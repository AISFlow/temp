33157625,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639483,1725402617,"Bitcoin, XRP See Declining Whale Activity: What It Means","On-chain data shows Bitcoin, XRP, and other top cryptocurrencies have been witnessing notably lesser activity from the whales recently as compared to earlier in the year. Bitcoin, XRP Among Assets Observing A Decline In Whale Transactions In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about how the latest trend in the Whale Transaction Count has been looking like for the various top coins in the sector. Related Reading: ‘Paper’ Bitcoin On The Decline: What It Means For BTC The “Whale Transaction Count” here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the total number of transfers occurring on a given cryptocurrency network that are valued at $100,000 or more. Transactions of this scale are generally considered to have been made by the whales, so the Whale Transaction Count represents the amount of activity that these humongous entities are participating in. When the value of the indicator is high, it means the whales are making a large number of moves right now. Such a trend implies that large players have an active interest in trading the asset. On the other hand, the metric being low implies the whales may not be paying much attention to the cryptocurrency as they aren’t making too many moves on the blockchain. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for five top coins, Bitcoin (BTC), XRP (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Toncoin (TON), over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Whale Transaction Count had been at pretty high levels for Bitcoin and Ethereum back in March. More specifically, between the 13th and the 19th of the month, BTC and ETH had both seen around 115,000 whale transfers. This high activity from the whales had come right after Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH) price, suggesting that these large holders may have possibly been making the moves to cash in on the rally. In the months since then, the metric has registered a rather notable drop. Bitcoin has seen 60,000 whale transactions recently, while Ethereum’s drawdown has been even more significant as the indicator has stood at just 32,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $68,000 In September: Could This Be The Turning Point? The likes of XRP and Cardano hadn’t seen anywhere near as high whale activity in March as these top two coins, but the levels back then were still noticeably higher than today, suggesting whales across the sector have paused their trading activities. As for what this could mean for the various assets, a lack of whale activity can lead to a more stale market, as it’s the large volume from these entities that fuel volatility. Thus, Bitcoin and other coins may see their consolidation continue, as long as the whales remain still. BTC Price Bitcoin had plunged towards the $57,000 level yesterday, but the coin has seen a bounce today as it’s back around $59,000.

33156877,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24094,1725399542,What is Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL)?,"The Polygon ecosystem is on the cusp of a significant transformation with a proposal to transition its native token from MATIC to POL. This proposed change aims to enhance the utility and functionality within the network. POL, poised to become the upgraded native token of the Polygon ecosystem, is designed to facilitate a broad spectrum of activities central to network operations, including participation and bolstering network security. As an integral part of the ecosystem, POL will allow stakeholders to actively engage as validators through staking, thereby contributing to the overall health and security of the network. Get Started The POL token, mirroring many of MATIC’s characteristics, will be based on OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 implementations and will support EIP-2612 for signature-based permit approvals. This transition is planned to be seamless, ensuring compatibility and continuity for node operators, delegators, and application developers within the Polygon ecosystem. The initial supply of POL tokens is set to be 10 billion, maintaining a 1:1 ratio with the existing supply of MATIC, symbolising a direct upgrade rather than the introduction of an entirely new token. Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) Blockchain records show that the “Polygon Ecosystem Token,” commonly referred to as POL, was established on October 25, 2023 at 9:06 am UTC. The Polygon team’s recent announcement highlighted POL’s role in energising an extensive network of Layer 2 chains based on zero-knowledge technology. A notable feature of POL is its “re-staking protocol,” which offers token holders the flexibility to stake across multiple chains, enabling diverse functionalities. The introduction of POL marks a significant step in the progression of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap. This includes the development of a new staking layer within the Polygon ecosystem, transitioning the existing PoS network to a zkEVM Layer-2 structure, and establishing a unified liquidity protocol that spans all Polygon networks, as per the team’s statement. It is important to note, as the team clarified, that POL is not yet in operational use within the Polygon network, but it is set to migrate on September 4th, 2024. The current staking processes on Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM are still conducted with the original token, MATIC, which is also still being used to pay gas fees on the PoS network. Once the migration takes place on September 4th, users and exchanges will need to switch their MATIC to POL tokens. Polygon Labs initially unveiled plans for developing this new Layer-2 ecosystem, termed “Polygon 2.0,” on June 29, 2023. Subsequently, on September 14th, 2023 the introduction of a new token, POL, for Polygon 2.0 was announced. However, at that time, POL was merely a proposed idea and had not yet been launched on the Ethereum network. Trade POL Now How will Polygon Work after the Polygon Ecosystem Token Upgrade? The Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) is set to bring several significant enhancements to the Polygon network, aligning with a series of well-defined design goals. First and foremost, POL aims to bolster ecosystem security. It’s designed to create a large, decentralised pool of validators to run and secure any Polygon chain, rewarding validators for their contributions and penalising any malicious activities. Secondly, POL is integral to achieving infinite scalability within the Polygon ecosystem. It supports the expansion of the validator pool, enabling the network to potentially manage thousands of Polygon chains, a crucial step towards what is termed as “hyperblockchainization.” In terms of ecosystem support, POL is expected to play a vital role in establishing a self-sustaining economic model for Polygon’s ongoing development and growth. This aspect is particularly important as Polygon positions itself as a global network, requiring continuous innovation and expansion. POL is also designed to minimise friction commonly associated with blockchain networks, where users and developers often need to hold, stake, or consume native tokens. This approach aims to enhance the overall user and developer experience. Lastly, POL is envisioned to facilitate community ownership, with governance rights assigned to POL holders, enabling them to participate actively in decision-making processes that shape the Polygon ecosystem. From a utility perspective, POL serves multiple functions. Validators will be required to stake POL to join the validator pool, increasing the ecosystem’s security through mechanisms like preventing Sybil attacks and enabling slashing for malicious validators. To incentivize validators, POL will be distributed as protocol rewards, proportional to the amount staked. Additionally, POL will be a key component in governance, allowing holders to participate in the governance frameworks of Polygon. The initial supply of POL is set to match that of MATIC at 10 billion tokens, ensuring a straightforward migration process. This migration is crucial for POL to succeed MATIC as Polygon’s native token, with the transition not starting until Q1 2024, after the community-supported upgrade in Q4 2023. Regarding supply and emission, POL features a predefined emission rate, serving two primary purposes: validator rewards and ecosystem support. The proposed yearly emission rate of 1% of the POL supply for each purpose ensures a balance between providing adequate support to the ecosystem and maintaining token scarcity, a vital aspect for network security and market attractiveness. This emission policy, predictable and potentially modifiable by community governance, aims to nurture a stable and attractive economic environment conducive to the growth and adoption of the Polygon ecosystem. After the POL Upgrade Why Will Polygon Be Unique? The POL upgrade will make Polygon a unique and advanced blockchain platform, offering a combination of high scalability, enhanced security, innovative economic models, and a frictionless experience, all governed by a community-driven approach. These attributes are set to position Polygon at the forefront of blockchain technology, especially for large-scale and diverse applications. The POL upgrade focuses on enhancing ecosystem security through a broader, more decentralised validator pool. This will fortify the network against attacks and align validators’ interests with the ecosystem’s success, ensuring a more robust and secure platform. With POL, Polygon aims to achieve unprecedented scalability, supporting the growth of the network to potentially thousands of chains. This level of scalability, dubbed “hyperblockchainisation,” positions Polygon as a leading solution for large-scale blockchain applications and mass adoption. The introduction of a re-staking protocol with POL allows stakeholders to stake across multiple chains within the ecosystem. This multi-chain staking capability not only enhances security but also optimises resource utilisation, making Polygon highly efficient. What will the Polygon Ecosystem be Like After the POL Upgrade? POL will enhance Polygon ecosystem security through a highly decentralised pool of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators, who are incentivized to secure a multitude of chains within the Polygon network. This design aims to achieve infinite scalability, supporting the exponential growth of the Polygon ecosystem and paving the way for mainstream adoption. POL also supports the ecosystem by establishing a sustainable, in-protocol mechanism for ongoing development and growth activities, governed by the Polygon community. This community-driven approach ensures that the ecosystem evolves with decentralisation at its core. The multifaceted utility of POL revolves around its role in validator incentivisation. Validators are required to stake POL to join the validator set, contributing to the network’s security through mechanisms such as Sybil attack prevention, alignment with ecosystem success, and slashing for misconduct. In return, validators can earn rewards through protocol emissions, transaction fees, and additional incentives offered by individual Polygon chains. This broad definition of validation roles, including tasks like zero-knowledge proof generation and participation in Data Availability Committees, enhances the value proposition of being a validator in the Polygon ecosystem. To future-proof the ecosystem and support its growth until Web3 reaches mass adoption, a continuous emission of POL is proposed to fund a Community Treasury. This fund will be vital for protocol development, research, ecosystem grants, and adoption incentives, with governance vested in the Polygon community. The transition from MATIC to POL is planned as a seamless upgrade, requiring token holders to exchange MATIC for POL through a straightforward technical process, with ample time provided for the migration. What is the POL Token? The POL token is a proposed technical upgrade to the native asset of the Polygon network, intended to enhance and expand the network’s infrastructure and functionality. This new token is part of a broader initiative to transform Polygon into the “Value Layer of the Internet,” a vision that encompasses a more robust and scalable ecosystem. POL is designed as a ‘hyperproductive’ token, an evolution beyond traditional productive tokens like Ethereum’s ETH. It allows its holders to engage in the network not just as validators but also in multiple roles across various chains within the Polygon ecosystem. Some of the key characteristics of the POL token include: Validator Participation: POL enables holders to participate as validators in the network. This involves staking POL tokens, which contributes to the security and integrity of the Polygon ecosystem. The staking mechanism is essential for preventing Sybil attacks, aligning validators with the ecosystem’s success, and enabling punitive measures against malicious activities. Multi-Chain Validation and Rewards: A distinctive feature of POL is the ability for validators to validate multiple chains within the Polygon network. This multi-chain validation capability vastly increases the scalability of the ecosystem and offers validators the opportunity to earn rewards from various sources, including protocol rewards, transaction fees, and additional incentives provided by individual chains. Community Governance and Ecosystem Support: As a hyperproductive token, POL is also geared towards enabling community governance. Holders of POL will have governance rights, allowing them to participate in decision-making processes that shape the future of the Polygon ecosystem. Moreover, POL aims to establish a self-sustaining funding mechanism for ongoing development, research, and ecosystem growth. Seamless User Experience: Designed to minimise friction for both users and developers, POL is structured to facilitate easy interaction with the Polygon network, enhancing the overall experience and accessibility. Emission Policy for Ecosystem Funding: POL will have a predetermined emission rate to support validator rewards and a Community Treasury. This Treasury, governed by the Polygon community, is intended to fund various activities crucial for the ecosystem’s advancement, including protocol development and adoption incentives. Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) Tokenomics Upgrade and Replacement of MATIC: POL is not a completely new token; rather, it is an upgraded and renamed version of the existing MATIC token. In the Polygon ecosystem, MATIC and POL are not intended to coexist. Instead, POL will replace MATIC as the native token. This transition marks a significant shift in the token’s utility and role within the network, aligning with the broader goals of Polygon’s strategic evolution. Introduction of the Community Treasury: The Community Treasury is a new mechanism being introduced alongside POL. Its purpose is not to supplement the Polygon Foundation’s funds but to provide a self-sustaining support system for the Polygon ecosystem. The Community Treasury is envisioned as an independent entity that will bolster Polygon’s position in the competitive blockchain infrastructure market. This Treasury will be key in responding to the emergence of new infrastructure protocols with substantial token reserves. Additionally, it aims to enhance transparency, decentralisation, and community involvement in the Polygon ecosystem, ensuring that the network remains competitive and adaptive. Use of POL for Gas Fees: The use of POL for gas fees will depend on the individual choices of each chain within the Polygon ecosystem. While some chains might opt to use POL for gas fees, this is not a fixed or universal application for the token. Specifically, for the Polygon Proof of Stake (PoS) chain, the transition to POL implies that it could become one of the chains using POL for gas fees.

42390473,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1zmV,1725397706,Polygon to Start Much-Awaited Swap of POL Token for Longstanding MATIC,"Polygon, a layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain, will activate an upgrade on Wednesday that swaps out its longstanding MATIC token for a new POL token, allowing for more flexibility on issuance of new supply.  While the planned switchover has been well-telegraphed, the changeover could be closely monitored, since the token is widely held across crypto investor portfolios; it's the 13th biggest by market capitalization in the CoinDesk 20 index of large digital assets, at about $3.8 billion. For many users, the swap will take place automatically.  The migration comes as a part of the project's planned revamp laid out last year in its “Polygon 2.0” roadmap, to make POL the native token of its main chain, the Polygon PoS chain, as well as eventually other chains in its ecosystem.  According to Polygon, in the initial phase of the migration, “POL replaces MATIC as the native gas and staking token for the Polygon PoS network. In subsequent phases, POL will serve a crucial role in the AggLayer.” The AggLayer is another staple in the roadmap, essentially a system for aggregating affiliated blockchains built using Polygon technology.  Furthermore, the Polygon community has proposed that “POL will support broader roles in the Polygon staking hub (to be released in 2025), including block generation, zero-knowledge proof generation and participation in Data Availability Committees (DACs).”  POL migration  The migration from POL to MATIC will also bring in some tokenomics changes. Polygon shared that the token will have a new emission rate of 2% annually, where part of the supply goes to validators on Polygon PoS for rewards, and the other part to the community treasury, “a self-sustainable ecosystem fund that can support the above activities.”  “The biggest reason why the upgrade was needed from a technical perspective, is that the MATIC upgrade keys were burned very intentionally years ago. Which basically means that we can't make changes to that token,” said Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, in an interview with CoinDesk. “So one of the things that we wanted was to introduce emissions that way. We could use it for the community, we could use it for growth. It was literally impossible to do that otherwise.”  Boiron reiterated that introducing emissions is supposed to help the Polygon community ecosystem by introducing a grants program as part of the community treasury, allowing them “some form of control by the community over the funds so that you can grow the ecosystem.”  “And then the second one is a means for, effectively, validators to receive emissions,” Boiron added. “Effectively, if you think of these new chains that pop up, what's going to happen is that with time, they're going to want to decentralize. And so instead of just having a centralized sequencer, they're going to need to incentivize people to actually run a decentralized group or a decentralized prover. And if they don't have a token, or if they don't want to launch a token yet, how do they do that? Well, effectively, what this does is that a portion of that POL emissions can actually be used to decentralize their network, and then POL holders will then receive fees from that network.”  Read more: Polygon Sets September Date for Migration to POL Token from MATIC",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | REGULATION,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/03/polygon-to-start-much-awaited-swap-of-pol-token-for-longstanding-matic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1182ca87e4ae835d5c08a5c03c54eaebe63af97f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33155364,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639516,1725397213,Solana Pullback To $137: Will Bulls Break Through Or Bears Dominate?,"Solana (SOL) has recently pulled back to the $137 level, a key point that could dictate its next move in the market. As the cryptocurrency tests this resistance, market participants are watching closely to see if the bears will seize the opportunity to drive prices lower, or if the bulls will capitalize on this pullback to ignite a breakout. This article aims to analyze Solana’s recent pullback to the $137 level and assess whether the bears can regain momentum to push the price lower or if the bulls will leverage this moment to drive a breakout. By examining key technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential scenarios, we aim to provide traders and investors with a comprehensive outlook on SOL’s next potential moves and what to watch for in this crucial phase. Currently, Solana is trading at approximately $135, reflecting a 4.66% increase. The cryptocurrency boasts a market capitalization of over $63 billion, with a trading volume surpassing $2 billion. Over the past 24 hours, Solana’s market cap has grown by 4.70%, while its trading volume has dipped by 6.89%. Market Overview: SOL’s Recent Movement To $137 On the 4-hour chart, Solana has gained significant bullish momentum, advancing toward the $135 mark and forming multiple positive candlesticks just below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This upward movement suggests increasing buying interest. However, the proximity to the 100-day SMA indicates that the bulls will need to maintain their momentum to overcome this resistance and push higher. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed to 48% after rebounding from the oversold zone and is now attempting to move above the 50% mark. This upward shift in the RSI indicates strengthening buying pressure, which could support further positive movement if it continues. On the daily chart, Solana is showing signs of a bullish attempt toward the $137 level, remaining below the 100-day SMA. A bullish momentum candlestick was formed in the previous trading session, suggesting potential upward movement despite its current position below the key moving average. Finally, the 1-day RSI suggests that Solana might extend its current pullback. The signal line, which had previously dropped to 34%, is now showing signs of recovery and is currently sitting at 40%. Thus this upward movement could indicate a potential shift in momentum, suggesting that SOL might regain optimistic strength as it progresses. Crucial Levels To Watch: Resistance And Support Zones For Solana Monitoring key support and resistance levels will be critical as Solana navigates its current price action. The immediate resistance is at the $137 level, which could challenge the ongoing bullish momentum. Should Solana surpass this resistance, it may target higher levels, potentially testing new highs. On the downside, the crucial support level to monitor is approximately $118. If SOL cannot break through the $137 resistance, it may face additional declines, potentially dropping toward $118 and reaching even lower support zones.

42390482,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd216Z,1725396723,Inside the Trump Crypto Project Linked to a $2M DeFi Hack and Former Pick-Up Artist,"Donald Trump and his sons have for weeks teased an upcoming cryptocurrency project, but they've been light on details in public.  Privately, though, the former U.S. president's inner circle has been quietly shopping around a white paper for World Liberty Financial – and CoinDesk has obtained excerpts.  The document and other reporting describe a borrowing and lending service strikingly similar to Dough Finance, a recently hacked blockchain app built by four people listed as World Liberty Financial team members. Other participants include all three of Trump's sons (including 18-year-old Barron, who is identified as the project's ""DeFi visionary""), financiers and e-commerce influencers.  Latest News: In Trump-Backed Crypto Project, Insiders Are Poised for Unusually Big Paydays  According to a person familiar with the plans, the project will also include a new cryptocurrency: WLFI, a non-transferable governance token. A transfer restriction could make the asset difficult for speculators to trade.  World Liberty Financial ""highlights the power of blockchain in an accessible way,"" according to the white paper. Though the app isn't ready for prime time, a review of a since-deleted codebase on GitHub shows that the project – at least in its early stages – appears to have lifted code directly from Dough Finance, which lost $2 million in July's hack. It has not been confirmed whether later iterations of the app contain such earlier code, and there is no indication that any vulnerabilities in the Dough Finance code appear in the new project's code.  Zachary Folkman and Chase Herro – listed in the white paper as World Liberty Financial's head of operations and its data and strategies lead, respectively – built Dough Finance, a person familiar with the matter said. (Herro used to link to Dough Finance's Telegram group in his bio on the messaging app, according to a screenshot reviewed by CoinDesk.) Octavian Lojnita, the project's smart contracts lead, also previously worked on Dough Finance, according to his online resume. Boga, World Liberty Financial's pseudonymous front-end developer, is listed as an author (under 0xboga) in Dough Finance's source code.  A limited liability corporation for World Liberty Financial is registered to Folkman, who, along with Herro, is the co-creator of Subify, which bills itself as a censorship-free competitor to both Patreon and OnlyFans – both services that let customers pay content creators, with the latter skewing toward explicit content. Folkman previously registered a company called Date Hotter Girls LLC and posted seminars on YouTube on how to pick up women.  Herro, Folkman, World Liberty Financial and the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.  Details about Trump's foray into decentralized finance have been scarce up until now. Members of the Trump family teased that it was coming on social media, but they revealed little beyond the project's name. When it was first announced last month, it was called The DeFiant Ones.  According to the white paper for the rebranded World Liberty Financial, the project will include a ""credit account system"" – built on decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Aave and the Ethereum blockchain – to facilitate decentralized borrowing and lending.  Governance tokens like WLFI generally allow their owners to participate in the management of the crypto project. In this case, the platform's users ""can suggest and vote on adding new DeFi lending markets or integrating new blockchains,"" according to the white paper.  The white paper also says the product will feature an ""easy-to-use interface for accessing WLFI as a 'smart account' or a brokerage.""  Previous efforts to create crypto brokerage services have seen mixed results. Companies like Voyager Digital, which offered brokerage services, fell into bankruptcy in 2022, costing customers significant chunks of money. More traditional financial firms have also made moves toward offering brokerage services to crypto clients, though they've so far refrained from getting deep into DeFi specifically.  Read more: Behind Voyager's Fall: Crypto Broker Acted Like a Bank, Went Bankrupt  The team behind World Liberty Financial  The project's figurehead is Donald J. Trump, who has taken the title of ""Chief Crypto Advocate."" His sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. – who seem to be the driving force behind the project – are also involved as ""Web3 Ambassadors.""  The project's leadership team also includes people who aren't in Trump's family. In addition to Folkman, Herro, Lojnita and Boga, the project's leadership includes long-time Trump friend and well-known property developer Steve Witkoff (""Institutional Investment"") and his son Zach Witkoff (""Intelligence"") and Alex Golubitsky (""Legal Counsel"").  Golubitsky and his legal partner, Gabriel Shapiro, run the crypto governance advisory MetaleX Pro. The firm has disclosed it is receiving 1.3% of World Financial Liberty's upcoming token $WLFI.  Folkman and Herro, who also goes by ""Chase Hero,"" are longtime friends and business partners. In addition to their work with Subify, Herro and Folkman have operated so-called ""mastermind groups"" – essentially, private networking clubs with a steep price of entry – and sold online e-commerce courses.  Herro has appeared as a guest on popular podcasts including YouTuber Logan Paul's podcast ""Impaulsive,"" where he has discussed his past stints in prison for drug-related charges, and how he got rich as a ""self-made businessman."" Paul is currently being sued in a class action lawsuit accusing him of orchestrating a rug-pull with his failed CryptoZoo project.  Court records show Herro owns a 34-foot boat called ""Clickbait.""  According to data from Open Corporates, Folkman, under the alias Zack Bauer, formerly operated the pick-up artist advice platform ""Date Hotter Girls"" with another individual, Rob Judge. During his work with Date Hotter Girls, Folkman taught ""masterclasses,"" including one on how to ""Become the Ultimate Alpha Male.""  Beginning in 2015, Herro and Folkman started ""The Watchers,"" a Facebook page and YouTube channel with 2,280 subscribers dedicated to providing information about cryptocurrency and advice about entrepreneurship. The last video was uploaded four years ago. Herro formerly operated a crypto trading firm called ""Pacer Capital,"" which appears to no longer exist.  Courting crypto voters  The initiative is part of a significant shift for Trump, who during his presidency expressed skepticism toward digital assets and derided Bitcoin {{BTC}} as ""based on thin air."" Now, with a campaign promise to make the United States the ""crypto capital of the planet,"" the former president is aiming to solidify his appeal with an industry that has accounted for more than half of all corporate campaign spending in this election cycle.  It comes after the former president sold multiple waves of Trump-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs), some of which gave purchasers raffle tickets to attend a dinner with him or similar rewards. He just released the fourth batch.  Read more: Trump's Pro-Crypto Bluster at NFT Gala Lacked Policy Substance  Cryptocurrency companies have dumped $119 million into the 2024 election cycle, outspent only by the fossil fuel industry. Two of the top-10 corporate spenders in this election are Coinbase and Ripple, with Coinbase securing the No. 1 spot.  The crypto industry has also made itself felt through targeted funding spent by Fairshake, a super political action committee, and its affiliated PACs, claiming 26 wins in the 2024 primaries.  Trump and other Republicans have sought to argue that they will nurture the crypto industry, replacing unpopular regulators and allowing entrepreneurs to launch products without fear of lawsuits or subpoenas from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Democrats have been more split on the issue, with some prominent lawmakers like Sen. Chuck Schumer promising legislation to clarify the rules of the road but others remain hostile to digital assets. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has not said anything publicly about crypto or how she views the issue.

Later, it converted the proceeds to ETH using predominantly Li.fi and forwarded to asset to a new address, according to Etherscan data.

Pendle confirmed that it identified a security compromise on Penpie's protocol and will maintain close communication with the team. Pendle added that investors' funds are safe on Pendle, but temporarily paused all contracts as a precautionary measure.

33153152,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639508,1725391833,"Analysts Predict Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $40,000, But There’s Good News","Despite initial expectations of a steady price increase and a robust bull run this year, Bitcoin (BTC) has suffered severe declines, pushing its price below the $60,000 threshold. Due to the cryptocurrency’s prolonged bearish performance, a crypto analyst has warned that Bitcoin could decline even further, predicting a potential crash below $40,000. However, the analyst also provides a silver lining to his bearish outlook, anticipating a major rebound after the decline. Bitcoin May Be Headed For A $40,000 Crash A crypto analyst known as ‘Magog PhD’ took to X (formerly Twitter) on September 1 to share a unique encounter he had with a supposed Bitcoin billionaire. The analyst recounted an unusual experience from his summer job as a waiter in a New York restaurant, where a Bitcoin billionaire slid a piece of paper across the table in the form of a tip. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Plunged To $0.55 Upon examination the paper revealed a chart forecasting Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. The chart illustrated that Bitcoin’s price was expected to crash below $32,000, marking a massive decline to new lows. Over the past few months the price of Bitcoin has experienced strong volatility and widespread liquidations which have led to severe price decline. At one stage, the cryptocurrency tumbled by over 20%, plunging below $50,000 before rebounding to nearly $60,000. The demand for Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have also seen a sharp decline, likely playing a role in Bitcoin’s recent downward trend. Although the Bitcoin price chart projects that the cryptocurrency will crash below $32,000, it also illustrated that Bitcoin would potentially witness a major breakout above $76,000 following the decline. Similar bullish sentiment has been shared by fellow crypto analysts in the market. According to technical analyst and Bitcoin trader, ‘Titan of Crypto,’ Bitcoin is currently forming a unique technical pattern called the “Cup and Handle pattern.” Often recognized as a bullish continuation signal, the Cup and Handle is a technical chart pattern that highlights a period of consolidation after an uptrend, followed by a slight pull back and an eventual breakout to the upside. Based on this technical pattern, the analyst believes that Bitcoin is likely to break out soon, reaching a potential price target of $110,000. He disclosed that this bullish price movement could happen in the final quarter of the year, highlighting that the cryptocurrency’s rebound is “going to be epic.” BTC Achieves Historic Weekly Golden Cross Bitcoin may have reached a historic milestone, as crypto analyst Jelle has identified the formation of a weekly Golden Cross on the Bitcoin price chart for the first time ever. Related Reading: Crypto Market In Trouble As Analyst Predicts $1 Trillion Crash The golden cross occurs when a short-term Moving Average (MA) crosses above a long-term MA. This week, Bitcoin’s 100-week MA surpassed the 200-week MA, highlighting a strong bullish signal that could potentially trigger a massive bull run for the cryptocurrency.

42390471,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd20C9,1725389533,How Decentralized AI and Zero-Knowledge Proofs Will Democratize Compute,"In late July, Mark Zuckerberg penned a letter explaining why “open source is necessary for a positive AI future,” where he waxes poetic about the need for open-source AI development. The once-nerdy teen founder, now turned into the wakeboarding, gold chain-wearing, and jiu-jitsu fighting “Zuck,” has been branded as the messiah of open-source model development.  But thus-far, he and the Meta team haven’t articulated much about how these models are being deployed. As model complexity drives compute requirements higher, if model deployment is controlled by a handful of actors, then have we not succumbed to a similar form of centralization? Decentralized AI promises to solve this challenge, but the technology requires advancements in industry-leading cryptographic techniques and unique hybrid solutions.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  Unlike centralized cloud providers, decentralized AI (DAI) distributes the computational processes for AI inference and training across multiple systems, networks, and locations. If implemented correctly, these networks, a type of decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN), bring benefits in censorship resistance, compute access, and cost.  DAI faces challenges in two main areas: the AI environment and the decentralized infrastructure itself. Compared to centralized systems, DAI requires additional safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to model details or the theft and replication of proprietary information. For this reason, there is an under-explored opportunity for teams who focus on open-source models, but recognize the potential performance disadvantage of open-sourced models compared to their closed-source counterparts.  Decentralized systems specifically face obstacles in network integrity and resource overhead. The distribution of client data across separate nodes, for instance, exposes more attack vectors. Attackers could spin up a node and analyze its computations, try to intercept data transmissions between nodes, or even introduce biases that degrade the system’s performance. Even in a secure decentralized inference model, there must be mechanisms to audit compute processes. Nodes are incentivized to save cost on resources by presenting incomplete computations, and verification is complicated by the lack of a trusted, centralized actor.  Zero-Knowledge Proofs  Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), while currently too computationally expensive, are one potential solution to some DAI challenges. ZKP is a cryptographic mechanism that enables one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) of the truth of a statement without divulging any details about the statement itself, except its validity. Verification of this proof is quick for other nodes to run and offers a way for each node to prove it acted in accordance with the protocol. The technical differences between proof systems and their implementations (deep-dive on this coming later) are important for investors in the space.  Centralized compute makes model training exclusive to a handful of well-positioned and resourced players. ZKPs could be one part of unlocking idle compute on consumer hardware; a MacBook, for example, could use its extra compute bandwidth to help train a large-language model while earning tokens for the user.  Deploying decentralized training or inference with consumer hardware is the focus of teams like Gensyn and Inference Labs; unlike a decentralized compute network like Akash or Render, sharding the computations adds complexity, namely the floating point problem. Making use of idle distributed compute resources opens the door for smaller developers to test and train their own networks — as long as they have access to tools that solve associated challenges.  At present, ZKP systems are seemingly four to six orders of magnitude more expensive than running the compute natively, and for tasks that require high-compute (like model training) or low latency (like model inference) using a ZKP is prohibitively slow. For comparison, a drop of six orders of magnitude means that a cutting edge system (like a16z’s Jolt) running on an M3 Max chip can prove a program 150 times slower than running it on a TI-84 graphing calculator.  AI's ability to process large amounts of data makes it compatible with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but more progress in cryptography is needed before ZKPs can be widely used. Work being done by teams such as Irreducible (who designed the Binius proof system and commitment scheme), Gensyn, TensorOpera, Hellas, and Inference Labs, among others, will be an important step in achieving this vision. Timelines, however, remain overly optimistic as true innovation takes time and mathematical advancement.  In the meantime, it’s worth noting other possibilities and hybrid solutions. HellasAI and others are developing new methods of representing models and computations that can enable an optimistic challenge game, allowing for only a subset of computation that needs to be handled in zero-knowledge. Optimistic proofs only work when there is staking, the ability to prove wrongdoing, and a credible threat that the computation is being checked by other nodes in the system. Another method, developed by Inference Labs, validates a subset of queries where a node commits to generate a ZKP with a bond, but only presents the proof if first challenged by the client.  In Sum  Decentralized AI training and inference will serve as a safeguard against the consolidation of power by a few major actors while unlocking previously inaccessible compute. ZKPs will be an integral part of enabling this vision. Your computer will be able to earn you real money imperceptibly by utilizing extra processing power in the background. Succinct proofs that a computation was carried out correctly will make the trust that the largest cloud providers leverage unnecessary, enabling compute networks with smaller providers to attract enterprise clientele.  While zero-knowledge proofs will enable this future and be an essential part of more than just compute networks (like Ethereum’s vision for single slot finality), their computational overhead remains an obstacle. Hybrid solutions that combine game theory mechanics of optimistic games with selective use of zero-knowledge proofs are a better solution, and will likely become ubiquitous as a bridging point until ZKPs become much faster.  For native and non-native crypto investors, understanding the value and challenges of decentralized AI systems will be crucial to effectively deploying capital. Teams should have answers to questions regarding node computation proofs and network redundancies. Furthermore, as we’ve observed in many DePIN projects, decentralization occurs over time, and teams’ clear plan toward that vision is essential. Solving the challenges associated with DePIN compute is essential for handing control back to individuals and small developers — a vital part of keeping our systems open, free and censorship-resistant.

Solana (SOL) has experienced a sharp 15.8% drop, leading to a flurry of reactions from investors and analysts alike. While Solana (SOL)’s decline has certainly captured attention, another player is moving aggressively in the background: Mpeppe (MPEPE). The meme-inspired casino token is making significant strides, with its Stage 3 presale nearing 93% completion, positioning itself as a strong contender in the meme coin market. Solana’s Sudden Decline: What’s Going On? Solana (SOL), known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, has been a favorite among developers and investors. However, the recent 15.8% drop in its value has caused alarm within its community. This decline, which occurred over a brief period, has led to speculation about the underlying causes and the potential impact on Solana (SOL)’s future. Several factors may have contributed to this sudden drop. The broader cryptocurrency market has been facing challenges, with many major tokens experiencing similar declines. Additionally, specific issues within the Solana (SOL) network, such as congestion problems and network outages in the past, may have also played a role in shaking investor confidence. The uncertainty surrounding regulatory actions in major markets like the United States could further exacerbate Solana (SOL)’s woes. Mpeppe’s Aggressive Moves Amid Market Turbulence While Solana (SOL) grapples with its recent challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is seizing the moment to make significant strides. The meme-inspired token, which blends elements of decentralized finance (DeFi) with a casino gaming experience, has been aggressively pushing forward with its presale. As of now, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Stage 3 presale is nearly 93% complete, indicating strong demand and growing interest in the token. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success in its presale stages is a testament to the growing appeal of meme coins that offer more than just speculative value. With its unique value proposition, combining entertainment with potential financial rewards, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting a diverse range of investors. The token’s community-driven approach, coupled with its innovative features, has set it apart from other meme coins in the market. The aggressive completion of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Stage 3 presale is also a signal that the token is gaining momentum, even as more established cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) face challenges. Investors who are looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities are increasingly turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE), seeing it as a potential breakout star in the meme coin arena. The Path Forward for Solana and Mpeppe For Solana (SOL), the path forward involves addressing the concerns that have arisen from its recent price drop. The community and developers will need to work together to resolve any technical issues and reinforce the platform’s strengths. If Solana (SOL) can navigate these challenges effectively, it may well recover and continue to be a leading blockchain platform in the cryptocurrency space. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to continue its aggressive growth. With the Stage 3 presale nearing completion, the token is on the brink of entering its next phase, where it could see even greater adoption and price appreciation. The combination of its meme coin appeal and practical use cases in the DeFi and gaming sectors gives Mpeppe (MPEPE) a unique edge in a crowded market. Conclusion The recent 15.8% drop in Solana (SOL)’s value has undoubtedly caused concern within its community, but it also highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. As Solana (SOL) works to regain its footing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is moving full steam ahead, capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the current market conditions.

Solana (SOL), known for its impressive technical capabilities and rapid transaction speeds, has been a darling of the crypto world. However, as Solana (SOL) faces increasing competition, a new contender, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is poised to make waves, capturing the attention of whales and investors alike with its potential for astronomical returns. Solana’s (SOL) Rise and Challenges Solana (SOL) has experienced a meteoric rise in the cryptocurrency world, largely due to its ability to process over 65,000 transactions per second. This level of efficiency sets it apart from many other blockchain projects, which often struggle with scalability issues. As a result, Solana (SOL) has become a favorite among developers and institutional investors, particularly within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Analysts have highlighted Solana (SOL)’s potential and the significant trends driving its growth. The platform’s low transaction fees and high throughput have made it a popular choice for decentralized applications (dApps), further boosting its appeal. However, as with any rapidly growing technology, Solana (SOL) is not without its risks. Market analysts warn that unexpected market movements or technical issues could threaten its continued ascent. Despite these challenges, Solana (SOL) remains a key player in the crypto ecosystem. Its ability to scale and maintain low fees is crucial for its adoption and long-term success. However, the rapid development in the crypto space means that even strong contenders like Solana (SOL) must constantly innovate to stay ahead of the competition. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Big Thing? As Solana (SOL) continues to navigate its path, a new project, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is gaining momentum.

The question on everyone’s mind is whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) can truly challenge Solana (SOL)’s dominance. Solana (SOL)’s strengths are clear: its speed, scalability, and growing ecosystem of dApps make it a formidable force. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid growth and the excitement surrounding its presale suggest that it could capture a significant share of the market, particularly among investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Whales, always on the lookout for the next big thing, are closely monitoring Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s progress. The potential for massive returns is driving interest in the token, and many believe that Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach could give it an edge over Solana (SOL) in certain sectors of the crypto market. Conclusion Solana (SOL) has undoubtedly made a significant impact on the crypto world, but the emergence of Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the fastest-growing presale project signals that the competition is heating up.

Recently, Internet Computer (ICP) has been the talk of the town, but not for the reasons its developers might have hoped. A 9.21% drop in Internet Computer (ICP)’s value has sent shockwaves through the market, leading investors to explore alternative options. One such option that has caught the eye of many is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino-themed cryptocurrency that has quickly become an internet sensation. The Fall of Internet Computer (ICP) Internet Computer (ICP), once touted as a revolutionary project aiming to decentralize the internet, has seen a significant decline in its market value. Over the past few weeks, Internet Computer (ICP) has struggled to maintain its footing, and the recent 9.21% drop has only added to the uncertainty surrounding the token. Investors who were once optimistic about Internet Computer (ICP)’s potential are now rethinking their strategies, looking for safer and potentially more profitable alternatives. The reasons behind Internet Computer (ICP)’s decline are multifaceted. Market analysts point to several factors, including the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, competition from other decentralized platforms, and concerns about the project’s long-term viability. Despite these challenges, Internet Computer (ICP) remains a significant player in the blockchain space, but its recent performance has left many investors on edge. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Crypto Market’s New Player As Internet Computer (ICP) struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a new player in the crypto market, capturing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino-themed cryptocurrency, has leveraged the recent downturn in Internet Computer (ICP)’s value to position itself as a viable alternative. The token’s unique blend of entertainment and financial utility has made it an instant hit, especially among those looking to diversify their portfolios in the wake of Internet Computer (ICP)’s decline. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rise to fame can be attributed to its innovative approach to combining decentralized finance (DeFi) with the excitement of online gambling. The token offers users the chance to participate in a variety of casino games, all while earning rewards in the form of Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens. This dual functionality has made Mpeppe (MPEPE) a popular choice for those looking to combine the thrill of gambling with the potential for financial gains. The Impact of ICP’s Decline on Mpeppe’s Popularity The recent drop in Internet Computer (ICP)’s value has undoubtedly contributed to Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s surge in popularity. As investors look for alternatives to Internet Computer (ICP), Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique value proposition has made it a standout option. The token’s presale has garnered significant attention, with many speculating that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see exponential growth in the coming months. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success is not just a result of Internet Computer (ICP)’s decline, however. The token’s development team has been hard at work building a strong community around the project, leveraging social media and online forums to generate buzz. This grassroots approach has paid off, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) quickly becoming a favorite among crypto enthusiasts and casual investors alike. Internet Computer’s (ICP) Future Outlook While Mpeppe (MPEPE) enjoys its moment in the spotlight, the future of Internet Computer (ICP) remains uncertain. Despite the recent setbacks, Internet Computer (ICP) still holds a strong position in the decentralized internet space. The project’s long-term vision of creating a truly decentralized web is still intact, and many believe that Internet Computer (ICP) could recover from its recent losses if it can address the issues that have led to its decline. For Internet Computer (ICP) to regain investor confidence, the development team will need to focus on delivering on its promises and addressing the concerns that have plagued the project. Whether this means improving the platform’s scalability, enhancing its security, or simply communicating more effectively with the community, it’s clear that Internet Computer (ICP) has some work to do if it wants to reclaim its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Conclusion As Internet Computer (ICP) grapples with a 9.21% drop in value, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has taken advantage of the situation, becoming an internet sensation almost overnight.

But Pepecoin (PEPE) is not just riding the meme wave—it’s looking to overtake Dogecoin (DOGE) and become the new king of meme coins. Pepecoin (PEPE)’s rise is reminiscent of Dogecoin (DOGE)’s early days, when a small but dedicated community helped propel the coin to unexpected heights. The recent price surge and growing interest in Pepecoin (PEPE) suggest that it could challenge Dogecoin (DOGE)’s dominance, especially if it continues to attract new investors and expand its community. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Dark Horse with Explosive Potential While Pepecoin (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) battle for supremacy, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining traction as a potential game-changer in the meme coin space. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has caught the attention of investors, with many speculating that the token could see a 100X return on launch. This optimism is fueled by Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach, combining the appeal of meme coins with advanced technology and strong community support. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it offers a unique blend of decentralized finance (DeFi) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, making it an attractive option for investors looking for both entertainment and utility. The presale’s success indicates strong investor confidence, and if the token can deliver on its promises, it could quickly become a major player in the cryptocurrency market. The Future of Meme Coins: Pepecoin (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) The competition between Pepecoin (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) reflects the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Each coin offers something unique, and each has the potential to reshape the landscape of meme coins. Dogecoin (DOGE) has the advantage of being a well-established and widely accepted cryptocurrency, with a track record of turning small investments into significant fortunes. Pepecoin (PEPE), on the other hand, is gaining momentum, leveraging its community-driven success to challenge Dogecoin (DOGE)’s market cap. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential 100X return on launch makes it a token to watch closely, as it could redefine what investors expect from meme coins. Conclusion: A New Era for Meme Coins? As Pepecoin (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to dominate the meme coin market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a strong contender with the potential to disrupt the status quo. Whether Pepecoin (PEPE) can challenge Dogecoin (DOGE)’s market cap remains to be seen, but the competition is heating up. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale success suggests that it could be the next big thing in the crypto world, offering investors the opportunity for significant returns.

33150864,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639672,1725386412,Biggest Crypto Casino ICO Receives $1.1M From Solana Holders Within Days,"The cryptocurrency market continues to surprise with rapid shifts and bold moves by investors. Recently, Solana (SOL) holders have turned their attention to a new and exciting opportunity, investing $1.1 million into Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme-inspired casino token, within just a few days of its initial coin offering (ICO). This influx of capital from Solana (SOL) enthusiasts underscores the growing appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and highlights the shifting dynamics within the crypto market. Solana’s Struggles and Mpeppe’s Rise Solana (SOL) has been a major player in the cryptocurrency world, known for its high transaction speeds and low fees. However, recent market conditions have posed challenges for Solana (SOL), with the token facing significant price fluctuations. Despite these hurdles, Solana (SOL) has continued to attract attention, particularly as analysts predict a potential recovery that could see the token reaching new highs. In the past week, Solana (SOL) has seen a mixed bag of market activity. While Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced outflows, Solana (SOL)-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) managed to draw in over $7.6 million. This suggests that investors still believe in Solana (SOL)’s long-term potential, even if the token is currently facing some headwinds. Mpeppe: The Bright Spot Amidst Solana (SOL)’s ongoing challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a bright spot in the market. The meme-inspired token, which is designed to function as a casino coin, has quickly captured the imagination of investors. With its playful branding and the promise of high returns, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has successfully attracted significant investments, particularly from Solana (SOL) holders. The $1.1 million investment from Solana (SOL) holders into Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ICO is a testament to the growing interest in this new token. Analysts suggest that Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies not only in its meme-based origin but also in its potential to deliver substantial returns. As the market for meme coins continues to evolve, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a strong contender, drawing in investors who are eager to capitalize on the next big trend. Solana’s Potential Rebound Despite the recent shift of some Solana (SOL) holders towards Mpeppe (MPEPE), the future of Solana (SOL) remains promising. According to analysts, Solana (SOL) has the potential to recover from its current challenges and reach new heights in the coming months. The token’s high transaction speed and low fees make it an attractive option for developers and institutional investors alike. One key factor that could drive Solana (SOL)’s recovery is the potential for a new bull run in the broader cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies begin to rally, Solana (SOL) could follow suit, potentially reclaiming its position as one of the top tokens in the market. Additionally, the development of new decentralized applications (dApps) on the Solana (SOL) platform could further boost the token’s value. The Future of Mpeppe As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain momentum, its future looks bright. The token’s successful ICO has positioned it as one of the most exciting new entries in the cryptocurrency market. With substantial investments pouring in, particularly from Solana (SOL) holders, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well on its way to establishing itself as a major player in the world of meme coins. The success of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ICO also suggests that investors are increasingly looking for new and innovative opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. As the market continues to evolve, tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which combine playful branding with real utility, are likely to attract even more attention. For those who got in early, the potential for significant returns is substantial. Conclusion The recent investment of $1.1 million by Solana (SOL) holders into Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a clear sign of the shifting dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. While Solana (SOL) continues to face challenges, the rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights the growing interest in meme-inspired tokens and the potential for high returns. As the market evolves, both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are well-positioned to be major players, each offering unique opportunities for investors. Whether through Solana (SOL)’s technical strengths or Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach, the future of cryptocurrency looks bright.

33150862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639534,1725386412,"Solana (SOL) Is ‘Truly In Limbo’ If This Happens, Warns Crypto Analyst","A recent statement made by Austin Federa, a strategist at the Solana Foundation, has sparked a widespread debate within the crypto community. On Monday, Federa proposed a novel conceptualization for several enhancements on the Solana blockchain via a post on X, suggesting that “most of the L2-ish things on Solana are better thought of as Network Extensions.” “While the underlying tech stack might resemble Bitcoin or Ethereum L2’s, the function and role is so radically different I think founders would best be served by Network Extensions. Network Extensions extend the Solana network to new places, or bring new execution environments, specialized processing, etc to the Solana network. State Compression, cNFTs, Neon’s EVM layer, maybe even Phoenix all fit this mental framing imo,” Federa wrote. Why This Could Put Solana ‘In Limbo’ Responding to this post, Ignas, a popular crypto analyst and co-founder of Pinky Brains, voiced his analysis and concerns to his 105,000 followers on X. Ignas highlights the critical nature of the ongoing debate about Solana’s developmental strategy. He raises a fundamental question about whether the crypto community will embrace the new “Network extension” terminology or continue to favor the Layer 2 framing. Related Reading: Solana’s Surge: Here’s Why This Analyst Is Predicting A Rise To $360 Ignas elaborates on the potential risks associated with Solana’s rebranding of its scalability solutions as Network Extensions. He cautions that if Solana’s transition leads to negative outcomes similar to those experienced by Ethereum—such as liquidity fragmentation and a degraded user experience due to the complexities of bridging between layers—then the future of SOL could be jeopardized, leaving it in a state of limbo. “ETH was stuck between BTC and SOL during this bull run. BTC was ‘better money’ for less conservative and institutional investors, and SOL as a faster, simpler, and cheaper smart contract platform with higher upside than ETH. If Solana narrative shifts from a monolithic model to scaling with L2s (like Ethereum), SOL could become the new ETH. [..] then SOL is truly in limbo,” Ignas warns. The impact on the Solana price could be significant. According to Ignas, Ethereum would remain the “safer option” for long-term investors because of its higher decentralization and no downtimes. “Plus, if degens start chasing ‘network extension’ tokens for SOL beta instead of buying SOL, it could stagnate SOL’s price growth,” the analyst added. Related Reading: Analysts Unanimous: Solana (SOL) To Soar 100% – Details Meanwhile, Ignas did not dismiss the potential advantages of Solana’s strategy entirely. He acknowledged that integrating Network Extensions from the outset, with aggregation layer solutions already in place—a step Ethereum had not taken during its initial Layer 2 rollouts—could mitigate some of the common challenges associated with Layer 2 solutions. This proactive integration could preserve a unified user experience and prevent the fragmentation of liquidity. “As a result, Solana could maintain the ‘monolithic narrative’ while benefiting from modular approach solutions. The ‘network extension’ narrative could then prevail,” Ignas concludes. However, if the Solana narrative shifts to L2s, there could be an empty void for a new monolithic champion. The crypto analyst concluded: ”Solana’s shift to a modular scaling approach creates an opportunity for a new monolithic scaling champion in the eyes of crypto community. Could this be the perfect moment for Monad to launch? Or will another Layer 1 blockchain seize the monolithic chain crown from Solana? Exciting!” At press time, SOL traded at $134.

33149770,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639654,1725383941,Crypto Firm Galois Capital Faces $200K Fine From US SEC For ‘Investor Violations’,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a settlement with troubled crypto hedge fund Galois Capital. The SEC charged Galois with failing to meet critical requirements for safeguarding customer assets, including those the agency stated were “securities”. Related Reading: Bullish Alert For Dogecoin: TD Indicator Flashes Buy Signal As $0.10 Target Looms FTX Costs Galois Capital Half Of Managed Assets According to the SEC’s announcement on Tuesday, Galois Capital’s missteps began in July 2022 when the firm allegedly did not ensure that certain crypto assets held by its private fund were maintained with a qualified custodian, violating the Investment Advisers Act’s Custody Rule. Instead, the agency claims that the crypto company kept these assets in online trading accounts on platforms like FTX Trading, which were not recognized as “qualified custodians.” The fallout from this decision was significant. Following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, approximately half of the assets under Galois’s management were lost. Settlement Reached The SEC also alleged on Tuesday’s announcement that Galois misled its investors about the notice required for redemptions. Some investors were told that they had to provide at least five business days’ notice before the end of the month. In contrast, others were allowed to redeem their investments with less notice, which the SEC said “created an uneven playing field among fund participants.” Corey Schuster, co-chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit, said: By failing to comply with Custody Rule provisions, Galois Capital exposed investors to risks that fund assets, including crypto assets, could be lost, misused, or misappropriated.

42390480,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd20rB,1725381777,Why ‘Universal Basic Compute’ Is a Solution to Economic Inequality,"Universal Basic Income (UBI) has frequently been discussed as a potential solution to economic inequality in an increasingly automated and AI-driven world. Alternatives like Universal Basic Services or Universal Basic Housing have also been proposed. But what if the answer doesn’t lie in providing financial support, but in granting universal access to the very resource driving this technological transformation?  Enter Universal Basic Compute (UBC), a concept coined by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  The idea is straightforward – in a post-Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) world, many traditional forms of labor may become obsolete. Rather than distributing money, UBC would provide every individual with a share of the advanced computational power that fuels emerging technologies like AI. As Altman explained in a recent interview, owners of compute could use it, resell it, or even donate it. Proponents argue that while UBI addresses some issues, it falls short in an AI-driven future. UBC, on the other hand, could empower people with wealth-building tools that enhance productivity and creativity, offering a more forward-thinking solution.  While the concept of UBC has sparked debate over its potential benefits and drawbacks, a crucial question remains: is such an initiative even feasible? Furthermore, with the race for graphic processing unit (GPU) supplies becoming increasingly competitive, and a small number of tech giants dominating access to computational resources, would the industry as a whole even permit it?  The Role of DePINs  For the concept of UBC to even become a reality, it would require a global compute infrastructure capable of seamlessly delivering computational power to billions. This is where decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) enter the picture. DePINs represent a revolutionary approach, linking distributed computing resources into a cohesive, global network of GPUs that can be utilized for machine learning and other high-performance computing tasks. By leveraging blockchain technology, these networks can harness idle computational power from across the world, creating a resilient and scalable infrastructure.  Instead of relying on centralized ownership of data centers as traditional GPU suppliers do, DePINs leverage a network of distributed compute nodes owned and operated by individuals worldwide. For example, in a decentralized gaming platform, developers could tap into this distributed network to render high-quality graphics and process complex game environments, ensuring faster load times and a more immersive experience for players – without depending on a single, centralized infrastructure provider.  This decentralized model not only democratizes access to computing and strengthens network resiliency, but it also paves the way for a future where computational resources are no longer scarce. By decentralizing the supply and access to computing power, it offers a viable alternative to traditional GPU monopolies. I previously noted that our very industry’s future depends on addressing the AI-GPU gap, which has led to an AI ecosystem primarily molded by a small group of Big Tech companies who own a majority of traditional computing power resources.  This DePIN-centric approach could not only spur innovation within the industry but also resolve the supply challenges so effectively that Universal Basic Compute becomes a realistic possibility.  Industry Resistance: A Barrier to UBC?  The concept of UBC is compelling, but significant challenges stand in its way. Today’s cloud computing landscape is dominated by a handful of powerful tech giants that benefit from the scarcity of and limited access to high-powered computation. One could argue that the prospect of universally accessible, low-cost computing power poses a direct threat to these entrenched business models. Therefore, these companies are unlikely to welcome a shift that undermines their control over such a critical resource.  Yet, the emergence of decentralized networks like DePINs could upend this status quo. Unlike traditional cloud providers, DePINs operate without centralized ownership, offering a more democratized approach to computing. For example, Aethir Edge, the hardware device connected to our DePIN stack, allows users to contribute their idle GPU power to a global decentralized network. This approach not only challenges the dominance of centralized cloud providers but also enables users worldwide to participate directly in the growing AI and gaming industries.  What makes this model so appealing is that DePINs do not require any form of permission to break out of the status quo. By decentralizing the distribution of computational power, DePINs challenge existing monopolies and redefine the very concept of scarcity in the digital age.  As Altman suggests, ""What you get is not dollars, but you own part of the productivity."" This reimagining of ownership and access has the potential to fundamentally reshape the industry, paving the way for a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. If successful, this model could transform not just the way we think about computation, but also who controls it and who benefits from it.  Towards a UBC-type future?  Will the industry allow anything like UBC to take root? It should certainly be considered.  The increasing integration of AI into our daily lives necessitates a fundamental shift in how computational resources are distributed. As AI-driven services become more ubiquitous, the demand for equitable access to the underlying computational power will inevitably grow. This surge in demand, coupled with the potential for decentralized networks like DePIN and potential regulatory interventions to solve the supply issues, will likely erode the barriers preventing the widespread adoption of UBC.  As controversial as Altman’s comments revolving around UBC may have been to leaders across the AI industry, the point of how increasingly necessary wider access to computational resources remains valid.  I still believe decentralized GPU infrastructure represents a pivotal step towards bridging the compute divide. What I also believe is that through DePIN, the sky's the limit for how much compute power can be made available to the world. The market for GPU computing is projected to quadruple in size by 2040, and as recent initiatives from leaders in the DePIN industry have shown, decentralized networks that leverage physical infrastructure are poised to play a critical role in meeting the growing demand for computational power.  I have no doubt that, at some point, our market will face a shift driven by increased compute supply. But will this shift result in a future that resembles Sam Altman’s concept of UBC? While the industry may resist this shift, the trajectory is clear. As decentralized networks gain momentum, the dream of Universal Basic Compute could soon become a reality, reshaping not only the tech industry but society as a whole.

On the thread, seven programs were featured each granted $50,000 to aid their development process. In total, over 31 programs have been given financial assistance. $1.3-$1.6 Chokes STX’s Upside Potential As of writing, STX is held tightly by the $1.3-$1.6 trading range, hampering the token’s upside potential shortly. This leaves the bulls in an interesting position which has the opportunity to break through the $1.7 price ceiling. STX’s relative strength index (RSI) suggests that the token will attempt to stabilize in its current trading range which gives the bulls a much-needed platform to jump out from. However, its relatively stable level reveals that the bears still have some strength, enough to cancel the bullish momentum that’s currently forming.

In the short term, the bears will have the upper hand unless the market makes another leap forward, creating enough momentum for STX to have a breakthrough. However, the meager gains the broader market experienced have little to no effect on STX’s future performance. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt still plagues market sentiment for the token. For now, investors and traders should exercise caution while monitoring the broader market’s movement before making a decision. STX’s significant correlation with BTC is both a boon and a curse for investors as any swing made by the latter will have a strong influence on the performance of the former.

42390469,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1zwl,1725379949,Why the SEC Is Wrong About NFTs,"In their 2024 book Over Ruled, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Janie Nitze document the dramatic expansion of federal laws. This expansion stems not just from enactments by Congress and decisions of courts, but also from the numerous federal agencies through their arsenal of rules and regulations, informal public guidance and enforcement actions. Federal statutes used to fit in one volume, but now surpass 54 volumes and 60,000 pages. Federal agency rules ran 16 pages in 1936, but now surpass 200 volumes and 188,000 pages. No one knows for sure how many agency regulations have criminal penalties, but one estimate is that the total surpasses 300,000. And, more worrisome, federal agencies sometimes “don’t just write and enforce legally binding rules,” but also “act as prosecutor and judge, too.”  This proliferation of laws and regulations may reflect the complexities of modern society. But, as the book details, it has led to tragic consequences with federal laws being over-enforced against individuals, even in ways beyond the law’s intended scope. Especially when laws are over-enforced based on tenuous if not incorrect interpretations, the rule of law is undermined. As Justice Gorsuch and Nitze show, the rule of law “requires that laws that are publicly declared, knowable to ordinary people, and stable.”  Unfortunately, that’s not the case with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s opaque treatment of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Instead, the regulator’s approach adds another sad chapter to the problem of over-enforcement of laws, which paradoxically undermines the rule of law.  In 2021, a new market for digital artworks blossomed. NFTs provided artists with an innovative new way to sell their art and collect resale royalties, which provide artists a modicum of financial sustainability. As artists flocked to the burgeoning NFT market, with sales volume hitting $27 billion, the SEC remained silent. Artists had no public guidance on whether the SEC would treat NFTs as securities. Top law firms were unsure.  Read more: Brian Frye - Art Is Not a Security  But, in 2023, when the NFT market was in a downturn, the SEC added another risk to the ones artists faced: possible SEC prosecution. The SEC announced the settlements of enforcement actions against two NFT projects, which were developing a cartoon cat series and avatar-based game, respectively. The SEC alleged the NFTs were investment contracts and unregistered securities. Although the settlements do not establish legal precedents and the entities admitted no wrongdoing, the SEC required the two projects to destroy their NFTs. Neither project survived. Other businesses, such as GameStop, killed their NFT projects due to “regulatory uncertainty.”  Then, in late-August, the SEC showed it’s not done. OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces, revealed the SEC sent a Wells notice indicating a potential action against the company for allowing the sales of NFTs that were allegedly unregistered securities. Although a Wells notice doesn’t necessarily end in prosecution, it often does.  NFT artists and businesses were upset. On social media, some even discussed going to jail. While that fear may be unfounded, the panic is not. The SEC’s strategy of bringing selective enforcement actions against NFT projects and businesses, without promulgating any rules or public guidance related to NFTs, threatens the entire NFT market. The uncertainty will chill artists from creating NFTs and kill business ventures involving NFTs.  Regulatory uncertainty isn’t the biggest problem with the SEC’s approach. Instead, as I explain in a forthcoming U.C. Davis Law Review article, the SEC’s approach is likely unconstitutional. Requiring securities registration of artwork NFTs before they can be offered to the public is a prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment rights of the artists. Prior restraints on speech, including pre-publication licensing and registration, “are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights,” as the Supreme Court admonished. Prior restraints may mask censorship and chill speech. Even the delay of publication is problematic under the First Amendment. Speech delayed is speech denied.  Artists shouldn’t have to hire securities lawyers — or risk prosecution by the SEC — before selling NFTs. Such a regime of prior restraint harms society. As the Supreme Court explained in the election context: “Many persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected speech — harming not only themselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.”  The solution to this constitutional problem is simple: the SEC and courts should return to the original public meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 — what the statute actually says; that’s what the Supreme Court recently did in interpreting the National Firearms Act of 1934. In 1933, the original public meaning of “investment contract” referred to a specific type of investment: investors’ payment of money for a contractual right to a share in the profits made by the offeror. When the Supreme Court interpreted “investment contract” in 1946, in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., it expressly endorsed this ordinary meaning of the term a state supreme court had identified in 1920. Every Supreme Court decision finding an investment contract, including Howey, involved such a contractual right, or “the promise of profits.”  Of course, an investment doesn’t have to be titled as an “investment contract” to be one. Because the Securities Act applies to mere offerings, it’s not essential that a contract existed. But, to fall within “investment contract,” the offering must involve a contractual right to a share in the profits made by the offeror. Without it, the offering involves an investment, but not a contractual one.  It is not for the SEC or courts to read the word “contract” out of the Securities Act. It serves an important purpose in distinguishing investment contracts from other investments, such as the purchase of artworks and collectibles. Investors permitted by Hermès to buy Birkin bags can reasonably expect to make a profit from Hermès’s assiduous efforts to maintain their rarity and value. But investors’ expectation of profits doesn’t turn Birkin bags into investment contracts. Nor does it with NFTs. Buying collectibles, whether Birkin bags or artwork NFTs, is different in kind from investing in investment contracts: the former lacks the contractual right to profits that the latter has.  If the word “contract” in the Securities Act continues to be ignored, it will soon be time for the Supreme Court to step in. The rule of law requires no less.

33147724,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639636,1725379258,SUI Price Analysis; Top Analyst Dives Into SUI Future Potential and More,"The cryptocurrency market has always been a roller-coaster ride, and Sui (SUI) is no exception. Over the past week, SUI has experienced a significant drop, with a staggering 23% loss as market panic grips investors. Despite the strong developments within its ecosystem, SUI’s short-term performance appears to be clouded by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). However, amidst this turmoil, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a potential contender for those seeking gains in the volatile crypto space. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Crypto Markets Favorite Meme While SUI grapples with its recent losses, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been quietly gaining traction as a promising token in the gambling and AI sectors. Mpeppe’s unique approach, combining AI-driven features with a focus on decentralized gambling, has captured the interest of investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. As SUI continues to face challenges, Mpeppe’s appeal is growing among those seeking to diversify their portfolios. The token’s ability to offer both utility and entertainment through its platform has made it an attractive option for those who are disillusioned by the current market conditions affecting tokens like SUI. SUI: Recent Market Struggles Sui (SUI) has made headlines with its recent price drop, bringing it down to the $0.71-$0.82 trading range. This decline has caused concern among investors, particularly as SUI has a strong on-chain presence in the DeFi space. The market’s influence on SUI has been evident, with its performance overshadowed by the broader bearish sentiment prevailing in the crypto market. Despite this downturn, there is still optimism among traders and analysts who believe that SUI could make a comeback. The token’s position on the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level indicates a potential support zone, which could provide the foundation for future price recovery. Additionally, SUI’s correlation with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Mpeppe might give it the momentum needed to stabilize and eventually regain lost ground. Why SUI Still has Potential Despite the bearish trend, Sui (SUI) remains a significant player in the DeFi and gaming sectors. The recent announcement of the MMORPG game DARKTIMES launching its Alpha state later this year has fueled anticipation within the SUI community. Built on the Sui network, the game promises to deliver fast-paced action and a rich world powered by SUI’s blockchain technology. Additionally, the platform’s handheld gaming console, SuiPlay OX1, is set to open for pre-orders soon, further expanding SUI’s presence in the gaming industry. These developments, coupled with the resurgence of NFTs on Sui, indicate that the platform is actively working to solidify its position despite the current market challenges. The SUI token’s RSI still signals bearish control, but its return to the 61.80% Fibonacci level is a bullish sign for the long term. If market sentiment flips, SUI could potentially retest the $0.96 level, offering a glimmer of hope for investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE) as an Alternative Investment For those looking to mitigate risks and explore new opportunities, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling case. The token’s integration of AI and gambling features offers a fresh perspective in a market saturated with traditional DeFi tokens. As SUI works to overcome its current challenges, Mpeppe could be the alternative that investors need to maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio. Conclusion While Sui (SUI) faces short-term difficulties, its ongoing developments in gaming and NFTs suggest that it still holds long-term potential. However, for investors looking to explore new horizons, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an intriguing alternative with its innovative approach to AI and decentralized gambling. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on both SUI and Mpeppe could provide valuable insights into the future of the cryptocurrency landscape.

33147721,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639645,1725379256,"Ethereum ETF Couldn’t Save ETH From Falling, ETH Whales Search For New 100X Dreams","The cryptocurrency market has been anything but kind to Ethereum (ETH) lately. Despite the highly anticipated launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs, which many believed would bolster the asset’s price, Ethereum continues to struggle, casting doubts on its short-term potential. As the price of ETH remains trapped in a bearish trend, large investors, or “whales,” are beginning to seek out new opportunities for massive returns—enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising star in the crypto space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Captures the Attention of Ethereum Whales As Ethereum’s price continues to face downward pressure, the search for high-potential alternatives has intensified among crypto whales. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a relatively new entrant in the cryptocurrency market, has quickly garnered attention due to its unique blend of DeFi and entertainment, positioning itself as a potential 100X investment opportunity. Unlike Ethereum, which has been weighed down by market corrections and investor caution, Mpeppe offers a fresh perspective with its innovative approach to decentralized finance. The token’s integration of gambling elements provides an attractive value proposition, particularly for those looking to diversify away from more traditional assets like ETH. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) still in its early stages, the upside potential is significant. This has made it a prime target for Ethereum whales looking to hedge against further losses in their ETH holdings while exploring new avenues for growth. The token’s recent developments, community engagement, and the promise of upcoming updates have only added to its allure. Ethereum’s (ETH) Disappointing Performance The past few months have been challenging for Ethereum investors. With a price decline of 23% over the last 30 days, ETH has underperformed expectations significantly. The launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs was supposed to be a catalyst for a bullish surge, yet the reality has been far from what traders hoped. Benjamin Cowen, a well-known crypto analyst, has pointed out that Ethereum’s current price action is eerily similar to its performance in 2016. Back then, ETH exhibited a similar pattern of monthly candlestick behavior, which eventually led to a massive 19,000% rally, pushing the price to new heights. However, while history often offers clues, it provides no guarantees. As Ethereum continues to track its 2016 movements, investors are left wondering whether the past will indeed repeat itself or if ETH will continue its downward trajectory, leaving investors to lean heavily on newer Coins such as Mpeppe (MPEPE) to carry the baton Cowen suggests that if the pattern holds, Ethereum could see a green September, followed by three bearish months leading into the end of 2024. Should this scenario unfold, the stage could be set for a significant rally in 2025. However, this speculative outlook is not enough to calm the nerves of ETH holders who are seeing their investments dwindle. The Road Ahead for Ethereum and Mpeppe Ethereum’s (ETH) path forward is fraught with uncertainty. While the historical parallels with 2016 suggest a possible turnaround, the immediate future remains bleak, with the asset trading at critical support levels. The 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, just above $2,400, is being closely watched by traders. A bounce from this level could spark a recovery, but if ETH fails to hold this support, further declines could be imminent. For Ethereum bulls, the hope of reaching $5,000 remains on the horizon, albeit increasingly distant. The current bearish momentum has dampened the enthusiasm that once surrounded the asset, leading many to consider reallocating their investments into more promising opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As the year progresses, the crypto market will be a battleground between established giants like Ethereum and emerging contenders like Mpeppe. For now, Ethereum whales appear to be hedging their bets, keeping one foot in the familiar waters of ETH while dipping their toes into the uncharted but potentially lucrative territory of Mpeppe. Conclusion The struggles of Ethereum (ETH) in 2024 have been a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. Despite the excitement surrounding Ethereum ETFs, the asset has continued to underperform, leading investors to seek alternatives. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a compelling option, offering the kind of high-risk, high-reward potential that ETH once promised. As the market navigates through these turbulent times, the decisions made by crypto whales—whether to stick with Ethereum or to explore new frontiers with Mpeppe—will likely shape the future of both assets. For investors, staying informed and adaptable will be key to navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

33147719,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639648,1725379254,Will Pepecoin Make Any More Millionaires? Mpeppe Holders Beg To Differ,"The cryptocurrency market has always been a hotbed of speculation and rapid wealth generation, with meme coins like Pepecoin (PEPE) making headlines for their incredible price surges. However, as the market matures, investors are beginning to question whether these meme coins can continue to deliver the same explosive returns. With the emergence of new contenders like Mpeppe (MPEPE), the debate about which tokens will dominate the next wave of crypto millionaires is heating up. Pepecoin (PEPE) Enjoying the Meme Wave Pepecoin (PEPE) has made a name for itself in the meme coin space, drawing on the viral power of internet culture to fuel its rise. Recently, PEPE saw a 9.8% surge in just 24 hours, further solidifying its position among the top meme coins. This rapid price increase was accompanied by a successful presale for Crypto All Stars, raising $600,000 and generating significant buzz among early investors. The allure of Pepecoin lies in its strong community backing and its ability to tap into the humor and relatability that meme coins thrive on. However, the critical question remains: Can Pepecoin sustain this momentum? Like many meme coins before it, PEPE faces the challenge of proving its value beyond the initial hype. The short-term gains are undeniable, but long-term success will require more than just viral appeal. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Offers a New Hope As Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to ride the waves of meme culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quietly emerging as a formidable alternative. Mpeppe combines the excitement of meme coins with the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) and artificial intelligence (AI), creating a unique value proposition that sets it apart from traditional meme tokens. Mpeppe’s appeal lies in its innovative approach to blending AI-driven gambling with DeFi, offering users not just entertainment but also the potential for substantial financial rewards. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, Mpeppe presents an opportunity to capitalize on the growing trend of AI integration in the crypto space. The Huge Potential of Meme Coins Today The big question on every investor’s mind is: Which token has the potential to make more millionaires? While Pepecoin (PEPE) has already delivered significant returns for early adopters, its future remains uncertain. Meme coins are notoriously volatile, and sustaining their value over the long term is challenging. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned to attract investors who are seeking more than just a quick profit. With its unique combination of AI, gambling, and DeFi, Mpeppe offers a broader utility that could help it maintain and even grow its value over time. This makes it an appealing option for those looking to invest in a token with both short-term excitement and long-term potential. Conclusion: The Next Millionaire-Maker for Meme Holders? In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, both Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) present intriguing opportunities. However, while PEPE has already proven its ability to deliver massive returns, its future remains uncertain. Mpeppe, with its innovative approach and broader utility, could be the safer bet for those looking to build lasting wealth in the crypto market. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: Investors are no longer content with short-term gains. They are looking for projects that offer real value and long-term growth potential. Mpeppe’s unique blend of AI, gambling, and DeFi positions it as a top contender in the race to become the next millionaire-maker in the crypto space. For those willing to take the plunge, Mpeppe (MPEPE) might just be the ticket to substantial returns in the ever-competitive world of cryptocurrency. Whether Pepecoin can continue to make millionaires remains to be seen, but Mpeppe holders are certainly betting on it.

33147717,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639633,1725379240,"ICP, RENDER & MPEPE: Top Analyst Dives Into A.I Tokens and Future Predictions","As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, certain tokens are emerging as front-runners in the race to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Among these are Internet Computer (ICP), Render (RNDR), and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Each of these tokens represents a unique approach to leveraging AI, offering investors promising opportunities for the future. A leading analyst recently provided insights into these tokens, offering predictions on their potential trajectory. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Future of AI-Driven Crypto Gambling Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the newest entrant in the AI and blockchain space, combining the thrill of gambling with the strategic advantages of decentralized finance (DeFi). What sets Mpeppe apart is its innovative use of AI to enhance the gambling experience. The platform utilizes AI algorithms to create fair and engaging games, offering users a unique blend of entertainment and financial reward. The analyst predicts that Mpeppe’s focus on AI-driven gambling will capture the attention of both the crypto and gaming communities. As online gambling continues to grow, Mpeppe’s use of AI to ensure fairness and transparency could make it a leading platform in this space. The token’s value is expected to rise as more users flock to its platform, attracted by the promise of high returns and a novel gaming experience. Internet Computer (ICP): Pioneering Decentralized AI Internet Computer (ICP) has long been a staple in the blockchain world, known for its mission to decentralize the internet. As the digital landscape shifts towards AI-driven solutions, ICP is positioning itself as a key player in this space. The ICP network allows developers to build scalable decentralized applications (dApps) that can integrate AI, enabling new possibilities in automation, machine learning, and data processing. The analyst predicts that ICP’s focus on creating a decentralized internet infrastructure will make it a cornerstone for AI applications in the coming years. With AI increasingly becoming a critical component of many industries, ICP’s and Mpepe’s ability to support these applications without the need for centralized servers positions it as a crucial asset in the AI-driven future. The token’s price could see significant growth as more developers and enterprises adopt its platform to build and deploy AI-based dApps. Render (RNDR): Powering AI with GPU Rendering Render (RNDR) has carved out a niche for itself by enabling users to monetize their unused GPU capacity, particularly in the context of rendering visual effects and motion graphics. However, as AI becomes more integral to various industries, RNDR is also gaining traction as a platform that can support the computational needs of AI projects.

Ethereum (ETH), one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrencies, is no stranger to this volatility. As the market takes a cautious turn, ETH whales are looking for safe havens to protect their investments, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as an intriguing option. Roller coaster: Ethereum (ETH) Under Pressure Ethereum (ETH) has recently faced significant selling pressure, leading to a downturn that has left many investors scrambling for alternatives. Despite its strong fundamentals, including the ongoing development of Ethereum 2.0 and its dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, ETH has not been immune to the broader market correction. According to a recent report by Yahoo Finance, Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the top choices for billionaires, with over $8 billion and $1 billion invested, respectively, since the beginning of the year. However, this influx of capital has not been enough to stave off the recent bearish trend. Ethereum, like many other altcoins, has been in a correction phase following a significant rally driven by the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The report highlights that Ethereum has not been able to keep pace with Bitcoin in terms of performance. While Ethereum offers technical advantages, it has struggled to match Bitcoin’s resilience during market downturns. Since the launch of Ethereum ETFs, there has been a net outflow of $500 million, signaling a cautious approach by investors, hence buying pressure building up for Mpeppe and becoming the fastest growing Meme in 2024. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gains Attention Amid Ethereum’s Struggles As Ethereum (ETH) continues to grapple with market challenges, a new player has caught the attention of ETH whales: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has quickly gained traction, particularly among those looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. The token, which combines elements of decentralized finance and gambling, offers a unique value proposition that appeals to investors seeking alternatives to traditional cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. ETH whales, who are always on the lookout for promising opportunities, have started to diversify their portfolios by investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE). This shift is driven by the desire to mitigate losses during Ethereum’s bearish phase while potentially reaping substantial gains from a token with significant growth potential. Mpeppe’s appeal lies in its innovative approach to blending DeFi with gambling, offering both utility and entertainment. The token’s recent updates and developments have only increased its attractiveness, making it a viable option for those looking to diversify their crypto holdings. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis and Future Outlook Ethereum’s (ETH) recent price action has been less than encouraging for bulls. The token has seen a decline of over 23% in recent weeks, driven by a combination of market-wide bearish sentiment and specific challenges facing the Ethereum network. The SUI crash, which also impacted other major altcoins, added to the selling pressure on ETH. Despite these setbacks, Ethereum remains a powerhouse in the cryptocurrency space. The ongoing development of Ethereum and its dominance in DeFi suggest that the token is far from finished. However, in the short term, ETH investors should brace for continued volatility. Ethereum is currently trading in a crucial support range between $2400-$2600. This range is significant for the long-term performance of the token. A break below this level could signal further downside, while a bounce from this support could pave the way for a recovery. ETH’s correlation with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin suggests that its future performance will be heavily influenced by broader market sentiment. If the market turns bullish, Ethereum could see a resurgence, potentially testing the $5000-$6000 level in the long term, which will automatically put Mpeppe in a strong market position. Conclusion As Ethereum (ETH) navigates through a challenging period, ETH whales are increasingly looking to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a potential refuge. While Ethereum’s long-term prospects remain strong, the current market conditions have prompted a shift in investment strategies. Mpeppe’s unique blend of DeFi and gambling has made it an attractive alternative for those seeking to hedge against Ethereum’s bearish trend. The coming weeks will be critical for both Ethereum and Mpeppe, as investors watch closely to see how these tokens perform in a volatile market. Whether Ethereum can reclaim its former glory or if Mpeppe will rise as a new contender remains to be seen.

42390466,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1zhN,1725378935,Institutional DeFi Needs a BUIDL Moment,"""The institutions are coming!"" This is one of those perennial arguments we've been hearing for years in decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite the evolution in the space and hundreds of billions in total value locked (TVL), institutional presence in DeFi remains relatively low. The lack of KYC-AML capabilities is often cited as the main reason, but that argument is increasingly weak. The reality, more difficult to admit, is that DeFi is missing key building blocks to unlock significant levels of institutional adoption.  DeFi has all the technical foundations to become a parallel financial system for institutions, but unlocking its potential will require two key things. Firstly, DeFi desperately needs first-class primitives for institutions. Additionally, the space must work towards strong validation by meeting the requirements of large institutions in traditional finance. If we consider the impact that the BlackRock BUIDL project has had in validating tokenized securities and real-world assets (RWA), that should be the north star for institutional DeFi.  We are entering a period in global markets with central banks cutting rates, which could be incredibly favorable for DeFi. Not taking advantage of this to catalyze institutional adoption is a wasted opportunity, but we need to address the right challenges instead of oversimplifying the problem.  It's not only about KYC-AML  The limited growth of institutional DeFi is often explained by the lack of KYC and AML capabilities. At the peak of the DeFi market in 2021, several blue-chip DeFi protocols attempted to enable KYC-AML capabilities to attract institutions without any significant success. If KYC-AML was the main hurdle for traditional finance institutions to embrace DeFi, and we were at the peak of the bull cycle, that should have worked, right? What happened?  The reason is that while KYC-AML is required for many institutional DeFi products, it is hardly sufficient to unlock the potential of the market. Today, DeFi is still lacking financial primitives for institutions, so adding KYC-AML just results in the same institutional-less market with validated investors. In the context of large institutional capital, DeFi is still perceived as a second-tier market, not because of the lack of KYC-AML, but due to limited institutional-grade capabilities.  Limited capital efficiency, technical and economic risks, extremely fragmented liquidity, and the lack of institutional-grade investment products are some of the factors that rank higher than KYC-AML for institutions considering DeFi. Even if all protocols in DeFi were to enable KYC-AML features tomorrow, it would only result in a marginal increase in institutional adoption.  DeFi needs a BUIDL moment  Tokenized securities have been hailed as the next-big-thing in crypto since 2018, but the market saw relatively little adoption for years. The value proposition of tokenized securities was obvious, and most platforms had KYC-AML capabilities, but that wasn’t enough to be taken seriously by institutions. During that time, companies like Securitize added institutional-ready capabilities such as broker-dealers, transfer agents, and onboarding institutions, all of which led to BlackRock gaining conviction for the space. BUIDL built on the institutional blocks laid by Securitize, like its transfer agent and broker-dealer capabilities.  The tokenized securities market can effectively be divided into “before BUIDL” and “after BUIDL.” BUIDL legitimized tokenized securities to levels that were previously unthinkable. DeFi needs to work towards a BUIDL moment, and the first step is to enable institutional-grade primitives.  Towards institutional DeFi primitives  The path to enabling institutional-grade capabilities in DeFi has three main avenues:  The Top-Down Approach: Building financial products that expand the existing foundation of DeFi protocols with institutional-grade capabilities.  The Bottom-Up Approach: Building DeFi protocols or extensions of protocols with native capabilities for institutions.  The Shortcut Approach: Bringing products with significant institutional adoption to DeFi.  Top-down institutional DeFi  A top-down approach refers to the idea of building investment products that mitigate some of the limitations of existing DeFi protocols for institutional adoption.  A classic example of this trend is capital efficiency. In DeFi today, protocols like automated market makers (AMMs) rely on basic linear algorithms to balance liquidity, which remain incredibly inefficient compared to traditional mechanisms such as order books. Similarly, most lending in DeFi is overcollateralized, imposing major limits on scaling. We can envision a new generation of DEXes or lending vehicles that use the current generation of DeFi protocols as a foundation but enable more capital-efficient rails for institutions.  Another example of this trend is capital fragmentation. In today’s version of DeFi, capital is fragmented across hundreds of protocols and different chains with limited interoperability. The launch of new protocols and ecosystems is exacerbating this problem to levels that make it impractical for institutions. Primitives that abstract capital access across different ecosystems are among the simplest and most welcomed solutions to attract institutional capital into DeFi.  Bottom-up institutional DeFi  As DeFi evolves, we should work towards enabling native institutional-grade capabilities in DeFi protocols. The canonical example of this idea is to enable institutional-first pools or markets in AMMs or lending protocols. This is technically possible today with protocols such as Morpho Blue or the upcoming Uniswap v4 or Aave v4. The blockers are in areas such as liquidity formation, security, and several others.  Another classic example is insurance primitives, which remain very basic in their current form. Native DeFi insurance could be one of the major unlocks for institutional adoption in DeFi.  The shortcut approach  Until now, we’ve been discussing building capabilities to enable institutions to interact with DeFi, but what about enabling DeFi capabilities for products that already have significant adoption by financial institutions? DeFi has a long history of building derivatives over financial constructs to enable access in DeFi protocols or different ecosystems. wBTC and stETH gained incredible traction in DeFi using these principles. The same idea applies to tokenized treasuries or vehicles like BUIDL, which could be made available in DeFi via derivatives with the right regulatory constructs.  Institutions will come if we help  The lack of institutional adoption in DeFi is fundamentally due to capability limitations, not solely regulatory uncertainty. The market is about to enter a low-interest rate cycle that should favor DeFi adoption. Building the right institutional rails in that environment is paramount for the success of DeFi. This might be the best chance DeFi has to capture institutional mindshare in the foreseeable future. The institutions will come to DeFi if the right institutional-grade capabilities exist.

Ninety minutes after U.S. stock markets opened for trade following Monday's Labor Day Holiday, bitcoin {{BTC}} was down 1.5% to $57,800 while ether {{ETH}} was lower by 3% to $2,442, its weakest level since early February.  The broad market gauge CoinDesk 20 Index was down only 1% as a handful of constituents were posting modest session gains, led by lumens {{XLMX}} and litecoin {{LTC}}.  The selling in crypto took place alongside a sizable slide in stocks, led by a 2.4% decline in the Nasdaq and a 1.5% fall for the S&P 500.  U.S. August economic data begins to roll in  This morning's ISM Manufacturing PMI report for August showed continued contraction, coming in at 47.2 versus 47.5 expected and July's 46.8. The guts of the report, however, had a stagflationish feel, with New Orders dipping to 44.6 from July's 47.4 while Prices Paid rose to 54.0 from 52.9.  Following the soft numbers, traders have upped the odds of a 50 basis point Federal Reserve rate cut in September to 39% from 30% one day ago, according to CME FedWatch. The betting favorite, though, remains 25 basis points at 61%.  The main event for U.S. macro news – and possibly the final arbiter on whether the Fed goes 25 or 50 – remains Friday's August employment report, and economists are forecasting job gains rebounding to 160,000 from July's soft 114,000 print. The unemployment rate is anticipated to have dipped to 4.2% from 4.3%.  Seasonality suggests selling might continue  After bitcoin's roughly 10% decline for the month of August, at least some were hoping for a September bounce, but that could prove wishful thinking. According to Galaxy Research chief Alex Thorn, bitcoin fell during seven of the last 10 Septembers. However, that data set contains some good news, said Thorn, as October has typically been bitcoin's best month of the year and the rest of the Fall has usually brought positive returns as well.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/03/crypto-crumble-sends-bitcoin-below-58k-ether-to-7-month-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b68bf729986837877770b0392ed80d01d5cb2dbf-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33146157,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639601,1725375640,Ripple (XRP) Struggles To Regain Momentum As XRP holders Dive Into New Gambling Fortune,"Ripple (XRP) has long been a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, particularly known for its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, recent developments have shown that XRP is facing challenges in regaining its momentum, prompting some XRP holders to explore new opportunities, such as the emerging gambling token Mpeppe (MPEPE). The Ripple CTO’s Surprising Admission In a recent statement that surprised many within the crypto community, David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple, admitted that he has no clear understanding of what factors drive the price of XRP. This revelation has led to further questions about the future of XRP and its market dynamics, especially when such an influential figure within Ripple cannot pinpoint the forces influencing the token’s value. Schwartz’s statement, “I have no idea what influences the price of XRP,” underscores the complexity and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency markets. Even for someone deeply involved in the technological development of XRP, the market forces remain elusive. This admission has left many investors and analysts questioning the stability and predictability of XRP as an investment and created a spotlight on the fastest growing presale coin in 2024, Mpeppe (MPEPE). A Fascinating Correlation: XRP and Stellar (XLM) Despite the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s price drivers, Schwartz did observe an intriguing correlation between the prices and market capitalizations of XRP and Stellar (XLM). Both cryptocurrencies, founded with the intent to streamline cross-border payments, have shown remarkable synchronization in their market movements across various time frames. Stellar (XLM), created by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, focuses on providing financial services to unbanked populations, while XRP targets financial institutions and banks. The correlation noted by Schwartz suggests that market events affecting one token might similarly influence the other. This insight could provide traders and investors with a unique perspective, potentially using developments in one network as an indicator for the other. XRP’s Struggle and the Rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) As XRP grapples with these uncertainties, a portion of its investor base is exploring new avenues for potential gains. One such opportunity that has caught the attention of XRP holders is the new gambling token, Mpeppe (MPEPE). This token is quickly gaining popularity for its innovative approach to combining decentralized finance (DeFi) with online gambling. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique blend of entertainment and financial reward, appealing to investors looking to diversify their portfolios with tokens that provide both utility and potential for high returns. The recent surge in interest surrounding Mpeppe is indicative of a broader trend where investors are increasingly drawn to projects that offer something beyond the traditional functions of a cryptocurrency. The Future of XRP and Emerging Tokens The future of Ripple (XRP) remains uncertain as it continues to face challenges in regaining its market momentum. The CTO’s recent admission about the unpredictability of XRP’s price drivers has only added to the skepticism among some investors. This environment of uncertainty has opened the door for emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to attract attention and investment. For XRP holders, the shift towards Mpeppe represents a strategic move to capitalize on new opportunities in the evolving crypto landscape. As Mpeppe continues to develop its ecosystem, particularly in the gambling sector, it could offer significant rewards for early adopters Conclusion Ripple (XRP) may be struggling to regain its footing, but the rise of new tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents fresh opportunities for investors seeking to diversify their holdings. While XRP’s future remains clouded by uncertainty, the appeal of innovative projects in the DeFi and gambling spaces could provide the next wave of growth in the cryptocurrency market. For those willing to explore beyond established tokens, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an exciting prospect in the world of digital assets.

33146155,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639615,1725375638,TRX vs MPEPE: Tron Whales Add Mpepe Gambling Token To Moonbag Holdings,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, whales—those deep-pocketed investors who can move markets with a single transaction—are constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Recently, a new trend has emerged as some of these whales are beginning to diversify their portfolios by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their holdings. This move comes as Tron (TRX) continues to perform admirably but faces increasing competition in the space, especially with the rise of innovative tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). The Rise of Tron (TRX) and Its Whales Tron (TRX) has long been a favorite among crypto investors, particularly for its high transaction speeds and low fees. Over the years, the Tron (TRX) network has consistently outperformed many of its peers, particularly in terms of the sheer volume of transactions processed. Recently, Tron (TRX) reached a new all-time high with over 8.1 billion transactions, driven largely by the increasing use of its network for Tether (USDT) transactions. This has cemented Tron (TRX)’s position as a leader in the blockchain space, especially among those looking for cost-effective and efficient transaction solutions. Whales have been a crucial part of Tron (TRX)’s success. These large investors have the power to drive up the price of TRX, and their confidence in the platform has been a major factor in its sustained uptrend. However, as the market matures and new opportunities arise, these whales are beginning to look elsewhere to diversify their investments. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new player in the market that is rapidly gaining attention for its unique offering. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender in the Crypto Arena Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it’s a token that has quickly carved out a niche for itself in the rapidly growing online gambling sector. Unlike many other tokens that rely heavily on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers tangible utility, which is why it’s starting to catch the eye of Tron (TRX) whales. The token is part of a larger ecosystem that integrates blockchain technology with online gambling, offering a transparent, secure, and decentralized platform for users. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its focus on providing a seamless gambling experience, where users can stake their tokens and participate in various games with the potential for high returns. This utility, combined with the community-driven nature of the project, is what makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a strong contender in the market. Why Are Tron Whales Adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to Their Holdings? The move by Tron (TRX) whales to add Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their moonbag holdings is indicative of a broader shift in the market. While Tron (TRX) continues to be a strong performer, the search for diversification and higher returns is leading these large investors to explore new opportunities. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers several advantages that make it an attractive option: High Potential Returns: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its early stages, which means it has significant room for growth. The token’s unique proposition in the online gambling space, combined with its strong community backing, positions it well for future success. Diversification: For whales who are heavily invested in Tron (TRX), adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios offers a way to diversify their holdings. This is particularly important in a market as volatile as crypto, where spreading risk across multiple assets can be a smart strategy. Strong Community and Utility: Unlike many other meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has a clear use case and a growing community of supporters. This adds a layer of stability to the investment, as the token’s value is not solely dependent on market speculation. Gambling Sector Integration: The integration of Mpeppe (MPEPE) into the online gambling sector adds another layer of utility to the token. As the online gambling industry continues to grow, so too does the potential for Mpeppe (MPEPE) to increase in value. TRX vs MPEPE: A Comparative Analysis While Tron (TRX) has a well-established presence in the crypto world, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a strong competitor. The key difference between the two lies in their target markets and use cases. Tron (TRX) is primarily focused on providing a high-speed, low-cost blockchain solution, which has made it a favorite for transactions and smart contracts. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, is carving out a niche in the online gambling sector, offering a specialized product that appeals to a different segment of the market. For whales, the decision to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) alongside Tron (TRX) is a strategic one. By diversifying their holdings, they can capitalize on the strengths of both tokens—Tron (TRX)’s robust network and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s growing influence in the gambling industry. Conclusion: The Future of TRX and MPEPE As the crypto market continues to evolve, the need for diversification and the search for new opportunities will drive investors to explore emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Tron (TRX) remains a strong contender in the space, the addition of Mpeppe (MPEPE) to whale portfolios suggests that this new token is one to watch. With its unique offering and growing community support, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has the potential to become a major player in the crypto world, particularly in the niche market of online gambling.

This A.I.-driven gambling token stands out in the crowded digital asset market, making it a promising investment choice. Why FET Investors Are Betting Big on Mpeppe (MPEPE) Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), or the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, has been a key player in the A.I. and blockchain sectors, attracting investors who are interested in cutting-edge technology. However, as the market evolves, these investors are now turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new A.I.-powered gambling token that is poised to revolutionize the online gambling industry. The shift in focus highlights Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential to offer substantial returns and its alignment with the growing trend of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain applications. The Appeal of Cryptocurrencies in Online Gambling: Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Stands Out The rise of cryptocurrencies in online casinos has been driven by several key factors, making tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly attractive. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies offers enhanced security and privacy, which are crucial for players in the gambling industry. Additionally, the transparency and traceability provided by blockchain technology have further accelerated the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE) in online gaming platforms. For Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) investors, the appeal lies in Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ability to leverage these advantages to create a seamless and secure gambling experience. Security and Privacy: The Cornerstones of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Success One of the primary reasons Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) investors are drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its focus on security and privacy. In the world of online gambling, where sensitive personal and financial information is constantly at risk, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s use of blockchain technology provides an added layer of protection. The decentralized nature of Mpeppe (MPEPE) ensures that transactions are secure, private, and resistant to hacking or fraud. This emphasis on security makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a trusted choice for both players and investors looking to capitalize on the growing online gambling market. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Global Reach Another key factor driving the adoption of Mpeppe (MPEPE) in the online gambling industry is its ability to overcome geographical constraints. Traditional banking methods often impose restrictions on cross-border transactions, creating barriers for international players. Cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE) eliminate these obstacles, enabling players from around the world to participate in online gambling without the hassle of currency conversion or regional limitations. For Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) investors, this global reach represents a significant growth opportunity, as Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to expand its user base across multiple markets. A Competitive Edge for Mpeppe (MPEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) also offers a competitive advantage through its low-cost transaction model. Unlike traditional payment methods that often come with high fees and delays, blockchain technology allows Mpeppe (MPEPE) to process transactions quickly and at a fraction of the cost. This efficiency is particularly appealing in the fast-paced world of online gambling, where players expect immediate payouts and seamless experiences. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) investors recognize the value of this feature, which not only enhances the user experience but also contributes to the overall profitability of the Mpeppe (MPEPE) platform. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) – A Smart Addition to FET Investor Portfolios Major Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) investors have added Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios, marking a significant advancement in cryptocurrency investments. MPEPE combines blockchain security and privacy with global reach and low-cost transactions in online gambling, positioning investors for success in a rapidly changing market.

33146106,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639500,1725375610,"Solana Sees 7,600% Surge In Institutional Inflows, Here’s Why","Solana price action might be trending downwards, but institutional investors are bucking the trend. This speck of positive Solana sentiment has come through an inflow report of digital asset investment report, with Solana coming up on top. Digital asset investment products witnessed a cumulative outflow last week, especially as Bitcoin-based products failed to attract investor inflow. Particularly, data from CoinShares’s weekly report on digital asset fund flows noted a total outflow of $305 million last week, a vast difference from the $533 million registered in the previous week. Although the majority of outflow came through Bitcoin-based products, Solana managed to perform a 7,500% increase in inflows. SOL Sees 7,600% Surge In Inflows The digital asset investment landscape was marked by significant volatility in August. Last week’s cumulative outflows from the institutional niche highlighted the challenges faced by many cryptocurrencies. According to the most recent CoinShares report, Bitcoin can be credited with the lion’s share of the outflows, with the crypto’s products registering $319 million worth of outflows last week. Related Reading: Road To $5,000: Ethereum Maintains Similarities With 2016 Price Movements Altcoins, on the other hand, displayed varying results last week. Ethereum, the leading altcoin, mirrored Bitcoin’s performance with an outflow of $5.7 million amidst a low trading volume week for Spot ETH ETFs. However, every other altcoin managed to attract institutional inflow last week in what could be a reflection of growing confidence. Notably, Solana-based products topped the charts with $7.6 million worth of inflows, which is a vast increase from the $0.1 million it registered in the prior week. As such, the crypto managed to perform a 7,500% inflow increase. This positive momentum for SOL is particularly notable because it marks a reversal from the negative sentiment that started to rise in mid-August. Just two weeks ago, Solana experienced the most significant outflow on record to the tune of $39 million, making the recent inflows even more important. Solana ETF Changing The Narrative A large part of the shift in Solana sentiment can be attributed to some rumors surrounding the launch of Spot Solana ETFs in the US. After the successful launch of Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the crypto industry has naturally shifted focus to the potential of a Spot ETF for the next big altcoin, and Solana has come into the limelight. Interestingly, Spot Solana ETFs recently went live in Brazil and the South American market. The most recent approval was given to Hashdex, a Brazil-based asset manager with over $962 million in assets under management.

42390496,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd28dJ,1725373845,Facing Up to Crypto’s Gen Z Stigma,"The future of crypto lies in the hands of a generation that does not appreciate it. As a sophomore in college, I have witnessed this firsthand.  In theory, college students should be the most open to using consumer-facing applications with incentive structures. They are too old for their parents to cover their expenses but not old enough for a full-time job. However, they are skeptical of crypto products.  From my vantage point, the hesitation to use these applications stems from a lack of trust in the system, or that the incentives are simply too good to be true.  People believe this primarily because of the content they are consuming. In a world of Instagram and TikTok, crypto is losing a major information war. The majority of content on these platforms pertaining to crypto is disingenuous (at best) and malicious.  This content is popular because ""sob stories"" rack up views. People posting videos of how they got ""rugged"" on a memecoin or lost their money in a hack attracts 100x more views than posting about the benefits of crypto.  The mainstream media largely only references crypto when a crisis happens, like the FTX collapse. We see news talking about the collapse of a crypto exchange but do not see the stories of how Bitcoin saves people's lives in Latin America.  This selective media reporting, along with the malicious content on social media, is causing younger generations to feel apprehensive about the crypto industry and position their careers elsewhere.  We can solve this through education. Firstly, it is important to understand that you can't onboard someone by feeding them content their brain is hardwired to disagree with. This can be reversed by showing students the good that has originated from our industry and how it can benefit their daily lives. For example, it means showing people how to interact with Blackbird to earn free food, or Helium to be paid to have cell service.  We can also combat malicious content by producing our own that tells the other side of the story. While the majority of communication happens on Twitter and Telegram, Gen Z is relatively unused to these applications. To flip the script, we need to push out content on Instagram and other social media sites showing the good of crypto and the ways it is benefiting people across the world.  University blockchain clubs are playing an important role in this. Through workshops, onboarding sessions, and boot camps, these groups are arguably playing the most important role in ensuring the crypto industry does not die out.  At the University of Florida, where I go to school, Gator Blockchain provides access to Delphi Digital's research and brings in industry leaders to talk to members. At the University of Michigan, Michigan Blockchain has consistently delivered access for its members to exclusive events like the upcoming Midwest Blockchain Conference.  Sponsoring hackathons, research grants, or offering internships to students is crucial to developing talent and flipping the script that crypto is just criminal activity.  As an industry, we need to invest in future generations. While the crypto industry needs to ensure Gen Z goes on-chain, significant innovation will also stem from putting resources in the hands of hungry college kids. It is paramount that university clubs are funded so talent continues to be drawn towards building in crypto.  Outside of giving resources to university clubs, platforms that can benefit from onboarding Gen Z should make a push towards doing this. DePIN protocols will benefit from having more people using them, and there are millions of college kids who would be happy to earn some side money. Play-to-Earn games are always searching for more users. On the privacy side, Gen Z is considered the most privacy-concerned generation. Tools like BrightID allow people to securely own their digital identities, and decentralized VPNs like Orchid satisfy the need for internet freedom.  The idea of cryptocurrency aligns with Gen Z's desire for independence. We have built products that satisfy the wants of the younger generations; they just are unaware they exist. Respectfully, the only institution I see actively pushing to put people on-chain is Coinbase. This has to change — there are too many resources floating around the industry to not allocate a portion towards ensuring the younger generations love crypto.  Many people don't seem to believe this is make or break. We're approaching an inflection point — the technology exists, and we either find users or go down as trying to solve a problem people did not want solved.  College kids are the biggest opportunity to bring people on-chain. University clubs are in the best position to bring those people on-chain and thus should have the full support of the major networks and protocols that stand to benefit the most from people coming on-chain.

""We went through a large org planning exercise, and it became clear that the talent and roles we have today do not perfectly match our needs,"" CEO Alex Gluchowski wrote.  Matter Labs, the main developer behind the Ethereum layer-2 protocol ZKsync, laid off 16% of its employees as part of a restructuring to adapt to ""the different type of technology and support"" developers building on system now require, CEO Alex Gluchowski said in a post on X.  ""We went through a large org planning exercise, and it became clear that the talent and roles we have today do not perfectly match our needs,"" Gluchowski wrote in his Tuesday post. Matter Labs may have as many as 200 employees according to its LinkedIn profile, so the layoffs could amount to more than 30 people.  ZKsync is jostling for market share in the crowded field of Ethereum layer-2 networks, protocols built atop the main blockchain that provide an alternate venue for transactions to be settled, with the goal of doing so faster and cheaper.  The proliferation of layer 2s may indicate that the sector needs to be reframed and looked at through a use case-specific lens, Gluchowski suggested in a recent interview with CoinDesk. Matter Labs released its Elastic Chain in June to tackle fragmentation between this multitude of layer 2s by enabling them to plug into its interoperability layer.  ""I think that we will not need too many general purpose layer 2s, but we do need some application specific L2s or community specific L2s,” he said in the interview. ""We have projects launching on the Elastic Chain that are just gaming chains, which does not really need to be sharing infrastructure block space with DeFi or financial applications.”  The protocol's ZKSync (ZK) token has dropped 3.14% in the past 24 hours according to CoinGecko, while ether fell 2.9%. The broader market, as measured by CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), declined 1.5%. ZK has lost about 64% of its value since its June debut.

Từ đầu tháng 8, Bitcoin đã tăng hơn 32%, được thúc đẩy bởi các trader kỳ vọng những bình luận ôn hòa từ Cục Dự trữ Liên bang. Một lần cắt giảm 25 điểm cơ bản có thể báo hiệu sự khởi đầu của một chu kỳ nới lỏng điển hình, điều này có thể dẫn đến tăng giá dài hạn cho Bitcoin khi thanh khoản tăng và nỗi sợ suy thoái giảm. Mặt khác, một lần cắt giảm 50 điểm cơ bản mạnh mẽ hơn có thể gây ra một đột biến giá ngay lập tức nhưng có thể được theo sau bởi một sự điều chỉnh khi lo ngại suy thoái tăng lên. Trong tuần qua, chúng ta đã thấy những người nắm giữ spot giảm rủi ro trong khi những người đầu cơ thị trường vĩnh cửu đã cố gắng “mua đáy” và chúng tôi tiếp tục quan sát sự quan tâm mở lớn đáng kể đối với BTC perpetuals. Nếu chúng ta phải suy đoán, chúng ta sẽ cảnh báo về khả năng giảm 15-20% khi lãi suất được cắt giảm trong tháng này, với mức đáy của Bitcoin là 40-50k$. Đây không phải là một con số tùy ý mà dựa trên thực tế là đỉnh điểm của chu kỳ về mặt tỷ lệ lợi nhuận giảm khoảng 60-70% mỗi chu kỳ và mức điều chỉnh trung bình của thị trường tăng giá cũng đã giảm. Nhưng logic này có thể bị phủ nhận khá dễ dàng nếu điều kiện kinh tế vĩ mô thay đổi. Đây là thời điểm không chắc chắn đối với các trader. Theo lịch sử, tháng 9 là một tháng biến động đối với Bitcoin, với lợi nhuận trung bình là -4,78% và mức giảm điển hình từ đỉnh đến đáy khoảng 24,6%. Sự biến động này , kết hợp với khả năng xảy ra phản ứng “bán tin tức” sau khi cắt giảm lãi suất, có thể mang lại cả rủi ro và cơ hội cho các trader. Trong khi đó, sự tương quan ngày càng tăng của Bitcoin với các tài sản rủi ro truyền thống như S&P 500 cho thấy các biến động giá của nó sẽ vẫn gắn chặt với các điều kiện kinh tế vĩ mô toàn cầu. Các hành động của các ngân hàng trung ương lớn khác, chẳng hạn như việc Ngân hàng Trung ương Châu Âu có thể tạm dừng tăng lãi suất giữa bối cảnh tăng trưởng chậm lại, cách tiếp cận thận trọng của Ngân hàng Nhật Bản giữa bối cảnh nền kinh tế đang phục hồi chậm và các biện pháp thanh khoản có mục tiêu của Ngân hàng Nhân dân Trung Quốc để hỗ trợ tăng trưởng chậm của Trung Quốc, có khả năng sẽ có tác động lan tỏa trên toàn thị trường toàn cầu và ảnh hưởng đến các tài sản kỹ thuật số như Bitcoin. Nền kinh tế Mỹ tiếp tục được hưởng lợi từ việc giảm lạm phát liên tục, tiêu dùng hộ gia đình mạnh mẽ và tăng trưởng tiền lương vượt quá lạm phát. Chỉ số PCE , thước đo lạm phát ưa thích của Cục Dự trữ Liên bang, đã tăng 2,5% vào tháng 7, cho thấy sự giảm lạm phát bền vững và củng cố sự ổn định giá cả trên toàn nền kinh tế. Những lo ngại trước đây về khả năng suy thoái kinh tế đã giảm bớt, được hỗ trợ bởi tăng trưởng GDP mạnh hơn dự kiến ​​trong quý thứ hai, đã được sửa đổi tăng lên ba phần trăm hàng năm từ ước tính trước đó là 2,8 phần trăm. Tuy nhiên, thị trường nhà ở đã gặp phải những thách thức vào tháng 7, với doanh số bán nhà đang chờ xử lý giảm xuống mức thấp kỷ lục , khi lãi suất thế chấp giảm không kích thích hoạt động thị trường. Bất chấp sự cố này, chúng tôi vẫn lạc quan rằng sự suy giảm sẽ chỉ là tạm thời, với kỳ vọng rằng việc giảm thêm lãi suất thế chấp và kết thúc năm bầu cử có thể giúp thị trường lấy lại đà. Trong khi đó, niềm tin của người tiêu dùng Mỹ đã đạt mức cao nhất trong sáu tháng vào tháng 8, được thúc đẩy bởi sự lạc quan về triển vọng kinh tế tổng thể, mặc dù vẫn còn lo ngại về thị trường việc làm. Trong toàn ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử, chúng ta cũng thấy một xu hướng ngày càng tăng về sự tham gia chính trị và quy định, cùng với những tiến bộ đáng kể trong cơ sở hạ tầng giao dịch và việc áp dụng thị trường. Ứng cử viên tổng thống Donald Trump đã công bố một chiến lược nhằm định vị Hoa Kỳ trở thành một nhà lãnh đạo toàn cầu về tiền điện tử, cụ thể là thông qua sự liên kết của ông với dự án tài chính phi tập trung, World Liberty Financial. Song song với sự thay đổi chính trị này, 24X National Exchange đã đệ trình một đề xuất lên cơ quan quản lý Hoa Kỳ để ra mắt một sàn giao dịch chứng khoán cho phép giao dịch 24/7 các ETF tiền điện tử. Trong khi đó, Úc đã nổi lên như một người chơi lớn trong thị trường tiền điện tử toàn cầu, chứng kiến ​​sự gia tăng 17 lần về số lượng ATM tiền điện tử trong hai năm qua, biến nó thành thị trường lớn thứ ba trên thế giới. Tuy nhiên, sự mở rộng nhanh chóng này cũng đã làm dấy lên mối lo ngại trong giới chức về khả năng sử dụng các ATM này để rửa tiền. Để đối phó, một lực lượng đặc nhiệm đa cơ quan đã được thành lập để giải quyết những vấn đề này, nhấn mạnh sự căng thẳng liên tục giữa đổi mới và quy định trong bối cảnh tiền điện tử.

NEAR continues with the list of altcoins that keep up their losses even as the majors, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, recover from their respective slumps. According to CoinGecko, the token fell by 21% since last week despite the market’s 3%uptick today. Related Reading: SUI Crashes 23% As September Unleashes Market Panic—Is A Comeback Possible? Although NEAR is underperforming, developments on-chain continue to offset the market’s bearishness. One of the most notable developments on NEAR is Libre Capital offering tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on chain, bringing institutional interest to the platform RWAs Create Buzz For The Protocol Libre Capital is a new crypto asset management firm supported by market giants like Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Nomura’s Laser Digital. It was founded four months ago and has since experienced huge upward momentum. According to Libre Capital Founder and CEO Avtar Sehra, Libre surpassed the $100 million asset under management mark, cementing the firm as one of the fastest-rising crypto asset management companies on the market. Libre has achieved many milestones since our MVP launch four months ago, surpassing our $100 million aum target and expanding to multiple chains. Launch on @NEARProtocol marks a crucial step towards our multichain wealth strategy. Learn more here: https://t.co/dGCqKENTXu — Avtar Sehra (@avtarsehra) September 2, 2024 NEAR and Libre’s partnership will enable NEAR users to access tokenized versions of RWAs. As of writing, users have access to Hamilton Lane’s credit Fund, Brevan Howard’s Master Fund, and Blackrock’s ICS Money Market Fund, bridging the gap between crypto and the traditional finance space. According to Sehra, the launch of Libre on NEAR is “a crucial step towards our multichain wealth strategy” which hints at future support for more blockchains other than NEAR. But for now, this development might help bring in more institutional investors on the platform. NEAR On Goldilocks Zone Trading Range As of writing, the bears experienced a strong rejection on the $3.8 price floor giving the bulls time to regroup and bounce. NEAR is now trying to stabilize between the $3.8-$4.3 trading range, allowing investors and traders to target $5.2 in the long term. Related Reading: Ripple Unleashes 1 Billion XRP: Could This Trigger A Price Tsunami? NEAR continues to experience a strong bearish momentum in the short term, but the bulls have since gathered enough momentum to cancel out the token’s decline. The problem now is when will NEAR have enough push to break through $4.3 in the medium term. The relative strength index (RSI) suggests that the token might experience a period of low volatility where the bears and the bulls will have an equally strong momentum. But after this, NEAR will have enough push to drive the bears out of the market, breaking through $4.3 in the medium term before settling on the $4.3-$4.7 trading range. However, this price movement is completely dependent on the broader market momentum. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to struggle, NEAR will have a lot of ground to retake if the bears succeed in breaking through $3.8.

42390490,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd28Nv,1725368461,BitGo CEO Says Wrapped Bitcoin’s Critics Aren’t Being ‘Intellectually Honest’ About Their Concerns,"BitGo's CEO Mike Belshe defended a recent partnership with BiT Global involving wrapped bitcoin, that has been criticized by some for its proximity to Tron founder Justin Sun.  ""There is no doubt that the model that BitGo is proposing, how we're going to store the keys, is far superior to anything that Coinbase can or would concoct,"" he said.  The deal with BiT Global is about enhancing security and expanding in Asia, using a model that separates key custody across multiple institutions to eliminate single points of failure, despite concerns about Sun's involvement.  SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA – BitGo’s move to sign a deal with BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based crypto custodian that’s partially owned by Tron’s Justin Sun has received its share of criticism from the crypto community. However, in an interview with CoinDesk during Korea Blockchain Week, BitGo’s CEO Mike Belshe says that this criticism is missing one thing: intellectual honesty.  Threshold – one of the loudest critics of the BitGo-BiT Global tie-up – recently proposed to merge its BTC wrapper, tBTC, into Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) to address concerns over what it calls wBTC's shift in control.  “They’ve even said publicly that if they had all of Wrapped Bitcoin’s market share, their token's value would be 35 times higher. I understand that they want their token to go up, but we’re facing attacks from every tBTC holder who wants to see that happen,” Belshe said. “Let’s be intellectually honest here: criticizing our efforts to decentralize Wrapped Bitcoin just to boost their token’s value is beyond ridiculous.""  As for Coinbase, which recently teased its own competitor of wrapped bitcoin called cbBTC on the Base blockchain, Belshe said it would go against the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi) if cbBTC gained a following, and if the “DeFi community picks central bank Coinbase as the ultimate steward, then I think all DeFi hope should be lost.”  ""Of course, the central bank, CB, Coinbase, they also would love to have Wrapped Bitcoin under their belt,"" he said. ""There is no doubt that the model that BitGo is proposing, how we're going to store the keys, is far superior to anything that Coinbase can or would concoct.""  Belshe emphasizes that many of the loudest critics don’t understand the legal structure of BiT Global. Registered as a licensed Trust or Company Service Provider (TCSP) in Hong Kong, the company has a fiduciary duty – just like BitGo – to the Wrapped Bitcoin DAO to ensure the security of the bitcoin in its custody.  ""We are a fiduciary today, and it’s our duty to ensure that the assets are protected, regardless of where they are held,"" he said.  So then, why do this deal in the first place? The deal is about, he explains, “eliminating single points of failure"" and expanding its footprint in Asia.  ""We use deep cold storage, separating keys across multiple people, he said. “And now we're taking it a step further by separating them across multiple institutions.""  Belshe said he knows Justin Sun is a “colorful character,” but he emphasized the importance of transparency: ""Most companies wouldn't have even mentioned his name, but we did. Why? Because transparency matters.""  He wanted the community to ""digest it, scrutinize it, and propose alternatives,"" ensuring trust by openly sharing all aspects of the partnership.  And it looks like this move paid off. Despite an initial huff-and-puff by elements of the MakerDAO community, on-chain data shows that there hasn’t been a significant exodus out of wBTC via burns.  ""It’s not like a 'why Sun' type of thing. It’s about who is a qualified custodian that can receive these assets,"" he continued.  And that qualified custodian just happens to be in Justin Sun’s portfolio. But it's a portfolio company he can’t control by its very design.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/03/bitgo-ceo-says-wrapped-bitcoins-critics-arent-being-intellectually-honest-about-their-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0268cae9f7a0a088e09d8f3de3d29a9779fa6c4-1051x591.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
33142943,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639574,1725368449,Tron (TRX) Could Face Another Price Drop As Investors Add New Gambling Token,"Tron (TRX) has recently been at the center of attention in the crypto world, especially following some bullish updates from its founder, Justin Sun. However, despite these positive developments, there are signs that TRX might face another price drop as investors start adding a new gambling token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), to their portfolios. With MPEPE’s presale almost reaching completion and promising high returns, the shift in investor sentiment could signal challenges ahead for Tron. TRX’s Recent Surge Driven by Justin Sun’s Updates Several Tron-related meme coins, including Sundog (SUNDOG), have seen a significant rise in their value, largely due to Justin Sun’s recent updates on the Tron network. Sun’s announcements regarding energy cap increases and reduced transaction fees have fueled optimism among TRX investors. In particular, SunPump, a meme coin generator on the Tron blockchain, has been performing exceptionally well, outpacing similar projects on other blockchains like Solana. Sun’s push for launching high-quality NFT projects on Tron has further bolstered the sentiment. He mentioned plans to use NFT trading fees for buybacks and burns, which would support TRX’s deflationary nature and potentially increase its value. These moves have contributed to TRX’s recent price resilience, with the token trading close to its 2021 peak. The Rising Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) Among TRX Investors Despite the positive momentum for Tron (TRX), there’s growing interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new gambling token currently in its presale stage. With the token priced at $0.001777 USDT and nearly 93.02% of the total supply already sold, Mpeppe is quickly gaining traction among investors. The remaining tokens are selling fast, and the price is expected to rise in the next phase. Mpeppe’s appeal lies in its strong community engagement and its potential for high returns, which is drawing in investors who are looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto space. This shift in investment focus could spell trouble for TRX, as more funds flow into Mpeppe. Potential Challenges Ahead for Tron (TRX) While Tron (TRX) has seen positive developments, there are concerns that the ongoing shift towards Mpeppe (MPEPE) could lead to a price decline for TRX. Investors are attracted to Mpeppe’s unique value proposition, which combines the excitement of meme culture with the potential for significant returns, particularly in the gambling sector. Tron’s (TRX) recent performance has been bolstered by factors like revenue growth from SunPump and increased community engagement. However, the entry of Mpeppe into the market presents a new challenge, as it provides an alternative investment with potentially higher rewards. If this trend continues, TRX could experience downward pressure as investors redirect their funds towards Mpeppe. Conclusion: A Shift in Investor Sentiment The cryptocurrency market is known for its rapid changes and shifting investor sentiments. While Tron (TRX) has enjoyed a strong run recently, the growing interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) could lead to a price correction for TRX. As Mpeppe’s presale nears completion and the token prepares to enter the market, investors are likely to continue diversifying their portfolios, potentially at the expense of TRX. For now, it remains to be seen whether Tron can maintain its momentum in the face of this new competition. Investors will need to closely monitor both tokens as the situation evolves, making informed decisions based on the latest market trends and developments.

33142941,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639590,1725368443,Solana (SOL) ETF? SOL Price Faces Challenges Coming Into September Here’s What To Expect,"As we step into September, the cryptocurrency landscape is witnessing dynamic shifts, with Solana (SOL) facing unique challenges and opportunities. The advent of exchange-traded products (ETPs) tailored for Solana (SOL) has introduced new dimensions to the market. However, despite Solana (SOL)’s technological prowess and market appeal, the month ahead presents significant hurdles for the blockchain giant. Meanwhile, new rivals like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are gaining traction, presenting fresh competition in the ever-evolving crypto market. Solana (SOL)’s Rollercoaster: ETP Inflows Amid Price Slumps The past week has been a mixed bag for Solana (SOL). Despite the broader weakness in cryptocurrency prices, Solana (SOL)-based digital asset products have seen notable inflows. According to a report from CoinShares, while the overall crypto market experienced net outflows totaling $305 million, Solana (SOL) bucked the trend with over $7.6 million in inflows into its ETPs. This marks a stark contrast to the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which saw outflows of $319 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Interestingly, this comes at a time when Solana (SOL)’s price has struggled to maintain its footing. On August 30, 2024, SOL hit a low of $133 before rebounding slightly above $130. Despite the price dip, the continued inflows into Solana (SOL) ETPs suggest that investors still believe in the blockchain’s long-term potential, even as short-term challenges persist. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender While Solana (SOL) grapples with market fluctuations, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a formidable new player in the crypto arena. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale stages have seen overwhelming success, with investors flocking to the token, drawn by its unique utility and robust community support. Unlike many new tokens that struggle to find their footing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is already establishing itself as a serious contender, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and gambling sectors. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its strong focus on real-world applications. This is not just another meme coin riding the wave of hype; Mpeppe (MPEPE) is built on solid foundations, offering tangible value to its users. As the cryptocurrency market becomes increasingly competitive, projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) that offer both innovation and utility are likely to stand out, drawing attention away from more established assets like Solana (SOL). The Solana (SOL) ETF Question: Will It Propel or Hinder Growth? One of the most anticipated developments in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem is the potential introduction of Solana (SOL) ETFs. While the idea of a Solana (SOL) ETF has generated significant buzz, it’s important to consider the challenges that lie ahead. The concept of a Solana (SOL) ETF is enticing—allowing investors to gain exposure to SOL without having to purchase the cryptocurrency directly. However, the success of such an ETF would depend heavily on market conditions, regulatory approval, and the overall performance of Solana (SOL)’s blockchain. The recent inflows into Solana (SOL)’s ETPs indicate that there is strong institutional interest in the asset, but this interest could wane if Solana (SOL) fails to address its current price challenges and network issues. What to Expect in September As we move further into September, the crypto market will likely remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors, including interest rate expectations from the U.S. Federal Reserve. CoinShares has pointed out that the negative sentiment in the crypto ETP market last week was largely driven by stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data, which dampened hopes for a 50 basis point rate cut. This kind of environment could continue to exert downward pressure on assets like Solana (SOL), particularly if the market perceives them as overvalued or too risky. For Solana (SOL), maintaining investor confidence will be key. The blockchain’s ability to handle high transaction volumes at low costs remains one of its strongest selling points, but it must continue to innovate and expand its ecosystem to justify its current valuation. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to capitalize on the shifting dynamics of the crypto market. As more investors look for the next big opportunity, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s combination of community-driven growth and practical applications could make it a standout performer in the months to come. Conclusion: A Tale of Two Cryptos In summary, Solana (SOL) faces a critical period as it navigates the complexities of ETP inflows, potential ETF developments, and market volatility. While Solana (SOL)’s underlying technology and ecosystem continue to attract institutional interest, the blockchain giant must overcome significant hurdles to maintain its position in the market. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly emerging as a strong contender, offering a fresh perspective on what a successful cryptocurrency project can look like in 2024. As investors weigh their options, the coming weeks will reveal whether Solana (SOL) can reclaim its momentum or if new challengers like Mpeppe (MPEPE) will rise to the forefront of the crypto world.

Among the many tokens vying for investor attention, Pepecoin (PEPE) has enjoyed its time in the spotlight, leveraging meme culture to drive its initial success. However, as the market evolves and investors grow more sophisticated, questions are being raised about the long-term viability of Pepecoin (PEPE), especially when compared to new, utility-driven projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Pepecoin (PEPE)’s Surge and the Question of Sustainability Pepecoin (PEPE) has become a notable player in the meme coin arena, riding the wave of internet culture to achieve significant gains. Recently, Pepecoin (PEPE) saw a 9.8% surge in just 24 hours, a testament to its strong community support and the viral nature of meme coins. The project’s presale for Crypto All-Stars also raised $600K, promising substantial returns for early backers. However, despite these short-term gains, many analysts are beginning to question whether Pepecoin (PEPE) can sustain this momentum. The challenge for PEPE, like many meme coins, lies in its reliance on hype rather than intrinsic value. While the community-driven aspect of Pepecoin (PEPE) has certainly contributed to its rise, the lack of a clear utility could make it vulnerable to market corrections and investor fatigue. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Gains Machine In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a robust alternative for investors seeking more than just speculative hype. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a “gains machine,” offering a unique blend of utility and community engagement that could provide more sustainable growth compared to Pepecoin (PEPE). What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its focus on gambling utility. The platform allows users to engage in various gambling activities, creating a direct use case for the token. This practical application not only adds value to Mpeppe (MPEPE) but also attracts a broader range of investors who are interested in projects with real-world applications. As more investors flock to Mpeppe (MPEPE), the token’s value is expected to increase, making it a promising option for those looking to maximize their returns. Conclusion As the crypto market matures, investors are increasingly looking for projects that offer more than just hype. Pepecoin (PEPE) may have enjoyed significant gains in the past, but its future remains uncertain without clear utility. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly becoming the go-to choice for investors seeking sustainable growth through practical applications. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s focus on gambling utility, combined with its growing community, positions it as a leader in the next wave of cryptocurrency projects. For those looking to maximize their returns in 2024, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling alternative to Pepecoin (PEPE) and other meme coins, making it a must-watch token in the coming months.

33142938,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639587,1725368421,Solana (SOL) Challenges Paypal? Solana (SOL) Blockchain Development and 100X Moves,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Solana (SOL) has emerged as a formidable force, often hailed as a potential competitor to traditional payment giants like PayPal. With its rapid transaction speeds and low fees, Solana (SOL) is setting new benchmarks in the digital payment landscape. But with new cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE) making waves, the race for dominance in the blockchain ecosystem is more intense than ever. Is Solana (SOL) the Next PayPal? Solana (SOL)’s growth trajectory since its launch in March 2020 has been nothing short of extraordinary. The blockchain platform has delivered returns exceeding 16,000% for its early investors, making it one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in recent history. Despite trading 44% below its all-time high, Solana (SOL) remains a key player in the market, especially with its ongoing innovations aimed at revolutionizing the payment space. Solana (SOL) Pay: A New Frontier in Payments Solana (SOL) Labs, the driving force behind Solana (SOL), introduced Solana (SOL) Pay in early 2022. This blockchain-based payment solution allows merchants and consumers to transact directly, using SOL tokens or stablecoins. Transactions are settled almost instantaneously, with fees amounting to mere fractions of a penny. For businesses operating on thin margins, Solana (SOL) Pay offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional payment processors. Solana (SOL) Pay’s features go beyond simple transactions. The integration of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as digital receipts could pave the way for deeper customer engagement and more personalized shopping experiences. While Solana (SOL) Pay’s current user base of 280,000 accounts may seem modest compared to global giants, it represents a significant step forward in Solana (SOL)’s ambition to dominate the digital payments space. Solana (SOL) vs. Mpeppe: The Battle for Blockchain Supremacy While Solana (SOL) has its sights set on becoming the next PayPal, it faces stiff competition not only from traditional financial institutions but also from emerging cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly gained traction as a community-driven project with a unique blend of utility and innovation, particularly in the DeFi and gambling sectors. Mpeppe’s Rise in the Crypto World Mpeppe (MPEPE) has distinguished itself through its strong community support and innovative tokenomics. Its presales have seen unprecedented success, with each stage selling out rapidly. This strong market interest is a testament to the growing belief in Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) potential to deliver substantial returns for its investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s focus on utility and real-world applications, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) and online gambling, has resonated with a wide audience. This utility-driven approach sets it apart from other meme coins, which often rely solely on community hype for their value. As a result, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting a diverse range of investors, including those who have traditionally supported more established assets like Solana (SOL). The Future of Payments: Solana (SOL) vs. PayPal The comparison between Solana (SOL) and PayPal highlights the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the payments industry. While PayPal remains a dominant player with over 429 million active users and $1.7 trillion in annualized payment volume, Solana (SOL) is rapidly closing the gap. With its superior transaction speed and cost-efficiency, Solana (SOL) is well-positioned to challenge PayPal’s dominance in the long term. However, it’s worth noting that Solana (SOL) still has a long way to go. The platform’s scalability and security have been called into question following several network outages. These issues must be addressed if Solana (SOL) is to realize its full potential as a global payment solution. Conclusion: The Road Ahead As Solana (SOL) continues to develop its blockchain and payment solutions, it will undoubtedly remain a key player in the cryptocurrency market. However, the emergence of innovative projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) suggests that the future of blockchain is not confined to a single platform. Investors looking for the next big opportunity should consider the broader landscape, where both established players like Solana (SOL) and rising stars like Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique value propositions.

This surge comes at a time when Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves of its own, having successfully completed 60% of its presale. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, both established tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and emerging ones like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are drawing the attention of investors. Ethereum (ETH) Faces Turbulent August, But Trading Volume Soars Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has had a challenging August. The token lost nearly 16% of its value over the month, as concerns about a potential economic slowdown in the United States weighed on investor sentiment. This decline has placed Ethereum (ETH) in a precarious position, with its trading range between $2,000 and $3,000 becoming increasingly critical. Despite these challenges, Ethereum (ETH) saw a remarkable 38% increase in trading volume within a 24-hour period. This spike suggests that traders are positioning themselves ahead of potential market moves, particularly with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates. A rate cut in September could provide a much-needed boost to Ethereum (ETH) and other risk assets. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale Gains Momentum While Ethereum (ETH) grapples with market volatility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making significant strides in its presale. Currently in its third stage, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has raised $1,644,349, with 93.02% of stage 3 tokens already sold. The presale’s success underscores the growing interest in Mpeppe, which has quickly become a favorite among investors looking for high-potential projects. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its unique blend of DeFi functionality and meme culture, which resonates with a broad range of investors. With the presale price set to increase from 0.001777 USDT to 0.0021 USDT in the next phase, early investors are seizing the opportunity to secure their positions in what could be one of the next big tokens in the crypto space. Ethereum (ETH)’s Future Hinges on Federal Reserve’s Decision As Ethereum (ETH)’s trading volume surges, the token’s future largely depends on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates. Investors are closely watching the September meeting, where there is currently a 31% chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut. Such a move could spark a rally in Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies, reversing the losses seen in August. Economists are also eyeing the U.S. labor market data, which could influence the Fed’s decision. A stronger-than-expected jobs report could lead to higher interest rates, which might further pressure Ethereum (ETH)’s price. Conversely, signs of economic weakness could prompt the Fed to cut rates, providing a tailwind for ETH. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Continues to Attract Investor Interest Investors are drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach, which combines the fun and viral nature of meme coins with the practical applications of decentralized finance. As the presale progresses, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is likely to attract even more attention, particularly as its price increases in the next phase. Conclusion For investors, the current environment presents opportunities. Those looking to diversify their portfolios may find Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale an attractive option, especially given the token’s potential for growth.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,857.87 +0.73%  Bitcoin (BTC): $59.022 +0.84%  Ether (ETH): $2,506 −0.53%  S&P 500: 5,648.40 +1%  Gold: $2495.38 −0.07%  Nikkei 225: 38,686.31 −0.04%  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose above $59,000, though the rally was pared by suggestions of further interest-rate increases in Japan. Still, BTC remains 1% higher in the last 24 hours while the broader crypto market has risen around 0.9%, according to the CoinDesk20 Index. A slew of U.S. economic data is due this week, kicking off with the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers' index for August later on Tuesday. A weak reading will strengthen the case for the Fed to cut interest rates, which would be expected to boost riskier assets like crypto.  Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated that the central bank will raise interest rates further if the economy and inflation develop as expected. Ueda said the economic environment remains accommodative, with inflation-adjusted interest rates negative even after a late July increase in the benchmark borrowing cost. That was the first in decades and triggered an unwinding of yen carry trades, destabilizing risk assets. Ueda's comments drew bids for the yen, pushing the USD/JPY pair to 145.85 from 147. Futures tied to the S&P 500 slipped by 0.5% and bitcoin by 0.4% to $58,920, according to CoinDesk data. The BOJ's plan to tighten monetary policy poses a challenge for risk assets because the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to start cutting rates in September.  Japanese investment adviser Metaplanet, which adopted bitcoin as a reserve asset earlier this year, tapped SBI VC Trade to provide custody services. Crypto exchange SBI VC Trade, a unit of Tokyo-based SBI Holdings, offers the potential to use BTC as collateral for financing, Metaplanet said on Monday. In May, Metaplanet said it was adopting bitcoin as a reserve asset to hedge against the volatility of the yen. As of Aug. 20, it held 360.4 BTC ($21 million). The reserve-asset strategy mimics software developer MicroStrategy, which has been buying bitcoin since 2020 and now holds over 226,000 BTC, more than 1% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows weekly open-interest adjusted cumulative volume delta (CVD) in the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market value.  XMR and APT have positive CVDs, a sign of net inflows into the perpetual futures market tied to the two coins.  The remaining cryptocurrencies, including BTC, have faced net selling pressure.

42390495,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd28iR,1725364898,Ripple Will Soon Add Ethereum Compatible Smart Contracts to XRP Ledger,"Ripple will add Ethereum-compatible smart contracts via a new sidechain to XRP Ledger, expanding its functionality beyond basic transactions.  This development includes using the Axelar network for cross-chain token transfers, with wrapped XRP (eXRP) acting as the primary token on this sidechain.  Ripple is enhancing the XRP Ledger by integrating Ethereum-compatible smart contracts via a new sidechain, expanding its functionality beyond basic transactions to include complex applications like decentralized exchanges and token issuance.  This development includes the use of the Axelar network for cross-chain token transfers, with Wrapped XRP (eXRP) acting as the primary token on this sidechain, facilitating broader interoperability and developer engagement.  Ripple will soon add Ethereum-compatible smart contracts to the XRP Ledger using sidechain networks in a move that boosts the fundamentals of the closely related XRP token.  Smart contracts are programs that automate the actions required in a blockchain transaction, allowing for features beyond mere transactions, such as issuing tokens, processing trades, and creating decentralized exchanges and financial applications.  “Progress towards smart contract functionality is already underway in the XRP Ledger ecosystem with the XRPL EVM sidechain,” Ripple said in a release Monday. “This sidechain will bring Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to the XRP community, allowing developers to employ familiar tools and programming languages, thereby broadening the XRP Ledger’s appeal to a global developer community.”  XRP Ledger is an open-source blockchain network that uses xrp tokens to process and record financial transactions. Ripple first started testing a way for developers to deploy smart contracts made for Ethereum on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) blockchain in 2022.  Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the software that runs smart contracts on Ethereum. A sidechain is a blockchain that runs parallel to a main blockchain (XRP Ledger in this case).  The XRPL EVM sidechain will use the crypto bridging service Axelar to allow users to transfer tokens between itself and 55 other blockchains.

33141347,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639457,1725364819,Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Surge To $18 In Third Elliott Wave Phase,"In a new technical analysis published on X, crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) is projecting a highly bullish future for the XRP price. He leverages the Elliott Wave Theory to suggest a potential surge to $18.22 in what he anticipates to be the third wave of a major bullish cycle. This analysis is backed by a detailed review of XRP’s price movements, key support levels, and technical indicators on the weekly chart. Why XRP Price Is Poised To Hit $18 The Elliott Wave Theory posits that market prices unfold in specific patterns, referred to as waves. According to this theory, a typical cycle includes five waves, with waves 1, 3, and 5 being impulse waves that move in the direction of the overall trend, and waves 2 and 4 being corrective waves that move against it. The third wave is often the most dynamic and achieves the greatest price distance. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Plunged To $0.55 Analyzing the XRP chart, Dark Defender points out that XRP has completed its first and second waves. The first wave saw a significant upward trend. XRP surged as high as $0.93 in July 2023, followed by a downward correction in the second wave, which is typical in Elliott Wave formations. The second wave brought the XRP price below the $0.39 mark in July 2024, which marked the bottom. The consolidation phase between $0.6649 and $0.3917 ended the corrective phase and set the stage for the anticipated third wave. Notably, the transition into wave 3 aligns with a ‘higher low’ formation on the RSI. A higher low on the RSI during a corrective wave (wave 2) suggests underlying strength and typically precedes a strong upward movement, signaling that the price has maintained higher relative bottoms despite the correction. This formation is seen as a bullish signal by Dark Defender, reinforcing the potential onset of wave 3. Dark Defender’s analysis includes critical Fibonacci extension levels that serve as potential targets and resistance levels in the bull run. The 23.60% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.3917 and the 50.00% at $0.5286 served as significant support during the corrective phase. With the XRP price currently trading around $0.56, the next price target is at $0.6649 (70.20%). Related Reading: XRP Price Recovery Encounters Hurdles: Will It Prevail? These levels are crucial as they represent intermediate resistances that XRP has faced and must surpass to confirm the bullish trend. The $0.6649 level is highlighted by the crypto analyst as particularly significant, marking the upper boundary of past consolidation. “It has been a long time since XRP has been consolidating between $0.6649 & $0.3917. In the weekly time frame, RSI dips formed parallel with the price dips. Weekly RSI golden cross is in place. We have consistently emphasized the importance of the $0.6649 level. This level, which is above the weekly Ichimoku clouds, is a crucial marker that must be in place before the run,” explained Dark Defender via X. As the price progresses, the 100.00% Fibonacci level at $0.9327 represents a full recovery and doubling from some of the lowest recent prices, setting a baseline for the next impulse wave. The extended Fibonacci levels at 161.80% and 261.80%, equating to $1.8815 and $5.8563 respectively, are higher bullish targets that could be reached in a strong market upswing. The ultimate price target for wave 3, represented by the 361.80% level at $18.22, would signify an extraordinary rise, reminiscent of the dramatic gains seen in the 2017 crypto bull market. “We are having a deja vu of 2017 by standing weeks in front of the XRP bull run. If a similar run is in place, $18.22, (NFA) the Fibonacci level of 361.80%, is expected to be the upper target level of wave 3. It will be great to see all these will come through,” concluded Dark Defender. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5672.

The framework includes recognition of smart contracts, licensing for crypto companies, property rights in tokens and custody arrangements among other issues.  Qatar introduced a regime to regulate digital assets, opening the way for companies to obtain licenses as token service providers and help develop the country's digital financial economy.  The Qatar Financial Centre (QFC), which provides legal services for local and international companies, brought in the Digital Asset Regulations 2024 to establish the ""legal and regulatory foundation for digital assets, including the process of tokenization, legal recognition of property rights in tokens and their underlying assets, custody arrangements, transfer, and exchange,"" it said Sunday.  The framework, which also legally recognizes smart contracts, marks a shift from an earlier policy typified by a 2018 ban on crypto. Qatar began a public consultation process last year and regulation was expected by the end of the year.  ""We anticipate that this regulatory clarity will attract both domestic and international players, boosting Qatar’s financial services sector competitiveness,"" said QFC CEO Yousuf Mohamed Al-Jaida.  The regulation is the result of discussions with stakeholders, coordinated through an advisory group of 37 domestic and international organizations. More than 20 startups and fintech firms have taken part in tests that began in October 2023 to help develop the framework.  ""As compared to other Middle Eastern countries, Qatar’s approach is notably advanced, offering a more structured and clear regulatory environment,"" said Navandeep Matta, a senior associate at Kochhar & Co.

33139777,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639450,1725361213,"PEPE Open Interest Plunges 72% From ATH, Is A Recovery Imminent?","When it comes to meme coins, PEPE has undoubtedly been one of the best performers in the last year. The meme coin reached an all-time high after an all-time high in 2024, eventually crossing the $5 billion market cap. The rapid rise in price was followed by a surge in the open interest of the meme coin at the time. However, with time, the open interest has seen a notable decline, both in price and in open interest, but this could be good news for the PEPE meme coin. PEPE Open Interest Down 72% In the middle of 2024, the PEPE price rose quickly as the crypto market rebounded. This rise to new all-time high levels also meant that interest in the meme coin was rising rapidly and the result was the PEPE open interest actually touching a new all-time high of its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decline Not A Cause For Alarm, $100,000 Still In The Cards, Analyst Says According to data from the Coinglass website, in May 2024, the PEPE price rose to its current peak of $0.000017, while the open interest reached a new high of $794.77 million. However, bulls lost momentum at this level as the shooters took over the crypto market. Over the next few months, the PEPE price declined, as did the open interest. By August, the PEPE open interest dropped to levels not seen since April 2024, meaning new 4-month lows. The open interest went from almost $800 million to as low as $215 million. Since then, there has been some recovery in the open interest, but it has remained shaky. The drop to August lows meant that the open interest had fallen as much as 72% from its peak. However, around this time, the PEPE price has fallen only around 55% from its peak, going from $0.000017 to as low as $0.000007. Is This Good News? The drop in open interest in the PEPE meme coin does signal a decline in bullish sentiment among investors. It means that investors are more willing to bet on the price of the meme coin going down rather than going up, which could mean mounting selling pressure on the coin. Related Reading: Road To $5,000: Ethereum Maintains Similarities With 2016 Price Movements However, times like these can often turn out to be bullish for a cryptocurrency’s price. This is because when investors are the most bearish, the odds of a reversal are higher, taking the shorter by surprise. Given how much the open interest has fallen, it would come as no surprise if there was a short squeeze, flushing bears out of the market. If this happens, then the PEPE price could see a quick recovery from here. Naturally, as the open interest begins to rise, so would the price, given their positive correlation so far.

The yen rallied, while BTC and S&P 500 futures registered moderate losses.  BOJ-Fed policy divergence points to continued yen strength and pain for risk assets, including BTC.  Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated that the central bank will raise interest rates further if the economy and inflation develop as expected, according to Bloomberg.  In a document filed with a government panel led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Tuesday, Ueda said the economic environment remains accommodative, with inflation-adjusted interest rates negative even after a late July increase in the benchmark borrowing cost. That was the first in decades and triggered an unwinding of yen carry trades, destabilizing risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Ueda's comments drew bids for the yen, pushing the USD/JPY pair to 145.85 from 147, according to charting platform TradingView. Futures tied to the S&P 500 slipped by 0.5% and bitcoin {{BTC}} by 0.4% to $58,920, according to CoinDesk data.  The BOJ's plan to tighten monetary policy poses a challenge for risk assets because the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to start cutting rates in September and other central banks are expected to do the same in the months ahead.  That means the yen could be solidly bid against most currencies, including the dollar, potentially forcing traders to sell riskier investments and pay back their yen-denominated loans. The unwinding of the so-called yen carry trade rocked the global markets early last month and was partly responsible for BTC's slide to $50,000 from $70,000.  ""The initial positive market reaction [to Fed's impending rate cuts] is justified because investors believe that if money is cheaper, assets priced in fiat dollars of fixed supply should rise,""Arthur Hayes, a co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX and the chief investment officer at Maelstrom, wrote in a recent blog post. ""I agree; however … we are forgetting that these future anticipated rate cuts by the Fed, BOE, and ECB reduce the interest rate differential between these currencies and the yen.""  ""The danger of the yen carry trade unwind will reappear and could derail the party unless 'real food' in the form of central bank balance sheet expansion, aka money printing, raises the quantity of money,"" Hayes said.  Interest rates in Japan were stuck at zero for over two decades, leading investors to borrow yen and invest in high-yielding assets.

33138147,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639358,1725357647,"FET Price Targets $3.4 After Breakout, Here Are The Key Levels To Watch","The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has seen a remarkable performance in the last two weeks. Amid the latest market shakeouts, the AI crypto token saw a significant increase, surging over 60% a week ago. In the last 24 hours, the token has recorded a 4% price surge, retesting a crucial resistance level that could propel the price near its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Price Action Signals 30% Crash After Losing A Key Level FET Sees 30% Monthly Surge FET showed a formidable price action throughout August despite the market retraces, seeing a 30% surge in the last 30 days. The ASI alliance token saw a 49% increase in the past two weeks and recovered above pre-Black Monday levels during this timeframe. Additionally, it saw a massive surge in trading volume, price, and whale activity a week ago when the FET’s on-chain developments fueled the bullish momentum by over 60%. The drive pushed the cryptocurrency’s price to a high of $1.46 on Tuesday, a level not seen since mid-July. Nonetheless, the market jitters halted FET’s rally, sending the price to a biweekly low of $1.06. The token retested the $1.20 resistance level over the weekend, unsuccessfully reclaiming it but holding above the $1.10 price range. This performance has been highlighted by several market watchers, who noted that the token has held effectively above the $1.17 support level. This level was retested and maintained since late February when the token’s leg up drove the price to its March ATH of $3.45 but was lost as July closed. Analysts Suggest Key Levels To Watch Some market watchers noted that FET recently broke out of crucial horizontal levels. The token has been in a multi-month falling wedge pattern and registered multiple touchpoints within the upper and lower trendlines. According to Crypto Yapper, some key horizontal levels have come into play in the past month. The token bounced from the “huge” $0.8 support area a few weeks ago. This level was deemed an “interesting accumulation zone” by the analyst. Since then, FET has seen a significant jump, breaking out of the falling wedge pattern. Following the breakout, it has attempted to turn the next horizontal resistance level into a support zone. Per the analyst, if the $1.17 level holds strong, the cryptocurrency could move to the next big resistance in the $1.7 area. “Then we can continue the bullish uptrend, and eventually, the top side of the formation will be confluent with the breakout target, which will be around $3.4,” he further explained. Conversely, other analysts have cautioned that the token remains in a bearish market structure. According to Altcoin Sherpa, FET is attempting to form a higher low, which will need to be followed by a higher high to continue the uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Continued Selling Pressure Amid Market Volatility, Here’s Why To Sherpa, if the token achieves this, it will have “bottomed in the short term.” Additionally, he set the $1.5 price zone as a “super key level” for further bullish price action. FET hovered between the $1.1-$1.21 price range in the last 24 hours, holding above the key support level throughout Monday morning. As of this writing, the token is trading at $1.2, a 4% daily surge.

The first event is a 180-day 'wait period' where Bitcoin attempted to reclaim its previous all-time high before claiming new ATHs in the subsequent 180-day window. The second event is a bullish signal indicated by the Coppock Curve within the first 180-day 'wait period' when Bitcoin attempted to reclaim its previous ATH. The current cycle differs from past cycles in which the current bull market occurred without the price bouncing off the Halving Cycle support level. Nevertheless, we think that the bull market remains intact, and we're positioning for a bullish bias when the 2 aforementioned events occur. Introduction It is great to be back here at Seeking Alpha to share our outlook on Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) as we're now in what we consider the Bitcoin bull market. Considering how Bitcoin failed to initiate a runaway bull run past the $70,000 ATH from the past cycle after the highly anticipated halving event back in April 2024, we believe that many avid followers of Bitcoin are left wondering whether a bull run would come at all. Fortunately, we can say that Bitcoin's current performance still aligns with the decade-old Halving Cycle that we know today. In this article, we aim to show you 2 very important events that should occur before we expect a bull run. Background Before we discuss the 2 important events, we should outline our current findings, assumptions, and expectations for the current bull market. This is so that you can grasp the degree of conservatism/aggression we have for the Bitcoin market. This was our outlook: Any runaway bull market will probably mark the end of the decade-old Bitcoin halving cycle as we know it. This is because the current Bitcoin Halving Cycle could not account for price movements beyond the $100,000 price level (Fig 1). Nevertheless, some observations suggest that this bull market could peak at about the same $100,000 price level. Fig 1. Bitcoin's Decade-old Halving Cycle Cannot Project Prices Beyond the $100,000 Price Level (TradingView) In our most recent article on Bitcoin at the beginning of the year, we showed that Bitcoin's so-called ""100x bull run"" could be behind us. We observed that the magnitude of returns diminishes over each cycle. The first bull cycle saw a 100x return (from $12 to $1,200), then a 32x return (from $600 to $19,000) in 2016's bull run, then an 8x return (from about $8,500 to $70,000) in 2020's bull run. Extrapolating the observation suggests the current bull market will conservatively produce a 2x to 3x bull run, which is still pretty good. Side note: You could still magnify returns (and risk) to obtain a similar level of return as past Bitcoin bull markets through Bitcoin miners or options on ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). For instance, our latest pick Iris Energy ( IREN ) gained as much as 3x when we expressed we changed our outlook from very bearish to bullish (unfortunately, the article could not get through the editorial process). Our BITO call position (at $13-strike, $3.90 premium) also produced a peak return of 5x from Oct 2023 to March 2024. Hence, all things considered, Bitcoin's 2x to 3x return isn't that pessimistic, but it does suggest undertaking more risk for the same level of return. Therefore, what we're trying to express is that the term 'bull run' used in this article refers to an expected ~2x return from today's Bitcoin price ($57,000 -> $100,000). This implies that the $100,000 will also be the price level where we hope to liquidate our miner positions (if any) and BITO positions. We're not going to touch our Bitcoin position as it is currently staked. Since the beginning of this year, we've also started looking at other 'traditional' and less exciting sectors to allocate our gains (you should've seen how badly we screwed up with our position on Unity Software ( U ) if not for Bitcoin, hah!). The 2 events Bitcoin’s Bull Run Could Be Waiting On As the title of this article suggests, the 2 events we're waiting on are Time and a bullish signal on the Coppock Curve . The time variable plays an incredibly significant role in Bitcoin's Halving Cycle. A Bitcoin cycle typically lasts for 4 years, consisting of a 1-year bull market, a 1-year bear market, and a 2-year recovery phase (fig 1). There are also distinctive patterns within each stage, including the bull market. Referring back to Fig 1, it is observable that Bitcoin takes roughly 5 to 6 months after the halving event to regain its ATH from its cyclical lows. Then Bitcoin typically spends another 6 months reaching for new ATHs. So when will we see a bull run beyond the previous cycle's ATH? The answer is about 160 to 180 days after the halving event, and we are actually approaching the end of the 180-day wait. 27th September 2024 and 17th October 2024 mark the 160th day and the 180th day after the halving event. During this period, we should see Bitcoin forming bullish technical signals all around the chart. Among these indicators, we put most of our emphasis on the Coppock Curve, given its more recent historical record in both the stock market and Bitcoin. The Coppock Curve is a momentum indicator that was developed in the early 1960s by Edwin Coppock. It is primarily used to identify bullish reversals during stock market cycles. The Coppock Curve is calculated as a 10-period (usually monthly) weighted moving average of the sum of an asset's 14-period and 11-period rate of change. In simpler terms, rather than computing a moving average of price , the Coppock Curve computes the weighted moving average of the rate of change in price over two specific time periods. The Coppock Curve oscillates between negative and positive values. When the Coppock Curve crossovers from negative to positive, we interpret it as a bullish reversal signal. We mark the ""0.00"" level in yellow for easier reference. In the stock market, it managed to provide credible bullish reversal signals coming out of major crises such as in 2008, 2016, and 2020 (Fig 2). For Bitcoin, it successfully signaled the beginning of every bullish reversal (since the first 100x bull market in 2012) and the signals occurred in both the 1-year bull market periods and the 2-year recovery period (Fig 3). Fig 2. The Coppock Curve managed to predict bullish reversals coming out of the crisis in 2008, 2016, and 2020. (TradingView, Author) Fig 3. The Coppock Curve managed to signal bullish reversals in past bull markets and recovery phases ever since the 100x bull run in 2012. (TradingView, Author) The Coppock Curve by itself is not perfect. Note that in both the S&P ( SPY ) (marked in red circle) and Bitcoin's case, the Coppock Curve does signal fake-outs (as do other trend-following indicators). However, in the right context, we can greatly reduce the probability of those fake-outs. Lately, one of our team members welcomed a new addition to the family, so we'll use that member's analogy. Understanding what a baby's cry meant is a pain! I had no idea what the baby wanted whenever she cried! Her cry could mean anything! Time for diaper change, hunger, too hot, too cold, unable to sleep, etc. People's advise are not useful because every baby could be different. I had to put my stock market experience to work. I tried to find 'signals' and define the context whenever the baby cried. Eventually I found out that the baby's cry meant ""hunger"" if the cry occur between 2 to 3 hours after the last feeding. - A team member of Made Easy - Finance The moral of the story is that no indicators are perfect, and indicators have to be used in the right context to work. Context is the keyword. Bitcoin's case (Fig 3), all instances, where the Coppock Curve successfully signaled a bullish reversal, coincided with 2 events. The signals occurred in one of the bullish stages in the Bitcoin Halving Cycle (the 1-year bull market, and the 2-year recovery phase). Particularly for the bull market, it occurred within the 180-day wait period. The signals also occurred when Bitcoin bounced off the Bitcoin Halving Cycle support. This price action provided the signals with a high level of credibility, given that there are only a few instances where Bitcoin broke below that support. Here's also where it gets tricky for the current bull market: Although the Coppock Curve bullish signal may still occur within the 180-day wait period, it looks quite difficult for the signal to occur where the Bitcoin price is near the Bitcoin Halving Cycle support. We felt that the optimism that came from the potential of Bitcoin Spot ETF approvals (in the US) in mid-2023 and the eventual approval of Bitcoin Spot ETF (in the US) at the beginning of 2024 caused Bitcoin to 'front-run' its original trajectory. Even though this setup may not be perfect, we can still use the 180-day wait period as a confirmation. If Bitcoin recovers back to $70,000 before 17th October and the Coppock Curve signals the bullish signal (bullish signal = signal line cross up from 0, refer to Fig 2 and Fig 3), we'll assume a bullish bias to our trades related to Bitcoin. Verdict We strongly believe in the long-term prospects of Bitcoin based on its design (decentralized, limited supply, etc.) and the utilities that are derived from its design. We also believe that one can outperform the 'market' (which is HODLing Bitcoin) by tilting one's crypto portfolio (Bitcoin, altcoins, miners, futures, etc.) based on the biases one has for the crypto market for a given period. In this article, we presented how we establish our bullish bias on 2 events: the 180-day wait period and the Coppock Curve. We have also prepared theses for several Bitcoin miners in preparation for this bullish bias. We can't wait to share them with you as soon as possible. We hope that by sharing our 'story' for Bitcoin, we can hear yours as well. ""Go fast, go alone; Go far, go together."" Let's go at it together.

33136385,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639330,1725354019,Bullish Alert For Dogecoin: TD Indicator Flashes Buy Signal As $0.10 Target Looms,"The broader cryptocurrency market has endured significant corrections over the past six months, primarily driven by the two largest digital currencies: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Dogecoin (DOGE), the leading meme coin, has not escaped this trend, experiencing a marked decline in value. Dogecoin Price Faces 55% Decline Since March High Since reaching a yearly high of $0.22 in March, DOGE has suffered a substantial drop of 55.9%, currently trading at approximately $0.0976. This decline is even more pronounced over longer time frames; according to CoinGecko data, Dogecoin is now 86% lower than its all-time high of $0.73 recorded in May 2021. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Price Action Signals 30% Crash After Losing A Key Level In the short term, Dogecoin has been underperforming compared to the overall crypto market, which has seen a 6.90% drop over the past week. During the same period, DOGE’s price fell by 8.8%, further illustrating its struggles. However, there are emerging bullish signs that could pave the way for a recovery. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently pointed out a bullish divergence forming on Dogecoin’s 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI). In addition, the analyst noted that the Tom Demark Sequential 9 (TD) indicator is flashing a buy signal, suggesting that a price rebound may be on the horizon. Can DOGE Break Through $0.10? As outlined by the analyst, these indicators suggest that the Dogecoin price could potentially surge above its current trading levels, with the $0.10 mark being a critical milestone not seen since August 24. Achieving this level would signify a successful recovery of the token’s 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), which coincides with the $0.10 price point. However, if bullish momentum fails to materialize, there is a risk of a failed attempt to reclaim this key resistance. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Down Today? Key Reasons Explained Should DOGE successfully surpass the $0.10 threshold, bulls will then need to focus on the next significant hurdle at $0.107. This level is crucial for any further attempts to climb higher and tackle the next EMA. If Dogecoin can navigate this resistance, it may be poised to retest the 200-day moving average at $0.11. A successful breakthrough at this level could signal a continuation of the recovery, potentially pushing DOGE toward the next resistance level of $0.13 on its DOGE/USDT daily chart. Conversely, for the past almost four weeks, the Dogecoin price has found a significant support floor at $0.094, which prevented the token from crashing towards $0.080 again last week, as it did during the broader market crash on August 5. What is certain is that despite these signals, bullish momentum is much needed for the coin to push higher resistance and consolidate above its previous support levels to continue on its path to retest the yearly highs.

Analyst Warns Of Surging Exchange Reserves,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been under significant pressure in recent weeks. As its price continues to fluctuate, analysts have been observing its market signals to determine whether the current phase is one of accumulation or distribution. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Shayan, the Ethereum exchange reserve metric, which tracks the amount of ETH held in exchange wallets, is providing insights into this question. Related Reading: Is Ethereum’s Price Under Pressure? Here Is What Futures Data Signals What Does The Ethereum Exchange Reserve Currently Signals? Shayan disclosed in the analysis shared in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform that the Ethereum exchange reserve metric has shown a notable upward trend between June and August, indicating a distribution phase that has contributed to the ongoing bearish trend. This metric is particularly noteworthy given that coins held on exchanges are often considered ready for sale, which can lead to increased selling pressure. According to Shayan, the recent “death cross” on Ethereum’s price chart, where the 100-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average, has raised further concerns. Following this technical signal, the exchange reserve metric has risen sharply, suggesting that another distribution phase may be unfolding. The analyst noted that this increase in reserves on exchanges could point to a potential decrease in demand for Ethereum, which might lead to further price declines. However, Shayan noted that the state of the futures market, a critical factor in price determination, must also be analyzed before making “definitive conclusions.” Exchange Reserves Signal New Distribution Phase Amidst Death Cross Concerns “Ethereum reserves on exchanges continue to grow, the likelihood of a decrease in demand—and consequently, a further price decline—also increases.” – By @ShayanBTC7 Link 👇https://t.co/HKaeDBsss3 pic.twitter.com/K6mMDmtnBH — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) September 2, 2024 Ethereum’s Price Action and Market Sentiment Despite the concerning signals from the exchange reserve metric, Ethereum has managed to stage a modest recovery over the past day. The cryptocurrency has seen a 2.2% increase, bringing its current trading price to $2,515 at the time of writing. However, this uptick does little to offset the 7% decline Ethereum has experienced over the past week. Renowned crypto analyst CrediBull, commenting on Ethereum’s recent price action, emphasized that the situation is still evolving. He noted: Nothing has really changed on ETH here. We went a bit lower, but OI has simply decreased even more, funding is negative, and we are simply back at our local lows. CrediBull suggests that Ethereum might sweep the lows into local demand before forming a deviation and potentially moving higher.

33134047,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639414,1725348649,Bitcoin Price Prediction: VanEck Envisions $2.9 Million BTC By 2050,"Amid ongoing volatility for the Bitcoin price, which has struggled to reclaim its all-time high of $73,700, bullish predictions continue to emerge for the leading cryptocurrency. The latest forecast comes from VanEck, asset manager and Bitcoin ETF issuer with over $100 billion in assets under management. Bitcoin Price Projection In a recent update, VanEck projected that by 2050, the Bitcoin price could solidify its position as a key international medium of exchange, potentially becoming one of the world’s reserve currencies. This assertion is rooted in the anticipated decline in trust in current reserve assets, prompting a shift toward more stable alternatives like Bitcoin. One of the primary barriers to Bitcoin’s widespread adoption has been its scalability issues. However, VanEck anticipates that these challenges will be addressed through the development of Layer-2 (L2) solutions, which enhance Bitcoin’s functionality and efficiency. By combining Bitcoin’s immutable property rights with the advanced features of L2 solutions, VanEck envisions a global financial system better equipped to meet the needs of the developing world. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ends August Down 8%: What To Expect From Historically Bearish September With this in mind, the firm believes that by 2050, Bitcoin could be used to settle 10% of international trade and 5% of domestic transactions, leading to central banks potentially holding 2.5% of their assets in BTC. Based on projections of global economic growth, BTC demand and turnover, VanEck estimates a potential price of $2.9 million per Bitcoin, which translates to a total market capitalization of approximately $61 trillion. This forecast incorporates assumptions about the global trade landscape, with trade growth expected to lag behind overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth—projected at 2% versus 3%. Moreover, VanEck anticipates a market share decline for traditional currencies, such as the US dollar and the Euro, due to deteriorating economic fundamentals, which would allow Bitcoin and other emerging currencies to gain traction. Store Of Value Potential From a medium-of-exchange perspective, VanEck suggests that Bitcoin could capture 10% of cross-border payments and 5% of domestic trade. The firm also highlights that as Bitcoin becomes increasingly recognized as a store of value, approximately 85% of the circulating supply may be effectively removed from the market, further driving its value. The analysis reflects a broader trend of the Bitcoin price correlation with traditional risk assets, suggesting that its movements will remain closely linked to macroeconomic conditions. Related Reading: SUI Crashes 23% As September Unleashes Market Panic—Is A Comeback Possible? As the global economy evolves, VanEck predicts that Bitcoin will become an essential component of the International Monetary System, gaining market share from existing reserve currencies. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $59,140, up 3% in the last few hours after rebounding from a drop towards $57,000 on Monday.

Amongst them, a renowned crypto analyst known as Mags on X has recently shared an insightful perspective on Bitcoin’s current market behavior in one of his latest posts. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Momentum at Risk? NVT Golden Cross Sends Warning Signals Is Bitcoin Primed For A September Rally? Mags pointed out that Bitcoin has been in a long consolidation phase since March and is now entering its seventh month. He drew a parallel to a similar pattern observed last year, where Bitcoin also began its consolidation in March, only to start recovering by September. According to Mags, over the following seven months, Bitcoin experienced a 195% increase in price. So far, this historical pattern has raised whether September will again serve as a pivotal month for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin – september is a bearish month ?

But what if I told you we saw a similar pattern last year? Back then, the consolidation… pic.twitter.com/8PJ8MMNEUR — Mags (@thescalpingpro) September 2, 2024 Bitcoin is showing signs of a bearish trend, having fallen below the psychological $60,000 level. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has seen a 9.9% decline. However, there seems to be a slight recovery in progress, with BTC currently trading at $58,411, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours. Next Moves Expected From BTC In response to Bitcoin’s recent price action, prominent crypto analyst Captain Faibik offered his outlook, suggesting that BTC is still moving within a bullish flag pattern. According to Faibik, there is a possibility that Bitcoin may test the $54,000 support area once again. He emphasized the importance of bulls defending this level, as a bounce back from $54,000 could potentially lead to a rally up to $68,000 in September. This scenario aligns with Mags’ theory that September could be a turning point for Bitcoin, mirroring last year’s price recovery. Adding to the discussion, another well-known analyst, Willy Woo, provided insights on the supply dynamics affecting Bitcoin’s price. Woo noted that the influx of BTC from sources such as Germany’s Mt. Gox and the US Department of Justice is gradually being “absorbed” by the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Breakout Blueprint: Analyst Reveals Roadmap For Imminent Surge He also observed that paper BTC bets are declining, which he interprets as a positive sign.

The price must settle above the $4.35 and $4.50 resistance levels to start a decent increase. DOT declined steadily below the $5.50 and $5.00 levels against the US Dollar. The price is trading below the $5.00 zone and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $4.18 on the hourly chart of the DOT/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $4.35 and then $4.50. Polkadot Price Remains In The Red Zone In the past few weeks, DOT price saw a steady decline from well above $6.50. Bitcoin and Ethereum were stable, but Polkadot remained in the red zone. There was a close below the $5.00 level. Finally, the price tested the $4.00 zone. A low was formed at $4.03 and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $4.10 and $4.15 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4.65 swing high to the $4.03 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $4.18 on the hourly chart of the DOT/USD pair. DOT is now trading below the $4.50 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $4.30 level. The next major resistance is near $4.35 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4.65 swing high to the $4.03 low. A successful break above $4.35 could start another strong rally. In the stated case, the price could easily rally toward $4.50 in the near term. The next major resistance is seen near the $5.00 zone. Another Decline in DOT? If DOT price fails to start a fresh increase above $4.35, it could start another decline. The first key support is near the $4.15 level. The next major support is near the $4.10, below which the price might decline to $4.00. Any more losses may perhaps open the doors for a move toward the $3.85 support zone or $3.60.

33130016,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639283,1725339634,"Bitcoin Needs To Break $70,000 For The Uptrend To Continue, Here’s Why","Bitcoin traders are upbeat, expecting prices to shake off recent weakness and soar above the local resistances to as high as $73,800. Even so, before the coin breaks above these liquidation regions, buyers must have conviction. Moreover, the leg up must be sustained by a fresh influx of new capital, ideally from investors fearing they will miss the train. Currently, Bitcoin is stable and moving inside last week’s bear range. At the same time, the coin is moving inside the September 1 bear candlestick that’s noticeably wide-ranging. Even though prices are higher at spot rates, finding support from the $56,500 and $57,000 support zone, some traders are not convinced. Bitcoin Needs To Break $70,000 For The Uptrend To Continue There are several reasons to be cautious. According to IntoTheBlock data, bulls need to be supported for the uptrend of Q1 2024 to continue. From their data, approximately seven million addresses bought BTC between $61,700 and $70,500. Related Reading: Ripple Unleashes 1 Billion XRP: Could This Trigger A Price Tsunami? At spot rates, the analytics platform notes that these addresses are at a loss. Therefore, whenever prices approaches their break even price, they are more likely to sell. Their sustained selling pressure and motivation to be safe, IntoTheBlock data analysts said, prevents BTC from ripping higher, soaring to all-time highs. In light of this, and for Bitcoin to soar, bulls need to sustain the rally above $60,000. Moreover, they need to decisively break $70,000, ideally with expanding volume. If anything, the level of engagement should exceed the trading volume posted on August 5. Then, prices slumped to as low as $49,000 in early August. Over 30% Of All Supply In The Hands Of HODLers, Paper BTC Declining While there is a likelihood that the nearly seven million addresses will dump BTC, a significant portion of BTC supply is in the hands of long-term holders (LTHs). LTHs are those addresses that have held BTC for at least 155 days. According to IntoTheBlock data, over 30% of the total supply has not been moved for over five years. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Down Today? Key Reasons Explained Meanwhile, another bullish factor that can support prices in the coming days is how the market has been absorbing supply from German authorities, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ), and Mt. Gox. One on-chain analyst notes that the absorption is impressive. This development, coupled with declining “paper” BTC from derivative platforms like Binance, could support prices.

33127535,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639317,1725334201,"Road To $5,000: Ethereum Maintains Similarities With 2016 Price Movements","The Ethereum price action has significantly underperformed traders’ expectations over the past few months. Ethereum is currently trapped in a bearish trend, with its price now down by 23% over a 30-day period. This downturn contrasts sharply with the hopes of many ETH investors who have been anticipating a bullish surge following the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs. However, technical analysis suggests that Ethereum’s recent performance is not unusual for the cryptocurrency, as it appears to be mirroring a similar pattern observed in 2016. Ethereum Maintains Similarities With 2016 Price Movements Despite the price concerns, a deeper look into Ethereum’s historical price movements suggests that the current situation might not be as unfamiliar as it seems. According to an ongoing analysis by popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Ethereum’s price action in 2024 closely mirrors its performance in 2016 when viewed on the monthly candlestick chart. This pattern of repetition became even more apparent after August 2024 concluded with Ethereum closing on a bearish candle, mirroring the same outcome in August 2016. Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes Massive Bull Surge As Metrics Turn Green Isolated, this would’ve probably not meant anything. However, as Cowen has highlighted, this pattern has been consistent throughout 2024, dating back to January. Interestingly, Ethereum has closed monthly candlesticks the same way as in 2016 for eight months in a row. As such, this could give an idea of how Ethereum could continue to play out for the rest of the year. #ETH / #USD monthly candles continue to track 2016 perfectly. If it continues to play out, it would suggest #ETH is green in September, and then red Oct-Dec. Then in 2025 #ETH turns green for a while pic.twitter.com/G8WtDwQlWY — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 21, 2024 Back in 2016, Ethereum eventually went on a massive 19,000% rally, which saw it reach $1,590 for the first time. If this continues to play out like in 2016, investors can look towards a green monthly close for Ethereum in September and then three consecutive bearish months from October to December. If this price action repetition continues after December 2024, Ethereum will eventually go on a notable price rally above its current all-time high. This would push fervent Ethereum bulls into the much-needed profitability they’ve been anticipating. Road To $5,000? At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,445, a decline of 10.85% over the past seven days and 23% over the past 30 days. If the current trend continues to mirror the 2016 pattern, Ethereum’s bearish momentum might persist throughout the remainder of the year. However, not all hope is lost for Ethereum bulls, as the cryptocurrency is currently hovering around a critical support level that could trigger a rebound upwards. Related Reading: Crypto Market In Trouble As Analyst Predicts $1 Trillion Crash Ethereum’s price is at a crucial support level, specifically at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, just above $2,400. A significant bounce from this level could signal the start of an upward trend, leading to a close above its monthly open by the end of September. An ETH surge above $3,000 into $4,000, and subsequently, $5,000 is still in the books.

ETH must clear $2,550 to continue higher in the near term. Ethereum started a decent recovery wave above the $2,450 level. The price is trading above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,485 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must stay above $2,500 to start another increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Starts Recovery Ethereum price extended losses below the $2,500 level. ETH even tested the $2,400 support before the bulls appeared. The price started a recovery wave above the $2,450 level like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $2,480 and $2,500 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,595 swing high to the $2,400 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,485 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,550 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,595 swing high to the $2,400 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. A close above the $2,600 level might send Ether toward the $2,650 resistance. The next key resistance is near $2,720. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might send the price higher toward the $2,800 resistance zone in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $2,495. The first major support sits near the $2,450 zone. A clear move below the $2,450 support might push the price toward $2,400 where the bulls could emerge. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 support level in the near term.

In a video uploaded to X (formerly Twitter) on Monday afternoon, a distressed Gambaryan pleads with a prison guard escorting him into the courtroom for help walking.  ""I'm not okay, this is f*cked up,"" Gambaryan said in the video, as he clutched the guard's wrist for support. When the guard stepped away, leaving Gambaryan with only a single crutch to lean on, Gambaryan turned to a small crowd of onlookers and said:  ""He was told not to help me. He said there's instruction – this is f*cked up. Why couldn't I use a goddamn wheelchair? This is a show. I'm a f*cking innocent person. Why are you doing this to me?""  After several visibly painful steps, Gambaryan reached again for the guard's arm for support, but the guard snatched his arm away, telling Gambaryan: ""Don't hold me, please. You can walk.""  ""I can't f*cking walk, my spine is – this is f*cked up. I'm a f*cking human,"" Gambaryan said in the video. ""I'm not f*cking okay.""  Gambaryan's lawyers filed a new application for bail on medical grounds on Monday, urging the judge to release him so he can receive medical care for conditions he has developed in prison, including malaria, pneumonia, tonsillitis, and complications from a herniated disc in his back – the latter of which has left him in severe pain and nearly unable to walk, according to a spokesperson for his family.  A prosecutor for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) – the entity prosecuting Gambaryan for money laundering – reportedly opposed the bail application, arguing that Gambaryan was not, in fact, in ill health and claiming he was refusing treatment.  Gambaryan's previous bail application was denied in May.  Authorities of Kuje prison, where Gambaryan has been held since March, have previously refused to turn over Gambaryan's health records but, according to a family spokesperson, some of his records were given to the court during Monday's bail hearing. The medical records indicate a need for immediate surgery, the spokesperson said, but ""key elements of the record including an MRI scan were missing.""  In addition to being denied adequate medical care, Gambaryan has also been denied proper access to his lawyers and U.S. embassy staff, the spokesperson said.  ""This situation is entirely unjust,"" Gambaryan's wife Yuki said in a statement. ""The U.S. Government must do more to help Tigran. I urge them to use every available tool to free an innocent American who is at risk of permanent damage…This entire situation is inhumane and degrading, and I am fed up. There must be consequences for this disregard of law and human rights.""  Read more: 'My Living Nightmare': Detained Binance Exec's Wife Begs For His Immediate Release  Scapegoat for Binance  Gambaryan, a former U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent and Binance's head of financial crime compliance, was detained in Abuja seven months ago, shortly after voluntarily traveling to Nigeria's capital city at the government's invitation.  At first, Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance's regional manager for Africa and a dual Kenyan-British national, were placed under house arrest. But when Anjarwalla escaped under mysterious circumstances in March, Gambaryan was transferred to the notoriously dangerous Kuje prison and charged with tax evasion and money laundering – seemingly as a scapegoat for his employer, which Nigerian officials have accused, without evidence, of tanking the value of the national currency, the naira.  The tax evasion charges were later dropped, but Gambaryan's money laundering trial has been ongoing since June. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.  So far, the U.S. government has failed to make any public statement about Gambaryan's situation. The State Department told CoinDesk it was ""aware of reports"" of his detention in March, but did not mention Gambaryan by name.

The hacker started moving nearly $4 million worth of ether to obscure the transaction trail.  WazirX is undergoing restructuring after the hack and customers are expected to recover only 55%-57% of their funds.  The hacker entity that stole over $230 million in user assets from Indian crypto exchange WazirX started to move funds using Tornado Cash early Tuesday, beginning a move that allows them to obfuscate the trail of funds.  Tornado Cash allows crypto users to exchange tokens while masking wallet addresses on various blockchains. The service, by itself, is not nefarious but is commonly used by crypto criminals to clean an online trail that could lead to the identity of those moving stolen funds.  The attacker moved nearly $4 million worth of ether {{ETH}} in 16 transactions on the Ethereum network, data tracked by Arkham shows, to a Tornado Cash router. The address holds over $155 million worth of various tokens - with a majority in ether at $150 million - and has previously not moved any funds to Tornado.  In July, WazirX was hit by a security breach in one of its multisig wallets, causing over $100 million in shiba inu (SHIB) and $52 million in ether, among other assets, drained from the exchange.  The stolen funds accounted for over 45% of the total reserves cited by the exchange in a June 2024 report – and the exchange has since filed for a restructuring process to clear liabilities.  WazirX’s legal advisers said on Monday that customers are unlikely to be made whole in crypto terms, with the best-case scenario being a return of anywhere between 55% and 57% of the funds.

Speaking on a conference call with journalists, George Gwee, a director at restructuring firm Kroll, that is helping WazirX with its restructuring, stated that at least 43% of the funds any user had in WazirX are unlikely to be recovered. Gwee added that the recovery might be “anywhere between 55% and 57% of the funds in an optimistic scenario.” For those unfamiliar, a restructuring typically follows a severe incident at an organization to reorganize its operations, finances, and governance. In WazirX’s case, the restructuring aims to distribute the remaining digital assets pro-rata to the affected users. Without delving too much into detail, the exchange hinted at discussions to share profits from its revenue-generating products and services. Jason Kardachi, managing director at Kroll, noted: In crypto terms, it’s extremely unlikely that we can make people whole. So, whatever profits we generate or contributions from white knights or third parties can help improve the recovery in crypto terms. But I don’t think it’s realistic to think that we could ever make people whole when half or thereabouts of the crypto has suffered from the cyber attack. However, Kardashi offered a glimmer of hope, saying that if the overall crypto market improves, users may recover more of their lost investment in dollar terms. WazirX’s hack is, by far, the largest cryptocurrency exchange hack in India. Since the hack, the company has undertaken various measures, some unsuccessfully, to compensate users who lost their funds stored on the exchange. One such measure was the proposal to socialize the loss or the “55/45 approach”, which suggested that all users, regardless of whether they were affected by the hack, could only trade 55% of their tokens. In contrast, the remaining 45% would be converted into stablecoins and locked in the exchange. Predictably, the proposal generated massive backlash within the Indian crypto community, forcing WazirX to abandon distributing user losses. A look at the WRX token chart summarizes the exchange’s tumultuous journey since the hack. Since March 2024, when the token approached $0.37, it has been on a downward trajectory, hitting as low as $0.12 immediately following the theft. What Lies Ahead For India’s Crypto Ecosystem? Although the WazirX mishap has sent tremors across India’s nascent crypto industry, the country’s high user participation still holds the potential to establish it as one of the most influential crypto markets in the world. However, several hurdles must be overcome before India can hope to become a superpower in the global crypto ecosystem. For instance, the stringent tax regulations regarding crypto transactions in the country deter retail investors and traders from participating in the industry.

Here’s what it could imply for the cryptocurrency’s price. Bitcoin Inventory On Exchanges Has Seen A Drawdown Recently In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed the latest trend in the Bitcoin inventory sitting on centralized exchanges. Such platforms have two types of reserves: Spot BTC and Paper BTC. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Down Today? Key Reasons Explained The former of these is simply the actual tokens that the exchanges are holding on behalf of their users. This BTC naturally gets involved in normal trading activities. Paper BTC refers to the derivatives products related to the cryptocurrency that don’t involve the investors owning any BTC. This form of the asset wasn’t relevant to the market for much of BTC’s history, but in recent years, derivatives trading has gained popularity. So, the influence of Paper BTC has become notable. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the Bitcoin inventory on exchanges has changed over the last few years. As is visible in the graph, the combined Paper and Spot Bitcoin inventory had been on the rise earlier. The peak of this upward trajectory coincided with the asset’s crash under the $50,000 level last month. The exchange inventory going up has usually been bearish for the cryptocurrency, so this trend wasn’t surprising. After the plunge in the coin’s price, the metric had also seen a plummet and it was perhaps because of this reduction in the exchange inventory that the asset could recover. In the chart, Woo has also separately attached the data for the Spot BTC (bottom-most curve). This indicator makes it apparent which side was behind the exchange inventory increase witnessed earlier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dogs Listing on Major Exchanges: 1000X Buy Pressure Incoming? Initially, the spot supply was also on the way up alongside the total exchange inventory. Still, midway through, the former fell to sideways movement while the latter kept rising. Thus, it would appear that the main increase in the exchange inventory leading up to the price crash was contributed by the printing of Paper BTC. Similarly, Paper BTC has destabilized the market in the past as well, with its influence at its peak just before the FTX crash in November 2022. Recently, the Bitcoin inventory on exchanges has plunged while the spot reserve has continued consolidating, suggesting Paper BTC has seen a wipeout. This means that while the coin has continued its bearish price action recently, at least the threat of Paper BTC isn’t looming over it. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $58,300, down more than 8% over the past week.
