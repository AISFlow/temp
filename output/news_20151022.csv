Attributing the expansion to Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar to the growing demand for bitcoin in the Gulf region, co-founder Ola Doudin, told CoinDesk that users in those countries had requested the option to buy the digital currency on BitOasis' platform.  Doudin, who claims the startup has close to 20,000 customers, added that future expansion plans included launches in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The company is looking to move beyond its existing business model with additional products and services aimed at merchants and other companies that can accept bitcoin.  ""We're looking to add more features to support merchants and SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] to accept and use bitcoin by partnering with existing payment processors in the region ... and rolling out our new mobile apps as well,"" Doudin said in an email.  The expansion comes after the wallet and exchange launched in May this year.

42398768,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXks,1445540525,Research Examines Compatibility of Public and Private Blockchains,"While distributed ledger technology continues to gain momentum among the world's financial institutions, the potential and viability of bitcoin is still being largely dismissed by the same parties.  Avid bitcoin supporters believe that using a private blockchain would inevitably result in a centralised system – a world away from bitcoin's decentralised, trustless protocol.  However, according to bitcoin mining firm BitFury's latest white paper – written in collaboration with developer Jeff Garzik – permissioned and permissionless blockchains are compatible and can be interconnected.  Many permissioned blockchain applications, the paper says, can be layered on top of permissionless blockchains using existing technology.  For example, coloured coins – a concept designed to be layered on top of bitcoin's blockchain which aims to ease the transfer of assets – could make public ledgers useful for financial institutions.  The paper adds:  ""Similar protocols could enable timestamping documents, assisting in development of decentralised timestamped registries.""  ""Payment channel networks could streamline payments by creating a scalable peer-to-peer layer on top of permissionless blockchains,"" it continues. ""Sidechain technology could be used to integrate permissionless and permissioned blockchains into a single interconnected environment.""  Permission vs permissionless  Although the paper says that private, permissioned blockchains could hold the key for blockchain innovation in the short run, it notes that public permissionless ledgers are less vulnerable to attacks.  This, the paper notes, is due to the design of permissionless ledgers, which are based on the assumption that transaction participants do not have to trust each other.  It concludes:  ""Permissionless chains minimise human factor and emphasise the algorithmic approach to security and data consistency, which are core aspects of blockchain technology. Therefore, permissionless chains could reasonably become a base layer of blockchain infrastructure, while permissioned applications could be built on top of it.""

42398756,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXZ4,1445534018,London Law Firm to Digitise Contracts Using Bitcoin Technology,"A London law firm has announced plans to digitise its legal agreements using blockchain technology.  In partnership with Stash, a Texan startup formed earlier this year, Selachii will swap its paper documents for self-executing 'smart contracts' run on a layer above bitcoin's blockchain.  Selachii partner Richard Howlett told CoinDesk his firm, which has been researching various blockchain solutions since 2013, will start out with contracts such as wills, title registries and shareholder agreements. He said:  ""We envisage smart contracts being revolutionary in ... litigation across the world. This is just the beginning of a game-changing implementation and execution of contracts. Ultimately, the technology is now in place for any contract to be a smart contract.""  Currently, Selachii and Stash are still at the testing phase. However, the firm expects to roll out the product to UK clients by the end of 2015, with an international launch due in 2016.  In terms of clients, Howlett said he is currently in discussion with a European bank looking to use smart contracts with its commercial contacts. A London Stock Exchange has also expressed interest in recording and executing their trades on the platform.  Eventually, Howlett sees 'Selachii Smart Contracts' extending beyond the firm's clientele as a whitelabel service used by other businesses and individuals.  ""Our aim is to establish ourselves as the top brand in this new and growing legal sector,"" he added.  Stash  First announced under six weeks ago, Stash is an off-blockchain system that uses the Open-Transactions platform – developed by co-founder Chris Odom in 2010 – which claims to be faster and cheaper than using bitcoin alone.  Once signed, each Stash contract is vetted by 'multi-signature voting pools' that are designed in such a way that only the user has access to their funds.  ""This means a server running our software never receives user funds, never transmits user funds, and cannot access user funds. Nor does a server have the power to change a user's balance, reverse a transaction, or confiscate a user's money,"" the company's site reads.  Co-founder Cliff Baltzley said Stash will charge users on a ""per-contract executed basis"", with prices falling once its template contracts are in place.  While Selachii was its first client, he added, other bitcoin startups and legal firms had expressed interest.  Smart contracts  Smart contracts – a term first coined by cryptographer Nick Szabo – are cryptographically secured bits of code that, at their simplest, stipulate 'if this, then that'.  How are these types of contracts seen in the eyes of the law? Howlett says they are perfectly legal – ""a contract is a contract"" – and they bring with them game-changing benefits: speed, ease and immutability. Also, they can never be lost:    ""Any important document can be placed [on the blockchain] and is always accessible by the person who stored it. For the users of the contract, ultimately, this will assist in bringing down legal fees, and could also lead to automated legal services to a certain extent.""            IBM  and BBVA are among those currently exploring smart contracts' use in a business context, which some see as a pathway to human-free corporations, also known as Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs).  And while startups like Stash are linking their platforms to the bitcoin blockchain, projects such as Eris and Ethereum are designing alternative blockchain platforms that have smart contract functionality built in. ""What bitcoin does for payments, Ethereum does for anything that can be programmed,"" its site reads.

42398772,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXoo,1445526039,Bitcoin Startup Abra Moves to Launch Mobile Remittance App,"Abra is gearing up to release its bitcoin-powered remittance app in the next few weeks, pending final approval from the Apple App Store.  The company, which recently closed a $12m Series A funding round, has announced its remittance app will be first available to customers in the US and the Philippines, with other countries in the pipeline over the weeks and months ahead.  Today, Abra also unveiled two previously undisclosed investors in its funding round: American Express, by way of its venture arm American Express Ventures, and Ratan Tata, a well-known Indian business magnate.  Additionally, the startup is announcing a new suite of merchant APIs, dubbed Abra Pay, that will enable Abra users to make payments using their mobile devices. According to Abra founder Bill Barhydt, the company has been conducting pilot tests with select merchants and will continue establishing relationships as it broadens its peer-to-peer teller network.  Preparations  Barhydt told CoinDesk that Abra has spent the better part of the last year and a half preparing for the pending launch of its remittance app, adding:  “Abra has gone very, very deep to make sure that all those integrated user experiences are working correctly. We’re really excited that it’s all come together after over a year and a half of hard work to put all the pieces together. And we’ll be turning on more countries as we go.”  On its relationship with American Express, Barhydt said Abra wasn’t ready to disclose the nature of its work in conjunction with the payments giant, stating that “right now, Abra is in charge of its own destiny”.  Harshul Sanghi, American Express Ventures’ head of global investments, said the company is working with Abra to explore the technology. He declined to detail how much money American Express had invested in the startup.  Future for blockchain  While noting the company sees a future for blockchain technology, Sanghi stressed it’s too early to speculate on how the technology will be applied.  ""As we watch the digital currency industry develop, we have seen that blockchain technology and the distributed ledger can have play an important role in shaping the future,” he told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:  “It still early days, but you can imagine a number of use cases for blockchain technology for B2B as well as B2C transactions.""  When asked whether the company sees a future for bitcoin specifically, Sanghi said American Express would base its decision on the preferences of its customers.  “Let’s see what currencies are important and we’ll transact in the currencies that our customers want to transact in,” he said.  Ratan Tata was not available for comment.

42398765,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXhv,1445520669,Bitcoin Groups and Law Enforcement Unite to Form Blockchain Alliance,"A group of digital currency companies and organizations, as well as a number of US law enforcement agencies, are establishing a new public-private forum in a bid to foster communication and education between the government and industry stakeholders.  Dubbed the Blockchain Alliance, the initiative is being spearheaded by Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, with support from a range of companies including: BitFury, BitFinex, BitGo, Bitnet, Bitstamp, Blockchain, Circle, Coinbase, CoinX, itBit, Kraken, Noble Markets and Xapo. The Alliance will also draw support from several bitcoin developers and the MIT Digital Currency Initiative’s Brian Forde.  Government agencies and departments already taking part include the US Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the US Marshals Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. More agencies, including international ones, are expected to join in the months ahead.  Jason Weinstein, the former US Deputy Assistant Attorney General named to the board of BitFury in March, will act as the group’s first director.  Primary goals  Both Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito and Weinstein suggested one of the primary goals of the initiative is to help change the perception that bitcoin and digital currencies are “a currency for criminals”.  To do this, the Alliance will maintain a mailing list through which law enforcement officials can ask questions, host regular conference calls and, potentially, produce larger gatherings that bring industry members and government officials together.  Brito explained:  “Essentially it’s a public-private forum that’s going to make it easier to have a single point of contact with law enforcement; for people in the bitcoin industry, academia, developers, to have conversations about law enforcement on the bitcoin blockchain, to ask questions and to answer questions.”  Weinstein cited the companies involved as the main impetus behind the initiative’s formation and direction forward.  “The most critical thing here is that this is being driven by the industry,” he said. “This wasn’t LE coming to us and saying ‘Help us’, this was the industry going to law enforcement and saying, ‘Let us help you’.”  Forum function  Weinstein went on to stress that the Alliance’s function isn’t to help law enforcement conduct investigations into the industry. Rather, he characterized it as a forum for “high level conversations” that focus on the broader trends of the technology and how it’s being used in the world today.  In a statement, Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring said the initiative will help spark discussion between the industry and law enforcement.  “It’s no secret that bitcoin has perception issues, which is a roadblock to mainstream adoption. Having an open dialogue with law enforcement and policymakers will help reduce anxiety about this transformative technology,” she said.

42398760,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXd0,1445504325,"Bitcoin is Exempt from VAT, Rules European Court of Justice","Bitcoin transactions will be exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT), the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled.  According to the Financial Times  , the ECJ said that bitcoin transactions ""are exempt from VAT under the provision concerning transactions relating to currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender.""  The ECJ's long-awaited ruling comes after its Advocate General Juliane Kokott urged the court to refrain from applying tax to bitcoin purchases and sales, in an opinion document published in July.  The European court first looked into bitcoin taxation in June last year after the Skatterverket – Sweden’s tax office – challenged a court decision that ruled bitcoin transactions in the country should be exempt from VAT, following a dispute with bitcoin forum operator Daniel Hedqvist.
