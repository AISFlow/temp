The SEC's concerns about custody solutions and market surveillance mechanisms may be delaying the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity are addressing the SEC's concerns in their updated ETF applications, indicating progress towards approval. Introduction It is now clear that one of the much-anticipated catalysts for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in the run-up to the upcoming Bitcoin halving is the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. For about a year, asset managers like Fidelity have been awaiting the SEC's approval for their spot in Bitcoin ETF. The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock's ( BLK ), application in June to get its spot Bitcoin ETF approved increased the hopes of such approval becoming fruitful and brought the spot Bitcoin ETF topic to the front pages. Crypto asset manager Grayscale ( OTC:GBTC ) scored a popular victory against the SEC in August, when the court ruled against the SEC's decision to outrightly reject Grayscale's application to convert the largest Bitcoin trust fund, GBTC, into a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC was given till midnight on October 13 to appeal the court order or review Grayscale's application. Decoding the SEC's Crypto Spot ETF Approach By midnight on October 13, the SEC hadn't budged. The SEC refused to appeal the August court order ruled in favor of Grayscale. The SEC's silence has left analysts wondering whether the refusal to appeal the ruling signals that an ETF approval is on the horizon or if it suggests a lack of interest and a preconceived inclination to reject Grayscale's application with minimal scrutiny. The SEC's stance on its spot BTC ETF approval has been based on the argument that spot crypto ETFs present risks; while the SEC has approved futures ETFs whose values are based on the underlying spot prices, leaving analysts confused. This stance does not appear valid because approving futures ETFs with spot price dependencies, while rejecting spot ETFs, appears inconsistent and raises questions about the rationale behind these decisions. It is difficult to pinpoint the SEC's main rationale for delaying a spot Bitcoin ETF approval; however, in my view, some reasons why the SEC might have been dragging its feet could be because the regulator is waiting for more comprehensive Bitcoin custody solutions and market surveillance mechanisms before deciding to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC's concern about custody solutions for spot ETFs could be a key factor. Futures contracts are typically traded on regulated exchanges, like CBOE and CME, with established custody solutions. Spot assets involve holding actual cryptocurrencies, which may pose greater custody and security challenges. Also, the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency market presents some challenges in ensuring market integrity. Unlike traditional financial markets, where surveillance is more straightforward due to centralized exchanges, the opposite is the case with crypto. This absence of centralization can make it difficult to monitor and prevent the risk of market manipulation, and other risks effectively. The SEC's hesitance in approving spot Bitcoin ETFs could stem from concerns about the potential impact of these risks on retail and institutional investors. The regulator might be waiting for more robust and comprehensive market surveillance solutions and regulatory frameworks to be in place before approving a spot Bitcoin ETF, to ensure that investors can confidently participate in this emerging asset class without undue risk. Strides Toward Spot ETF Approval Spot ETF applicants are making notable strides in addressing the SEC's concerns regarding Bitcoin spot ETFs. Some applicants, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco ( IVZ ), have recently submitted an updated prospectus that provides detailed insights into key aspects of their spot ETF product, including the implementation of robust market surveillance mechanisms, enhancing the safety of assets under management, and utilizing GAAP-compliant reporting mechanisms. BlackRock updated its spot Bitcoin ETF application one day ago. In this updated application, BlackRock addresses some of the SEC's concerns by highlighting its custody arrangements with Coinbase ( COIN ), Bitcoin's volatility risks, and the complexities surrounding Bitcoin's valuation. BlackRock indicated its commitment to gauge fair value and prepare the trust's periodic financial statements per the Financial Accounting Standards Board ((FASB)) ASC 820 . Fidelity also filed an updated ETF application one day ago. Like BlackRock's updated prospectus, Fidelity's updated ETF application mentioned using a pricing source consistent with GAAP for its financial statements, and also contained risk disclosures. Cointelegraph's Misinformation and the Market Reaction Last Monday's erroneous (now-deleted) tweet, published by Cointelegraph, stated the approval of BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF quickly spread throughout the crypto community and led to a significant surge in Bitcoin's price, peaking at $30,000. The market's reaction to this false news is an indication of the heightened anticipation and excitement surrounding the eventual approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Cointelegraph has since issued an apology for the misinformation. While this incident was an isolated case of misinformation, it highlights the potential impact that a genuine ETF approval could have. The Cointelegraph incident may well be considered the tip of the iceberg, offering a tantalizing preview of what lies beneath the surface, ready to be unlocked by the arrival of a legitimate Bitcoin ETF. This is one reason I recommend holding Bitcoin at this point, especially as the halving is approaching - another likely Bitcoin price catalyst. Conclusion The coordinated update of ETF applications by asset managers shows that talks could be going on behind the scenes between the ETF applicants and the SEC. I like the fact that these asset managers are updating their ETF applications, highlighting more of the SEC's concerns and showing their readiness to make the ETFs regulatory compliant. I believe this is the quickest route to getting a spot BTC ETF approved. Some Bitcoin maximalists who are self-custody ""advocates"" believe that the introduction of investment vehicles like a spot ETF will affect Bitcoin's inherent characteristic of decentralization. I believe that for Bitcoin to become a mainstream asset with worldwide mass adoption, regulation is inevitable.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4642018-bitcoin-all-eyes-on-the-sec?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19085082.jpeg

Glassnode Founder Predicts","As Bitcoin teases the psychological barrier of $30,000, enthusiasts and analysts appear to be closely watching every price movement. The general sentiment so far seems to be not a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’ BTC will make its way past this significant mark. Glassnode founder, aptly named “Negentropic”, recently shed some light on Bitcoin’s current price action via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). The analyst observed that the top cryptocurrency remains comfortably perched above the 100-hourly SMA, consistently maintaining its price above the $28,000 range. Related Reading: Binance Traders Go Bearish On Bitcoin, But Here’s Why They Might Regret It Bitcoin Potential Upward Trajectory Diving deeper into the specifics, Negentropic pinpointed an immediate resistance for Bitcoin at $28,550. This is the threshold that the analyst believes could act as a catalyst for further price movements. According to Negentropic, if Bitcoin breaches this resistance and pushes past the $29,500 mark, it’s almost certain that the top crypto will set its sights on the coveted $30,000 level. Going by the momentum, it’s not unrealistic to even anticipate a peak of around $30,650, the analyst concluded. Are bulls taking control as they rally around the $28k zone? Main takeaways: • Current price > $28k & above the 100 hourly SMA 📊 • Immediate resistance at $28.55k ⛔ • Break past $29.5k could lead to $30k target 🎯 • Potential to reach beyond $30.65k with continued momentum… pic.twitter.com/Al8q2xGg5V — 𝗡𝗲𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰 (@Negentropic_) October 19, 2023 However, price isn’t the only metric painting a bullish picture for Bitcoin. In another post on X that sparked considerable interest, on-chain analytics firm Santiment disclosed that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding a minimum of 100 BTC has surged significantly, reaching 15,970. 🐳 #Bitcoin‘s number of wallets holding at least 100 $BTC has jumped to 15,970 after the largest single day jump of 2023 on Saturday. Since this accumulation, $BTC‘s price is +5.3%, and they may not be done. We will continue to monitor. https://t.co/l0drhvkf7E pic.twitter.com/0mDAmys7N4 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 18, 2023 His statistic often signifies increased confidence among larger investors, suggesting that the ecosystem’s key players are anticipating a continued upward trajectory for BTC. BTC Latest Price Action Recently, Bitcoin’s price has exhibited a bullish trend. Over the past week, the asset has surged by 7.5%. This uptick has propelled BTC to trade above the $28,500 threshold, currently priced at $28,698, marking a 1.2% increase in the last 24 hours. From the analysis provided by Negentropic, BTC seems to have decisively breached its resistance at $28,550. This break could signify an imminent upward rally, based on insights from the Glassnode founder. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000?

The U.S. Department of Justice and Bankman-Fried's defense team filed their proposed jury instructions, which they hope Judge Kaplan will adopt after witness testimony wraps up in the coming weeks, early Thursday evening. The judge can adopt either proposal or find a happy medium when he instructs the jury on the laws surrounding the seven charges Bankman-Fried faces.  The filings contain some similarities, including requests that the judge address the indictment and explain the charges.

Thursday's filings mark the final revised set of proposals, which the parties have been debating since before the trial itself began.

""You are to break it down to the elements, assess whether there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to each of those elements, and then, with that determination made, you can render a unanimous verdict.""  Prosecutors, for their part, want to nip in the bud any argument that Bankman-Fried's actions around FTX and Alameda were tied to charitable giving, and they want the judge to make it clear to the jury that the DOJ is alleging Bankman-Fried took customer and investor funds, and misappropriated them for personal use.

""Any such arguments are not a defense to fraud or other criminal charges, as courts have repeatedly recognized.""  The defense filing suggested Kaplan delve into the concept of ""property"" and explain it ""does not include intangible interests,"" a view the DOJ disagreed with explicitly.

As always, Wood remains steadfast in her Bitcoin predictions, coming out once more with an even more daring figure for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin To $1 Million Cathie Wood, who is the founder and CEO of ARK Invest, an investment firm with over $6 billion in assets under management (AUM) has come forward with a new price expectation for Bitcoin. The CEO had a chat with Natalie Brunell, hist of the “Coin Stories” podcast, where she made this new prediction. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Getting Ready To Explode: Analyst Presents 16,500% Blowout As Wood explains, ARK Invest’s research team’s efforts have shown that Bitcoin’s growth will be largely driven by institutional adoption. They expect the digital asset to undergo a massive rally as the next decade begins. Wood points to the adoption trend of new assets by these large institutional investors and how they often tend to allocate their portfolios. As the CEO points out, between 5% and 6% of institutional investors’ portfolios were allocated to assets such as real estate after the managers had tested the waters. Bitcoin could be seen as being in the ‘testing the waters’ phase where institutional investors are still only putting around 1% into the digital asset to see how it turns out. Then gradually, they expand their allocation until they get to that 5% to 6% range. Now, when this happens, as Wood has pointed out before, BTC will cross the 7-figure mark. BTC price fails to reclaim $28,500 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Wood tells Brunell that she wants the Bitcoin price to cross $1 million by 2030. But this doesn’t mean that the CEO does not expect the digital asset to grow further as she puts it as high as $1.48 million in the next seven years. Related Reading: Meme Coins That Are Ripe For The Picking Following $3.2 Billion Crash The ARK Invest founder further points out that some companies are already starting to exceed the conservative 1% allocation. “Tesla, Square have Bitcoin on the balance sheets. But we make very cautious assumptions and I think the corporate treasury assumption is 2.5% of all cash and cash equivalent in Bitcoin.” Wood stated: If we’re right and the purchasing power of Bitcoin becomes so obvious in the years ahead, meaning the purchasing power goes up, instead of cash [dollars] staying pretty flat, if not, in real terms, deteriorating, then more and more corporate treasuries are going to be putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. She believes analysts at these companies will ask companies to put money into BTC rather than leave it in cash where the value continues to decline.

42419379,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEO7R,1697749688,"SEC Drops Charges Against Ripple CEO Garlinghouse, Chairman Larsen","Ripple's top leaders are cleared in the SEC's securities-violation accusations that have spent years winding their way through federal courts, bringing the overall case closer to an initial conclusion – and potentially closer to an appeal.  The case is seen as one of the bellwethers in the ongoing dispute between the crypto industry and SEC in what defines a security.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will no longer pursue claims that Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse or Executive Chairman Chris Larsen aided and abetted the company in violating federal securities laws in its XRP transactions, canceling a trial scheduled for next year and giving the crypto company another victory in the agency's long-running suit against it while moving the regulator closer to appealing a federal judge's ruling in the case.  According to a filing Thursday afternoon, the parties agreed to voluntarily dismiss the aiding and abetting charges against the two executives with prejudice, meaning it cannot be filed again. The SEC will continue pursuing its claims against Ripple, the filing said.  ""For nearly three years, Chris and I have been the subject of baseless allegations from a rogue regulator with a political agenda,"" said Garlinghouse, in a statement. ""Instead of looking for the criminals stealing customer funds on offshore exchanges that were courting political favor, the SEC went after the good guys.""  Ripple won a major – if partial – victory in July, when the judge overseeing the case ruled that the company had not violated federal securities laws in making XRP available to retail investors by putting it on exchanges. In the same ruling, Judge Analisa Torres said the company had violated federal securities law in selling XRP directly to institutional investors.  It's this second part where the SEC and Ripple will continue discussions, Thursday's filing indicated. Similarly, the dropped charges are tied to the institutional sales, which would have gone on trial next April.  ""The SEC and Ripple intend to meet and confer on a potential briefing schedule with respect to the pending issue in the case – what remedies are proper against Ripple for its Section 5 violations with respect to its Institutional Sales of XRP,"" the filing said.  An SEC spokesperson declined to comment. A Ripple press release described the filing as a ""surrender"" and the original pursuit as ""absurd theatrics.""  The price of XRP jumped about 4.1% on the news, to $0.51.  Earlier this month, an attempt by the SEC to appeal its court loss in the Ripple case while the other issues continued through the trial process was denied.  The SEC has experienced a series of litigation setbacks in its wide-ranging pursuit of crypto firms it says are violating securities laws. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has argued that virtually all cryptocurrencies should be considered securities in the jurisdiction of agency oversight, but U.S. judges have repeatedly declared it's not so simple.  In the near-term absence of crypto regulatory laws from Congress, these court battles may end up setting the U.S. standards by which the government approaches digital assets.  In the meantime, Ripple said it's now doing almost 90% of its business beyond the U.S. borders.  Katherine Kirkpatrick, the chief legal officer for Cboe Digital, said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the agency may have dropped the cases against the individuals as a legal tactic.  ""This means they can proceed to appeal the Ripple decision much sooner – otherwise they would have had to wait until the conclusion of that trial in the late spring,"" she wrote.

42419371,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUENzB,1697749303,Hamas Crypto Funding Likely ‘Overstated’ – Chainalysis,"Reports of tens of millions of dollars in crypto going to fund Palestinian operations in Israel are likely “overstated,” Chainalysis said. The forensics outfit published a blog post arguing that flows of crypto financing to Hamas and affiliated groups have become inflated far beyond reality. While acknowledging that it was crucial to stop any financing of terror through crypto, Chainalysis said it was also important to understand how such funding actually works, lest it lead to misconceptions.  We have “seen overstated metrics and flawed analyses of these terrorist groups’ use of cryptocurrency, and feel compelled to address some misconceptions,” the company said.  Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Palestinian Islamic Jihad received $93 million in crypto between August 2021 and June 2023 and that Hamas received about $41 million in the same timeframe. The report was partly based on data analysis from Elliptic, a Chainalysis competitor.  Critics of the WSJ report said the headline – “Hamas Militants Behind Israel Attack Raised Millions in Crypto” – suggested that crypto was funding the Palestinian operation directly, when it was not clear whether the flows were actually reaching terrorists. They also noted that crypto financing, while important to stop, was small compared to state-funded support (particularly from Iran).  Hamas announced in April that it was suspending crypto fundraising because it put its collaborators at risk of capture or worse. Chainalysis states that the transparency of blockchains is bad for actors trying to operate in the shadows.  “Given blockchain technology’s inherent transparency and the often public nature of terrorism financing campaigns, cryptocurrency is not an effective solution to finance terrorism at scale.”  “It’s possible that no one understands the challenges of using cryptocurrency for fundraising better than Hamas,” the company added.  Aside from the immediate question of whether crypto is financing Hamas, it’s relevant for a live policy debate about controls the U.S. might employ around money laundering. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) cited the WSJ’s reporting on Hamas financing in an op-ed for the same outlet Oct. 18. Both are sponsors of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, which seeks to increase reporting requirements on crypto transactions in a bid to tamp down on money laundering. Warren, in particular, is a staunch crypto critic with a stated goal to build an “anti-crypto army.”  Chainalysis said the “inflated” estimates cited by the WSJ likely count all flows going to service providers suspected of involvement in terror financing. But that’s not evidence that the funds actually reached wallets controlled by terrorists. “We have seen recent estimates related to the attacks on Israel that appear to include all flows to certain service providers that received some funds associated with terrorism financing.

19078765,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556118,1697749230,"Hedera (HBAR) Q3 Triumph: Transaction Volume Soars, Network Revenue Crosses 1M Milestone","According to a recent report by the online database platform Messari, the Hedera (HBAR) Network, an open-source, public blockchain governed by the Hedera Governing Council, has showcased significant growth in the face of a challenging crypto market during Q3 2023. Hedera Network Hits New Record With 99 Million Daily Transactions Per the report, Hedera Network’s transaction volume continued its upward trajectory, achieving a new record of 99 million daily average transactions in Q3 2023. This milestone marks the fifth consecutive quarterly increase in transaction activity, with the Hedera Consensus Service responsible for 99% of all transactions on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maximalist Calls Ethereum ‘Garbage’, Here’s Why Notably, the network’s revenue derived from transaction fees surpassed $1 million for the first time, experiencing a remarkable 30% quarter-on-quarter growth. According to Messari, the Hedera Consensus Service largely drove the revenue growth and remained independent of HBAR’s price fluctuations, as transaction fees are fixed in USD terms. While the overall crypto market experienced a moderate downturn during Q3 2023, HBAR’s circulating market capitalization grew by 7.6% quarter-on-quarter, reaching $1.7 billion by the end of September. HBAR’s fully diluted market capitalization also increased by 2.5%, settling at $2.5 billion. As a result, the Hedera Network emerged as the 31st-largest crypto protocol by market capitalization, demonstrating its growing prominence in the industry. Hedera’s TVL Skyrockets By 29% The protocol’s Total Value Locked (TVL) reached $31 million in Q3 2023, a 29% increase from the previous quarter. While the broader market witnessed a reduction in TVL, Hedera’s year-over-year (YoY) TVL growth stood at an impressive 75%. SaucerSwap, the leading protocol within the Hedera ecosystem, accounted for most of the TVL, with $27 million locked, comprising 87% of the Hedera Network’s total TVL. According to Messari, this growth in TVL can be attributed to the launch of new protocols within the ecosystem. On the flip side, the Hedera community has strongly emphasized enhancing developer tools and collaborations. In Q3 2023, significant progress was made toward achieving Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence. The community introduced developer-focused features, integrated the JSON-RPC codebase, and refined contract creation transactions through HIP-729. These efforts have increased compatibility with EVM networks and expanded the capabilities of smart contract development on the Hedera Network. High Staking Percentage And Strategic Partnerships The Hedera Network reported a high staking percentage, with 85% of the circulating supply and 56% of the total supply staked. Core entities such as the HBAR Foundation, Swirlds, and Swirlds Labs have staked their HBAR allocations and the Hedera Treasury to support validators in meeting the minimum staking threshold for network consensus. Notably, these entities have chosen not to collect staking rewards. Related Reading: This Bullish Divergence Is Once Again Forming For Bitcoin, Rally Soon? Per the report, the Hedera Governing Council modified the staking rewards structure during Q3, adjusting the reward rate to 2.5% and setting a maximum staked quantity to ensure proportional reward rates. Despite the challenging crypto market conditions in Q3 2023, the Hedera Network has showcased significant growth. The expansion of TVL and the dominance of SaucerSwap further solidified the ecosystem’s position. Despite the growth of Hedera Network’s ecosystem, the native token, HBAR, is currently trading at $0.0460, reflecting a 4.5% decrease in value over the past 24 hours. This trend has persisted throughout the year, resulting in a year-to-date decline of 24%.

42419372,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEO0D,1697748025,"For DeFi to Flourish, Right-Size the Regulators","Shakespeare wrote in ""Henry VI:"" “the first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” If you work in DeFi in 2023, you’ve likely heard similar grumbling directed at regulators. Gary Gensler may as well be the King of France.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week sponsored by Chainalysis. Matt Luongo is the CEO of Thesis, a venture studio and auditing firm which has built a family of projects across fintech, DeFi, infrastructure, and zero-knowledge cryptography such as Fold, tBTC, Taho, Etcher and Embody.  The fundamental complaint is the same as in the Bard’s day: that “parchment, being scribbled o’er, should undo a man.” Or in this case, an industry.  See also: IRS Proposed Rule on Digital Asset Broker Reporting Could 'Kill' Crypto  I’ve spent years building and developing projects in Web3. This technology can make billions of people’s lives safer, richer and easier to navigate. So I share the frustrations of many at the recent heavy-handedness of regulatory bodies.  Decentralization and on-chain transparency lend themselves to regulatory efficiency  This year has already seen a broad assault on crypto, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing both Binance and Coinbase and refusing to admit defeat in its fight against Ripple. The case against Coinbase is particularly baffling, since the same SEC that’s now accusing the crypto exchange of malfeasance only a few years ago approved its Nasdaq listing.  In the U.S, the approach seems to be to enforce first and figure out the rules second. This must change.  But where does the change start? How can this challenge be overcome?  Tech is about disruption, and some argue that decentralized tech itself will eventually make regulators obsolete. If rules can be written into code, the argument goes, human enforcers and the biases they bring will no longer be needed. Trust me: if it was possible to replace the SEC with code, I would in a heartbeat.  But it’s not possible. The world needs regulators. It just needs to right-size them.  First, do no harm  We need to start with a simple question: what is regulation for?  Constructive regulation helps ensure that people do not abuse their positions to cheat, steal or harm others. Enforcement should ensure that everyone is playing by the same rules. At its most basic level, regulation should keep ordinary people safe from bad actors and allow marketplaces to operate as beneficially as possible.  The need for regulation highlights a fundamental truth: technology is amoral. This is true of all tech, from fire to airplanes and AI to DeFi. Its morality is determined by the people who use it. And there are as many motives as there are people.  The stunning unraveling of FTX last year, and the failure of several banks earlier this year, demonstrate the multifaceted nature of risk. FTX was, based on available evidence, a classic Ponzi scheme. Bank failures were caused by a panic that spread through social media. But in each case, a crisis was precipitated by human activity rather than anything inherent to underlying technology.  And since human action is what drives these crises, it’s human behavior that must be regulated.  If crimes are committed, perpetrators must be held accountable. At the same time, honest actors should be allowed to innovate. As a rule, history has shown that adopting and regulating, rather than opposing, new technology benefits society at large. This constructive approach to innovation is a major reason wealth, educational attainment and life expectancy have all risen so quickly over the past century and a half.  Most people get this intuitively. They object not to regulation as such, but to the arbitrary exercise of bureaucratic authority. Excessive regulation is a drag on innovation and economic activity. It’s practically self-evident: who doesn’t know how maddening it is to have your time wasted dealing with an officious employee at the DMV?  Good regulation strengthens the markets by establishing clear rules of the road and enforcing them efficiently and predictably. What does this look like in practice?  See also: Defiant by Default: Why Regulators Must Understand, Not Police, DeFi  First, the scope of regulators’ oversight must be clearly defined. They should not have arbitrary authority to block the march of progress or to favor certain industries while smothering others. They should be empowered to stop bad actors while enabling technology to develop and flourish. And where possible, they should just let the tech work.  Here’s the exciting part: as DeFi matures, this should be an increasingly obvious proposition.  Decentralization and on-chain transparency lend themselves to regulatory efficiency. If a condition is met, a corresponding action is automatically executed; there is no space for manipulation by a human. The more we build out truly decentralized systems, the more the role of regulators will organically shrink. This will take time — the internet wasn’t built in a day. But gradually, the need for humans to regulate technical processes will fade.  Regulators will probably always be necessary to police human activity. But as decentralized technology matures, they should get comfortable letting the machines take care of themselves. Truly helpful regulation means understanding where to step in — and where not to.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Matt Luongo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/19/for-defi-to-flourish-right-size-the-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/070456bd58e4f31d9e4163ae8862664ca43ea0a2-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419370,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUENy9,1697746982,U.S. Risks Unleashing Second 'Eurodollar' Market if It Dallies on Stablecoin Regulation,"On Sept. 8, Michael Barr, the vice chair for supervision and Federal Reserve governor, said he was “deeply concerned about stablecoins without strong federal oversight.” This is a reaction to the growing recognition among major financial institutions, including PayPal and Visa, of the potential of stablecoins.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week sponsored by Chainalysis. Jón Egilsson, former chairman of the Icelandic Central Bank, is the co-founder of Monerium, the first company to issue fiat onchain.  The Federal Reserve intends to ""intensify oversight of crypto activities,” Barr said, a strong statement but not officially forward guidance. In fact, today, there is a glaring absence of much-needed regulatory clarity for stablecoins in the U.S., considering the stakes of the industry and how quickly it moves.  This is in stark contrast to the environment in Europe, where lawmakers carved out stablecoins as a serious focus when developing the most comprehensive package of crypto laws yet, MiCA.  See also: Stablecoins: A Potential Counter to De-Dollarization | Opinion  The current lack of regulatory clarity for USD stablecoins in the U.S. could precipitate a migration of the USD stablecoin industry away from American shores and towards Europe, where legal and regulatory frameworks are firmly in place.  If this scenario unfolds, it would mark a recurring pattern of arcane regulations inadvertently pushing a trillion-dollar industry beyond the U.S. borders. In contrast to Europe's proactive approach, characterized by the implementation of time-tested, technology-neutral frameworks for stablecoin regulation, the United States finds itself trailing in the race to establish the necessary guidelines for widespread stablecoin acceptance.  This lag represents a missed opportunity for Congress and regulatory bodies to take the lead in crafting well-defined rules that not only foster innovation but also can increase financial stability.  Stablecoins offer the promise of secure and efficient transactions and storage of digital assets, all without the need for intermediation by traditional financial institutions, such as banks. And so the importance of regulatory guidance cannot be overstated. Regulation serves as a critical bulwark for consumer protection, and upholds the reliability and soundness of digital transactions.  Stablecoins are quickly becoming a tool used globally as a U.S. dollar on-ramp. This means that stablecoins are also becoming a tool that bolsters the U.S. dollar hegemony.  Former French President Charles De Gaulle once eloquently said the U.S. enjoys an ""exorbitant privilege” due to its exceptional global position. It has a unique ability to issue dollars for settling international debts and serve as the world's primary reserve currency, which grants the U.S. unprecedented economic power and privilege.  See also: What's the Point of Stablecoins? The Reasons, Risks and Rewards | Opinion  However, the lack of regulatory clarity creates challenges, including the risk of diminishing USD demand and the potential for the market of USD stablecoins to migrate towards more favorable regulatory jurisdictions.  There is a historical parallel with the formation of the ""eurodollar"" market in the 1960s, which emerged due to a lack of regulatory clarity surrounding offshore-held U.S. dollars in international finance. Today, the lack of guidance around stablecoins in the U.S. may be laying the foundation for a second eurodollar market.  The potential resurgence of a eurodollar market represents a multi-trillion dollar stablecoin opportunity on Europe's doorstep  Congress and regulators have an imperative to assert the dominance of USD stablecoins based on U.S. regulatory terms. They must adopt a proactive stance and provide comprehensive guidelines that not only foster innovation but also safeguard the integrity of the financial system. Neglecting this responsibility risks compromising the United States' standing in the global economy.  The stakes for both jurisdictions are undeniably high, yet distinctly polar. The potential resurgence of a eurodollar market represents a multi-trillion dollar stablecoin opportunity on Europe's doorstep. While the United States faces the challenge of preserving its economic dominance.

Importantly, this news came just a few days after the SEC's deadline to appeal the result of the Grayscale lawsuit passed without an appeal . It's looking increasingly likely that there will be a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the near future with some even expecting one before the end of the year. The arrival of a spot ETF could be a major development for a community that to this point has seen most of the investment demand for BTC flow to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) and the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). Each of these funds has limitations that have left many hopeful for a spot ETF. I've covered Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust numerous times for Seeking Alpha, so I don't want to spend a lot of time in this article on that fund. I'm personally bullish on GBTC because the fund has traded at such a steep discount to net asset value and I see that discount as a phenomenal arbitrage opportunity even if the underlying asset doesn't move all that much between now and the end of the year. So far that trade is working out very well, and it has allowed GBTC to outperform both Bitcoin and BITO year to date: Data by YCharts However, in this article I'd like to explore BITO a bit more and get into why I think there are alternatives that investors may want to consider. Futures vs. Spot One of the key differences between BITO and a potential spot ETF is that the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy fund utilizes CME Bitcoin futures contracts rather than holding the underlying asset either directly or through a custodian. Since the futures contracts are cash-settled, the issuer never actually holds any BTC in the fund. This is different from a spot ETF which could hold a certain amount of Bitcoin per share outstanding and allow for asset redemptions to mitigate the kind of NAV issue that we've witnessed in GBTC shares over the last couple of years. BITO Holdings (ProShares) ProShares generally stick to front-month futures and have exposure to the October and November CME contracts currently. It's important to note that futures work differently than options. With options, there is no obligation for the speculator to exercise. With futures contracts, the speculator either needs to take delivery of the underlying asset or roll over the contract to a later maturity date. ProShares is doing the latter with BITO and that creates a scenario where contract rollover costs could hinder the performance of the fund compared to alternatives. This is something ProShares addressed in its one-year review last October and made note of how much rollover costs have come down since inception. BITO Prospectus (ProShares) The roll-over costs have also been partially offset by the yield from treasuries that ProShares holds in the fund. And this brings us to BITO's massive dividend yield. But That Dividend Though In an effort to avoid paying excise taxes, ProShares distributes taxable income from gains on its futures positions to BITO shareholders. This means that the dividend can fluctuate significantly from month to month, and we've seen that already in BITO's distributions this year: BITO Distributions (Seeking Alpha) The July dividend was $0.66 while the October dividend was just $0.07 and the September dividend was less than a penny. However, these dividends do dramatically impact the total return from holding BITO compared to simply looking at the share price: Data by YCharts Still, even when accounting for distributions the total return from holding BITO shares is 700 bps below the return of the underlying asset year to date. BITO vs. XBTF The question for potential BITO buyers is does a better alternative exist? Buying and holding Bitcoin directly makes the most sense for anyone who wants to minimize fees and fund decay, but buying directly exposes investors to capital gains taxes. There are ways around that as well, but not everyone is willing to open up a crypto IRA through a platform like iTrustCapital or Choice. For typical investors who want simple Bitcoin exposure in a tax-advantaged investment account, BITO isn't a bad option as it has less NAV arbitrage variance than funds like GBTC or Osprey Bitcoin Trust ( OTCPK:OBTC ). But compared to something like the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( XBTF ), BITO's performance is a bit more mixed: BITO XBTF AUM $893m $46.5 Expense Ratio 0.95% 0.76% Dividend Frequency Monthly Annual Yield TTM 18.69% 0.25% YTD Total Return 63.0% 63.4% Source: Seeking Alpha From a total return standpoint, BITO is trailing XBTF year to date by about 40 bps. Over the last 12 months, the head-to-head performance is actually a bit worse for BITO: Data by YCharts There we see XBTF ahead by 300 bps. And it's worth repeating that each of these funds is underperforming the underlying asset. In addition to the lower expense ratio and the very different dividend schedule, VanEck's Bitcoin Strategy ETF currently only has exposure to the October contract while BITO has both October and November with a larger weighting to October. This maturity strategy may be contributing to the discrepancy in the fund's performance versus XBTF. Risks There is risk when investing in Bitcoin, crypto, and derivatives. While I'm very bullish on BTC personally, there is no certainty that the coin's price post-halving will behave the same way it has in the past. Bitcoin has gone through many booms and bust cycles, but crypto has never faced a 5% fed funds or short-duration T-bills that pay nearly 6% before. While I'm of the view that we will soon have far more regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the United States, the reality is we still don't know for sure what the SEC is going to do with the spot ETF applications. But in the event those applications are approved, spot ETFs will ultimately compete with BITO and likely track the return of BTC better since there won't be rollover costs. Summary If you're looking to tactically trade Bitcoin in a traditional IRA, BITO will help you do that. I personally like GBTC better given the arbitrage opportunity from the NAV discount. But until there is a low-cost spot ETF in the US market, there are worse ways to get BTC exposure in a tax-advantaged account. BITO has better liquidity than XBTF and has a total return that appears to be tracking peers better this year than it has in the past. I don't hold BITO personally, but I think Bitcoin will be higher in the next 12 months, so I'm rating the fund a buy regardless.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4641958-bito-simple-and-easy-bitcoin-price-exposure?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19076671.jpeg

19076499,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556084,1697745623,XRP Price Prediction: Rare Bent Fork Pattern Predicts Explosive 3000% Surge To $15,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has been continuously bullish on the future of the XRP price and the latest prediction proves this. This time around, the crypto analyst is using a rare Bent Fork Pattern to back up his prediction that the XRP price is headed for double-digits. The Rare Bent Fork Pattern Egrag first mentioned the Bent Fork Pattern in a June post while showing a bullish roadmap for the XRP price. In the earlier post, the analyst points out ‘four distinct tracks’. These include the “Track A) Major Historical Support, Track B) Ranging Zone, Track C) Mid-Cycle Top, and Track D) Cycle Top.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $100: Here’s How To Become A Millionaire As Egrag explained, the Track D is the cycle top which could see the altcoin’s price reach as high as $15, although not without incidence. Despite expecting a surge, Egrag says that XRP could fall lower before this happens. However, the analyst asks investors not to fret when this happens. Rather, they should see it as an opportunity to buy the cryptocurrency for lower prices. Now, four months after the initial post was made, Egrag has revisited this Bent Fork Pattern, doubling down on the previous prediction. In a post made on Wednesday, October 18, Egrag updated the previous prediction, showing what needs to happen for the XRP price to reach the lofty price of $15. This would mean at least a 3,000% price increase for XRP if the pattern plays out exactly as expected. In the chart below, the analyst explains that the XRP price needs to breach the white line for the rally to begin. “the real excitement is if #XRP shatters the ‘White’ Ascending Triangle – get ready for some market-shaking action,” the analyst said. Bent Fork Pattern points to bullish recovery | Source: X Looking at a time frame, the crypto analyst asks investors to keep an eye out for the 3rd and 4th week of November as this is when something interesting might happen. “Feeling uncertain about your next move? This might just be your last chance to seize a buying opportunity,” Egrag said in closing. Not The Only Bullish Chart For XRP Price Interestingly, Egrag’s XRP price prediction using the Bent Fork Pattern also matches their other predictions for the altcoin. Earlier in the week, Egrag had also put forward another forecast but used the Elliot Wave Theory to present the bull case. Related Reading: Ripple Job Posting Sparks IPO Rumors, Will XRP Price Finally Cross $100? As Egrag notes, the fifth wave is where the main movement really lies where the analyst expects the price surge to happen. Just like with the Bent Fork Pattern, it also suggests a double-digit price level at the top. However, the wave theory takes it a step further with a $27 price mark compared to the Bent Fork’s $15 mark. Another similarity between both predictions is that the June Bent Fork chart shows the XRP price at $15 somewhere between 2025 and 2026. This is the same timeframe presented using the Elliot Wave analysis, so most of this will likely play out in the bull market.

42419369,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUENx7,1697745313,Grayscale ETF Case's Final Word Coming in Federal Court as SEC Loss Formalized,"A federal court is poised to formalize Grayscale's win against the Securities and Exchange Commission on the dispute over a spot bitcoin ETF application.  It's unclear whether the court will direct the SEC toward any specific timeline to govern its next steps in rethinking the application.  Grayscale Investments is waiting for a federal court tomorrow or soon after to formalize the defeat it handed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) two months ago in the parties’ dispute over a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). That federal court action will close the case, legally setting Grayscale's win in stone.  According to procedure in such cases, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had seven days to close the books on this matter after the SEC chose last week not to appeal the court's ruling that the agency must scrap its rejection of Grayscale's ETF application. That deadline is arriving on Friday, and there are a couple of possibilities for what the court does next: It can just terminate the case without comment, or it could issue some further direction to the SEC on what comes next.  That's the sticking point in this eagerly watched legal dispute. Consequential uncertainties remain over what happens now with Grayscale's application. The SEC could technically seek to reject it again for different reasons, or the regulator could give in and approve this and other ETF applications, such as those from financial giants BlackRock and Fidelity.  The industry generally expects the SEC to allow the new ETFs, though timing – be it later this year or sometime in 2024 – is uncertain. If approved, Grayscale would convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an exchange-traded product. The company plans to list that on NYSE Arca, where the ETF would become widely available to investors.  The court's final action could come on the deadline day of Friday, though it may also emerge on Monday because of the late midnight deadline, according to a person familiar with the case.  ""Grayscale remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF, and on behalf of GBTC's investors, we look forward to working collaboratively and expeditiously with the SEC on these matters,"" spokeswoman Jennifer Rosenthal said in a statement.  Earlier today, the company filed a registration statement with the SEC to list shares of GBTC on the exchange. While the statement – known as the SEC's Form S-3 – has been filed, it's not yet effective as Grayscale awaits word from the agency.

19076160,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556121,1697745151,What is USDT? All About Tether Stablecoin Cryptocurrency,"USDT, also known as Tether, has become an integral part of cryptocurrency markets since its launch in 2014. Pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, it is the most widely used stablecoin with a market capitalization of over $83 billion as of October 2023. But it is also controversial, with opaque reserves and questions around its long-term viability. Here is an in-depth look at how USDT works, its importance in crypto, and the risks it presents. What is USDT? Overview of Tether Stablecoin Cryptocurrency At its core, Tether functions as a stablecoin, meaning each token is backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currency. This peg to the dollar aims to minimize volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. USDT operates on different blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron and others, allowing it to be transferred seamlessly between different networks. Crypto traders rely on USDT as a stable store of value when trading between different digital assets. It is also widely used on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for lending, borrowing, and making payments. USDT price: $1 USDT Market Cap: ~$83 billion (as of October 2023) Key Features of USDT Crypto The key features that define Tether include: Pegged 1:1 to the US dollar – USDT aims to maintain parity with the dollar Operates on different blockchains – Enables transfer between networks Hedges against crypto volatility – Acts as a stable haven when markets are fluctuating Wide adoption – Used extensively in crypto trading and DeFi protocols How Does USDT Maintain Its Dollar Peg? According to Tether Limited, the company behind USDT, every token in circulation is backed 1:1 by their reserves, which include both traditional currency and cash equivalents. When buyers purchase USDT by depositing $1 per token, new tokens are issued while the dollars are held in reserves. This mechanism theoretically allows users to redeem each USDT to USD. By allowing two-way convertibility between USDT and dollars, the supply can adjust to maintain the 1:1 parity. However, Tether’s reserves have been shrouded in secrecy over the years, leading to allegations that the company does not hold sufficient dollar reserves to back all USDT in circulation. Tether settled a case with the New York Attorney General in 2021, agreeing to release periodic reports on its reserves. So far, the redemptions have generally maintained the dollar peg. But questions linger over the breakdown of reserves and their adequacy as USDT supply has ballooned. USDT Price Chart from CoinMarketCap The Role and Importance of USDT in Crypto Despite the opacity, USDT continues to play a hugely important role in cryptocurrency markets. It is one of the most widely traded crypto assets, with daily trading volumes in the billions of dollars against assets like Bitcoin. Exchanges rely on stablecoin trading pairs like BTC/USDT to enable traders to hedge risk during times of high volatility. USDT is also widely integrated into DeFi protocols like lending and borrowing platforms, decentralized exchanges, yield farms, and more. It provides stability in an otherwise volatile environment for decentralized finance. The demand for USDT trading, transactions, and parking value in a stable asset continues to drive increasing adoption. Future Outlook for Tether Stablecoin Going forward, the biggest threat to USDT is the risk of losing its 1:1 dollar peg and collapsing in value if its reserves are inadequate. Tether also faces potential regulatory crackdowns from authorities who may threaten its viability. Competing stablecoins like USDC and BUSD are more transparent about reserves and could gain share. However, USDT retains first-mover advantage and the network effects of wider integration in crypto infrastructure. It continues to maintain peg stability through redemptions so far. If Tether can provide greater transparency and embrace compliance, USDT may retain its dominant position for some time. But traders should exercise caution and understand the risks of relying too much on USDT long-term. Despite controversies around reserves and regulation, Tether remains an integral cog in the crypto economy machine. But as the market matures, stablecoins built on greater transparency and compliance are likely to emerge as leaders. How Does USDT Work? There are a few key mechanisms that enable USDT to function as a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar: Minting and Issuing New USDT Tether mints new USDT when buyers deposit $1 per token with the company. The dollars are added to reserves, while an equivalent amount of USDT is issued on the blockchain ledger. This USDT enters circulation when transferred to the buyer’s wallet address. The minting helps adjust supply to match demand. Sending and Receiving USDT Transactions Once issued, USDT can be transacted between addresses on its supported blockchains like any other cryptocurrency. Senders can broadcast transactions and pay small network fees to send USDT to recipients’ wallet addresses. These peer-to-peer transactions are recorded transparently on public blockchain explorers. Trading USDT on Exchanges and DeFi USDT is listed as a trading pair on most major centralized crypto exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges. Traders can use USDT to buy and sell other cryptos like Bitcoin in a stable manner when volatility is high. In decentralized finance, USDT also serves as a stable currency for lending, borrowing, liquidity provision, and more. Redeeming USDT for Dollars In theory, USDT holders can redeem each token for exactly 1 US dollar from Tether Limited. This is made possible by the underlying reserves that back each token. Redemptions help maintain the 1:1 peg when USDT falls below $1 on exchanges. However, Tether reserves the right to delay or deny redemptions in some circumstances. Pros and Cons of USDT Stablecoin USDT provides stability amid crypto volatility but also carries risks: Pros Avoid volatility by parking value in USDT Seamless transfers between blockchains Wide acceptance in crypto ecosystem Useful for decentralized trading and finance Cons Opaque reserves raise viability concerns Regulatory crackdowns could threaten operations Reliant on Tether’s redemption policy to maintain peg Vulnerable to bank runs if reserves are inadequate Tether pioneered stablecoins in crypto but transparent alternatives like USDC are emerging. Regulatory direction will play a key role in determining whether USDT maintains dominance long-term. In conclusion, USDT remains indispensable for crypto trading and finance today. But prudent users should assess risks of relying extensively on USDT if its opaque operations and reserves raise too many questions about its sustainability. As the sector develops, the stability and transparency offered by its competitors could make them a safer bet over the coming years USDT FAQ: Tether Frequently Asked Questions & Answers What is USDT TRC20?

19074361,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556106,1697742033,Bitcoin ETF Approval Anticipated To Trigger Fiat Influx Of $24-50 Billion,"In a recent report released by Matrixport, a digital assets financial services platform, the spotlight shifts beyond Bitcoin (BTC) as the eagerly anticipated approval of a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have far-reaching effects. According to the analysis, not only could the Bitcoin market experience a significant boost, but Tether (USDT) and the broader crypto market could also see positive outcomes. Potential Impact On Bitcoin Matrixport’s foresight, outlined in their 2023 outlook report published on December 9, 2022, projected a substantial crypto rally driven by factors such as lower US inflation and favorable macroeconomic conditions. This projection anticipated strong rebounds for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), along with a notable decrease in volatility. Related Reading: ETH Price Watch: Impact On Price As Traders Ditch Bitcoin On Derivatives Market Surrounding the approval of these pending applications, a standout performer in the market has been Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with its share prices surging by an impressive 167% year-to-date, outpacing Bitcoin’s 71% growth. While GBTC’s net-asset-value (NAV) discount marginally narrowed from -45% to -43% at the beginning of the year, the game-changing moment arrived when BlackRock announced its ETF application on June 15, 2023. Matrixport’s earlier reports analyzed the US registered investor advisor (RIA) community, comprising approximately 15,000 advisors overseeing around $5 trillion. Recognizing the potential of this group, the report suggests that even a modest 1% allocation recommendation for Bitcoin would result in approximately $50 billion in inflows. $56,000 BTC Price Projection Drawing a parallel with precious metals ETFs boasting an estimated $120 billion in market capitalization, and assuming that between 10-20% of precious metal ETF investors explore a Bitcoin ETF as a diversification tactic against monetary debasement and inflation hedges, the potential influx into the Bitcoin ETF could reach a significant $12-24 billion. The report speculates on the implications for Tether’s market capitalization by looking at the potential impact of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF approval. Acting as a proxy for potential ETF inflows, a $24 billion increase in Tether’s market cap could conservatively push Bitcoin’s price to $42,000. With an even larger influx of $50 billion resulting from a 1% allocation by RIAs, Bitcoin could rally to $56,000. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For Massive Rally As BlackRock And JPMorgan Make Their Move Overall, Matrixport’s analysis sheds light on the potential ripple effects of Bitcoin ETF approval, extending beyond Bitcoin’s immediate market and encompassing Tether and the wider cryptocurrency landscape. As market participants eagerly await regulatory decisions, the industry remains poised for potential growth and transformation. As of the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin (BTC), is trading at $28,700, reflecting a 1.8% increase over the past 24 hours. It is worth noting that BTC has successfully maintained the gains it has made since mid-September. During this period, the cryptocurrency broke its short-term downtrend structure after reaching its peak for the year at $31,800 on July 13.

42419382,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEOBZ,1697740979,"DCG, Genesis Were the ‘Adults in the Room’ but Didn’t Behave Like It","My colleague, the intrepid reporter/editor Nik De recently wrote a column about how amateurish the crypto industry seems as details come to light from Sam Bankman-Fried’s ongoing criminal trial. To some extent you can almost, almost forgive the crooked dealings at SBF’s twinned exchange and trading shop businesses. After all, FTX and Alameda Research were managed by a close-knit crop of longtime friends of SBF, who all had limited experience in finance and who were guided, seemingly, by the genuine utilitarian desire to make the world a better place.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Last week, during Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison’s multi-day testimony, she admitted guilt to sending Alameda’s business partners cooked books and running a longhaul scheme to defraud FTX investors and customers — including deceiving CoinDesk’s sister company Genesis, the lending subsidiary of Digital Currency Group. I’m not going to bite my tongue just because we share a parent organization. In Ellison’s testimony, Genesis — nominally a victim of SBF’s scheme — is an unsympathetic participant.  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | Opinion  New York Attorney General Leticia James today filed lawsuits against Genesis and DCG, as well as their principal managers, ex-CEO of Genesis Michael Moro and DCG founder and Chief Executive Barry Silbert, accusing the firms of lying to customers, each other and the general public. It’s a complicated case involving another crypto exchange Gemini, century-old securities law and Gemini’s retail-focused crypto lending platform called “Earn.”  What’s painful about this particular lawsuit, apart from the familiar connection, is that this was supposed to be the big leagues of crypto. There was real money on the line (Earn customers are estimated to have lost upwards of $1 billion) and well-established firms involved. Before a unit of Genesis declared bankruptcy this year, the firm’s employees were widely considered to be “the adults in the room,” the people who knew business best.  At its height, DCG was compared to Standard Oil, a firm that grew oligarchically big. Only it turns out The State doesn’t need to dissemble Silbert’s empire — it tore itself apart.  The line between fraud and “rookie mistakes” is a prominent theme throughout the FTX story. SBF’s lawyer has described FTX’s misfit operation as a plane being built mid-flight. Ellison’s testimony spoke to the casual relationship Alameda had with Genesis, where it seemed routine to transact hundreds of millions of dollars over a Telegram chat. That level of insouciance speaks both to confidence gained through expertise and a basic error in judgment.  Of course, it was also a casual relationship established in trust — and allegedly, SBF and his cadres willingly violated that trust. To the extent that Genesis was deceived, it is a victim. However, Attorney General Leticia James is also accusing Genesis and DCG of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the world. Genesis made what are in retrospect insane decisions — like facilitating a $1 billion swap of Do Kwon’s rickety stablecoin for bitcoin, and accepting the FTX casino token FTT as collateral for billions of dollars in loans — that show poor risk-management.  Where things cross the line, James might argue, is when Genesis and DCG tried to hide their losses and mismanagement. At the center of this is a $1.1 billion promissory note DCG made to Genesis, allegedly used to conceal the firm’s ""true financial health."" At one point, Alameda accounted for 60% of Genesis’ loan book, a worrisome concentration of risk made worse by the loans being undersecured. Winklevoss-owned Gemini, also being sued by the Attorney General, knew as early as February 2021 that Genesis was risk-prone, yet entrusted its customers’ funds to Genesis to earn yield for the supposedly “low-risk” Earn program.  Is this amateur hour? Or what we would expect of boardroom-level financial dealings in a hot market? Where James’ might overcomplicate things in her lawsuit is by grouping together a number of firms — many of which are feuding publicly — and splitting a number of arrangements into ""two distinct fraudulent schemes.” The ""Gemini Scheme,"" perpetrated by that legacy institution of crypto, lent money to a firm it supposedly knew it shouldn’t (Genesis), and misrepresented its own offerings (Earn).  See also: Gemini Blasts DCG and Genesis Bankruptcy Plan, Calling It  The so-called ""DCG Scheme"" is of a different kind — an apparent attempt to conceal a ""structural hole"" of $1 billion at Genesis Capital. Despite being party to the case, for allegedly lying to customers, Gemini said the lawsuit vindicated its position that the firm was ""lied to."" Lied and lied to isn't far off as a description of the ""greater fool theory"" said to drive bull markets — where one ""fool"" buys an overpriced asset hoping sell it at a profit to an even ""greater fool.""  In crypto, companies are often more intertwined and dependent than you would suspect, and, after a while, all of the schemes that brought down firms like Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and BlockFi begin to rhyme. Lied and lied to. Genesis’ hole appeared after the collapse of 3AC, itself brought down by the implosion of Do Kwon’s UST stablecoin.  However, there are real differences of kind and degree in the many business failings following crypto’s largest market run-up to date. Yet, if there is a single lesson to be learned through it all, it’s that even the experienced can fall prey to wishful thinking.

XRP spiked as much as 6% as the SEC abandoned charges against Ripple Labs executives.  Bitcoin [BTC] was holding a modest gain at $28,600 midday Thursday despite news that might have been expected to send the crypto sharply lower.  The state of New York earlier today filed a lawsuit against Digital Currency Group, its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital and crypto exchange Gemini alleging fraud to the tune of more than $1 billion.  Alongside, interest rates continue their sharp rise, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield up another 6 basis points to 4.97%, threatening to top 5% for the first time since prior to the global financial crisis. That, in turn, has sent stocks lower for a second consecutive day.  Bitcoin, however, remains higher by 1% to $28,600 after earlier in the session having made a brief run to just shy of $29,000.  Most large-cap alternative cryptocurrencies – altcoins – traded flat, with ether [ETH], Binance-adjacent token BNB, Polkadot's DOT, dogecoin [DOGE] slightly down. Solana [SOL] defied the trend, jumping 5% during the day.  XRP, a cryptocurrency related to the Ripple network, spiked over 6% late Thursday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped charges against Ripple Labs chief executive Brad Garlinghouse and chairman Chris Larsen. The agency said it will continue pursue damages against the company.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks a basket of digital assets including BTC with the largest weight, was slightly up 0.3%.  Also at work were U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks at the Economic Club of New York. He said that inflation is still too high but rising long-term bond yields could mean less need for further interest rate hikes. Powell signaled the Fed will likely keep rates unchanged in November but kept the option open for a potential hike in December.  The lawsuit hasn't appeared to impact the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) share price, which was up near 2% during the day, per TradingView data. Asset manager Grayscale, another subsidiary of DCG, intends to convert its massive $15 billion bitcoin investment vehicle into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The firm bagged a court victory against the SEC in August for denying its application for conversion. The SEC failed to appeal the decision last week.

42419403,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEPpl,1697739455,U.S. Treasury Seeks to Name Crypto Mixers as 'Money Laundering Concern',"U.S. authorities are looking to target the whole class of crypto mixers as a money-laundering threat, a sweeping move they've never taken before.  If the mixers are declared a 'primary money laundering concern,' U.S. financial firms could face restrictions in their interactions with them.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury's financial crimes arm is proposing to label crypto mixers as a ""primary money laundering concern"" in its effort to combat illicit crypto finance, highlighting the terrorist groups that have benefited from anonymous crypto funds, including possibly Hamas.  The Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on Thursday, which will be open to public comment for 90 days.  “Today’s action underscores Treasury’s commitment to combating the exploitation of Convertible Virtual Currency mixing by a broad range of illicit actors, including state-affiliated cyber actors, cyber criminals, and terrorist groups,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo, in a statement that cited the agency's past actions against Tornado Cash and Blender.io.  FinCEN said that mixing services, which seek to allow users to conduct transactions with anonymity, are used by a ""variety of illicit actors throughout the world,"" referring by name to Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The agency said this proposed rule is a ""key part"" of the ongoing effort to boost transparency in the crypto markets.  The Treasury Department and the wider administration of President Joe Biden have been under pressure from U.S. lawmakers to do something about the use of crypto to support terrorism, especially in light of reports that Hamas received some crypto donations in advance of its attack this month in Israel.  FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki noted that this is her agency's “first ever use"" of its power to target so-called primary money laundering concerns on a whole class of transactions.  If the designation is made, the Treasury Department can impose restrictions on U.S. financial firms' dealings with the mixers, which ""range from requiring additional due diligence and special attention concerning particular account transactions among U.S. financial institutions to prohibiting the opening or maintenance of any correspondent or payable-through accounts.""  After the comment period, the agency will have to review that input before it can advance a final rule.  Earlier this week, the Treasury also announced sanctions against individuals and entities tied to Hamas, including a Gaza-based business accused of being a bitcoin conduit for terrorists.

19072110,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556093,1697738414,"Wait For Bitcoin At $20,000? This Analyst Says No","An analyst has explained using on-chain data that Bitcoin has a major demand bucket at the current price levels, so it won’t hit $20,000 anytime soon. Huge Bitcoin Buying Occurred Inside The $25,000 To $30,000 Range In a new post on X, analyst Ali has explained that some large entities accumulated at the $25,000 to $30,000 range. The indicator of interest here is the “UTXO Realized Price Distribution” (URPD), which, in short, tells us about the amount of Bitcoin that was acquired at the different price levels of the cryptocurrency. Here is a chart that shows how the URPD of the current Bitcoin market looks like: The data for the distribution of the supply over the different price levels | Source: @ali_charts on X Notice that the URPD here is “ATH-partitioned.” What this means is that the price ranges here have been defined by creating 100 equally spaced partitions between zero and the all-time high (ATH) of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: This Rare Bullish Bitcoin Crossover Could Soon Form, Quant Predicts When From the graph of the Bitcoin URPD, it’s visible that the price levels between $25,000 and $30,000 are host to the cost basis of a particularly large amount of the supply. Ali notes that most people, including major institutional investors like Michael Saylor’s Microstrategy and Elon Musk’s Tesla, purchased a significant number of coins between these levels. The levels being so dense with supply isn’t only significant because of the fact that these large entities believe those prices were worthy buys, but also due to how investor psychology tends to work out. Generally, whenever the price retests the cost basis of a holder, they may become more probable to show some reaction. How they would react depends on their sentiment and profit/loss status prior to the retest. If they had been i9n profits before the price declined towards their cost basis, they may believe the price would go up again in the future so they would accumulate more at the dip. On the other hand, them being at loss before may make them sell at their cost basis, as they would find the idea of breaking-even more enticing than potentially going back into losses. There are some dense price buckets above the current level, meaning that BTC could feel resistance when it would retest them due to such investors exiting at their break-even. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cap Could Rise By $1 Trillion After Spot ETFs Launch: CryptoQuant If Bitcoin declines instead, however, it could feel strong support, as the buckets below are zones of some pretty major demand, so at least some of these investors might be inclined to buy more at these same levels. Thus, a decline below this range could be unlikely for the cryptocurrency. “So when they tell you “It’s too late to buy BTC” or “Wait for $20k,” please ignore them!”, advises the analyst.

DCG is also the parent of company of Grayscale Investments, the manager of the $16.7 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is in the process of attempting to win SEC approval to convert that closed-end fund into a spot bitcoin ETF (DCG is also the parent of CoinDesk).  Even as Grayscale was not accused of any wrongdoing, analysts are speculating over whether the lawsuit might have any implications for its GBTC conversion chances.  “This strikes me as enough for SEC to put GBTC conversion on ice, at least for now,” tweeted Travis Kling, founder of crypto asset management firm Ikigai. “[The] SEC could still approve spot ETFs though.”  Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart suggested that the only relationship that could have impacted GBTC is that Genesis was the sole authorized participant (AP) of GBTC for most of its existence until late 2022 when it stopped being an AP for the fund.  “But that isn't the smoking gun that some seem to think,” he said. “Being an AP is an agreement to be the facilitator of creating and redeeming shares in a fund.”  Seyffart explained that in this case someone hands over bitcoin to Genesis and they’d go through the process of giving 'equivalent' value of GBTC shares in return.  “In this case there was admittedly a closer relationship because they are/were sister companies at DCG,” according to Seyffart. He concluded that with the current information available, there seems to be no impact on GBTC’s application from the DCG lawsuit.  GBTC’s shares are up 2.4% on the day, slightly more than bitcoin itself, suggesting the market has not taken the lawsuit as a negative to the chances of a conversion.  David Weisberger, CEO and co-founder of algorithmic-trading platform CoinRoutes, also saw the lawsuit as unrelated to the conversion of the fund.  “I am neither an attorney nor legal expert, but I don’t think there’s any scenario in which Grayscale will sell their bitcoin and dissolve their trusts, regardless of this lawsuit,” said Weisberger. “Even if DCG is forced to sell the trust, it would just come under operational management by a different entity. As a result, this case seems unrelated to the likelihood of the Greyscale trust conversion to an ETFs being approved.”  Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, said he doesn’t think the lawsuit matters with respect to the conversion.  “Grayscale owns GBTC but GBTC is its own bankruptcy remote trust,” Farrell said.  Grayscale did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/19/will-lawsuit-against-dcg-impact-gbtcs-chances-of-an-etf-conversion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9180848b8301d8f2a26afc9e67c96de8e329cf2-1622x912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, another Bitcoin maximalist, Steve Barbour, has referred to the leading platform for smart contracts as garbage. Bitcoin Maximalist Makes Controversial Claim About Ethereum In a social media post on X, the prominent Bitcoin enthusiast recently called Ethereum “garbage” and said it has no future. His argument essentially boils down to Ethereum failing to attract investors from the free market and nothing else. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Price Reach $1,000,000? Pundit Lays Out A Timeline Ethereum is garbage. The free market doesn’t want it and the captured market still can’t figure out what it is for. — Steve Barbour (@SGBarbour) October 16, 2023 Barbour is the founder of Upstream Data, a mining infrastructure company building off-grid Bitcoin mining rigs. His claim comes behind the heels of Ethereum staking rewards falling to new lows. The number of Ethereum in staking pools has been steadily growing over the past few months; however, this has not been accompanied by increased profitability. According to CoinGecko, liquid staking protocols accounted for 43.7% of the total 26.4 million ETH staked in August 2023. The annual percentage yield (APY) from ETH staking has decreased over the years, going from 18% in 2020 to 3% in October. Since 2022, these protocols have paid out 100,000 ETH in quarterly incentives for staking, but the low APY has led many investors to question if staking ETH is still worthwhile. Barbour and other Bitcoin maximalists claim that Ethereum is not as decentralized as Bitcoin, particularly given that the blockchain has recently moved from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus process. Most of them believe that Bitcoin is the sole “true” cryptocurrency and that all other cryptocurrencies are worthless. Bitcoin maximalists have also been critical of other cryptocurrencies apart from Ethereum. Max Kaiser, another strong supporter of Bitcoin, has lately asserted that XRP is centralized. ETH price remains firmly above $1,500 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Responses And Reactions Ethereum has proven itself to be more than garbage, as evident in its vast number of supporters and large ecosystem. However, some supporters of Bitcoin agreed with the maximalist. Agreed. It’s full of speculators — Carnival_Poe (@Carnival_Poe) October 17, 2023 The free market has Ethereum now at $1,550. ETH has witnessed a 1.65% drop in price in the past 24 hours, and it continues to stay weaker against Bitcoin. Related Reading: Real Reason Behind Ethereum Founder’s Massive ETH ‘Sales’ Exposed On the other hand, Bitcoin has increased in dominance against altcoins. Most of the money and attention has flowed into Bitcoin, and the crypto has witnessed a 6.39% increase in the past seven days. As a result, ETH bulls have struggled to push above $1,600 and the crypto is now trading around the $1,550 support zone. If bulls fail to hold this level, it could start another decline to as low as $1,430.

James is seeking restitution for investors, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and a ban on all three firms from New York's financial investment industry. The complaint said that Gemini lent funds to Genesis as part of its Earn program, a high-yield crypto lending product. The funds were then lent to a number of counterparties, including now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, leaving Genesis with $1.1B in losses. The suit further alleged that Gemini had knowledge of Genesis' undersecured loans, but didn't disclose this information to investors. ""Gemini hid the risks of investing with Genesis and Genesis lied to the public about its losses. This fraud is yet another example of bad actors causing harm throughout the under-regulated cryptocurrency industry,"" James said . Update at 2:20 PM ET: In a statement on social media platform X, Digital Currency Group said it will fight the claims. ""We were blindsided by the filing of the complaint, and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by DCG, Barry Silbert (its CEO), or its employees,"" it said . The company had been cooperating with the N.Y. Attorney General's investigation for months, it said.

It is unfortunate that this lawsuit omits that fundamental fact.""

42419412,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEPwz,1697732000,'Absolutely Not': FTX's Former General Counsel Says He Never Approved Loans of Customer Funds,"NEW YORK – FTX’s general counsel “never approved” the crypto exchange lending customer funds to sister firm Alameda Research, he told the jury on day 12 of Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal fraud trial.  Can Sun, who was the general counsel at FTX from August 2021 to the time of the exchange’s collapse in November 2022, said “absolutely not” when asked Thursday whether he signed off on Alameda’s use of FTX customer funds.  Sun testified he believed FTX customers' funds were kept segregated from the company’s own funds, based on conversations he’d had with Bankman-Fried.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon walked Sun through FTX’s terms of service and other public statements supporting the Department of Justice’s thesis that FTX misappropriated customer funds.  Various documents said FTX customer funds were supposed to be “ring-fenced” from FTX’s own funds, Sun said.  Sun, who testified under a non-prosecution agreement, also described how he tracked loans to FTX and Alameda executives – but his record of the loans did not match another document the DOJ showed him, he said.  Throughout his testimony, he reiterated that he did not know customer funds were involved in those loans.  After a brief cross-examination, Sun wrapped his testimony in the late morning.  From $60 million to zero  Robert Boroujerdi, a director at Third Point, the investment firm founded by Dan Loeb, briefly took the stand, testifying that his company invested $60 million in FTX.  The investment is now worth $0, he said.  Third Point saw both audited and unaudited financials, said Boroujerdi, a veteran of Wall Street investment banking colossus Goldman Sachs.  The trial will resume next Thursday, Oct. 26, with the DOJ's final witnesses. Prosecutors said at the opening of Thursday's session that they expected to wrap up quickly after the week-long break. The defense will begin presenting its case – if it chooses to do so – after lunch on Thursday, Oct. 26.  Bankman-Fried has not yet said whether he will testify in his defense.

Bitcoin Open Interest Has Declined, While Ethereum Has Seen Rise According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the BTC open interest has been going down since Monday. The “open interest” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin contracts (in USD) that are currently open on the futures and options market. When the value of this metric increases, it means that there are more positions being opened up on derivative exchanges right now. Such a trend can lead to increased volatility for the asset, as more positions generally come with higher overall leverage for the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cap Could Rise By $1 Trillion After Spot ETFs Launch: CryptoQuant On the other hand, decreasing values suggest the traders are either closing off their positions or are getting liquidated. The cryptocurrency may become calmer following this kind of trend. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the open interest for Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past month: Looks like the two metrics have been going opposite ways in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, The Bitcoin open interest has observed a downtrend in the last few days. This decline in the indicator had first started when the fake iShares ETF announcement led to more than $100 million shorts being flushed in a flash. The metric saw a bit of a rebound not too long after this sudden sharp liquidation squeeze took place, but it was quick to return back toward a downward trajectory. At the same time that this latest decline in the Bitcoin open interest has occurred, the Ethereum open interest has registered a rise instead. This suggests that while contracts are closing up on BTC futures and options, the ETH side of the market is seeing renewed interest. Interestingly, as Santiment has highlighted in the chart, the last time this trend occurred, the Bitcoin price benefited from an uplift. This previous occurrence of the pattern was between September 28 and 30, and shortly after this, the BTC price saw an increase of about 4.5%. The divergence between the metrics of the two assets was much more pronounced back then as compared to now; however, the scales of both the decline in the BTC open interest and the rise in the ETH open interest were far greater. Related Reading: This Rare Bullish Bitcoin Crossover Could Soon Form, Quant Predicts When Nonetheless, the same general pattern has still repeated this time, so it now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin would see a bullish effect this time as well, and if so, to what degree, given the lesser scale of the divergence.

42419398,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEPmf,1697730300,Crypto for Advisors: What Will Trigger Crypto Mass Adoption?,"Crypto enthusiasts anxiously await everyone “getting it"" and the masses entering and investing in crypto. But what will be the trigger? Will Ferrari's announcement that you can pay for your car in bitcoin in the US tip the scales - unlikely (just my opinion)?  Andy Baehr, managing director of CoinDesk Indices, tackles this topic and discusses scenarios which could drive the world towards crypto mass adoption.  Also, please answer a few questions in our bitcoin ETF survey . We will reveal the results in next week's newsletter.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Repeat After Me  Can the crypto industry, skewed towards innovators, entrepreneurs and ardent futurists focus on a Bitcoin 101 campaign and create real, deep, intuition for a broader audience, including the giant distribution engine that delivers financial services?  Once you spend some time in crypto, it is easy to lose sight of a critically important objective: mass adoption as a new asset class and integration into investment portfolios. And while great promise lies ahead for a rich, diverse and dynamic universe of tokens, the first (and largest) addition to most portfolios will be bitcoin.  Two recent experiences highlight the gap between the front of the crypto product curve and its belly:  Scene 1: A spirited dinner with DeFi tablemates. The projects were fascinating and the enthusiasm palpable. These were neither frivolous nor unseasoned people. These were builders. But wait, I thought, how much potential TVL is sitting at this table? $1 billion? $5 billion?  I asked, “How are we going to get a hundred billion dollars in bitcoin integrated into investment portfolios?”  That stopped the dinner party cold. It was a problem no one felt like solving and a token that no one felt like discussing. Bitcoin’s constraints – many of which strengthen its appeal as a monetary asset – made it the wrong Play-Doh for this crowd. (Eventually, they relented.)  Scene 2: It is raining so hard in NYC that a sea lion escaped the Central Park Zoo as I caught up with a friend over coffee. She runs a fast-growing business designing and selling portfolio-enhancing structured derivatives to institutional investors at a major investment bank. Naturally, I wanted to ask what she was doing with crypto.  “Oh, me? Nothing. I know so little about it,” she said, tacitly acknowledging my surprise. Here is a talented, tack-sharp and intellectually curious financial professional who, like many derivatives people, is an early adopter and fluent in several asset classes. This person hasn’t thought about crypto?  We have work to do.  DeFi isn’t the only topic drawing energy away from this mission. Tokenzing RWA is the inescapable topic du jour. Crypto sectors, around which we have some market-leading products, lean on traditional sector intuition. ETH’s investment case, now featuring a measurable staking rate, fits nicely into TradFi’s mental models, even if ETH demand seems muted.  I get it. It’s hard to sing the same hymn year after year, especially when we have jobs and budgets labeled “2023.” We get fatigued talking about U.S. spot bitcoin ETF approval. We want to emerge from the regulatory paralysis, move on (with lessons learned!) from the adolescent mishaps of 2022, and focus our gaze onward and upward.  Good news: I do see some “back to bitcoin basics” initiatives. Fidelity Digital Assets chose to update its Bitcoin First report in October. Here in Crypto for Advisors, Jennifer Murphy of Runa Digital Assets proclaimed that, “a Blackrock-branded Bitcoin ETF will do more to accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets than anything that’s happened in the history of crypto,” and Brian Rudick and Matt Kunke from GSR devoted an entire piece to Bitcoin and the Bull.  There is no shortage of early adopters in digital assets. Coinbase claims that 52 million Americans own crypto. Great, but that doesn’t solve the “last mile” problem of integration. “My investments are over here and my crypto is over there,” keeps digital assets a peripheral pursuit.  Our objective, and our discipline, has to include a steady, credible, relevant conversation about what bitcoin is, why it’s important, how it can improve investment portfolios, and why you need to care. When the products arrive, we will be ready.  – Andy Baehr, CFA, Managing Director, CoinDesk Indices  Bitcoin ETF Survey  If or when a bitcoin spot etf is approved, will you invest for your clients?

42419407,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEPtt,1697728520,Global Bitcoin ATM Numbers Sink to Lowest Level Since 2021,"The number of bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide sank to a two-year low this month, according to data from AltIndex.  Since the end of last year, the number installed has dropped 7,000, or 17%, to 32,500, AltIndex said on Wednesday. That follows an increase from 34,500 at end-2021.  The U.S., which hosts the largest number of machines, saw the biggest drop. There are now about 26,700 machines in the country. Still, the world's largest economy still has almost 18 times the number installed across the whole of Europe, which hosts some 1,500.  AltIndex attributes the decline to controversies about their potentially criminal use. For example, scammers may advertise goods for sale on sites like eBay, ask buyers to deposit funds into a specific bitcoin wallet through ATM, and then vanish.  Brandon Mintz, the CEO and founder of publicly traded bitcoin ATM operator Bitcoin Depot (BTM) said the trend is due to some operators turning off unprofitable ATMs or going out of business altogether.  ""This creates an opportunity for us that allows us to further increase market share through acquisitions and organic kiosk growth in additional retail locations,” he told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.

19065892,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556086,1697727646,ETH Price Watch: Impact On Price As Traders Ditch Bitcoin On Derivatives Market,"Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been on a downward trajectory for the past three months. Despite a brief fake-out rally, ETH has struggled to regain its footing in the crypto market. The recent rally, though short-lived, has brought about interesting developments in the derivatives market. While Bitcoin’s open interest (OI) witnessed a significant drop, Ethereum saw an increase in its OI. Open interest, often abbreviated as OI, is a crucial metric in the world of cryptocurrency derivatives. It represents the total value of outstanding contracts in the market. In simpler terms, it measures the amount of money traders have invested in futures or options contracts for a specific cryptocurrency. ETH’s OI Garners More Interest As of October, the crypto derivatives market has depicted an intriguing scenario. Bitcoin’s OI has been hovering around $6 billion, while Ethereum’s stands at $2.8 billion. Although ETH has not surpassed BTC in terms of open interest, it has certainly garnered more attention and interest. Bitcoin and Ethereum Open Interest. Source: FXStreet A recent fake rally in Bitcoin’s price, triggered by false reports of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF, had a substantial impact on the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) declined by more than $270 million, decreasing to $5.7 billion as investors reacted to the misleading information. On the other hand, Ethereum’s OI increased by over $93 million, reaching $2.8 billion during the same period, highlighting its resilience in the face of market volatility. These events underscore the cryptocurrency market’s sensitivity to news and rumors, emphasizing the importance of accurate information in this space. Furthermore, the contrasting trajectories of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s OI showcase Ethereum’s ability to attract renewed investor interest and maintain stability, solidifying its position as a prominent and enduring cryptocurrency in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Climbs 22% – A Close Look At The Factors Behind The Surge ETH market cap currently at $187 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Potential Price Impact And ETH Current Status At the time of writing, the CoinGecko price for Ethereum is $1,548. It’s noteworthy that ETH has experienced a 1.9% dip in the past 24 hours and a 0.6% loss over the past week. Analyzing the daily price chart, Ethereum’s price action is characterized by a rising wedge formation. This formation serves as a key determinant of ETH’s short-term trajectory. As long as the trendlines defining this pattern remain intact, there’s potential for the coin to serve as a dynamic support zone for buyers during market corrections. Related Reading: Dogecoin Next Move: Will $0.055 Launch A Recovery Phase? However, a more pessimistic scenario looms in the event of a breakdown below the lower boundary of this wedge, which could signal the onset of a major correction for Ethereum.

""We can estimate potential inflows of $12-24 billion into the Bitcoin ETF. While the market cap of GBTC is currently only $17-18 billion, it reached a peak of $44 billion.

""15,000-strong U.S. registered investor advisor (RIA) community [are] overseeing around $5 trillion.

With a larger influx of $50 billion (1% allocation from RIAs), Bitcoin could potentially rally to $56,000,"" Matrixport said.

42419396,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEPiX,1697724127,"What Crypto Can Learn From Regulatory Overhauls at PayPal, Robinhood and Revolut","Concerns that over-regulation can stifle innovation and hinder the growth of Web3 are valid. But proper rules and laws can equally save and supercharge crypto.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week sponsored by Chainalysis. Anne-Sophie Cissey is the head of legal and compliance at Flowdesk, a Paris-based market-making technology company.  Regulators have in the past stifled or curbed innovation when hastily responding to unexpected events. While the contagion of FTX last year demonstrated the need for regulation that enforces transparency and customer protection, the recent rapid crackdown has lacked a cohesive framework.  In spite of that, regulatory oversight can also be a force of stability, transparency and legitimacy for emerging industries. Thus it is more important now than ever for Web3 to collaborate with regulators to ensure the future of their emerging industry. There are many compelling Web2 examples where regulation played a crucial role in strengthening the industry’s foundations.  Regulation encourages businesses to act properly, balancing privacy with financial freedom  One such example is PayPal. The company secured an alternative avenue for consumers and merchants alike to engage in financial processes without the need to set up a bank account.  See also: What's Wrong With PayPal's Stablecoin? | Opinion  Responding to regulation — PayPal went on to become one of the first successful online payment providers, transforming payment services from a private good to a public good.  This innovation came during the backdrop of intense anti-terrorism and money laundering litigation as mandated by the PATRIOT Act that sought to guarantee greater security for American citizens. The regulation changed PayPal. It obligated the company to provide a robust means through which it could prove that it properly vets its customers — while providing users with easy access to finance.  PayPal's compliance with the legislation enabled the company to expand its services beyond the United States, too. This expansion helped to increase PayPal's revenue and market share, while also providing greater convenience and accessibility to its users.  Similarly, regulation in crypto can encourage greater transparency by utilizing blockchain’s distributed ledger technology. We’ve seen legislation such as MiCA attempt to implement verification measures to bring Web3 in line with existing financial institutions. For example, it limits non-KYC’ed wallet addresses to 1,000 euros (~$1,057) per transaction — while KYCd addresses can transact freely. This could be considered a positive step in the right direction. Larger participants hold a greater share of the market, so, they should be held more accountable for their on-chain behavior.  Regulators can enforce proper accountability  Regulators could potentially embrace the role of the “superhero” by enforcing stricter liability on businesses that behave improperly. In doing so, businesses have an incentive to exceed compliance measures whilst also protecting consumers.  FINRA Rule 5310 requires broker-dealers to exercise ""reasonable diligence"" to ensure their customers receive the best execution when conducting trades. Robinhood has in the past been criticized for not providing sufficient risk disclosures, particularly regarding options trading. The company had been accused of encouraging inexperienced investors to engage in risky trading strategies without adequately disclosing the potential downsides. Regulatory probing led to Robinhood being fined $70 million. This put pressure on the company to adopt a more stringent supervisory process.  Robinhood’s case can be likened to the lackluster risk disclosure on many decentralized exchanges we see today. The learning curve for users onboarding and within Web3 remains steep, and the oversight of how on-chain code is implemented is minimal. Combine this with a rapidly evolving landscape and it becomes clear that adequate access to information will be the cornerstone of future innovation.  This suggests that government consultations such as the one recently undertaken by the U.K. government are important in defining the responsibilities of businesses to consumers and how these businesses should fundamentally operate.  There are many compelling Web2 examples where regulation played a crucial role in strengthening the industry’s foundations.  Improving businesses’ credibility, user experiences  Regulation has encouraged greater ease of use by enforcing a higher level of base-customer protection.  In 2019, the European Union introduced new regulations that required all online payments to go through a two-factor authentication process called Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). This was introduced to prevent users from falling victim to scams and other instances of financial fraud.  Revolut responded to this regulation by developing an innovative solution that utilizes biometric authentication. The users of the service can now use their fingerprint or face recognition to authenticate their transactions, making the payment process faster and more secure. Thus, significantly improving their user experience.  This authentication requirement can be correlated to the use of hardware wallets in web3 that has an added layer of security before transactions are processed. Only individuals possessing the physical device are able to approve transactions. A simple analogy would be how one-time-passwords (OTP) are sent to mobile devices for Web2 payments. This stands in contrast to “hot” wallets that are connected to the internet and can be accessed virtually by anyone and anywhere around the world. Regulation that helps streamline this verification process for transactions could potentially help garner ease of use and further adoption. This would help strengthen the credibility of the Web3 ecosystem as platforms’ accessibility improves as a result.  See also: How Clear and Effective Crypto Regulations are Born | State of Crypto Week  Therefore, it is clear that regulation could and perhaps should fill this gap in Web3 to provide a more comprehensive level of protection for all consumers to prevent a total loss of funds in cases where bad actors attempt to take advantage of users’ inexperience. In doing so, businesses operating in Web3 can expand their operations with greater credibility.  The verdict  It is evident that regulation in many instances has enabled innovation to progress and flourish. However, we must still approach the regulators’ superpowers with great caution.  Ideally, we would see a relationship in which regulation is utilized as a tool to serve to the benefit of Web3 rather than its detriment. So it remains to be seen whether lawmakers and regulators decide to curb innovation or supercharge it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Anne-Sophie Cissey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/19/what-crypto-can-learn-from-regulatory-overhauls-at-paypal-robinhood-and-revolut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65ed3e4ce5e390ce51283517caa9d60180c282c5-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
19063963,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556074,1697724046,XRP Price Set For Massive Rally As BlackRock And JPMorgan Make Their Move,"Amid the struggles in the cryptocurrency market, recent reports have suggested that the world’s largest asset manager Blackrock, and financial giant JPMorgan might spark a massive bull run for the XRP price as they work simultaneously. Blackrock, JPMorgan Move Might Affect XRP Price According to the report, Forbes Senior Contributor, Billy Bambrough, highlighted that Blackrock and JPMorgan are purportedly laying the foundation for an impending surge in the cryptocurrency sector. The report further identified several collaborative cryptocurrency moves taken by the two financial powerhouse firms. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $100: Here’s How To Become A Millionaire Bambrough pointed out a recent report that claims that the asset manager recently utilized JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx network and tokenized collateral service. Blackrock reportedly used the network to tokenize shares from one of its financial market funds, which was later transferred to the London-based Barclays in an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative operations occur between two parties. However, the specifics of the order quantity, cost, and other information of Blockrock’s transactions with Barclays remain concealed from the public. Following the report by Bambrough, it was revealed that Blackrock became the first Wall Street giant to make use of JPMorgan’s blockchain-based collateral settlement system. This was part of a move that Blackrock’s Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, has stated will pave the way for the “next generation for markets.” The Blackrock CEO’s previous statement in an annual letter to shareholders where he emphasized blockchain technology as “very important” in the past year was also mentioned in the report. Fink highlighted the role that blockchain technology plays in their financial operations. Blockchain technology enables traditional assets to be “tokenized” on a public ledger, potentially simplifying and lowering the cost of transferring anything from stocks and bonds to real estate and alternative investments like art. Due to this, Billy Bambrough believes that there will be a significant increase in the price of digital assets such as XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) as a result of BlackRock and JPMorgan entering the cryptocurrency industry, considering their connections to the traditional market. In addition, Ripple is also aiming to establish the XRP Ledger as a crucial platform for the tokenization of real-world assets. BlackRock using XRP would not doubt have an immense impact on the XRP price. An example of the kind of rally it could trigger is what happened back in June with Bitcoin when the asset manager announced it had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Significance Of Blackrock’s Transaction Via JPMorgan Blockchain So far, Blackrock’s partnering with JPMorgan marks a new milestone for the financial firm. Blackrock’s recent transaction via JPMorgan’s blockchain indicates a crucial contribution to the volume of the Ethereum-based network Onyx.

Austin, Texas-based Onramp launched a spot bitcoin (BTC) trust in April targeting high-net-worth investors.  As with the trust, Onramp is harnessing multisignature (multisig) security, in which several custodians control the private keys to the bitcoin being held. The asset manager has tapped BitGo to perform this role alongside Coincover and Kingdom Trust, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.  Two out of the three keys are necessary to move funds in the vault at the client's request.  The aim of this approach is to eliminate single points of failure and thus offer institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals reassurance when investing in bitcoin.  Bitcoin-only trend  The new platform illustrates a move toward bitcoin-only services in response to demand from clients who want to invest in the largest cryptocurrency while avoiding exposure to the rest of the digital asset market. BitGo, for example, recently teamed up with financial services firm Swan to form a bitcoin-only trust company, the first such firm in the U.S.  ""Bitcoin-only products and services are the market's way of pricing in a flight to quality and safety,"" Onramp co-founder and CEO Michael Tanguma told CoinDesk in a statement.  Tanguma said he believes bitcoin offers investors a degree of regulatory clarity that other digital assets lack. BTC's classification as a commodity by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is ""the only thing the [regulators] seem to agree on,"" he said.

19061982,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556070,1697720448,Solana Critical Path: Why The Next Solana Moves Demand Attention,"Solana (SOL) has been navigating a challenging correction phase for approximately two months, during which its fortunes have ebbed and flowed. The most recent dip, occurring on Aug. 15, was a direct response to a sudden decline in the price of Bitcoin, sending shockwaves throughout the crypto market. However, a closer examination of Solana’s price chart reveals an emerging inverse head and shoulders pattern. For those unfamiliar with the inverse head and shoulders pattern, it is a technical chart formation that signals a potential trend reversal. It consists of three key components: a lower low (the head) with two higher lows on either side (the shoulders), forming an inverted “T” shape. This pattern typically signifies a shift from a bearish trend to a bullish one, making it an enticing prospect for investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Takes A Steep Dive: 91% Decrease In 24 Hours Solana appears to be sketching out this intriguing configuration, hinting at the possibility of a significant upswing in its price. However, the realization of this bullish scenario hinges significantly on SOL’s ability to breach a crucial resistance point known as the neckline. Solana’s Potential Trajectory As of the latest data available on CoinGecko, Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $23.79. Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency experienced a slight dip of 0.6%, while it boasted a seven-day rally of 9.9%. These fluctuations reflect the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers, each vying for control of SOL’s price trajectory. SOL seven-day price movement. Source: Coingecko SOL: From Support To Vulnerability Solana has come a long way from its support level at $22.38, offering sellers an opportunity to exert pressure on the cryptocurrency. If the selling pressure persists, price predictions indicate that SOL could drop another 12%, potentially reaching a price of $18.8. The market’s vulnerability underscores the need for a cautious approach, both for existing investors and potential buyers. A closer examination of the daily timeframe chart reveals a distinct downward trend characterizing the ongoing correction phase of the cryptocurrency. Sellers are likely to continue exploiting any resistance points during bullish bounces, making it essential for investors to exercise caution. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.06 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com As the market continues on its downward trajectory, potential buyers are advised to exercise patience. The best strategy might be to wait until the neckline resistance is breached, signaling a change in trend. Timing remains paramount, and investors should be prepared to act when the conditions are right. Related Reading: Dogecoin Next Move: Will $0.055 Launch A Recovery Phase?

Coinbase has picked Ireland to be its regulatory hub within the European Union (EU), the company said.

""Ireland has a supportive political environment for FinTech companies, as well as a globally respected regulator,"" said a statement by Coinbase's Vice President and Regional Managing Director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, of the EU country that already plays host to tech giants like Apple and Google. ""We look forward to working with regulators in Ireland, Germany and beyond to bring this industry to its full potential with the advent of MiCA.”  The crypto winter may be over, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management said in a post examining whether the recent bear market in digital assets has run its course. “Based on current data, signs indicate that crypto winter may be in the past and that crypto spring is likely on the horizon,” the Tuesday post said. The investment manager noted that the trough in bitcoin (BTC) prices in previous crypto winters occurred 12 to 14 months after the peak. The cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of around $68,000 in November 2021 and bottomed out a year later. “A 50% increase in price from bitcoin’s low is typically a good sign that the trough has been achieved,” strategist Denny Galindo wrote. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has risen 70% year-to-date and 77% from last year’s lows.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows share of TRY, BRL, EUR.

19059971,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556047,1697716823,Is This The Best Bitcoin Price Indicator Right Now? Must-Know Details,"Following recent geopolitical events, the correlation between gold and Bitcoin prices has once again come under scrutiny by market analysts. Here’s a comprehensive dive into the relationship and its implications. The Gold And Bitcoin Correlation After the recent Israel-Hamas war, gold experienced a rapid uptick in its price. This shift interestingly mirrored movements in the Bitcoin market, emphasizing a revived correlation between the two assets. Skew, a reputable market analyst, shared his insights on X (formerly Twitter), noting on October 11 that “correlation has been rather loosely applicable to BTC periods of 35 days + where there’s price disconnection between both markets.” Related Reading: This Rare Bullish Bitcoin Crossover Could Soon Form, Quant Predicts When However, only days later, on October 16, he observed a potential “re-correlation” as both Bitcoin followed the latest gold rally. Today, the statement stands stronger with Skew’s latest tweet, “BTC & gold correlation still there it seems. Gold may lead the next big move for BTC.” In his recent insights shared in the Onramp Weekly Roundup, Bitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair emphasized the implications of the ongoing selloff in government bonds. Rising costs for long-term financing directly influence the global cost of capital, offering a valuation yardstick for various assets. More significantly, the treasury market underpins the global financial ecosystem. Its current instability could pressure asset prices and exacerbate the pre-existing debt cycle, potentially endangering the US’s fiscal position. This precarious state contrasts sharply with the US administration’s fiscal actions, as evidenced by plans like the “WHITE HOUSE EYES $100 BILLION UKRAINE, ISRAEL AND BORDER ASK”, suggesting a lack of fiscal restraint, according to LeClair. Gold, Real Yields, And The Changing Landscape Further complicating matters, Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in his recent Bloomberg piece, noted the likelihood of the current cycle of quantitative tightening (QT) persisting until late 2025. This prolonged QT could heighten long-term interest rates and risk treasury market turbulence. Yet, should severe dysfunction manifest in the treasury market, the Federal Reserve might reconsider its QT trajectory. Interestingly, post the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent confiscation of Russia’s G7 reserves, gold, and real yields have shown an atypical positive correlation, challenging their historical negative relationship. In this evolving geopolitical landscape where even G7 sovereign debt isn’t immune to confiscation, traditional ‘safe assets’ are being reevaluated. This uncertainty combined with the not-so-safe “risk free” yield from treasuries has bolstered gold’s position (and price) as a counter-risk monetary asset and may push Bitcoin on a similar trajectory. According to LeClair: This repositioning, however, isn’t limited to gold alone. Bitcoin, with its unique advantages and growing liquidity profile, is on a similar trajectory, albeit still in the very early stages of its monetization with a $500b market cap. The Best BTC Price Indicator? Under these current conditions, the price of gold may be a leading indicator for the price of Bitcoin, assuming that the correlation between the two assets continues. This would imply that Bitcoin is classified as a “safe haven” asset like gold by a majority of investors, rather than a “risk asset”. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Rises: Why Altcoin Buying May Need A Break However, this view is not shared by all. James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, pointed out that the Bitcoin market has shifted its focus after the fake news regarding a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. He remarked that investors now seem to prioritize the ETF approval over macro expectations, placing less emphasis on the Federal Reserve’s actions. Since the Coin Telegraph tweet mistake on a Bitcoin Spot ETF approval, Bitcoin prices have decoupled from December interest rate expectations – it seems like investors are solely focussed on the ETF approval now, and not what the FED does.

The proposal, known as PIP 29, will be “responsible for the narrow-in-scope, timelock-limited changes to system smart contracts implemented on Ethereum for existing and future Polygon protocols,” Polygon said in a press release.  According to the announcement, the council will “execute the community-led process to initiate future upgrades, including those proposed in the Frontier phase of Polygon 2.0.”  The committee will consist of members from the wider blockchain community. They include Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase; Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation; Zaki Manian, co-founder of Sommelier Finance; and Jordi Baylina, a technical lead at Polygon Labs, which is the primary developer behind the Polygon project.  If these members want to execute changes to the Polygon blockchain, they will have to do so through a Safe contract, according to a press release.  Thursday’s announcement is part of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap, a series of proposals and upgrades released in June that will change the blueprint of the blockchain.  The idea for a ""community-controlled Ecosystem Council security model"" was initially floated in a post in June by a representative of Polygon Labs, the primary developer behind the various Polygon networks.  “This proposal is a first step in a broader goal of further decentralizing governance for Polygon protocols in a security-oriented and responsible way,” Polygon wrote in their blog post. “Going forward, the community will help steer membership and terms of the Council through direct feedback, PIP proposals, as well as off- and on-chain voting components.”  Read more: Polygon Takes Wraps Off Version 2.0",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | SPONSORED,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/19/polygon-proposes-council-for-decentralized-governance-names-13-members,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7344bb7352ed5ce5e3234988f9717c9c6e57d4d-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Particularly, LQTY holders are waiting in suspense to see if they will somehow stand to gain from v2’s protocol revenue. Here we take a look at how Liquity Protocol’s upcoming v2 stablecoin protocol can potentially be interlaced with both its v1 borrowing protocol and its associated stablecoin, LUSD, as well as its related Chicken Bonds protocol, to mutually benefit vis-a-vis apportioned liquidity incentives. “Though we are apt to take it for granted, it is by no means of the essence of money that within a given territory there should exist only one kind... there are always significant differences in the demand for different forms of money and money substitutes of varying degrees of liquidity.” - F.A. Hayek, "" Denationalisation of Money ,"" Third Edition, 1990, p. 77 In Latin, trivium refers to “the place where three roads meet.” In this post, I’ll discuss how Liquity Protocol’s ( LQTY-USD ) upcoming v2 stablecoin protocol , which aspires to solve the stablecoin trilemma , can potentially be interlaced with both its v1 borrowing protocol and its associated stablecoin, LUSD ( LUSD-USD ), as well as its related Chicken Bonds protocol , to mutually benefit vis-a-vis apportioned liquidity incentives. For the sake of brevity, I will assume the reader is familiar with these various products, so I will not go into great detail on their defining traits. One is thus encouraged to refer to the associated documents for LUSD and Chicken Bonds as linked above, and to read up on the preliminary information that has been provided with regards to Liquity’s forthcoming v2 stablecoin protocol, in order to better understand the ideas shared below. Overview An unanswered question as it relates to Liquity’s v2 stablecoin protocol is whether there will be any connection with it and its v1 borrowing protocol. Particularly, LQTY holders are waiting in suspense to see if they will somehow stand to gain from v2’s protocol revenue, as they currently receive all of v1’s protocol revenue in the form of LUSD borrowing fees and ETH ( ETH-USD ) redemption fees, depending on how much LQTY they have staked. As it stands, we don’t know if or how LQTY, and by extension the v1 borrowing protocol more broadly, may reciprocate with the v2 stablecoin protocol. Hence, this post seeks to propose three ideas for how the three products originating from the Liquity team - Liquity v1, Chicken Bonds, and Liquity v2 - can imaginably meet at a crossroads for shared gain. Note that details regarding the v2 stablecoin protocol’s revenue model are currently unavailable, but since we know it won’t be collateral-based like the v1 borrowing protocol and will instead utilize a reserve-backed approach, an overarching assumption of this post is that it could favorably incentivize holders of the v2 stablecoin to sustain the necessary backing for an in-built reserve from a portion of its revenue, while allocating a portion of its revenue to uphold synergy with v1 and Chicken Bonds too. I. Introduce boosted LQTY via Chicken Bonds “Yield from liquid staking has the potential to form the base of structured products in the coming future... liquid staking rewards are relatively stable and predictable, making them a reliable source of cash flow to create structured products.” - Danny Chong, "" Where Liquid Staking Meets Tokenization ,"" CoinDesk - Opinion, 9/29/23 In a recent and extensive interview with a few members of the Liquity team, a discussion ensued as to whether the LQTY token in its staked state can be used for other purposes, akin to how there are liquid staking tokens to represent staked ETH, for example. In response, it was mentioned by the Liquity team members that this is currently not available, though it was noted that the idea, if pursued, “could carry us a long way.” Interestingly, there exists the capability to offer a liquid staking derivative for LQTY via the associated yet separate Chicken Bonds protocol. This derivative, akin to its proof of concept in the form of boosted LUSD (bLUSD) , would be known as boosted LQTY (bLQTY), since it would offer auto-compounded yield as represented by its rising market price floor . A similar concept was developed several months ago by Yearn Finance ( YFI-USD ) in the form of yLQTY , though its very limited number of holders suggests that it does not appear to have gained much traction as of yet. Unlike bLUSD, bLQTY could be a more simpler design, as there would be no need for an in-built shifting functionality for peg maintanence , since LQTY is not a stablecoin. Presumably, offering bLQTY should be possible when considering the Liquity team contemplated introducing a Generalized Chicken Bonds implementation for other DeFi protocols in the future based on its lessons learned from bLUSD . As proposed herein, a portion of v2’s revenue may be directed to incentivizing liquidity for a bLQTY + LQTY pool, akin to the 3% “Chicken In” fee with bLUSD, such that the corresponding “Chicken In” fee may then be reduced for bLQTY. Accordingly, LQTY holders could indirectly benefit from some of v2’s revenue vis-a-vis the rollout of bLQTY, and bLQTY could represent a kind of enshrined liquid staking token that encompasses all three of Liquity’s products, conceivably facilitating its use as a collateral option across other DeFi protocols as well. II. Liquidity Incentives for bLUSD Like the proposal above for bLQTY, a portion of v2’s revenue may be directed to incentivizing liquidity for the existing bLUSD + LUSD3CRV trading pool. This would augment the 3% “Chicken In” fee for bLUSD that already incentivizes this pool, further boosting the appeal of acquiring bLUSD and/or providing liquidity for it. Since bLUSD is already integrated as collateral in Gravita Protocol , a friendly fork of Liquity’s v1 borrowing protocol, this idea could drive its use for such a purpose and could perhaps compel other DeFi protocols to consider integrating it as a whitelisted collateral asset too. This idea may also revitalize interest in bLUSD, which has dwindled since the beginning of this year per its treasury dashboard . III. Liquidity Incentives for the v2 stablecoin and LUSD Building on the aforementioned ideas, a portion of v2’s revenue may similarly be directed towards incentivizing a liquidity pool for the v2 stablecoin and LUSD. “The crucial point it must keep in mind will be that, to keep a large and growing amount of its currency in circulation, it will be not the demand for borrowing it but the willingness of the public to hold it that will be decisive.” - F.A. Hayek, "" Denationalisation of Money ,"" Third Edition, 1990, p. 62 Since the v2 stablecoin is intended to be more scalable than LUSD, it will naturally compete with more centralized stablecoins and their derivatives, and eventually the v2 stablecoin may even supplant these highly liquid alternatives because of its added benefit of being censorship-resistant. Consequently, it would be sensible to pair the v2 stablecoin with LUSD, as this would cultivate a “ying and yang” balance between the two since LUSD has proven its resilien ce as the most decentralized, collateral-based stablecoin on Ethereum, particularly since banking concerns around centralized stablecoins heightened earlier this year. Notably, since the v2 stablecoin will be linked to staked ETH, it will compromise a bit on decentralization since liquid staked ETH derivatives come with their own smart contract risks, and what form(s) of staked ETH the v2 stablecoin protocol will be reliant upon have yet to be disclosed. Hence, since LUSD is backed by ETH alone, it mitigates this issue in terms of its decentralization, though it is restrained in terms of its scalability. To add, a bonded version of the v2 stablecoin via Chicken Bonds may not be necesssary, since it will inherently be designed to be more capital efficient and thus more liquid than LUSD. As such, a pool composing of both stablecoins may be sufficiently incentivized to foster their utility beyond their respective intra-protocol reserve and stability pools. In fact, it will be essential for both stablecoins to be incentivized for use outside of their corresponding protocol’s in-built yield sources, as this will bolster their demand for being held and used in circulation, which will ultimately sustain the growth of their circulating supplies. This is especially critical when considering centralized stablecoins and their derivatives are providing their holders higher yields as a consequence of their exposure to treasury bonds offering rising interest rates; it is for this reason, for example, that some have postulated that LUSD has been trading below its $1 peg in recent months. Conclusion Liquity’s v2 stablecoin protocol is expected to launch sometime in 2024 , enabling users to employ some form(s) of liquid staked ETH derivatives to mint the v2 stablecoin itself. By designing the v2 protocol in such a way that some portion of its revenue is directed towards upholding the utility of Liquity’s v1 borrowing protocol vis-a-vis Chicken Bonds and liquidity incentives for both the v2 stablecoin and LUSD itself, the Liquity team would reinforce the strategic cohesion and synergistic capacity of its three product offerings, ergo paving the path for wider co-marketing possibilities.Although LUSD will be less scalable than the v2 stablecoin, it is important for the Liquity team to keep in mind that it has an established Lindy effect due to its immutable and uncompromised existence that now exceeds two and half years since its debut on Ethereum mainnet in April 2021, and its continued utility should therefore be supported. On a related note, Ethereum Foundation researchers such as Justin Drake have similarly indicated that future proposed improvements to Ethereum, such as MEV burn , are intended to foster the use of “pristine, raw ETH” as collateral in DeFi protocols, and as such, LUSD is in a class of its own among stablecoins. In the above-cited interview with Liquity’s team members, it was remarked, "" What Bitcoin is for money, Liquity is for stablecoins. "" Although this was in reference to the distinct decentralization properties of Liquity’s v1 borrowing protocol and LUSD, I hope this post reflects how this quote may be applicable from a broader point of view: Liquity’s three product offerings can supplement their individual innovations to collectively advance Liquity’s adoption and market share in a global stablecoin market that some say may ultimately surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization in the coming years. To conclude, it is my estimation that Liquity’s upcoming v2 stablecoin protocol, alongside its v1 predecessor and Chicken Bonds protocol, are not mutually exclusive developments and can potentially complement one another as a trivium of structured products interwoven by liquidity incentivies predicated on real yield that could truly uplift Liquity’s renown in DeFi at large.

James is seeking to ban Gemini, Genesis, and DCG from the financial investment industry in New York.  Gemini lent funds to Genesis, which is owned by DCG, as part of its Earn program, the suit said. The funds were later lent to counterparties such as trading firms Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research, which ultimately went bankrupt. This left Genesis with a $1.1 billion hole. DCG also owns CoinDesk.  ""Today’s lawsuit is the latest action taken by Attorney General James to rein in the cryptocurrency industry and protect investors,” the statement said, citing her recent action against crypto players CoinEx, KuCoin, and Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky.  It also follows cases taken by the federal Department of Justice against Mashinsky and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who have both pleaded not guilty, and suits brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.  Undersecured  James' lawsuit alleges Gemini knew Genesis’ loans were undersecured and at one point, highly concentrated with one entity, Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, but did not reveal this information to investors.  James also charged Genesis' former Chief Executive Officer Soichiro Moro and DCG CEO Barry Silbert with defrauding the public by trying to conceal heavy losses that investors bore.  The defendants ""disguised $1.1 billion in losses through a months-long campaign of misstatements, omissions, and concealment” by way of a promissory note, according to the suit.  Tweets sent by Genesis and DCG after the default of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital ""were false, misleading, and omitted material facts,"" James' complaint stated.

""Even after Gemini decided to terminate Earn and provided formal notification to Genesis Capital, Gemini continued to take tens of millions of dollars’ worth of additional cryptocurrencies from Earn investors"" to hand to Genesis, at the same time that Gemini employees were closing out personal positions, the suit alleged.  Gemini and Genesis ""falsely claimed"" they had necessary governmental licenses when, in fact, they should have registered under New York securities laws, the suit added.  “My office will continue our efforts to stop deceptive cryptocurrency companies and push for stronger regulations to protect all investors,” James said.  Audit  The move comes during the trial of Bankman-Fried, where it's also been alleged that crypto companies such as Paradigm, BlockFi and Genesis did not have access to audited financial statements prior to investing or loaning billions to his companies, including crypto exchange FTX, its U.S. arm, and Alameda.  Genesis Global Capital filed for bankruptcy in January. Gemini sued DCG and Silbert in July, making allegations that DCG then described as ""defamatory"" and a ""publicity stunt.""  In a statement emailed to CoinDesk, a DCG spokesperson said the company had been “blindsided” by the filing after months of cooperating with James’ probe.  “We fully intend to fight the claims and look forward to being vindicated in this case,” the spokesperson said. “DCG has always conducted its business lawfully and with integrity … there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by DCG, Barry Silbert, or its employees.”  Silbert said he was “shocked by the baseless allegations” in James’ complaint, adding that “honesty and integrity have always been my guiding principles.”  Gemini said on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that it disagreed with the lawsuit against the firm. ""We wholly disagree with the NY AG’s decision to also sue Gemini. Blaming a victim for being defrauded and lied to makes no sense and we look forward to defending ourselves against this inconsistent position,"" the post said.  A spokesperson for Genesis told CoinDesk that there is ""no basis” for James’ claims, and that the move ""risked significant harm to Genesis’ creditors"" as Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings develop.  ""Genesis has not violated the law and continues to focus on maximizing recoveries for creditors in its Chapter 11 cases,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have been cooperating with all authorities and intend to continue doing so.""  Jack Schickler contributed reporting.

42419406,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEPuv,1697713916,Bitcoin ETF Rumor Had a Silver Lining and It's Apparent in the Crypto Options Market,"Monday's rumor-led pop in BTC showed there is plenty of dry powder waiting to cheer SEC's potential ETF approval.  Bullish sentiment has returned to the options market since the mistaken report.  Monday's false report that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved BlackRock's spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw the cryptocurrency spike 10% to $30,000 before quickly settling back to $28,000.  The rumor-led price swing was perhaps bad optics for the crypto industry, validating the SEC's persistent concerns about manipulation and surveillance shortcomings.  That said, it had a silver lining. The rally shows there's plenty of dry powder waiting to enter the market on approval of such an ETF. Monday's pop also challenged the notion that approval has been priced in.  ""The short-lived pump we saw on the back of fake news on ETF approval provided a preview of what is to come in the event of BTC spot ETF approvals,"" said Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven crypto trading firm TDX Strategies. ""The fact that BTC is holding well above $28k is encouraging and potentially shows that the market are under-invested and may be inclined to start building positions.""  Speculation is rife the SEC could approve the first U.S.-based spot ETF early next year after the regulator missed a deadline to appeal against a U.S. court verdict that set aside its decision to reject Grayscale Investments' attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF. Grayscale is owned by DCG, the parent company of CoinDesk.  ""With the SEC missing the deadline and actively engaging with other ETF issuers, the odds of spot ETF approvals appear to be near-certain, with the expectation that a batch of spot ETFs may be approved on or before 10-Jan-2024 (the final deadline for the Ark 21Shares application), which is just 83 days to go,"" Lo said.  Analysts at Blockware Solutions voiced a similar opinion, saying the price jump was a sign of what is to come once the ETF is approved.  ""The timeline for approval remains uncertain, but one thing that is not uncertain is that the BTC price will move up rapidly once approval happens. At this point, ETF approval is a 'when', not an 'if,'"" the analysts said in an email.  Perhaps, in the near term, bears may be more cautious in expressing their opinion in the market. The way bitcoin options have been priced since the rumor suggests that.  The 30- and 60-day call-put skews, which measure the cost of call options relative to puts, have risen above zero, joining the longer duration skews in signaling a bullish bias.  A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation to, buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put gives the right to sell.  Sentiment in the ether options market has also improved, although the bias for calls is still relatively weaker than in bitcoin.  ""A significant disparity in skew pricing between BTC and ETH is most apparent in the 1–3-month segment of the curve,"" Options Insights founder Imran Lakha said in a blog post at Deribit. ""This trend indicates market speculation that Bitcoin may see substantial relative gains, possibly due to anticipated ETF approval within this timeframe.""",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/19/bitcoin-etf-rumor-had-a-silver-lining-and-its-apparent-in-the-crypto-options-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07792ed29c1a9c5125844b5ceef3351beac8ce5d-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Expert Testimony Shows Customers’ Funds Were Stolen According to a report by Bloomberg, Easton explained that $9 billion in customers’ funds had already gone missing since June 2022, five months before FTX filed for bankruptcy. He specifically alluded to the customers’ deposits, which were made into Alameda Research’s bank accounts. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Price Reach $1,000,000? Pundit Lays Out A Timeline Having laid a foundation that Bankman-Fried stole FTX’s customers’ funds through Alameda, the next step in the prosecution’s case was to show that these funds were indeed stolen, and that was the role of Easton, who has an expertise in “penetrating the details of financial statements.” He stated that based on deposits made by customers, Alameda was meant to have held $11.3 billion in FTX customers’ funds, but only $2.3 billion was actually in the trading firm’s bank accounts. According to him, these funds were ultimately used for several purposes. FTT Token bulls struggle to hold $1 | Source: FTTUSDT on Tradingview.com What The Stolen FTX Funds Were Used For Easton further provided details as to where some of these funds went. He alleged that some of these funds were used to invest in companies like Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital, Lily Zhang’s Modulo Capital, Robinhood, Dave and Anthropic. Specifically, he stated that the investment in Modulo was 100% from customers’ funds, with him being able to trace the transaction from FTX’s database. While giving her testimony, Alameda’s ex-CEO, Caroline Ellison, also revealed that Alameda, with SBF’s permission, used FTX’s customers’ funds to repay its lenders. Easton corroborated this statement as he mentioned that some of the missing funds were used to repay lenders like Celsius, Abra, Maple, and Anchorage. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $100: Here’s How To Become A Millionaire His testimony didn’t stop there, though, as, according to him, some of the funds were also used to fund political campaigns, charity foundations, and real estate purchases. Part of these political contributions included the $1 million that FTX’s Director of Engineering Nishad Singh had donated to Mind The Gap (MTG), a Political Action Committee (PAC) that SBF’s mum Barbara Fried co-founded. Additionally, $96 million of these customers’ funds is said to have been spent on real estate purchases, of which a property owned by SBF’s parents happens to be among them, going by the evidence tendered by the prosecution. The professor mentioned that all these discoveries were made following his analysis of Alameda’s statements, information from the FTX database, documents from lenders, and on-chain data.

The company has a large glut of inventory and is moving units at deep discounts. One of the company's largest peers, Bitmain, has reportedly had difficulty paying its employees. This could theoretically be an opportunity for Canaan. I still think it's slightly early to go long CAN before a post-halving rebound. As the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) network quickly approaches the next block reward halving in April of next year, many eyes are generally on the price of BTC and if/when exuberance will return to the market. In my personal portfolio, I've curated a handful of Bitcoin proxy stocks that I believe will outperform if Bitcoin reaches new highs as is widely expected in the industry. Most of those stocks are Bitcoin miners and they are highly speculative wagers on my part. One highly speculative Bitcoin proxy stock that I'm not holding is Canaan (CAN). Canaan might not be a company that shows up on a lot of watch lists, but the company has played an integral part in the Bitcoin story. This Singapore-based company was the first to publicly sell ASIC machines in 2013. In a gold rush, finding the right miner to back may yield the best reward. But the safest play outside of simply being long gold directly is perhaps selling the miners their shovels. That's what Canaan does. Data by YCharts During the absolute mania in all risk assets following COVID lockdowns and stimmy checks, CAN shares ripped roughly 1,900% in a matter of just five months between late 2020 and early 2021. Unfortunately for CAN shareholders, even though Bitcoin has enjoyed a sizeable 70% relief rally in 2023, CAN shares are flat on the year and down 42% over the last 12 months. ASIC Price Index (HashRateIndex) Part of the problem is the lackluster pricing power for ASICs in an environment where mining profitability is depressed. When the price of Bitcoin rises, the value of the machines that mine BTC also rise. This led to a boom in the price of ASICs between October 2020 and April 2021 - CAN's stock price responded. But when the opposite happens and mining isn't as profitable, machine prices struggle and Canaan isn't moving units at the prices that it once was. Q2 Revenue In the second quarter, Canaan reported a 34% sequential increase in revenue from $55.2 million to $73.9 million. Q2's top line represented a 70% decline versus the same time period from 2022. Cost of goods sold for the quarter amounted to $143.9 million. This was up 33.7% from Q2-22. Data by YCharts Factoring in total operating expenses of $46.7 million, the total net loss for the quarter was $110.7 million dollars. Data by YCharts A large factor in this net loss was a $54.7 million non-cash charge that included an inventory write-down and impairment of property and equipment. As we'll see in the next section, the inventory levels are very high and the company as essentially resorted to fire selling dated hardware at large markdowns. Rev in millions Q2-22 Q2-23 YoY % Total Revenue $245.9 $73.9 -69.9% Mining Revenue $7.8 $15.9 +105.1% Mining % of Total 3.2% 21.5% Source: Canaan One bright spot for Canaan so far in 2023 has been the growth in mining revenue. At $15.9 million in Q2, mining as a percentage of total revenue has grown from just 3.5% in 2022 to 21.5% in the last quarter. Balance Sheet Looking at the balance sheet, the inventory problem sort of jumps off the page. The company has depleted cash and equivalents from over $422 million at the end of 2021 to just $66.1 million at the end of June: Data by YCharts It's worth noting Canaan only drew down cash by $5.9 million from Q1 to Q2. However, cash and total current assets have been in decline for six quarters and inventory has been difficult to move. Again, this is due to problems with machine pricing that go hand in hand with the decline in Bitcoin's price. When the machines aren't as profitable to run, the demand for machines declines and we're seeing the entire industry impacted by this dynamic. With the upcoming release of the company's new A14 miner series, Canaan is currently selling unused previous generation Avalon A13s for as much as 86% off MSRP: Machine sales (Canaan) This can theoretically turn around for Canaan if the price of Bitcoin starts to increase before the halving next year. But from where I sit, Canaan is in a difficult position and may need to tap its ATM with H.C. Wainwright soon or sell some of the 747 BTC stack on the balance sheet. That BTC is currently valued at about $21 million and gives Canaan about $87 million in total liquidity that it can draw from counting the cash. Competitive Catalyst? The three giants in the mining hardware market have historically been Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan with Bitmain commanding 60% share of the market based on estimates from DA Davidson last year. Crypto winter has been brutal for just about every company in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and ASIC manufacturers have been feeling it as well. Recently, we've even seen reports that Bitmain has had to temporarily delay payments to employees due to cash flow issues in September. According to crypto journalist Colin Wu, those employees were made whole earlier in October: It should be noted that only the performance-based portion of some employees' salaries was initially not distributed and has now been paid. Furthermore, the regular basic salaries were also paid on the 30th as per the usual schedule. In my view, this reported cash crunch that is impacting Bitmain is telling and I think it's something crypto miners and mining investors should be keeping an eye on going forward. I also see it as a possible opportunity to gain share for Canaan if we see demand return. However, I think the broader problems facing Canaan might outweigh the possible reward from taking a speculative wager on CAN even at these depressed share price levels. Risks One of the few bright spots in Canaan's second quarter was the growth in mining revenue and it appears that segment is now dealing with challenges as well. On the conference call, CEO Nangeng Zhang disclosed that policy changes in Kazakhstan and a partner default in the United States will impact 3 EH/s in mining power during the company's third quarter. That's a significant hit and accounts for about half the company's EH/s. Canaan is guiding for just $30 million in Q3 revenue. Summary While cash levels are down dramatically over the last 18 months, the company's fortunes can turn around fairly quickly if/when Bitcoin's price heads higher. If the surge in BTC price following the incorrect report of BlackRock's (BLK) spot ETF approval is any indication, this market moves fast on positive news. The old adage is past performance is not indicative of future returns and a 5% Fed Funds is certainly a possible factor in it being ""different this time."" But BTC is usually much higher in the 6 to 12 months following the halving. The gold rush hasn't started yet. But when it does, I think CAN will be a beneficiary once again. Of course, the big unknown is time. I'm not long this one personally, but I'm not ruling it out either as we get closer to the halving.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4641753-canaan-time-to-buy-shovels?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19056273.jpeg

Market analysts closely monitor the crypto’s struggle to breach a longstanding resistance trendline, as an upside breakout could trigger a fresh rally, while a continuation of the current stalemate may lead to a further decline. Earlier this week, DOGE encountered its fifth rejection from a persistent resistance trendline that has thwarted its upward momentum. The rejection left its mark on the daily candlestick chart, characterized by a prominent high wick, indicative of aggressive overhead supply. Historical data reveals that such patterns often precede significant corrections in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Climbs 22% – A Close Look At The Factors Behind The Surge The current price of DOGE, according to CoinGecko, stands at $0.058295, with a 24-hour dip of 1.5% and a minor seven-day loss of 0.1%. DOGE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko In the event that the prevailing selling pressure continues, there is a high probability that the value of the coin will see a further decline of approximately 4-5%. This decline may potentially lead to a reevaluation of the annual support trendline, with a projected value of approximately $0.055. Presently, the price of this memecoin is situated inside the confines of two prominent trendlines, indicating an impending occurrence of either a definitive upward surge or a downward decline. Dogecoin: Glimpse Of Hope Amidst Mixed Data Despite the gloomy price outlook, there is a glimmer of hope for DOGE enthusiasts. The report also predicts that if the coin manages to sustain a breakout above the resistance trendline, investors could witness a sharp 16.8% surge, targeting the $0.068 level. This possibility is poised to keep traders and investors on the edge of their seats. On the other hand, data from IntoTheBlock reveals some intriguing insights into DOGE’s current state. It’s been found that a significant portion of DOGE addresses, specifically 61%, are currently at a loss. Source: IntoTheBlock A deeper dive into the data exposes the fact that only 31% of the total DOGE holders are in profit, highlighting the challenging landscape for DOGE investors. An additional 10% of holders remain in a neutral position, while a substantial 59% of Dogecoin holders find themselves in a losing position. DOGE’s Silver Lining One silver lining in this scenario is the fact that 72% of DOGE holders have maintained their positions for over a year, signifying a strong commitment to the digital asset. A further 26% of holders have held DOGE for a duration ranging from one month to 12 months, while 2% of holders have relatively shorter-term positions, spanning less than a month. DOGE market cap currently at $6.8 billion.

42419394,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEPhV,1697709600,Judge Kaplan's Ire Hits All Lawyers in the Sam Bankman-Fried Case,"We’ve entered the soul-sucking phase of Sam Bankman-Fried’s month-long criminal trial. The part where an antsy Judge Lewis Kaplan paces and glares – and then lashes out at prosecutors (and also defense lawyers) for wasting everyone’s time.  The government proffered two dud witnesses on Wednesday that probably did more harm to their working relationship with Judge Kaplan than good to their borderline airtight fraud case. Ex-FTX lobbyist Eliora Katz and the paper-pushing Google bureaucrat Cory Gaddis didn’t spend an hour on the stand between them delivering lackluster performances that peeved the no-nonsense judge.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Late in the day, Kaplan accused prosecutors of ""calling up a mannequin"" in Katz, who had spent her morning testimony mumbling variations of ""I don’t know anything and I didn’t work at FTX back then"" in response to most every question. Her perplexing statements hinted that Katz would rather nuke her own credibility than play the game prosecutors wanted her to. That game was hardly earth-shattering: simply reading tweets and transcripts into the court record. At times, Kaplan was very clearly peeved at the sheer number of documents that Katz was asked to read into the record – especially given these were all public statements made on Twitter or uttered from the defendant's mouth in front of Congress.  As bad as she was, the Googler was worse. Gaddis, who responds to legal requests the search engine giant receives, spent his ever-so-brief testimony saying there existed metadata that (I guess) demonstrated some Google doc whose contents weren’t actually discussed had been received, or worked on, or something, by Bankman-Fried. (Editor's note: No, I'm not going to touch that sentence because it's perfect.) Then cross-examination demonstrated Gaddis didn’t know a damn thing about metadata, a revelation that threw the bench into disarray.  ""We have 18 people devoting time to this case, and it's really a crime"" what you’re doing to them, an exasperated Kaplan grumbled at the prosecution once the jury had left the room. He blasted them for making Gaddis fly ""from Texas"" to New York City to spend what couldn’t have been more than 10 minutes saying literally nothing of value.  ""Lawyers are supposed to do a little better than this – and I’m talking to both sides,"" the judge said.  The crux of Kaplan’s indignation with both the prosecution team and defense attorneys was the result of their apparent failure to stipulate. Stipulations are how things run smoothly in a court. Some pieces of evidence are facts that both sides agree are facts. I can appear on C-SPAN and say my crypto exchange isn’t stealing anyone’s money, while also wearing a $10,000 suit I bought with their cash. Those statements notwithstanding (I pinkie swear I didn’t do it), my defense and prosecutors SHOULD be able to ""stipulate"" (before blabbing in front of jurors) that the video is, itself, real.  That might be what happened with Katz – or, rather, what didn’t happen. Prosecutors had an array of videos and blog posts related to Bankman-Fried’s and FTX’s representations to lawmakers and they seemed to lack stipulations for some of them. They took the long route to getting it in the record, despite actually having stipulations for a small handful of exhibits Wednesday.  The situation was even more absurd for the Google employee. During a short afternoon recess, Kaplan pressed defense lawyer Chris Everdell on why his team didn’t simply agree to a stipulation that would have eliminated entirely the need for Gaddis’ testimony.  Everdell said prosecutors gave them late notice about the evidence they’d focus on Wednesday – and then never asked for one.  Now, that’s not to say that every government witness Wednesday was a fizzler. We can’t forget finance Santa Claus: a white-bearded Australian accounting professor named Peter Easton who teaches at Notre Dame. His testimony was tantamount to beating Bankman-Fried with a sock full of coal. He dug a knife into the defense by arguing it was simply impossible for Alameda to spend billions of dollars on its various pursuits without also dipping into customer funds. On cross-examination he twisted it.  The defense did land a pretty solid punch on a different accounting expert called by the government: an FBI forensic accountant whom defense lawyers pinned in a corner for seeming to mess up her analysis of the flow-of-funds that led her to believe Alameda spent its own money on political donations. Her lip seemed to quiver from the stand.  But the day’s best zinger went to the prosecution, who, despite their frosty moments with the judge, still finished Wednesday strong. With the help of an SDNY investigator they dug through the infamous Twitter conversation between Bankman-Fried and journalist Kelsey Piper. You know the one: where Bankman-Fried curses out regulators as well as the stupid little games ""woke westerners play"" and bemoaned his loss of funds.  The lines sounded pretty soulless and damning. Jurors certainly thought so. At least three nodded their heads and smiled after hearing them – as if to say, ""Yeah, he really did it.""  — Danny Nelson  Courtroom scenes  Two of the government’s witnesses – Richard Busick and Shamel Medrano – brought their own water bottles, eschewing the court-provided standard bottles on the witness table.  We appear to be past the halfway point of this trial. Time isn’t real but it’s definitely been flying. Tempus fugit, as Kaplan says.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told Kaplan she accidentally walked into the jurors' room during lunch. ""I walked right out, but not before they all laughed at me,"" she told the court.  Eliora Katz, the former FTX lobbyist, really did not want to be up there. She said 11 times that she wasn’t involved in drafting FTX’s proposed policy documents or that those statements were made before she arrived at the company in April 2022.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  So, we finally heard from many of our outstanding witnesses and it turns out both Shamel Medrano (not Chanel, as a court transcript suggested) and Paige Owens were with the government. Medrano is an investigative analyst with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York, who explained tweets and direct messages, while Owens is a financial forensics expert who looked at money flows for political contributions.  The Department of Justice confirmed on Wednesday that it will not call Andria van der Merwe, a proposed expert witness, and only expects to call former FTX General Counsel Can Sun and Third Point’s Robert Boroujerdi to the stand on Thursday. Everyone expects the court day to end early on Thursday. Defense attorney Mark Cohen, asked whether the defense has a broad list of possible witnesses, said the defense is still working on it. ""We’re certainly not going to rebut the expert that they didn’t call,"" he said. ""That seems reasonable,"" Judge Kaplan quipped in response.  We’re then on break until Oct. 26, when the DOJ expects to rest its case. The defense, which is still not acknowledging whether or not it will actually bring a case, could begin presenting it that same day.  One note on this last point: A defense is not obligated to present a case. The burden of proof is on the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bankman-Fried committed fraud and conspiracy on the different charges he faces. The defense can just immediately rest, as if to indicate that the DOJ has not met that burden of proof. I don’t think that’s likely, and I fully expect the defense to present its case that Bankman-Fried is not guilty of the seven different charges, but Cohen and Judge Kaplan have both acknowledged this possibility, including on the first day of the trial.  ""The burden of proof is always on the government,"" the judge told the jury before opening statements on Oct. 4. ""The defendant has no burden to prove innocence, no burden to produce any evidence, no burden to testify or obligation to testify. The defendant has an absolute right to remain silent, and if that's what happens in this case, you may not consider his silence against him in any way.""  — Nikhilesh De",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Danny Nelson, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/19/judge-kaplans-ire-hits-all-lawyers-in-the-sam-bankman-fried-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419409,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEPqn,1697705690,"Can You Use Crypto YouTube Channels to Time the Market? Yes, Says Delphi","YouTube-based crypto content channels are one of the key sources of information for retail investors.  The increased user base for popular crypto-focused YouTube channels has historically marked major price tops in bitcoin, according to data tracked by Delphi Digital.  Consider the number of crypto-related YouTube channels you have subscribed to and the hours spent per day watching these videos. Now, multiply these figures by the number of subscribers for each channel.  The resulting data can be used as a sentiment indicator to gauge how the general populace feels about the crypto market and predict major market tops and bottoms, according to crypto research firm Delphi Digital.  ""Analyzing the relationship between the average weekly views and subscriber growth/decline of popular crypto-related YouTube channels ought to shed some more color on retail participation,"" Delphi research analyst, Priyansh Patel, said in a note to clients on Wednesday.  ""Although far from perfect, using these alternate metrics does provide some valuable insight into the market trend and the impact of retail participation,"" Patel added.  Retail investors are usually the last to board the rally and exit the market. Their decision to invest is often based on the information disseminated through freely available sources like YouTube and blogs. Hence, a pick up in viewership for YouTube channels can be seen as a contrary indicator, just as Google search trends or investor sentiment surveys.  Savvy traders and professional money managers use retail investor-focused sentiment indicators as contrarian indicators, buying when the retail sentiment is too pessimistic and selling when the sentiment is overly optimistic.  Data tracked by Delphi show, that the weekly change in views and subscriber counts of popular channels like The Moon,BitBoy Crypto, DataDash, EllioTrades Crypto and Ivan on Tech have historically mimicked the crypto boom-bust cycles.  The chart shows the weekly gain in the subscriber count and viewership for ""The Moon"" and ""Ivan on Tech"" peaked in early 2021 as bitcoin (BTC) reached its first significant high above $60,000 and quickly fell to $30,000.  The cryptocurrency bounced back to a new all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021, but failed to bring new business to the two channels. In the subsequent 12 months, the weekly gain in viewership and subscriber count followed the bearish broader market trend.  More importantly, bitcoin’s year-to-date gain of over 70% has yet to boost both channels’ subscriber base and viewership. It’s a sign the general population is still sitting on the sideline, hungover from last year’s brutal bear market.  According to Delphi, analysis of popular social media platforms can be as effective as YouTube viewership.  ""You can take this a step further and perform a similar analysis on popular Twitter accounts, SubReddits, Blogs, podcasts, and so on. And upon doing so, in all likelihood, you’d find these trends being mimicked,"" Patel noted.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/19/can-you-use-crypto-youtube-channels-to-time-the-market-yes-says-delphi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59f43afb4691c76a5d892b168f63dec513328b3a-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kwon has been sued for misleading investors after the stablecoin's 2022 collapse sent shockwaves across the ecosystem.  A legal case against Do Kwon and his company, Terraform Labs, could hinge on the role of market maker Jump Trading, according to filings made in a New York court on Wednesday.  The collapse of Kwon’s terraUSD stablecoin (UST) in May 2022 sent a shockwave across the cryptocurrency market, heralding a crypto winter. Kwon was subsequently sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors.  New documents in the case show a focus on the role of Jump – a market maker that appears to have made $1.28 billion in profits as the doomed ecosystem fell apart.  Jump’s involvement may matter due to an incident a year earlier, in which UST temporarily lost its peg to the dollar. While Kwon told investors the coin maintained its $1 value because of its automated algorithm, SEC experts say that it was, rather, due to Jump intervening in the market at Terraform’s behest.  “Defendants deny these allegations and assert that Jump’s trades in UST were not the cause of the peg restoration in May 2021,” according to a letter from Kwon’s team to the Singapore Supreme Court, which had sought further details in connection with the case, included in the New York filing.  “The May 2022 depeg was the result of an intentional effort by third parties to ‘short’ UST causing it to depeg from its price and involved a direct, public intervention in an effort to combat the short,” the letter added.  Shorting is a way of betting that a price will decline. Generally, an investor borrows a financial instrument and sells it in the hope the price will have dropped by the time they have to repurchase it and return it to the lender. The borrower can then pocket the difference.  After apparently fleeing following the crisis, Kwon was arrested for possessing false ID documents in March and is currently in a Montenegro jail.  His defense team has also argued the SEC doesn’t have jurisdiction because the assets involved are currencies, not securities, highlighting a legal gray area that’s also been taken up in the regulator’s case against exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.  A recent biography of Sam Bankman-Fried said that Jump lost nearly $300 million when his FTX exchange went bust in November 2022.

The crypto exchange is on track to apply for a Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license, which gives it the right to operate across the EU.  Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) picked Ireland as its regulatory hub in the European Union (EU) about a year before the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) laws allow crypto service providers to operate across the 27-nation bloc with a license from just one of the national regulators.  ""Ireland has a supportive political environment for FinTech companies, as well as a globally respected regulator,"" Daniel Seifert, Coinbase's vice president and regional managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a statement. The country already plays host to tech giants like Apple and Google. ""We look forward to working with regulators in Ireland, Germany and beyond, to bring this industry to its full potential with the advent of MiCA.”  Nana Murugesan, the company's vice president of international and business development, told CoinDesk it has close to 150 staff in Ireland and plans on hiring more, citing the country's talent pool and “very good” approach to taxation as advantages. He was trying to get a license ready for when MiCA takes effect at the end of 2024.  “This morning, I had a meeting with the Central Bank of Ireland and we talked about next steps,” Murugesan said in an interview Thursday. “We will immediately swing into action.”  Read more: MiCA, EU’s Comprehensive New Crypto Regulation, Explained  The crypto exchange has already registered in Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, and is currently fighting charges from U.S. federal and state regulators that it should have registered as a securities exchange.

With the registrations it has garnered recently across Europe, Coinbase plans to diversify its business between trading and non-trading use cases, creating things that can be used daily, Murugesan said.  “The U.S. will lose leadership” when it comes to crypto if it continues to take an approach of regulating by enforcement in the absence of a clear federal crypto law, he said.

The investment manager notes that the trough of bitcoin (BTC) in previous crypto winters has occurred 12 to 14 months after the peak. The cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of around $68,000 in November 2021 and bottomed out a year later.  “A 50% increase in price from bitcoin’s low is typically a good sign that the trough has been achieved,” strategist Denny Galindo wrote. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has risen 70% year-to-date and 77% from last year’s lows.  The magnitude of the bitcoin drawdown is also important, the wealth manager said, noting that previous price troughs were about 83% off their respective highs. BTC had dropped nearly 77% to about $16,000 by November 2022.  Most of bitcoin’s gains come directly after the halving, Galindo wrote, and this “bull-run period starts with the halving event and ends once the price of bitcoin hits its prior peak.” Roughly every four years the reward for successfully mining a bitcoin block is cut in half, an event known as the halving, and this reduces inflationary pressure on BTC.  “By intentionally limiting the supply of new bitcoin, the shortage caused by the halving can affect the price of bitcoin to potentially spur a bull run,” Galindo said, adding that there have been “three such runs on bitcoin since its inception, each lasting 12 to 18 months after the halving.”  Read more: Coinbase Trading Volume Slows Further as Crypto Winter Continues: Berenberg",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/19/the-crypto-winter-may-be-over-morgan-stanley-wealth-management,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87d07633a130976f99079188febeca055ee0c7f2-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19051879,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556032,1697702447,Pro-XRP Lawyer Reacts To Elon Musk And Mark Cuban’s Amicus Brief To SEC,"In a pivotal moment backed by pro-XRP lawyer John E Deaton’s sentiments, high-profile entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, along with a consortium of prominent investors, have raised objections against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This challenge comes in the form of an amicus curiae brief addressing the SEC’s litigation procedures. Elon Musk and Mark Cuban’s Amicus Brief Musk, Cuban, and other amici such as Phillip Goldstein, Nelson Obus, Manouch Moshayedi, and the Investor Choice Advocates Network (ICAN) collectively argue against the SEC’s predominant use of administrative proceedings over jury trials. The brief highlights that this method raises questions about the constitutionality of the SEC’s practices. The amicus brief was composed for the SEC v. Jarkesy case. Here, George Jarkesy, the complainant, alleges that his Seventh Amendment privileges were infringed upon. He argues that the SEC’s internal adjudication method, which lacks a jury and is overseen by a commission-designated administrative law judge, violates these privileges. Related Reading: ‘Extra Bullish’ On XRP? Crypto Analyst Pinpoints The Perfect Timing Drawing attention to the Seventh Amendment, which upholds a defendant’s right to a jury trial for cases mirroring “suits at common law,” the amici underline the SEC’s inconsistency. They cite the SEC v. Seghers case as an example, where the SEC opted for a jury trial, resulting in a liability verdict against Seghers for fraud. The amici also address concerns of “forum shopping” by the SEC, suggesting that the agency might prosecute two identical defendants differently. This approach could result in one party benefiting from full constitutional rights, while the other might not, leading to a disparate legal outcome. The document reads: Forum shopping by itself may not be impermissible. But forum shopping by the federal government to pursue the same claims and penalties against similarly situated individuals, so that one individual has access to a jury and the other does not, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The document further contends that such practices damage the SEC’s credibility at a time when public trust in such institutions is waning, intensified by revelations of the SEC’s “improper access to privileged memoranda.” The amici conclude that the SEC’s practices deprive the public of critical information that might come to light during a jury trial, which contradicts the SEC’s core mission. This shared stance by Musk, Cuban, and their associates emphasizes the need for a reassessment of the SEC’s litigation approach, hinting at a potentially groundbreaking legal tussle on the horizon. Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Reacts Renowned pro-XRP lawyer, John E Deaton, aired his views on X, expressing his support for Musk and Cuban’s stance. Deaton said, “I’m thrilled to see Mark & Elon take this path, even if they disagree on certain issues.” He reflected on past decisions, stating, “Three years ago I filed suit against the SEC, and encouraged companies in the crypto space to do the same.” Deaton further challenges the narratives that discourage companies or executives from contesting the SEC or its chairmanship. “Just because they state something doesn’t make it true. Almost every court case involving the SEC is proving that very point,” he contends. He highlights concerns about potential conflicts of interest within the SEC, suggesting that both parties, Republican and Democrat, are tainted. In a particularly revealing statement, he mentions, “These temporary bureaucrats are often conflicted, implementing agendas that favor their friends and the companies they go work for immediately following their tenure at the SEC.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $100: Here’s How To Become A Millionaire Detailing alleged past conflicts, the pro-XRP lawyer critically remarks, “Look at Jay Clayton. He helped Apollo Group after they gave Kushner a huge loan and Clayton becomes a top advisor and Board Member at Apollo… Speaking of Hinman, he’s made partner at A16z, and they, along with Joseph Lubin, Vitalik Buterin, asked Hinman to give ETH a free pass. Hell, a16z lawyers actually helped Hinman write his famous speech.” Bringing attention to the broader issue, Deaton’s concerns are not only with individual transgressions but with systemic flaws. “The SEC MUST be completely restructured. It’s a broken and failed agency,” he unequivocally asserts. Deaton concludes with a strong call to action, emphasizing the urgent need for reform. “We need term limits in Congress and we need to pass legislation forbidding a regulator from immediately working for companies they were just regulating.” In his final, resounding statement, he warns, “Now it’s no longer only a revolving problem. It’s gotten so out of hand, they blatantly violate conflict laws because they know no one will do anything about it. The next regulator simply takes the attitude: ‘Now it’s my turn.’” At press time, XRP traded at $0.4804.

The tie-up will allow institutional clients of Komainu to trade over ClearLoop, the firm said. The clients will be able to benefit from regulated, on-chain custody provided by Komainu, while at the same time gaining access to off-exchange settlement through the network.  Custody and counterparty risk have become increasingly important considerations for digital asset investors following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year. ClearLoop allows investors to hold on to assets until just before a trade is executed by connecting multiple exchanges in one trading network, reducing their counterparty risk and eliminating the need to transfer assets to an exchange-based wallet.  “Together with Copper, we are bringing tried and tested best practices and infrastructure from traditional markets to meet the growing demand of digital asset participants to diversify counterparty risk,” said Komainu CEO Nicolas Bertrand.  The partnership is subject to legal documentation being finalized.  Komainu joined the U.K.’s crypto register earlier this month, after successfully registering with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

42392271,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3zfl,1697698645,Elon Musk’s Plan to Charge New X Users $1 May Not Deter Crypto Bots,"A plan to charge $1 to new users of social app X, formerly Twitter, may do little to deter the bot endemic on the popular platform used by crypto projects and users.  X began rolling out the annual charge to new users in New Zealand and the Philippines on Wednesday. The company said the test could help “reduce spam, manipulation of our platform and bot activity,” as any new user will be charged to use critical functions including posting, replying and liking.  However, previous efforts to charge users have seemingly failed to entirely prevent phishing scams by verified accounts on the platform. X’s premium service – which costs $8 a month and rewards a blue tick to users – is seemingly extensively used by crypto-focused bot armies and scammers.  Such phishing bots are ever-present on posts made by verified accounts. Replies to several different CoinDesk posts show the blue-tick verified bots ploy their trade – hoping to capture the attention of an unsuspecting user, who clicks on the link only to discover their wallet has been fully drained a few minutes later.  Market observers working in crypto security services believe that while the charge may help dissuade some bots, other measures are far more likely to create an impact.  ""While this new program is well-intentioned, it may be more effective to enhance reporting measures to resolve existing issues,” explained Veronica Wong, CEO of crypto wallet SafePal. “Despite having dedicated team members reporting bot and scam accounts to safeguard our users, it is a never-ending battle as the process takes time and new X accounts are always popping up.”  “Users may still be vulnerable to bot accounts with blue and gold checkmarks since those are unaffected, and stringent vetting to deny scam ads will be more crucial to mitigate this,” Wong added.  Wong, however, noted that X’s premium service for businesses, which rewards a gold checkmark to accounts made it “noticeably harder for bots and impersonators to execute malicious attacks.”  Meanwhile, some crypto funds say using blockchain could quell the extensive bots menace.  “The pervasive issue of botting stands as a formidable challenge, casting a long shadow of doubt upon the industry's reputation,” shared DFG Founder and CEO James Wo. “The ill-gotten gains from perpetrating these scams substantially outweigh any associated expenses.”  “Attempts to quell this issue with a mere $1 annual fee appear insufficient in the face of determined groups. As a solution, we think that Web2 platforms will need to consider implementing Proof of Personhood and Decentralized Identity (DID) methods to deal with bot problem effectively,” Wo added.  A decentralized identifier (DID) identifies a user without relying on a centralized company or organization.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/19/elon-musks-plan-to-charge-new-x-users-1-may-not-deter-crypto-bots,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d53c6502731d327baa05efc0793fc8317e13222b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Elrond Coin Looks To Breach $55 Resistance – Is $65 Hittable This Month? Following The Trend, What To Look For At xDay 2023? In addition to rebranding, the project launched new products, including a “Super App” called xPortal, to expand its ecosystem. The project founder and CEO, Beniamin Mincu, has been vocal about their attempts to provide “real” use cases and value to their users and foster a new financial system supported by blockchain, AI, the multiverse, and other technologies. We went to xDay to explore how MultiversX works to achieve this goal and what makes this ecosystem unique. The event will begin today, October 19th, and will last three days to wrap up this upcoming Saturday, October 21. Mincu told us in an exclusive statement: xDay brings together builders, government officials, executives from major global companies and investors for 3 days of meaningful dialogues on the latest trends and advancements at the intersection of blockchain, AI, Metaverse and Web3. A great opportunity to build bridges across industries and uncover our latest innovations, products and strategic partnerships. The Technological Renaissance Runs On The Blockchain The event will be subdivided into chapters, with the first two chapters dedicated to discussing MultiversX and its ecosystem, its technical milestones, and the projects building on top of this network. Mincu and other vital members of MultiversX will take center stage. In addition, the Romanian Minister of Energy, Sebastian Burduja, and the Romanian Minister of Economy, Stefan Radu, will talk about the potential for blockchain and crypto to drive innovation and growth in the country. The third and fourth chapters of the event will focus on partnerships, with Daniël Rood, Head of Web3 at Google Cloud, Tobias Jung from Deutsche Telekom, Nikita Kharchenko from Amazon Web Services, and Liu Bin from Tencent Cloud taking over the stage. These experts will discuss ways to drive global adoption of Web3, regulation, scalability, and interoperability across different sectors and regions. Representatives from Circle, Osmosis, Binance, KuCoin, Deloitte, Ledger, Trust Wallet, and others will speak about investment strategies, staking, security, and other relevant topics. Finally, on the final day of the xDay 2023 event, new technologies and their integration with blockchain and crypto, such as Artificial Intelligence and the Metaverse, will become the focus. Across the event, the community will have a voice as the Palace of Parliament in Bucharest becomes a place of dialogue. The CEO of MultiversX added: A catalyst for bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3, this event plans to reignite European ambitions, marking the beginning of a technological Renaissance (…).

Expect hands-on demos, product unveilings right from this stage, firsthand accounts of our newest strategic partnerships, and spotlights of the most audacious grassroots projects from our vibrant ecosystem, that are turning heads and setting trends.

There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $23.90 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a strong rally if it clears the $24 and $25 resistance levels. Solana Price Remains In Uptrend After a steady increase, Solana struggled to clear the $25 resistance zone. SOL formed a high at $24.82 and recently started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $24.20 and $22.00 levels. The bears pushed the price below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $20.94 swing low to the $24.82 high.

The main resistance is still near the $25.00 zone. A successful close above the $25.00 resistance could set the pace for a larger increase. The next key resistance is near $28.50. Any more gains might send the price toward the $30.00 level. Are Dips Limited in SOL? If SOL fails to recover above the $24.00 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $22.85 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $20.94 swing low to the $24.82 high. The first major support is near the $22.40 level. If there is a close below the $22.40 support, the price could decline toward the $21.80 support.
