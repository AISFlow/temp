42399707,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyRI9,1490218809,Who's Buying Bitcoin? Demand Persists Amid Fork Fears,"In spite of speculation the bitcoin network could split into two separate blockchains, demand for the digital currency continued to remain strong during today's trading session.  The digital currency has mostly been trading north of $1,000 today, dipping below but rebounding shortly after, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Further, volumes at two of the world's largest exchanges, Bitfinex and Kraken, were robust, with figures charting higher than the 30-day average.  Yet, given the possibility that the network could see significant turbulence in the event of technical schism, some market observers were left openly wondering why bitcoin prices were still high.  At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,005.29, 20% below its all-time high, but up 142% year-over-year.  So, who's purchasing the digital currency and propping up its price? Some analysts were left stumped.  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, told CoinDesk:  ""All we can say for sure is that someone is buying to keep the price as high as it is.""  Possible variables  As for what has been fueling bitcoin's sustained demand, other market analysts offered varying explanations, most of which revolved around speculation and uncertainty.  Some traders may be trying to buy the dip, as bitcoin prices have fallen, and observers reasoned this means there's the possibility of gain.  Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of exchange service CryptoCompare, told CoinDesk that while traders are ""skittish"", there will always be people ""trying to catch the bottom"" when prices decline.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, provided similar sentiment.  ""Most of the buying going on is speculative, as far as we can tell, going after short-term profits, opening and closing trades within a day to minimize exposure on this uncertain market environment,"" he said.  Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, suggested short sellers may be playing a key role in keeping bitcoin prices at their current level.  ""Lots of people were short, and they have been covering their shorts (ie buying),"" he speculated.  Others, he said, might simply be caught on the wrong side of what could be an impending correction.  He told CoinDesk  ""This recent bounce is a dead cat bounce, and it's a bull trap.""

42399700,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyRAH,1490211040,Developers Discuss Wallet Safety Under Hard Fork Conditions,"Developers affiliated with the Bitcoin Core project have begun to discuss possible negative side effects that could result if bitcoin is split into two competing blockchain networks with different block sizes.  In a post to the bitcoin developer mailing list today, developer Luke Dashjr proposed a way that would allow consumer-friendly wallets continue to function securely, even if an attack on a smaller-block blockchain was launched in an effort to confuse their behavior.  While built on many if-then assumptions, the idea has nonetheless drawn praise as a clever solution that could mitigate a potential drawback of such a scenario, one that seems increasingly of interest to bitcoin startups and businesses.  As reported by CoinDesk, bitcoin miners and developers have been increasingly at odds on project direction, prompting talk that one party could go so far as to force a 'fork' or alter the rules and thereby create a new blockchain.  Should this situation arise, the idea is that miners involved in securing the new blockchain could go so far as to attack the old chain, thereby compromising the ability of nodes to record transaction history and act as an authoritative record.  At issue is that so-called SPV wallets (the kind that most average users have) do not download the full history of transactions, and therefore could be disrupted should miners seek to confuse them with data that's incorrect by their ruleset.  In response, Dashjr has coded a draft for how light wallets would be able to detect that certain blocks were too large given the ruleset of the smaller block blockchain.  In comments on reddit, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell lauded the proposal as a ""moderately efficient proof"" that doesn't require network rule changes.

42399698,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyRBG,1490198436,SAP Ariba Inks Blockchain Supply Chain Partnership With Everledger,"SAP Ariba, the US software and IT firm owned by tech giant SAP, has integrated its services with blockchain startup Everledger.  Announced today, the move will see SAP Ariba deploy the tech for use in supply chain applications, one of the services the company provides. According to SAP Ariba, more than 2.5m companies utilize its offerings. Everledger, based in London, uses blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other assets.  SAP Ariba said that it is also joining the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger blockchain community.  Joe Fox, SAP Ariba's senior vice president for business development and strategy, said in a statement:  ""Twenty years ago, SAP Ariba bet big on a fringe technology called the Internet and pioneered a totally new model for buying and selling. True to our roots, we are again investing at the edge of technology to drive innovations in business-to-business collaboration that will change the game.""  Though the tech likely won't apply to the precious stones space in the case of SAP Ariba, Fox suggested that the application opens the door to other tracking-related uses.  “If you can track and trace diamonds, you can track and trace anything,"" he said.  Originally known simply as Ariba, the company was acquired by tech giant SAP in 2012 for more than $4bn. SAP has partnered with firms like Ripple to explore the tech, telling CoinDesk last year that supply chain management was among the use cases it is testing.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership take in Everledger.

42399696,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR9I,1490193611,UN Group Advances Ethereum Aid Tracking Pilot,"The World Food Programme (WFP), the food assistance arm of the United Nations, is testing blockchain technology.  In a blog post from earlier this month, the WFP detailed a project centered on a village in Pakistan. The test, which involved recording cash transactions on the ethereum blockchain, was conducted in conjunction with the WFP's Innovation Accelerator, an effort partially backed by the German government.  The group explained:  ""As vulnerable families received WFP food and cash assistance, the transactions were authenticated and recorded on a public blockchain through a smartphone interface. Transaction reports generated were then used to match the disbursements with entitlements.""  According to the WFP, the pilot was a successful one, setting the stage for what is expected to be a ""full-scale pilot"".  ""Blockchain can revolutionize the way WFP delivers assistance to vulnerable families across the globe. It can bring us closer to the people we serve and allow us to respond much faster,"" Farman Ali, a regional official for the WFP, said.  The WFP's initiative is far from the first for the UN when it comes to blockchain.  CoinDesk reported last November that the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) had invested in its first blockchain startup, a move that came months after the organization said it wanted to fund projects involving the tech.  Then in October, the UN's global development network, the Development Programme, detailed how it was using blockchain to experiment with new forms of delivering aid, fostering remittances and testing connected device networks.  UN delegations have also discussed how the tech can help the organization pursue its sustainability goals.

42399689,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR0R,1490188828,Boom in Drug Dealer Digital Currency Use Sparks Worries Among US Officials,"The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has seen ""a substantial increase"" in cases involving digital currencies in the drug trade, an official told Congress yesterday.  The comment was made by Matthew Allen, an assistant director for one of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) investigative arms, speaking during a House of Representatives hearing on opioid abuse.  Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI, uses blockchain analysis to track digital currency payments connected to the heroin and fentanyl trades, according to Allen. And while the agency told the US Senate in a late 2013 statement that it was working to investigate criminal uses of the technology, his statements represent some of the first disclosures as to how it conducts those operations.  Allen told committee members:  ""ICE has seen a substantial increase in cases in which private parties are acting as money service businesses to exchange digital currencies into fiat currency to enjoy the illicit proceeds of narcotics smuggling. The IFPCU also utilizes resources provided by the Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture’s Third-Party Money Laundering Initiative to support complex financial investigations.""  The initial interest for DHS in digital currencies traces back to the heyday of Silk Road, the now-defunct dark market. According to a presentation dated February 2014, the department said that it was working to ""build the capacity of field agents to identify virtual currency exchangers"", but at the time made no reference to blockchain analysis.  Since then, DHS has also moved to fund blockchain-related projects, later telling CoinDesk that it was especially interested in applications related to security and IoT.

42399716,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR2P,1490183114,Fire the Miners? Radical Ideas Emerge as Bitcoin Fork Talk Escalates,"Bitcoin is in a state of emergency – or, at least, the community thinks so.  Tensions are high as bitcoin's long-standing scaling debate escalated this week, with some miners talking openly about forcing a possible bitcoin fork that could result in two competing coins.  If that's not enough of a concern, some miners have even been discussing a possible attack on the old blockchain once they move on to mining the new one – dialogue that has prompted concerning statements from exchanges and other industry startups.  It's unclear if either will happen, and others aren't terribly concerned, with some going as far as to describe the recent frenzy as an attempt at price manipulation.  But amid all this, developers seem to be at least responding to community pressures, putting forth creative, if controversial, solutions, such as a way of making upgrades to bitcoin that depends on the economy rather than mining pools.  Another idea is even starting to take shape that might be best considered an emergency measure should miners be serious about forcing a system upgrade.  The thought is that, if such a subsequent attack were to occur, then developers could go so far as to propose a switch to bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm that would hobble today's miners by rendering their current computer hardware redundant.  While Bitcoin Core developers might not agree on much, they do have an aversion to forks without near unanimous support. This algorithm switch, though – recently taking shape into a more formal proposal called Bitcoin Proof-of-Work Initiative (complete with a website and a Twitter account) – requires one.  One developer even called it a ""likely"" course of action, at least in the right circumstances.  James Hilliard, a developer and technician at Bitcoin mining supply company BitmainWarranty, told CoinDesk:  ""If enough miners were to, say, fork Bitcoin Unlimited and attack the non-forked chain without the support of the community then the likely response would be to change proof-of-work.”  In conversation, Bitcoin Core developers stressed the fact that such discussions are exploratory – and that they remain unconvinced this threat of a fork is any different than similar efforts in the past.  Still, it seems like efforts are underway that take strategic planning forward.  ""Everything's on the table,"" Core contributor Eric Lombrozo said.  Solidifying an idea  The idea that bitcoin could replace its consensus algorithm is an older one, with Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr coding up a prototype for such a change last year.  ""It’s nothing new, it's sort of the assumed contingency plan for dealing with miners going against the wishes of the users,"" Hilliard said.  Further, the concept is common in other blockchain networks – for example, ethereum plans to switch from proof of work to an alternative further down its roadmap.  But, its apparent popularity in bitcoin might be new, with recent events giving the idea new life. Developers seem to think, if miners fork and end up attacking the old network (as rumored), that this would be the right emergency situation to deploy it.  A perhaps less popular idea, though, is that the network already needs the change.  ""The mere existence of an entity with control of over 50% [of the network] is a problem warranting a change,"" said Dashjr.  As further evidence the idea is evolving quickly, BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen pointed out that switching the algorithm is possible with a soft fork – a backwards-compatible way to make the change.  The response  Still, despite support, it remains a contentious idea.  Vice-chairman of the board at the blockchain technology company BitFury Group George Kikvadze went as far as to tweet that his company would hire lawyers to sue developers working on such a change.  ""[W]e will spare no resources,"" he wrote.  Others have called developers promoting such an algorithm swap hypocritical, since they've been opposed to such big bitcoin changes in other circumstances. Still, supporters see it as a necessary last resort.  Pseudonymous Bitcoin Core contributor BTCDrak told CoinDesk:  ""A PoW change will not happen unless miners attack the bitcoin chain, make no mistake, it won't happen without a crisis to justify it.""  One mining pool leader agreed.  ""In response to post-split attack with intention to kill original chain, changing PoW would be the best option at that moment,"" SatoshiLabs co-founder and CEO Marek Palatinus, who runs Slush Pool, tweeted.  Indeed, right now, the impetus seems to be discussion of a potential post-fork attack, though whether or not the proposal will be put into play remains to be seen.  Better solutions?  Stepping back a bit, ETH Zürich computer science postdoc researcher Arthur Gervais pointed out that such a fork, if used, would only addresses a symptom of what he called a larger problem.  ""[T]his doesn’t really solve the problem of mining pools or the potential to build ASICs. It would be a temporary 'quick fix',"" he said.  Gervais pointed to experimental projects that might have longer-term promise in tackling aspects of mining centralization. SmartPool, for example, is a pool in the process of being built using ethereum smart contracts. Another paper outlines a new mining puzzle that could discourage miners from forming mining pools.  Still, some bitcoin developers seem to want to send a message to miners in the near term.  Hilliard concluded:  ""[T]his is a reason why it’s not in the best interest for miners to push for a controversial fork.""  Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Kikvadze’s title. This has been corrected.

42399690,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR1Q,1490176807,R3 Targets Regulators for Next Wave of DLT Expansion,"The world's largest blockchain consortium is set to expand its membership to include a host of global regulators.  The news, revealed in interview with CoinDesk, follows R3's recent announcement that the State of Illinois had become the first US regulator to join the distributed ledger consortium.  Yet, shortly after that announcement, R3 CEO David Rutter teased broader plans to build a network of global regulators he called 'RegNet'.  After months of traveling the globe and meeting dozens of financial regulators, Rutter said it became apparent to his team that this group needed an easier way to communicate and collaborate on the technology.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Rutter explained how the RegNet participants would meet in parallel with the banking membership.  He said:  ""Ultimately, our goal is to have the regulators involved from the start, right from the design through the experiment and the pilot, and the prototyping.""  While distributed ledger technology has been touted for its potential to facilitate more efficient global transactions, the transparency it can provide won't be fully empowered until regulators learn how to access the data in near-real time.  As part of that learning curve, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation became the latest regulator to be granted a free membership to the consortium, following regulators from Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and the UK.  And that's just the beginning, according to Rutter. As more blockchain and distributed ledger prototypes begin to support live transactions, he expects regulators will have to follow suit – or in the case of early adopters, take the lead.  Facilitating oversight  And the wheels are already in motion to spur action.  As distributed ledger applications, such as the one launched last month by R3 member Northern Trust, appear at an increasing rate, R3 chief council and RegNet lead Isabelle Corbett said those regulators have been devoting more resources to working with her firm.  In addition to overseeing R3’s legal operations, Corbett has spent a large chunk of the past year flying to ""over 100"" financial regulators around the world.  With the promise of real-time compliance reporting, fund transparency and improved trade reporting, regulators stand to not only get more data to do their jobs, but, with a bit of work, an easier task of regulating, she said.  Rutter went on to explain how creating ""regulatory nodes"" powered by artificial intelligence will make it easier for regulators to track down illegal activity in the ""reams"" of date they will receive.  ""We're not talking about landing a rocket ship on a platform in the middle of the ocean,"" he said.  Corbett further elaborated on the potential benefits that regulators working together via a distributed ledgers could experience by being able to more easily look at the full context of a transaction.  ""We are in a system that is absolutely global and it is not one regulator per transaction,"" she said."" So we are building this ecosystem of regulators to figure out how we can make their job easier.""  Blockchain prairie  It just so happens that the most recent regulator to join R3 also helps oversee the first private equities fund powered by a blockchain.  In February, Illinois-chartered Northern Trust moved a portion of its private equities business to a blockchain powered by IBM Blockchain, the tech giant's newly revealed commercial application of Hyperledger Fabric.  Now that the State of Illinois has joined R3 and unveiled a sweeping set of blockchain measures, the state regulator is looking for ways to further support Northern Trust and other financial institutions considering joining the consortium.  As part of that effort, however, the deputy director of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, Cab Morris, said his state also looking to join other blockchain and distributed ledger consortia.  Morris told CoinDesk the decision to expand into other consortia was based on the desire to make it as easy as possible for the banks his agency oversees to build distributed ledger solutions shoulder to shoulder with his agency.  Going forward, he predicted that an increasing number of US regulators will take the same course of action.  Morris concluded:  ""You will start to see other regulators not just participating, but wanting to participate, because they see the value for them, and they see the value for the industry writ large.""
