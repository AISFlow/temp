At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading with a 0.07% gain in the past 30 days, which reveals the current consolidation situation it finds itself under. However, according to a technical analysis on TradingView, the Ethereum price could be well on its way to reaching a new all-time high after 12 weeks of consolidation. Ethereum Price Completes Bottom Formation According to a technical analysis of the Ethereum price in the weekly candlestick timeframe, the cryptocurrency is currently in its 12th week of consolidation after a decline that ended in the first week of August. Interestingly, analysis reveals that the consolidation is at the bottom of the lower trendline in a Channel Up trend in the weekly timeframe that started as far back as June 2022. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 Particularly, a close look at this Channel Up trend reveals that the Ethereum price action has been confined between its upper and lower trendlines in the past two and a half years. Fortunately, the trend is a bullish one with the creation of higher highs and higher lows, which suggests a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price. As it stands, the Ethereum price has been on an uptrend since the beginning of the week, essentially reversing last week’s declines. Consequently, the price has flipped from bearish to neutral on the weekly outlook and is now moving towards bullish. The only thing left is for the Ethereum price to keep pushing on this uptrend and flip above the weekly MA50 (50-Day Moving Average). A successful push above this level, according to crypto analyst InvestingScope, would not only signal an end to Ethereum’s prolonged consolidation but also set the stage for a rally toward the channel’s upper trendline. ETH On The Journey To Recording New Highs As it stands, the 1W Relative Strength Index has already crossed over its MA, lending charge to the momentum. All that’s left now is an Ethereum price break above the weekly MA50. A break above the MA50 on the weekly timeframe would confirm the shift from consolidation to bullish momentum, draw in fresh buying interest and open up Ethereum’s path to creating a higher high within the Channel Up structure. Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline The Channel Up structure is structured in such a way that the creation of a new higher high at this point would necessitate a break above the current all-time high of $4,900. A touch of the upper trendline in the Channel Up would see the Ethereum price peaking above $5,500 before undergoing any major correction. “When that happens, aim for no lower than the All Time High (TP = 4,900),” the analyst said.

Most of the digital assets are in the green zone meaning that their prices are rising and the outlook of the market is generally positive. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X?

The diverging performances between the two top digital assets now serve as an interesting sub-plot to an exciting week ahead for the general cryptocurrency industry. Ethereum And Bitcoin- A Contrasting Story Of Market Run As the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, it’s natural for analysts and observers to take a second look at Ethereum and Bitcoin. While both digital assets have notched some gains, with Bitcoin rising by 1.90% and ETH by 2.59%, they still paint contradicting storylines. $ETH is moving according to plan but is underperforming BTC from the past few weeks.

Last Tuesday, BTC tested the $73k level again, and analysts expect it will record another all-time high soon. In contrast, Ethereum’s run has been sluggish, falling short of expectations. While ETH joined other coins in a mini-rally this week, its current price of $2,687 is still far from the analysts’ target of $4,000. ETH’s Recent Run- What Analysts Are Saying The contrasting price runs and milestones for both top cryptos have attracted some attention. For most analysts, Bitcoin’s recent price performance validates its standing as the current top digital asset. Ethereum’s struggles to hit the elusive $4k have been criticized by some traders and analysts, with many stating that Solana is now “the next Ethereum.” ETH is not dying.#ETH / #BTC is doing what it always does.

Benjamin Cowen, the founder and CEO of ITC, took to Twitter/X to say that the Ethereum blockchain “is not dying.” In the same post, he shared that he expects ETH/BTC to bottom this quarter and will make a run next year.

Some $1.3 billion of the profits derived from yield on U.S. Treasury holdings, while another $1.1 billion was thanks to the unrealized appreciation of the company's gold holdings in the reserve, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in an X post. The price of gold was higher by about 15% during the third quarter.  According to the latest quarterly attestation signed by accounting firm BDO Italy, the company's stablecoin issuer arm Tether International Limited and Tether Limited disclosed $125.5 billion of assets in reserve against $119.4 billion in liabilities as of September 30. Excess reserves backing Tether's stablecoins rose to over $6 billion.  Some $105 billion of the reserve assets were held in cash and cash equivalents, including $84.5 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, per the attestation. The company's direct and indirect exposure to T-bills, which includes holdings in money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements, surpassed $102 billion.

42373458,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNTg9,1730404441,Crypto Slumps Alongside Trump's Victory Odds on Polymarket as Uncertainty and Profit-Taking Rise,"Bitcoin is down 1.9% in the last 24 hours, but the broader crypto market has suffered a far deeper decline.  Trump’s Polymarket victory odds have also taken a beating and are now trading at 61 cents, compared to 67 cents on Wednesday.  The price action could be, but isn't necessarily attributed to the election uncertainty, one analyst said.  Growing uncertainty around the result of next week's U.S. presidential election could be pushing crypto lower just days after bitcoin {{BTC}} came within a few dollars of hitting a new record high. Bitcoin has slumped 1.9% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $70,600. Meanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins and exchange coins — is down 3.9% over the same time frame, led by ether {{ETH}} bleeding 5.3%.  Markets move for all sorts of reasons, but some market watchers are attributing the crypto slump to shrinking odds for a victory for crypto-friendly GOP candidate Donald Trump. On crypto betting site Polymarket, Trump's chances of winning tumbled to just 61% on Thursday from 67% 48 hours earlier. The victory odds for Democrat Kamala Harris have surged to 39% from 33%.  Meanwhile, the stock for Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) — seen by some as a proxy for Trump's chances next week — has plunged 34% in the last three days after gaining 352% over the previous month.  Broader traditional markets are having a tough go of it as well on Thursday, with the Nasdaq off 2.4% and the S&P 500 1.6%.  “Big slip-ups by both parties over the past few days (Puerto Rico, garbage) have reminded people that the election is too close to call and may be event-dependent,"" said Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise. ""This has re-introduced uncertainty,”  Not everyone is convinced, however. Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk that the U.S. election is only one facet of the current trading environment. Traders, he suggested, have also been looking at tech earnings, ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel and a sharp rise in U.K. gilt yields following the rollout of the government budget earlier this week.  Thompson reminded that traders could simply be profit-taking after strong momentum pushed bitcoin up 22% in 20 days, and Trump's Polymarket odds from 47% to 67% in a little over a month.  “Kamala's Polymarket odds fell to nearly 1:2, which — considering many think it's a toss up — some mean reversion makes complete sense,” Thompson said. “The reality is everyone is at a standstill until the election, and extremely cautious, so these moves in the final days leading up will have a lot of noise.”  Similarly, Brian Rudick, director of research at crypto trading firm GSR, told CoinDesk that while Trump’s Polymarket odds were weighing bitcoin down, the top cryptocurrency was behaving “very well” considering the decline in equity prices.  “Trump's election winner odds and the price of Bitcoin have had just a 25-35% correlation since Trump began to embrace the digital asset in May,” Rudick noted, though he said that correlation could potentially increase as election day nears.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/31/crypto-slumps-alongside-trumps-victory-odds-on-polymarket-as-uncertainty-and-profit-taking-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f814416ce7bed5106a27fd78b1f04eea45ad02db-4306x2422.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Besides boasting of high throughput and low fees while protecting traders from maximal extractive value (MEV) bots, the platform has been striking key partnerships. Injective Integrates With Fetch.ai And ASI This week, the proposal by Fetch.ai and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) community to integrate Injective was passed synonymously. The proposal passed with 100% of the votes agreeing with the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Expect 98% Crash After Blow Off To $250,000, Here’s Why Looking at voting data, over 324 million FET voted to endorse the idea, with only 656 FET rejecting it. No one voted to abstain or veto. Voting started on October 23 and ended five days later on October 28. According to the proposal, the goal is to revive the expired IBC client for Injective under “Revive expired IBC client for Injective.” In this way, Fetch.ai, now part of the ASI Alliance, can harness the power of AI within the sprawling Injective DeFi ecosystem. This arrangement will allow Fech.ai, an AI-centric platform, to directly plug its machine learning and AI capabilities into the Injective platform. Out of this, users will benefit from streamlined and leveraged AI-enabled tools when trading. The team also said they would benefit from improved liquidity management and asset allocation. Even with this deal, Injective and ASI will continue operating independently. The integration isn’t a merger but an Injective tapping into ASI’s AI capabilities. Why Is INJ Down? Bullish as this may be, INJ prices ticked lower, looking at the events in the daily chart. Injective bulls have yet to reverse losses posted on October 25 comprehensively. Accordingly, despite the series of higher highs over the weekend and in the first half of the week, sellers are in control. So far, INJ is down 20% from October highs and continues consolidating inside a $10 zone. Clear resistance is around $25, while support is at $15. If the bulls of Q1 2024 flow back, momentum will likely pick up once buyers break above the $25 level, preferably with increasing engagement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Near ATH – Volume Suggests A Big Move Ahead Besides improving crypto sentiment and rising total value locked (TVL) across DeFi, INJ could benefit from Injective’s core feature. The protocol has the highest revenue-to-fully diluted valuation (FDV) ratio, even better than Ethereum. The high metric translates to Injective boasting of an efficient revenue generation mechanism that could further boost prices.

42373461,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNU1B,1730401299,Michael Saylor Conjures Stock Market Magic With Giant Plan to Buy More Bitcoin,"Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, whose stock price has tripled this year, topped Coinbase (COIN) as the biggest crypto stock.  MicroStrategy is up Thursday even after the company's massive plan to sell $21 billion of new shares — a plan that would likely drive down most other companies.  ""MicroStrategy shareholders are a unique cohort. Typically, when shareholders get diluted, this is a bad thing,"" said CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten.  In Michael Saylor's world, economics appear to be upside down.  He's turned MicroStrategy, originally a relatively unknown software business into corporate America's largest bitcoin {{BTC}} bull, amassing a gigantic stockpile of the cryptocurrency.  On Wednesday, his company announced it would issue and then sell $21 billion of its own stock — a move that, for most any other publicly traded company — would prove disastrous for current shareholders. That's because MicroStrategy's market capitalization was about $50 billion when the plan was announced, meaning the ownership stake represented by that existing equity will be diluted by roughly one-third. A 33% plunge or so in its stock price wouldn't be much of a surprise.  But MicroStrategy — and the fervent fanbase around it — isn't like most stocks. Its shares rose about 1% on Thursday after more than tripling so far this year, driving its market cap above Coinbase (COIN), which had been the largest crypto stock and slumped after the crypto exchange's disappointing third-quarter results. MicroStrategy, whose value tracks bitcoin's price given the significant size of the company's holdings, even climbed as BTC's price fell.  MicroStrategy's rally ""is a testament to investor confidence in the firm's accretive dilution strategy for bitcoin — wherein MicroStrategy leverages capital markets to buy bitcoin, diluting shares by issuing more, but accreting shareholder value via its bitcoin purchases,"" said Joe Consorti, head of growth at Theya.  The stock sale is what's known as an at-the-market equity offering — a type of deal that lets companies sell shares directly at prevailing prices, often providing a more flexible and less onerous way to raise capital compared with a conventional secondary offering.  It's, in fact, the largest such offering ever — by a factor of four, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The fact that MicroStrategy shareholders are accepting such dilution at prices prevailing before the plan was announced — rather than demanding a steep discount — suggests the strength of their belief in Saylor's corporate strategy.  ""MicroStrategy shareholders are a unique cohort. Typically, when shareholders get diluted, this is a bad thing,"" said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. ""However, as a MicroStrategy shareholder, I celebrate being diluted as I know MicroStrategy are going out and buying bitcoin, which increases the bitcoin per share as a company which is accretive for shareholder value.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/31/michael-saylor-conjures-stock-market-magic-with-giant-plan-to-buy-more-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e80dd67adba91ef6d23544aaa065cde5f65ecfd-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In its third-quarter filing ending September 30th, 2024, the company disclosed its revenues were up by 165%, and its overall year-to-date (YTD) net deposits increased to $34 million. Related Reading: Tether’s $1 Billion USDT Mint On Tron: What’s Fueling The Demand Surge? It’s a promising development for Robinhood Markets this quarter after facing plenty of challenges in the past. The company took a hit in early 2021 after it decided to restrict trading in GameStop and other meme stocks during a market frenzy. In a separate statement, Robinhood shared that it’s inching closer to a settlement with investors and traders. Q3 Filing Is Company’s Second-Best Revenue Despite its challenging backstory and the SEC’s regulatory pressures, Robinhood Markets found its rhythm to post a solid third-quarter performance. The company shared that its net deposits grew to $34 billion, and revenue increased 36% yearly to $367 million, with its cryptocurrency unit leading the surge. In its filing, Robinhood stated that its cryptocurrency revenue increased to $61 million over the quarter or 165%. Market observers expected this growth after the company completed its takeover of Bitstamp, thus pushing its trading volume. Robinhood Surprises With Impressive Growth Robinhood’s growth story impressed many market observers and analysts, given its recent experience with FTX, the ‘meme frenzy,’ and run-ins with the SEC. Last year, the company bought back its shares from Alameda Research for $605 million. At the time of the transaction, many observers expected that Robinhood would avoid cryptocurrency investments. However, the company surprised analysts by making crypto a critical investment through its Robinhood Crypto unit. For its Q3 filing, Robinhood’s Asset Under Custody (AUC) surged by 76% year-over-year to more than $152 billion. The firm reported that its holdings increased due to higher equity, better crypto valuation, and sustained deposits. The company has a portfolio heavy on Bitcoin, and the recent rise in the top crypto bodes well for the firm, which will continue to earn as long as the trend remains bullish for BTC. Related Reading: On The Verge Of History: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000 Barrier, Eyes New Record High – Details Robinhood Finally Moving Ahead After Regulatory Pressures Robinhood Markets is finally moving away from the challenges and issues. As mentioned, the company was embroiled in a trading scandal in early 2021 over the hype on GameStop and meme stocks. Last May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to the company. The agency argued that some of Robinhood’s cryptocurrency services violate securities laws. Interestingly, the SEC has not filed a case against the company. In the meantime, Robinhood Markets is business as usual. Based on reports, Robinhood has listed several tokens and allowed transfers for assets like SOL. However, access to the service is limited to EU customers.

42373448,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNT5L,1730393820,Industry-Funded Polls Back Crypto Message: They Have Enough Voters to Make a Splash,"The latest in a series of election polls purchased by industry groups produced the answers they wanted to hear, that some number of voters say they'll make decisions with crypto top-of-mind.  With the statistical grains of salt the survey methods require, the results do broadly indicate increased crypto interest among U.S. voters.  The latest crypto election poll illustrates — according to its industry sponsor — that single-issue crypto voters exist. That's a point the industry has been seeking to score for months, and its potential ramifications in future Washington policy discussions could run deep.  The crypto industry's new online survey was fielded with an aim to demonstrate such voters exist, according to the highly pointed question asked of respondents. While the sample size of likely voters was small and margin of error wide, the Paradigm-funded survey reported that 5% of those questioned said they're digital-asset voters before all other issues.  Whether or not that number demonstrates the honest sentiment of those voters, it indicates that some people in America are willing to at least say they're dedicated crypto voters. In a race as potentially tight as the one between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, any block of voters could tip the balance.  The poll emerging this week from investment firm Paradigm is the first to ask the question in such a focused (albeit potentially leading) way:  ""Would you say you are a single-issue crypto voter, in that government policy on crypto is the most important policy you consider when selecting a candidate for office?""  As Paradigm's Justin Slaughter and Dominique Little noted in a blog post on their poll, ""Five percent of voters identify themselves as single-issue crypto voters, and crypto owners could easily be the margin of victory or defeat in this seemingly razor-thin election.""  Read More: Crypto Poll: U.S. Voters More Serious About Demanding Candidates With Know-How  The caveats are many, including that Paradigm's hired survey firm, Dynata, tapped a limited number of 1,000 people and applied weighting to the responses to mold the results into something that better reflects the U.S. electorate. The margin of error is stated at 3.5% overall, but that necessarily rises as subsets of those surveyed are more closely analyzed, which was the case for that central question. The survey only asked the single-issue question of the 20% of people who said they had crypto investments, and since a quarter of those said yes, that their crypto enthusiasm made them single-issue voters, that comes out to 5% of the overall survey.  If the resulting 5% number were an accurate snapshot of voters, crypto enthusiasts almost certainly would decide the national outcome, which would cement the case that the industry has earned a significant sphere of influence in Washington. Putting aside that veracity of the number, though, the poll at least suggests a group of voters who are highly motivated on crypto issues – a scenario that could put politicians on-notice about digital assets policy matters as they come up for consideration in Washington against next year.  As with other industry polls, this one also suggested that being younger, male and a minority made respondents more likely to cheer for crypto, and answers compared with previous surveys seemed to demonstrate the Republican Party was increasingly seen as the stronger pro-crypto party. This week's poll also aligns closely with one earlier this month — paid for by the Digital Chamber — that suggested an even bigger 16% of voters considered digital assets as a prominent factor in their choices, though that online survey was also small with a relatively high potential error margin.

35410149,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650850,1730392213,"Crypto Analyst Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.4, What Does Elon Musk Have To Do With It?","The Dogecoin price now looks like it has established support of around $0.17, having rebounded just below it in the past 24 hours. With the $0.17 price level cleared, the next step is a convincing break above $0.18. Interestingly, technical analysis of the Dogecoin price suggests a strong multi-year resistance level between $0.18 and $0.20. Technical analysis using Elliot waves suggests a break above the resistance levels could open up the path to a peak of $2.4. While this target may seem ambitious, Dogecoin has attracted renewed popularity and recent price gains, which reflect its ability to capture investor interest. This is particularly evident in recent actions by billionaire Elon Musk, who brought Dogecoin into the mainstream conversation. Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin To $2.4, Elon Musk A Huge Factor Aside from the recent wider increase in crypto prices spearheaded by Bitcoin, it is evident that the current Dogecoin performance has also been bolstered by Elon Musk and his “Department Of Government Efficiency.” Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 According to an analysis by an analyst that goes by @HovWaves on social media platform X, Dogecoin is prime for a surge to $2.4. As you can imagine, reaching this level would require Dogecoin to attract investment inflows from every corner of investor cohorts. Fortunately, recent events have been drawing increased attention to Dogecoin, one of which is the presidential election campaigns in the United States. Campaigns have seen the introduction of the Department of Government Efficiency by Elon Musk, which is a campaign tactic by Republican candidate Donald Trump to cut $2 trillion in federal spending. Although seemingly unrelated to cryptocurrencies, the term has caught waves among Dogecoin investors, especially as it abbreviates as DOGE, the Dogecoin ticker. Interestingly, Elon Musk has fueled this narrative among Dogecoin investors by recently posting a picture of him alongside the Dogecoin avatar. As HovWaves noted, all the talk surrounding the Department Of Government Efficiency has made DOGE a household name in recent weeks. This surge in interest is reflected in the Dogecoin price, which has increased by 60% since October 1. Dogecoin’s Timeline To Reaching $2.4 According to technical analysis using the Elliot Wave theory, Dogecoin is currently on the third impulse wave, a phase known to be massively bullish. This bullish trend has seen Dogecoin on its way to breaking above a major resistance level, which HovWaves highlighted to be just below $0.18. Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline A successful breakout of the resistance level would open up the stage for Dogecoin to retest its 2024 high of $0.22. A subsequent break above this high would send it towards its all-time high of $0.73 in May 2021. With enough momentum, HovWaves predicted Dogecoin would eventually settle at a price target in the $1.9 to $2.9 confluence area by July 2025. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1725. A break towards $1.9 and $2.9 would reflect 1,000% and 1,585% gains, respectively.

42373460,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNTvv,1730391338,Trump's Crypto Business Slashes Fundraise Goal by 90% After Lackluster Sales,"Donald Trump's crypto business World Liberty Financial slashed its fundraising goal after sales of its WLFI token fell dramatically short of the initial target, according to a regulatory filing.  The company now plans to raise up to $30 million from investors, a 90% cutback from the $300 million World Liberty Financial had originally sought. An SEC filing dated Oct. 30 says World Liberty Financial plans to ""terminate"" WLFI sales upon hitting $30 million.  The change raises the possibility that former President Trump – who is running for election next week – may not quickly see any big payday from World Liberty Financial.  A Trump-owned entity called DT Marks DEFI LLC will get paid 75% of ""net protocol revenues"" (which include token sales) only after World Liberty Financial amasses a $30 million warchest to fund operations, according to public documents.  World Liberty Financial has struggled mightily to hit even half that. Since launching in mid-October, its wallet has received just over $14 million worth of cryptocurrencies from investors buying up the project's WLFI tokens. After a flurry of initial activity – including a period on launch day when its website crashed – demand fell off a cliff.  Lackluster demand may be the result of investors jittery about the World Liberty's fundamentals. As pointed out in a research note from Galaxy Digital, WLFI token has no mechanism to accrue value. It's a governance token over a protocol that doesn't yet exist.  An SEC filing dated Oct. 30 says World Liberty Financial has up to $288 million worth of ""nontransferable digital tokens"" available for sale. ""The company currently only plans to sell tokens up to $30M in the offering before terminating sale,"" the filing said.  At press time, World Liberty's website reflected the old sales target of $300 million. The company sold just under 1 billion of the 20 billion WLFI tokens available. It sold them at a valuation of $1.5 billion. But sold tokens remain frozen until further notice, meaning no one who bought WLFI can cash out on secondary markets.  Trump's company DT Marks DEFI LLC is slated to get 22.5 billion WLFI tokens worth over $330 million at World Liberty's public sale valuation.  What World Liberty Financial will be isn't exactly clear. Its website describes something akin to a portal for accessing crypto-investment opportunities. There's some talk of opening a borrow-and-lending service. Decrypt recently reported World Liberty Financial plans to launch a stablecoin.

The same developer team built Phoenix, a Solana-based decentralized exchange.  Ellipses closed a $20 million series A round in April, led by Paradigm.  Ellipsis Labs, the developer team behind the Solana-based decentralized exchange Phoenix, has raised $21 million from Haun Ventures to launch Atlas, a new blockchain purpose-built for what is being termed, ""verifiable finance.""  Co-founders Eugene Chen and Jarry Xiao, who have backgrounds in high-frequency trading, founded Ellipsis Labs in 2022. According to a statement from Haun Ventures, their ""key insight"" was that ""high-performance financial products can rival traditional finance without sacrificing transparency, auditability or censorship resistance.""  Ellipses aims to address key problems in DeFi, like inefficient price discovery and high transaction costs, which make it difficult for decentralized finance platforms to compete with traditional financial systems. Phoenix, their order book-style exchange on Solana, has already facilitated over $50 billion in trades since its 2023 launch, according to data from DefiLlama.  Ellipsis says it plans to apply its learnings from building Phoenix to Atlas, a new network that will reportedly feature ultra-low fees and will be built for high transaction throughput.  Initially launching as a layer-2 solution on Ethereum, Atlas is designed to plug into both Ethereum and Solana’s liquidity pools. Key features will include low-latency transaction processing, reliable oracle updates, and robust sequencing for non-custodial, on-chain price discovery, according to Haun Ventures.

35409939,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100038,1730388252,"Bitcoin Google Search Interest Remains Flat Despite $73,600 Surge: What History Tells Us","While Bitcoin (BTC) has surged past $73,000 this week, Google searches for the leading asset remain low, unlike past peaks. Bitcoin experienced a strong upward surge as the week began, reaching $69,000 by Monday and continuing its climb. By Tuesday, BTC broke significant price thresholds, surpassing $70,000 and then $71,000.The bullish momentum extended into Wednesday morning when Bitcoin hit $73,600, marking its highest value since its record peak in March. Market attention focused on this rally, but recent observations highlighted an unusual trend in search interest.Bitcoin Near ATH, but Mentions Remain LowRecent data suggests that while Bitcoin’s price has approached its all-time highs, search trends tell a different story. Insights shared on X pointed out that, despite the surge, Google searches for ""Bitcoin"" remained notably low. Historically, Bitcoin's bull runs have coincided with spikes in search volume, which reflected increased retail participation. The 2017 bull run serves as a prime example, with Bitcoin climbing to nearly $20,000 as Google Trends index levels soared past 80. A similar pattern emerged during the late 2020 to 2021 rally, where Bitcoin's rise past $60,000 aligned with significant search interest, though not reaching 2017 levels.However, the 2024 rally has unfolded differently. Initially, in the first quarter of the year, high search interest in Bitcoin mirrored its all-time high rally to $73,750 in March. Yet, significant interest in searches diminished in the seven months that followed.Now, despite the price nearing record levels again for the second time this year, Google Trends shows lower search interest, suggesting that retail engagement may not have peaked and that the rally has only just begun.Historical Trends Confirm More Upside for Bitcoin Meanwhile, October has historically been pivotal for Bitcoin's upward momentum. Market intelligence platform Lookonchain noted a recurring trend: since 2013, Bitcoin has repeatedly posted significant gains in October. Notable years include 2013, 2017, 2020, 2021, and most recently, 2023. Specifically, the October 2023 rally was significant, with Bitcoin achieving a 28.54% monthly gain that set the stage for a five-month uptrend.Starting from a price of $26,965 in early October 2023, Bitcoin climbed steadily, reaching over $73,000 by March 2024, a 173% increase. This period marked consecutive months of gains and positioned Bitcoin for another potential surge post-October 2024, following market corrections in the second and third quarters.Post-U.S. Election Price MovementsAnother factor shaping market analysis is Bitcoin's price movement following past U.S. presidential elections. Market watcher Ali Martinez highlighted this trend, citing 2012, 2016, and 2020 data. After the November 2012 election, Bitcoin's price surged by 10,640%, peaking at $1,137 by December 2013. The November 2016 election showed a similar pattern, with Bitcoin climbing 2,698% to reach $18,970 in December 2017. Following the November 2020 election, Bitcoin gained 386%, reaching a then-record high of $69,000 in November 2021.

35409938,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100045,1730387024,"Stablecoins Capture 10% of South Korea’s Trade Transactions, with TRON-Based USDT Leading","A South Korean government official has reportedly disclosed that around 10% of the country’s domestic trade transactions are conducted using stablecoins, specifically Tether (USDT). Ki Young Ju, founder of CryptoQuant, disclosed this today. The report highlighted the growing use of stablecoins in South Korea's trade and noted that traders find stablecoins appealing due to their low fees, fast transaction speeds, and bypassing South Korea's strict foreign exchange regulations. Moreover, using stablecoins, traders avoid SWIFT costs, currency conversion fees, and delays associated with traditional methods. TRON-Based Tether Leading the ChargeAmid this disclosure, Ki Young Ju noted that USDT holds a 72% share of the stablecoin market. Notably, most transactions occur on the TRON blockchain rather than Ethereum. For instance, Tether minted $1 billion worth of USDT on Tron in one transaction two days ago. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuers minted other lower values in units of $50 million on Ethereum.Moreover, data from Defillama indicates that Tron-based USDT accounts for 49.52% of Tether’s $120 billion supply, while Ethereum comes in lower at 39.13%.The preference for TRON-based USDT is attributed to its lower transaction fees and faster processing speeds, making it an ideal choice for trade. Young Ju stated that the choice of TRON for USDT transactions reflects a strong product-market fit. This highlights how TRON’s scalability and cost-effectiveness make it particularly attractive to businesses.https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1851902230724739533Concerns About Stablecoins’ Role in South Korea’s Trade TransactionsNotably, stablecoins in South Korea's financial landscape help businesses bypass the lengthy procedures and fees associated with traditional currency exchanges. They offer near-instant transfers and minimal costs, providing businesses greater flexibility and efficiency in cross-border trade.However, the growing reliance on stablecoins raises concerns for regulators.

35405897,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650867,1730386850,Dogwifhat (WIF) Prepares For A Bullish Breakout – Analyst Sets $3 Target,"Dogwifhat (WIF) has emerged as one of this cycle’s standout meme coins, and a major move might be imminent. WIF is trading just above $2.5, a key support level that top analyst and investor Ali Martinez believes could be a launchpad for a 17% surge to the $3 mark. Martinez shared a technical analysis highlighting WIF’s strong base above $2.5, signaling that bullish momentum is building for the token. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target – Analyst As WIF holds above this crucial level, investor optimism and trading volume are rising, suggesting that both short-term and long-term holders are preparing for another leg up. The next few days—or even hours—could be decisive, as WIF sits at a pivotal point that could set the stage for significant gains. With interest in meme coins surging and market sentiment favoring breakout plays, Dogwifhat is on track to test the $3 mark soon. If WIF breaks through, it may continue to draw more interest as one of the leading tokens in this meme coin cycle. Dogwifhat Holding Above Key Support Level Dogwifhat (WIF) has remained in a consolidation phase after reaching a local high of $2.97, now stabilizing above a crucial support level at $2.5. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, this consolidation period could set the stage for a breakout. Martinez shared a technical analysis on X highlighting a bullish pattern forming on WIF’s 1-hour timeframe, suggesting that the token may soon be ready to push higher. Martinez’s analysis indicates that WIF’s resistance level within this bullish pattern sits around $2.6. Should WIF break above this key resistance, a surge to the $3 mark is anticipated, which could spark renewed interest in the token. As meme coin traders know, FOMO (fear of missing out) can drive demand rapidly, especially for tokens with strong online communities and viral appeal. A move above $3 could position Dogwifhat as a top contender among this cycle’s meme coins, potentially leading to increased trading volume and broader market interest. Related Reading: Dogecoin Metrics Reveal Increasing Network Activity – Is DOGE Ready To Break Yearly Highs? However, broader market conditions, particularly Bitcoin’s price action, will play a crucial role in determining whether WIF and other meme coins continue their uptrend. Many traders and analysts are watching Bitcoin closely, as a push above its all-time high could catalyze a rally across the entire market. If BTC breaks into new highs, the resulting optimism and influx of capital could serve as the final push that Dogwifhat needs to leap to the $3 mark and beyond. Until then, WIF remains in a holding pattern, with its potential for a breakout hinging on technical triggers and broader market sentiment. WIF Technical Levels To Watch Dogwifhat (WIF) trades at $2.56, breaking above the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) set at $2.49. This move above the 200 MA signals bullish momentum, and WIF firmly holds the $2.52 level. Previously a resistance, this $2.52 mark supports the token’s uptrend. For WIF bulls to build further momentum, the price must push past the $2.7 mark, potentially paving the way for a run to local highs around $3. Breaking through these levels could attract renewed buying interest, especially as the market anticipates broader upward movements in leading assets. However, should WIF fail to maintain its position above the $2.5 mark, it may face a pullback, with support likely in a lower demand zone around $2.41.

42373459,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNTqf,1730386800,Crypto for Advisors: Don’t Be Spooked By Crypto,"Don’t be spooked by crypto!  While digital assets may seem unfamiliar, understanding their unique characteristics can empower advisors to support client interest in this asset class.  In today's Halloween issue, Bryan Courchesne from DAIM breaks down some of the challenges and opportunities for advisors wanting to understand these assets.  Then, Nick Rygiel from Ironclad Financial LLC answers questions about supporting clients in Ask an Expert.  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Don’t Be Scared – Embrace the Opportunity with Crypto Investing  As Halloween approaches with its haunted houses and spooky surprises, it’s easy to get caught up in things that go bump in the night. But when it comes to crypto investing, there’s no need to fear what lurks in the shadows — especially the concept of 24x7 trading. While the thought of a market that never sleeps might send chills down your spine, it’s actually one of crypto’s biggest strengths. Instead of being scared by the nonstop nature of crypto markets, investors should see it as an exciting opportunity to grow their portfolios — especially with the help of a skilled crypto advisor who can guide you through the complexity.  Why 24/7 trading is a game-changer  Unlike traditional stock markets, which close at 4 p.m., aren’t open on weekends, and take holidays off, crypto markets never sleep. This gives investors the freedom to trade at any time, regardless of where they are in the world. For many, this freedom may seem overwhelming and, paradoxically, may limit their participation. After all, who wants to be on alert around the clock, monitoring prices and making snap decisions? In traditional markets, significant events, partnerships or regulatory updates can be researched and synthesized during non-market hours. This allows investors to create a well-formulated plan and be prepared to act accordingly when markets open. In crypto, however, prices can move at any time. You may have loved Solana at $150 on Friday night, but how do you feel about it at $185 on Sunday morning? This is a unique dilemma that crypto investors constantly face; you often need to act early and with conviction or risk being left behind. If this inundation of information seems like taking a drink from a firehose, having a crypto advisor can provide a significant advantage. An advisor can afford to devote most of their time to a 24/7 market because this is their profession, whereas most investors will have a completely unrelated profession that takes up most of their waking hours.  Navigating volatility with confidence  For many new investors, this nonstop, volatile market leads to overreacting to every new piece of information and overtrading their accounts. For the majority of investors, your crypto portfolio is like a bar of soap: The more you handle it, the less of it you have. That’s why having a trusted professional can pay dividends. Many people benefit from having a crypto advisor oversee their portfolio while they focus on more important things in their lives. Having someone to safeguard your investments while you check in periodically can greatly improve your performance — and your sanity — over time.  Avoiding emotional decisions  If you’ve been in crypto long enough, you’ve probably made some decisions you wish you could take back. The fear of missing out (FOMO) has wrecked many new investors. You see a token appreciating 10x in a few days, and people on social media are saying this rocket won’t stop until it reaches the moon. So, you buy in — only for it to crash. Or, perhaps you’re holding a token that’s down 90%, and you decide to sell to cut your losses, only to see it soar a few weeks later. Taking a step back and seeing the bigger picture is essential, but that can be hard when you have emotional ties to your holdings. This is another area where an advisor can provide great value. Advisors take a professional, long-term approach to investing, helping clients avoid emotional reactions to market movements.  Simplifying the complexity  For new investors, crypto markets can seem overwhelming — especially when combined with the constant activity of 24x7 trading. Between technical analysis, global news and wallet security, it can be easy to feel lost. Many investors tend to overanalyze their situation and try to develop a unique strategy, but a trusted advisor can help cut through the noise. Advisors work with many different types of investors, so while you may think your situation is unique, an advisor will recognize patterns that align you with similar investors. They can craft a portfolio that gives you autonomy while ensuring your strategy matches your risk profile and investment horizon. This simplifies the management process and sets you up for long-term success without the need to react to every piece of market or personal news.  Conclusion: embrace this new market with a trusted guide  While investing in crypto may seem scary at first glance, including this asset in a diversified portfolio can be one of the biggest advantages for an adventurous investor. And you don’t have to face it alone. Partnering with an experienced crypto advisor allows you to navigate this market with confidence, strategy and peace of mind.  So, don’t be scared by crypto markets. Instead, embrace the opportunities they provide, knowing that with the right guidance, you can thrive in this exciting new world of investing.  - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Ask an Expert  Q: Why Do You Think Some Financial Advisors Have Kept Their Distance from Crypto?  A: The crypto industry can seem unfamiliar and unsettling. It's not just the volatility or complexity; it's the rapid pace of change, the idealistic builders pushing boundaries, and the occasional ""raccoons"" — as Ben Hunt refers to scammers and thieves — that make headlines. Even AI agents on platforms like X are expressing frustration about not having their own self-custodied crypto wallets. However, as advisors, it's our responsibility to objectively assess new developments and help clients navigate them confidently. By staying informed about emerging technologies that impact our industry, we can provide better guidance and prevent fear from keeping us — or our clients — in the dark.  Q: With the Launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, What Should Advisors Learn About Next?  A: Beyond ETFs, advisors should delve into on-chain crypto wallets and payment systems like stablecoins to understand their behavioural dynamics. I've found exploring Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and its primitives—lending, borrowing, staking, providing liquidity — offers valuable insights. DeFi operates without intermediaries, relying on persistent code (smart contracts) that functions transparently on public networks.  Q: How Can Advisors Assist Clients Who Want to Self-Custody Their Digital Assets?  A: As decentralized applications evolve, some clients now hold significant wealth in self-custodied digital assets. We can support them by discussing best practices like using multi-signature wallets to enhance security while maintaining control over their private keys. This collaborative approach helps clients understand potential pitfalls and plan contingencies to ensure their loved ones are cared for if something happens to them. Platforms like L1.co — which I'm personally involved with — enable advisors to understand a client's financial situation related to their self-custodied on-chain digital assets  - Nick Rygiel, financial advisor & owner: Ironclad Financial LLC  Keep Reading  Bitcoin traded above $71,000 Tuesday morning with high trading activity.

35409936,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100046,1730386407,"China Reduces Its US Treasury Bonds from $1.2T to Under $800B, Will It Consider Bitcoin?","In recent years, China has consistently reduced its exposure to US Treasury bonds but has turned to gold rather than other alternative assets like Bitcoin. Per data from the US Treasury, China’s holdings of US Treasury bonds have declined from a peak of around $1.2 trillion in 2017 to under $800 billion this month. This decline indicates a change in China’s strategy, a move away from the US dollar and towards other assets that hold less dependency on the American economy. However, despite this diversification, China has steered clear of Bitcoin as a potential addition to its reserves. Instead, over the past decade, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has been gradually accumulating gold reserves. China Avoids Bitcoin While Acquiring GoldThe acquisition of gold acts as a hedge against inflation and a more stable asset to balance its portfolio. China aims to shield itself from risks tied to the dollar’s value and political uncertainties surrounding US fiscal policies.Ecoinometrics, an economic analysis firm, recently noted that this shift shows China’s plan to lessen its reliance on the US dollar as a reserve currency. While China’s strategy has seen it acquire gold, Bitcoin remains absent from the country’s portfolio. This is no surprise, given that China has imposed strict regulations on crypto. As a result, the nation has shown no intention of adopting Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy.Despite the rise of cryptocurrency adoption worldwide, the Chinese government maintains that the risks and potential for financial instability associated with Bitcoin outweigh any advantages it might offer. In this context, gold presents a far more traditional and stable alternative.While China is pulling back from US bonds, other regions, particularly in Europe, are stepping in to fill the gap. According to Ecoinometrics, Europe has shown increased interest in purchasing US Treasury bonds, with European investments reportedly offsetting the reduction in China’s holdings. Countries and Companies Turn to Bitcoin Meanwhile, as China steps away from both US bonds and Bitcoin, other countries and corporations are embracing the cryptocurrency. El Salvador made headlines in 2021 as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The South American nation has since continued to acquire BTC, now holding 5,918 BTC worth over $427 million. Recall that El Salvador committed to buying 1 BTC a day in November 2022 during the bear market. Further, the small country of Bhutan is also expanding its Bitcoin stash, with its holdings recently reaching 13,036 BTC, now worth $925 million. In addition, GOP candidate Donald Trump has hinted at retaining the BTC holdings of the U.S. government if he becomes president.Major corporations, too, have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation, with MicroStrategy leading the charge . However, while Bitcoin’s popularity continues to grow, China’s strict regulatory approach leaves little room for speculation on whether the country might reverse its stance. Despite this, the Chinese government holds 194K BTC, which it acquired from confiscations.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/10/31/china-reduces-its-us-treasury-bonds-from-1-2t-to-under-800b-will-it-consider-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=china-reduces-its-us-treasury-bonds-from-1-2t-to-under-800b-will-it-consider-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Per an announcement today, the crypto exchange will launch two promotional events centered around Shiba Inu-themed tokens, SHIB and DOGE, to commemorate Japan’s Dog Day on November 1. https://twitter.com/sbivc_official/status/1851930082123878785SBI VC Trade Promotional Events The promotional events are divided into two categories: a social media campaign (Doggie Contest) and a trading campaign (Doggie Race). Doggie Contest This promotional event will run for one week, from November 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM to November 8, 2024, at 23:59 PM. During this period, crypto enthusiasts must perform an easy social media task, such as following @sbivc_official X account and posting an AI-generated dog celebration image on X using the hashtag ‘#sbivc dog campaign.’ After this campaign ends, SBI VC Trade will randomly select 11 winners, with each receiving 10,000 yen worth of Amazon gift vouchers. The exchange said it will contact the lucky winners via X direct message by year-end. Doggie Race The second promotional event is a trading contest exclusive to users of SBI VC Trade. This event will commence from November 1, 2024, at 07:00 AM to December 1, 2024, at 06:59 AM. Interested participants must trade at least 10,000-yen worth of SHIB during the campaign period for a chance to win 1,000 yen in Shiba Inu tokens. Participants will need to complete the exchange’s KYC requirements before joining this contest. Upon the completion of the event, SBI will select 110 participants by lottery, with each user receiving 1,000 yen worth of SHIB. The exchange will distribute the rewards to the winners by January 31, 2025. Exchange Highlights SHIB and DOG Utility Meanwhile, the exchange provided brief details about the Shiba Inu-themed tokens, SHIB and DOGE. According to SBI VC Trade, both tokens use the Shiba Inu dog mascot. It emphasized that even though they initially launched as memecoins, they have transformed into utility tokens with real-world use cases. The exchange said that while DOGE has a payment utility, SHIB will be deployed to multiple platforms, including NFT marketplaces. SBI VC Trade Support for SHIB This is not the first time SBI VC Trade has launched a promotional event for SHIB. Last year, the exchange celebrated Kabosu-Chan’s birthday with a SHIB giveaway campaign. Furthermore, the exchange has continued to expand its support for SHIB, including allowing its users to earn a passive income stream in SHIB. This initiative requires SBI VC Trade users to lend their SHIB tokens to receive a 1.3% annualized return. Meanwhile, the SBI VC Trade campaign announcement has not positively impacted SHIB’s price. The token currently trades at $0.00001847, reflecting a 0.78% decline over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/10/31/sbi-vc-trade-announces-two-promotional-events-for-shiba-inu/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sbi-vc-trade-announces-two-promotional-events-for-shiba-inu,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The California-headquartered crypto exchange shilled Shiba Inu in a tweet today describing how the meme coin moved from a mere joke to a sensation in the crypto sector. Robinhood mentioned Shiba Inu’s origin, linking users to an earlier post that noted that the token’s rise was “one of crypto’s more popular stories.”Robinhood Lauds Shiba Inu’s Community-Driven NatureOne major Shiba Inu comment that appealed to the community is Robinhood’s mention that the second-largest meme coin by market cap was designed to be more community-driven than its major rival, Dogecoin. The exchange argued that the anonymity of the Shiba Inu founders and team shows their admirable aim at decentralization and community engagement.Although Dogecoin debuted before Shiba Inu, Robinhood noted that the $11 billion market cap token set the precedence the meme coin sector now possesses. Notably, many other memes and jokes base their inspiration on Shiba Inu and how it has transcended its meme coin origin.Robinhood stated that since its debut in 2020, Shiba Inu has shown that meme coins can be useful in the crypto sector. The community achieved this through the expansion of its ecosystem to include layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium and ShibaSwap.

This marks the first time an asset manager is building on the layer-2 blockchain.  The fund, which has a $410 million market cap, is available on five other blockchains, with Stellar being the primary network.  Wall Street giant Franklin Templeton said its OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) is now available on Coinbase’s (COIN) layer-2 blockchain, Base.  Base becomes the sixth blockchain that shares of the fund can be traded on. They are already available on Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Aptos and Stellar, which functions as the primary public blockchain.  “This is the first large asset manager to directly launch on Base, a clear signal to investors and issuers of what’s to come,” said Anthony Bassili, head of tokenization at Coinbase.  The layer 2, which went live in 2022, represented a big step in the evolution of Coinbase, opening a new venture for the exchange beyond being a marketplace for crypto. It has since become a fast-growing part of the company’s business, handling 55% more transactions in the third quarter than in the second.  Base quickly became one of the most popular layer-2 blockchains in the ecosystem. It currently has more than $8 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to data from L2Beat, quickly moving past some of its more established competitors. Only Arbitrum has more.  Layer 2s are designed to execute transactions faster and cheaper than the base Ethereum blockchain, making them a popular choice for products like FOBXX.  “Financial institutions like Franklin Templeton are increasingly taking advantage of fast, low-cost onchain technology to modernize the financial system,” Bassili said.  Launched in 2021, FOBXX was the first money-market fund to use a public blockchain to record transactions and ownership.

35401514,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650843,1730381410,"Institutional Traders Bet On Bitcoin Exceeding $79,300 By End Of November","Institutional traders are betting that Bitcoin will surge to $79,300 by the end of November. This bullish sentiment is evident in recent trading activities on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where Bitcoin options have experienced some of their highest trading volumes ahead of the US presidential election. Bitcoin To Rise Above $79,300? Joshua Lim, co-founder of Arbelos Markets—a trading firm providing liquidity across cryptocurrency derivatives markets—shared insights on X about these notable trades. “CME Bitcoin options just experienced some of its largest volume days ever, ahead of the US election,” Lim stated. He highlighted two substantial transactions that occurred in the past week. On Friday the 25th, traders purchased 1,875 Bitcoin units of the 29-November $70,000 strike calls. In options trading, a call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a specified strike price before the option expires. In this case, the strike price is $70,000, meaning the buyers are betting that Bitcoin will exceed this price by the end of November. Lim detailed that at the time of the trade, “$8.3 million of premium was paid, $147,000 of vega, $65 million of delta.” Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hit $200,000 Only If The Dollar Falls? Bitwise CIO Answers Then, on Tuesday the 29th, another significant trade occurred with the purchase of 3,050 Bitcoin units of the 29-November $85,000 strike calls, where the strike price is $85,000. Lim noted that “$4.6 million of premium was paid, $173,000 of vega, $42 million of delta” at the time of the trade. The amounts of $8.3 million and $4.6 million indicate substantial investment, reflecting strong confidence in Bitcoin’s potential rise. The high vega suggests that the traders expect significant volatility, which could be massive around the US election. Delta represents how much the option’s price is expected to change with a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset. High delta values of $65 million and $42 million imply substantial exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. The total notional value of these positions—the total value of the underlying assets represented by the options—is approximately $350 million. Lim pointed out that this is “large even in the context of Deribit,” referring to the world’s largest crypto options exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility To Peak By November 8 As ‘Trump Trade’ Intensifies – Report The breakeven point for these positions is just below $79,300. This means that for the traders to start making a profit, Bitcoin’s price needs to exceed this level by the option’s expiry date. This price represents about a 16% increase from Bitcoin’s price when these trades were executed. “Very bullish positioning into the election, and great to see institutions sizing up like this on CME,” Lim commented. He added, “Perhaps a good sign that there is and will be growing liquidity in the crypto derivatives markets as the asset class matures.” The timing of these trades is particularly noteworthy. With the US presidential election imminent, market volatility is expected to increase, potentially impacting the entire Bitcoin and crypto market. Overall, the majority of experts believe that a Trump victory is bullish for the BTC price. At press time, BTC traded at $72,382.

42373464,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNURT,1730381029,"Freed From Prison, Binance Founder CZ Gets Ovation in Dubai and Talks New Educational Venture","DUBAI — Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao was greeted with a standing-room-only crowd and ovation in his return to crypto following his release from a U.S. prison.  Attendees stood shoulder to shoulder at Binance Blockchain Week to hear Zhao, colloquially known as ""CZ,"" make his first public appearance since his release last month. He served a four-month sentence following his guilty plea for violating the Bank Secrecy Act during his time running the exchange.  Zhao took the stage Thursday on the second day of the event, a two-day conference held in Dubai. In the hour or so before his scheduled appearance, the main stage area began filling up and no seats were left half an hour before the scheduled time of his appearance. When he was announced, attendees cheered and pulled out their phones to film him walking up onto the stage.  Altcoin Daily founder Austin Arnold, the session's moderator, opened the talk by asking Zhao about his experience in prison.  ""First question, how was your summer?"" he asked, drawing laughter from the room.  Zhao smiled at first but grew serious as he delved into the charges he pleaded guilty to — including violating the Bank Secrecy Act — noting that per his plea agreement, he can't speak badly about the deal.  ""It's not good,"" he said of prison. ""It's less fun than now [at the Binance event]. I think the whole experience is just very limiting in a lot of ways, right? Your freedom is taken away and you have nothing to do, so it gives you a lot of time to reflect.""  The crypto founder, who spoke about missing his family, friends and colleagues during his time behind bars, said he has no immediate plans to run another crypto exchange.  He came back to the sentencing process itself a few times, saying the judge had a tough job but that he was also the first person to go to prison over a Bank Secrecy Act violation, in contrast with TD Bank's recent settlement with U.S. prosecutors in which no individual has so far pleaded guilty to any similar charges.  He also noted that while he was in prison, former President Donald Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris — the Republican and Democratic nominees for U.S. president, respectively — have started talking about crypto on the campaign trail.  ""I'm just sitting in prison like 'What the hell happened?' What if I waited for two months?"" he said.  Asked about what's next, Zhao said he's spending at least half of his time on an educational platform called Giggle Academy, something he originally announced last year.  The project is aiming to provide digital education services to people who don't have access to educational resources already, he told the audience.  ""Today there's about 700 to 800 million adults who are illiterate, and two-thirds of them are women. And on top of that, there's about, depending on which report you read, there's about 300 million to 500 million kids who don't go to school,"" he said. ""When you look at educational apps, educational projects, they're all in places where … they're all supplementing the existing education system.""  Alongside Giggle Academy, Zhao said he's focusing on investments, including in artificial intelligence, biotech and other blockchain projects.  Blockchain week  Zhao's successor, current Binance CEO Richard Teng, made the rounds on the exposition floor during the first day of the conference, taking photos with attendees both before and after his opening remarks.  During opening remarks on Wednesday, Teng said the theme for the upcoming year is ""momentum"" in the crypto industry, pointing to approvals of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. as an example of forward progress for the industry.  Around 4,000 people are in attendance, with 1 million more streaming the panels online, a spokesperson for Binance said.

Shares are down pre-market off the earnings report, and we’ll see how it trades in the next few days, but I’m not excited about owning Coinbase here. Innocent until proven guilty That’s how I’d view the chart of Coinbase right now, with the post-earnings indicated price at about $208. That means shares are holding the rising 20-day exponential moving average (in red below), and unless and until that’s broken, it’s still in a primary uptrend. StockCharts If Coinbase were to trade below that line, I’d become much less constructive on it technically. The momentum indicators are supporting the bulls right now, with the PPO well into positive territory, and still very much rising. The RSI is less bullish in my view, as we have a lower RSI reading from earlier this week as price made a new local high. That’s a divergence that isn’t of primary importance, but is a relevant factor in terms of waning short-term momentum. The other extremely important thing with Coinbase is its correlation to the price of Bitcoin. Obviously, Coinbase’s fortunes are quite literally tied to that of the masses wanting to own and trade cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being the OG in that space. It makes sense that Coinbase would derive a benefit from higher crypto prices, as that generally leads to more activity from retail traders. StockCharts The 20-day rolling correlation between Coinbase’s share price and Bitcoin’s price is staggering at 0.90. That implies they’re moving almost in lockstep with each other, although we do see this relationship ebb and flow at times. For now, Bitcoin is trying to make new all-time highs, and as long as this relationship holds, it may not matter short-term to investors what Coinbase’s fundamentals are showing. To that end, let’s take a look at the report, and why I am cautious on Coinbase looking ahead. A tough report, and more warning signs emerge Coinbase has pretty much always traded with nosebleed valuations, and that sort of thing is totally fine so long as the fundamentals support it. However, I don’t see it at the moment. Let’s start with analyst expectations heading into the report, which I’m sure will move in the coming days. Seeking Alpha Earnings are much more mature than they were in prior years, but the problem is that there’s a huge lack of confidence Coinbase can grow earnings in the years to come. Revisions have also been hugely negative in recent months, with 83% of moves being down. This is not a great backdrop, and the report itself supports this weak view. On a headline basis, Coinbase saw $1.21 billion in revenue, which was up almost 80% year-over-year, but still missed estimates by $40 million. EPS came to 28 cents, but that missed widely on estimates of 38 cents. Investor relations The fact that Coinbase is at a point where it’s looking like it can consistently earn meaningful profits is a big shift from prior years where it was spending a lot more than it brought in. But is this good enough? In my view, it’s tough to make the case for Coinbase, and even tougher after the third quarter report. Investor relations Consumer revenue is the big pot for Coinbase, and it’s been awful this year. Third quarter consumer revenue was down almost 50% from the first quarter of this year. It’s been extremely volatile so it’s totally possible we get another big number for Q4. But it’s been really terrible in the last two quarters and Q3 was another big deterioration. On the plus side, subscription revenue is on the move higher, although the sequential move was lower for Q3. If Coinbase can continue to grow its subscription revenue, the volatility of the consumer segment will become less important. All-in, revenue was off more than $400 million from Q1 of this year, and as long as that persists, the case for Coinbase is not a bullish one, in my view. Coinbase noted lower average crypto prices in its commentary as driving subscription and services revenue lower. Bitcoin has rallied strongly since the end of September so it’s possible Q4 is off to a roaring start, particularly as we saw with the relationship between Coinbase’s price and Bitcoin. Coinbase’s business is much more than just Bitcoin, obviously, but as a proxy for crypto in general, Bitcoin is terrific. Operating costs were down 6% quarter-over-quarter, which is positive given the move in revenue. Coinbase’s business requires constant investment in technology to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry, so periods of revenue declines are doubly painful given the negative operating leverage it creates. In other words, it’s difficult to flex operating costs up and down as rapidly as Coinbase sees its revenue move around, so higher revenue is absolutely critical for operating margins. The other impact on earnings was a $121 million pre-tax loss on the company’s crypto asset investment portfolio, which it notes were largely unrealized. Again, given the price action in cryptos in the past four weeks since the quarter ended, it’s possible we get a nice bullish reversal for Q4, but it’s another negative factor for now. Trading volume was $185 billion in Q3, about 1% lower than analyst consensus, and way off from $226 billion in Q2. That’s to be expected given the weak transaction revenue number. In a somewhat curious move, the board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. I say curious because Coinbase is still heavily investing in growing its business, so spending money on buying back a stock that’s trading at ~40X earnings is odd. It implies the company cannot find a better use for that $1 billion than to buy a very expensive stock. We’ll see how it pans out but I’m not a huge fan of this at the moment. Subscription and services revenue was guided to $505 million to $580 million for Q4, against consensus of $580 million. That’s a miss, plain and simple, and is another arrow in the quiver of bears here. An expensive stock with questionable fundamentals Given the relative newness of Coinbase being a profitable company, we cannot use a traditional price-to-earnings ratio for historical comparison. We can, however, use EV to revenue, which is below for three years. TIKR The stock ended the day yesterday at ~9X forward revenue (not trailing). That’s definitely not the highest multiple we’ve seen, but it’s elevated to be sure. That implies a strong fundamental outlook in this particularly valuation metric, and I’m concerned about that given what we saw in the Q3 report. If we look back at this table posted above, we can see what I believe is further reason to be concerned about the valuation. Seeking Alpha Shares are at 39X times this year’s earnings, but 47X 2026 earnings on what analysts expect to be much lower EPS in the coming years. It’s totally possible Coinbase is going to blow past these estimates, particularly if Bitcoin goes to $100k or more. I’m not suggesting that’s going to happen, but that, in my opinion, is what it would take for Coinbase to beat these estimates. You must then decide if that's a risk you're willing to bet on. The bottom line for me right now is that Coinbase’s share price appears to be pricing in a lot of optimism that I don’t see cause for. That puts the odds in the favor of more consolidation and/or a bearish move over the medium term. In short, the weight of the evidence is not bullish in my view, and that includes a weak Q3 report. I’m putting a hold on Coinbase as it looks to be in no-man’s land at the moment, and unless either the fundamentals improve or it gets a lot cheaper, I’m just not interested.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731388-coinbase-q3-report-shows-continued-deterioration?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35400371.jpeg

The project aims to transform the Bitcoin blockchain into a venue for smart contracts by using zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to make bitcoin a programmable asset.  Adding greater utility to Bitcoin is of ""critical"" importance, Citrea said.  Citrea, a Bitcoin project striving to expand the utility of the original cryptocurrency by using zero-knowledge technology, said it raised $14 million in Series A funding.  The investment was led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and included contributions from angel investors Erik Voorhees and Balaji Srinivasan, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.  Citrea, which raised $2.7 million of seed funding in a Galaxy-led round in February, uses the BitVM computing paradigm that is designed to allow Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin.  ""Citrea is an EVM-compatible layer, meaning all the applications on Ethereum can simply deploy on Citrea without having to change anything,"" Orkun Mahir Kılıç, CEO of Citrea builder Chainway Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview last month.  Bitcoin risks becoming ""obsolete""  The project aims to transform the Bitcoin blockchain into a venue for smart contracts by making bitcoin {{BTC}} a programmable asset through the use of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology.  ZK technology allows data to be transferred securely between parties through the ability to demonstrate knowledge without actually revealing the data and without the prover and verifier interacting.  ""Citrea enhances the capabilities of Bitcoin blockspace with ZK technology and enables the Bitcoin network to support diverse on-chain applications and platforms,"" Citrea said.  The goal of allowing greater utility is one of ""critical"" importance, according to Citrea. While BTC has served well as a form of digital gold, it risks being sidelined by users relying on intermediaries and external networks to provide scalability, Citrea said.  Bitcoin is therefore being undermined by the absence of a ""proper scalability solution,"" hindering its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), which means it ""risks losing its relevance in DeFi and becoming obsolete as a network.""  The use of intermediaries to expand Bitcoin's utility is being explored by projects like layer-2 BOB, which aims to create bridges to other networks like Ethereum for the execution of transactions that are ultimately anchored on Bitcoin.

35401681,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100019,1730377943,"Top Analyst Issues Countdown to XRP Historic Breakout, Projects Massive 1,347% Surge to Follow","A leading analyst has issued a countdown for XRP to experience a historic breakout, targeting a potentially massive rally to $7.50. XRP has recently faced challenges keeping up with the broad crypto market recovery, trailing behind Bitcoin and other altcoins seeing upward momentum. Despite the market-wide surge energizing traders and investors, XRP’s price has remained subdued, leading analysts to predict potential turning points.Countdown to XRP BreakoutCrypto analyst Egrag Crypto shared insights on X regarding XRP's potential breakout, which he believes could be imminent. His analysis is rooted in the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. The chart illustrates the price narrowing within the triangle as it approaches a convergence point. According to Egrag, the target breakout price is expected to be reached within the next two days, though patience remains crucial for traders.The chart identifies key price targets. The initial breakout level is set at $0.5930, significantly higher than XRP’s current trading price of $0.5183.Beyond this, a major resistance level at $1.5000 marks the next milestone, suggesting substantial upward potential if XRP can break through the $0.5930 threshold. The analysis also highlights a critical upper target of $7.5000, indicating an increase of approximately 1,347%.XRP Potential Tied to Bitcoin?Separately, analyst Cryptobilbuwoo outlined a forecast linking XRP’s future trends to Bitcoin halving cycles. Historical data suggests that XRP's price movements closely follow Bitcoin’s halving events and their impact on Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D). The forecast indicates that XRP could reach a new high of $26 based on recurring patterns identified in previous cycles.The chart used in this analysis shows that XRP typically experiences a consolidation phase before bottoming out around the 31-week mark after each Bitcoin halving. For context, the July 2016 Bitcoin halving led to XRP peaking at $3.31 in January 2018, and the May 2020 halving saw XRP reach $1.96 by April 2021. This pattern appears to be forming again following the April 2024 Bitcoin halving, suggesting a potential major uptrend by mid-November.Growing Interest in XRP ETFsAs analysts dissect price potential, the crypto market has seen growing interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to XRP. Nate Geraci, co-founder of The ETF Institute, recently noted that the U.S. SEC has now ""formally acknowledged"" Grayscale’s application to transition the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), which includes XRP exposure, into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).Additionally, earlier this month, filings for XRP ETFs were submitted by Bitwise and Canary Capital. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has frequently expressed his belief that the introduction of an XRP ETF is simply a matter of time and is ""inevitable.""",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/10/31/top-analyst-issues-countdown-to-xrp-historic-breakout-projects-massive-1347-surge-to-follow/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-issues-countdown-to-xrp-historic-breakout-projects-massive-1347-surge-to-follow,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Patronise sold portfolio diversification to Chris Spenser, the executive director of the Florida State Board of Administration, in a letter on October 29. While citing the financial abundance of the US-based state, the CFO proposed dabbling some of Florida’s state retirement system funds into Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.Patronise Describes Bitcoin as Digital GoldIn the letter, the Florida CFO noted that Bitcoin is considered digital gold and possesses certain admirable qualities. Among them is the cryptocurrency’s ability to hedge against the volatility of other asset classes.Patronise further stated that Bitcoin’s price overperformance acumen would offer the best return on investments for Florida’s retiring teachers, firefighters, and police officers. He noted that digital assets were in their nascent stages, and the best Florida could do was embrace the exciting opportunities the sector provides.Meanwhile, the CFO mentioned other states that have adopted the Bitcoin investment strategy, persuading the state to follow suit. He noted that Wisconsin and Michigan have ventured into throwing some of their pension funds into Bitcoin, while Arizona is currently deliberating on the concept.CFO Drew Inspiration from Donald TrumpPatronise's letter states that he drew inspiration from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The Florida trustee noted that the former president’s disclosure regarding creating a Bitcoin reserve in the United States at the Bitcoin 2024 conference was something “that must not be taken for granted.”Notably, Trump proposed making America the crypto capital of the world and tackling regulation , crypto’s biggest issue in the country. The former president’s crypto endeavors have endeared him to the community, and Patronise stated that he believes in the “forethought and innovative thinking from a successful businessman like President Trump.”Meanwhile, Patronise asked the State Board of Administration (SBA) to consider his request, as it would put Florida at the forefront of innovation adoption.

MicroStrategy's leveraged BTC strategy and ongoing debt refinancing pose significant risks, with the firm generating a massive operating loss relative to revenue. Despite outperforming BTC, MSTR's valuation is driven by speculative euphoria, potentially reaching its pre-DOTCOM bubble high amidst a declining Federal Funds Rate. MicroStrategy reported earnings after market close on October 30, 2024, with 2x downward analyst revisions and no upward revisions in the last 90 days. MicroStrategy has been active in the debt market throughout q3’24, redeeming its senior secured 2028 notes through the issuance of $1.01b in 2028 convertible notes with part of the proceeds being allocated to acquiring additional BTC. Given the major run-up in share price and challenging business operational performance, I am reiterating my STRONG SELL rating with a price target of $102.63/share at 1.107x price/BTC. Be sure to review my previous coverage of MSTR here: MicroStrategy Holds Less Bitcoins Than You Think (Q2 Earnings Preview) During q3’24, MicroStrategy issued $800mm in 2.25% 2032 convertible notes and added 25,889 BTC to the company’s holdings. Total BTC holdings at the end of q3’24 sat at 252,220 BTC. The firm also had $650mm of 2025 convertible notes settle all conversion requests in shares. MicroStrategy also raised $1.1b through equity sales in q3’24. Since reporting q2’24 earnings, MicroStrategy has made a few updates to its debt levels. On September 16, 2024, MicroStrategy paid down $500mm of 6.125% 2028 senior secured notes and issued $1.01b in 0.625% 2028 senior convertible notes on September 20, 2024. The convertible notes were issued to pay down the 2028 secured notes as well as to purchase additional BTC. Paying down the secured notes resulted in 69,080 BTC being held as collateral to be released, potentially allowing for MicroStrategy to migrate these BTC to MacroStrategy. The conversion rate on the 2028 notes is set at 5.4589 shares, pricing these shares at $183.19. One of the factors Michael Saylor is bringing to the table is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Yield factor, which is essentially the difference in share distribution and BTC value. The example used was a 250bps expense ratio for BTC ETFs, which appears to be quite a high comparison considering that iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) costs holders 12bps. Regardless, management believes that the rate of share dilution will be outweighed by the growth in value of the company’s BTC holdings. YTD, the firm’s BTC yield sits at 12.2%, above the previous two years. Looking out to eFY27, management is targeting a BTC yield in the range of 4-8%. Corporate Reports Aside from the additional reporting strategy, MicroStrategy will continue its capital raises in the debt and equity markets. Management laid out their capital raising target for the coming years in their q3’24 earnings report. This will include $21b in equity issuances and $21b in debt over the next few years. Management is targeting $10b in eFY25, $14b in eFY26, and $18b in efY27. Given that MicroStrategy generated an adjusted operating loss of -$802mm as of q3’24 on a trailing twelve-month basis, the firm will likely remain in a cycle of debt refinancing debt. Given that digital assets are not held as a cash & equivalent position and rather a long-term investment, MicroStrategy has $4,264mm in total debt on the balance sheet. Essentially, MicroStrategy is acting as a leveraged BTC strategy on the back of an operating company that generates a massive loss relative to revenue. Corporate Reports Accordingly, the BTC yield targeted will be dependent on the price and accumulation of BTC. As of October 29, 2024, BTC holds a value of ~$73,315, leading MicroStrategy’s total BTC holdings to be valued at $18.5b. TradingView Comparing the performance of MSTR shares to BTC, MSTR has significantly outperformed the underlying asset. This is primarily due to MicroStrategy’s leveraged BTC strategy that enables the firm to issue debt to accumulate BTC. TradingView Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports As of q3’24, the breakeven price is $36,800/BTC, well below the present level of $73,315/BTC. Using the current price of BTC, MSTR’s valuation sits at 2.71x price to value of its BTC holdings. Using the firm’s capital structure as a guide, I value MSTR shares at 1.107x BTC at $102.63/share. I am reiterating my STRONG SELL rating for MSTR shares. Corporate Reports Though share price independently isn’t a material metric outside of observation, shares are driving towards their pre-DOTCOM bubble high of $333/share, adjusted for stock splits. The driving factor is that BTC may continue its upward trajectory as buy-and-hold strategies continue paired with the possibility of a declining Federal Funds Rate. Perhaps this may also indicate that MSTR is reaching peak euphoria amongst its shareholders.

The strong showing was almost entirely attributable to BlackRock's IBIT, which added $872 million.  ETFs' net inflows are a sign of institutional demand as bitcoin’s dominance continues to grow, traders said. “Strong BTC net inflows indicate robust institutional demand as BTC dominance continues to rise (59.8%),” Augustine Fan, head of insights at DeFi platform SOFA, told CoinDesk. “Equities are trading with a distinctive ‘Trump-win’ flavor despite official betting odds still calling for a 50–50 race. Similar positive skews can be observed in gold and crypto prices with call skews being bid up post-election as a hedge."" Skew refers to the shape of the distribution of returns for a financial asset. Positive skew in an options market context indicates that there's an increased demand for call options relative to put options. This means more investors are buying options betting on the price of the asset to go higher.  The outcome of next week's presidential election doesn't really matter in the context of mainstream bitcoin adoption through ETFs, according to Darius Sit, the chief investment officer of QCP Capital. While there may be some volatility depending on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris emerge victorious, the broader integration of bitcoin into American finance through firms like BlackRock is far more important, Sit said in an interview at Hong Kong Fintech Week. ""When you have [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink on CNBC talking about how bitcoin is a store of value, that's when you know crypto has become a part of the American investing narrative,"" he said. ""BlackRock has brought crypto from frontier to mainstream.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the 365-day and 30-day moving averages of active bitcoin addresses.  The two form a ""golden cross"" when the latter moves above the former, traditionally an indicator of upward price movement.  The six months of sideways movement in BTC's price this year coincided with the 30-day MA falling below the 365-day MA.

35397306,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650853,1730376050,"Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Expect 98% Crash After Blow Off To $250,000, Here’s Why","A crypto analyst has forecasted a 98% Bitcoin price crash following a substantial rally to $250,000. Interestingly, the analyst is confident that Bitcoin will eventually reach this ambitious quarter-million-dollar target. However, they caution that once profits are taken at this top, Bitcoin could decline significantly to new lows. Bitcoin Price Projected To Crash 98% On October 30, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen told his 106,700 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that the Bitcoin price could drop to the $24,000 range once it hits $250,000. Lagen revealed that many investors have felt overly confident that Bitcoin could never experience a 98% crash again, especially with the introduction of Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline Countering this overconfidence, the crypto analyst asserted that ETF assets tend to lose significant value during periods of economic recession. Consequently the analyst predicts that the Bitcoin price could first experience a “blowoff” of up to $250,000, marking a historical milestone. At this point, many investors would start taking profits, triggering massive selling pressure as they liquidate ahead of potential price declines. Following Lagen’s analysis, once the market sentiment for the Bitcoin price shifts, institutional investors, who may have been the prime drivers for the $250,000 rally, are likely to sell off their holdings. Lagen has described this massive sell-off as the “shake out of the century,” when the Bitcoin price could plummet dramatically to 98% of its high. This suggests that after hitting $250,000, the BTC price could crash to $2,000, trading below Ethereum’s current price, which is trading at $2,635, according to CoinMarketCap. Highlighting the reasoning behind this unexpected bearish price crash, Lagen revealed that by plotting the Bitcoin price on the “Syslog scale,” it clearly shows a High-Time Frame (HTF) rising wedge, which points at a price target between $1,000 and $10,000. He also disclosed in a much earlier post that if Bitcoin does experience his projected shakeout and price decline to $1,000, it will take four halving events before the cryptocurrency can return to its $200,000 price high. BTC To Break Above $73,000 And Rally Higher As of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at $72,433 after experiencing more than a 7.8% increase this week. Lagen has stated that the Bitcoin price action points to a possible “triangle bearish continuation pattern,” which typically signals a potential downward trend in a cryptocurrency. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 The crypto analyst has set a new target of $71,200 for Bitcoin, suggesting that if the cryptocurrency follows through with the triangle bearish continuation pattern, its price could decline significantly. On the flip side, Lagen has predicted that if Bitcoin can break the $73,000 threshold, it would invalidate the triangle bearish continuation pattern. This could indicate the end of the downtrend and potentially lead to a stronger upward momentum.

The company lost 54 cents per share in the quarter. From both net income and earnings per share standpoints, this was Riot's worst quarter since 'crypto winter.' Riot's energy curtailment strategy lacks consistency and SG&A is enormous relative to industry peers. When I last covered Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) for Seeking Alpha, I was actively holding the company's stock as a trade idea. The thesis behind that trade wasn't technical in nature, but there was a shelf-life on the viability of the thesis. My argument back in June was that Riot could benefit from a hot Texas summer: Between now and likely the end of September, Riot should be able to benefit from power credit optionality. If it's hot and Bitcoin's price returns are lackluster, Riot can instead go the energy route for monetizing power. This is not something that every public miner is able to do, so it gives Riot Platforms an advantage in the event Bitcoin's summer month price languishes. At that time of that publication of that article, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was topping out before a multi-week selloff that took the coin from $72k down to $53.5k by early-July. Data by YCharts As fate would have, the price of BTC is right back where it was in early June. The BTC pricing angle to my power credit thesis generally held up. The other half of my thesis did not. In this article, we'll look at Riot's Q3 earnings and assess whether RIOT is still a good trade with BTC now breaking out of multi-month resistance. Riot's Q3 Results For quarter ended September 2024, Riot Platforms reported top line revenue of $84.8 million. This was a year over year increase of 63% and a sequential increase of 21%. 80% of that headline number came from Bitcoin mining with the rest coming from 'engineering' and 'other.' Importantly, Riot didn't sell any BTC during the quarter. Q3 Investor Deck, Slide 8 (Riot Platforms) Despite the block reward halving back in April, the company managed to mine 1,104 BTC. This was almost an identical number of Bitcoin compared with the 1,106 mined during the same period from the prior year. However, that post-halving BTC production has come at a considerably higher 'all-in cost' when adjusting for the company's growth in installed exahash capacity. Riot has simply made up for declines in gross margin by scaling mining capacity up over 28 EH/s. Notably, quarter ending hash rate capacity is more than double the 10.9 EH/s figure from the end of Q3-23. I think this really highlights the problem with long term reliance on the block reward subsidy as the primary incentive for transaction validation. The company's self-reported cost to mine one Bitcoin including both power costs and hardware depreciation was $75.5k per coin during the quarter - nearly three times the figure from a year ago. And this doesn't even factor in other opex costs. Q3-24 Earnings Deck, Slide 9 (Riot Platforms) SG&A came in at $66.9 million. For the full quarter, the company reported a net loss of $154.4 million and a loss of 54 cents per share. From both net income and earnings per share standpoints, this was Riot's worst quarter since 'crypto winter' even though Bitcoin spent most of the quarter between $58-65k per coin. Power Credits What has saved Riot's bottom line in the past is the curtailment strategy that the company was able to execute during much of 2023. Riot's curtailment strategy paid off so well last year, that the company actually reported a negative net power cost for the three months ended September: Q3-24 Earnings Deck, Slide 18 (Riot Platforms) The company never sniffed curtailment credits to that degree this time around. Compared with 2023, the relative lack of energy and demand response credits during the Texas summer months has resulted in much less of an impact on the company's net power cost. In the chart below, we can get a good visual sense for how the company's power credit segment performed relative to last year and compared with BTC sales: Monthly Revenue Breakout (Bitfarms, Author's Chart) What complicates things for Riot now financially is the company's pivot from selling part of its BTC production to a 100% HODL approach. When combining BTC sales, power credits, and DR: 70% of Riot's monthly monetary production came from BTC sales in 2023. That is no longer the case. So long as Riot is HODLing mined BTC and generating very little in the way of DR/Energy credits, I don't see how the company can sustain a positive net income under this current strategy without significantly higher BTC prices. But even that doesn't address the long term asset volatility problem. Consider that mined BTC that isn't sold is an unrealized gain rather than an actual sale of goods. If we're simply leaving the company's quarterly results to FASB accounting adjustments, I don't see much of a reason to long RIOT over simply buying a spot ETF. The latter is certainly a lot less expensive to shareholders. Bitfarms Fiasco Something that I believe has weighed on RIOT's stock price is the failed hostile takeover of mining peer Bitfarms ( BITF ). The result of Riot's attempted takeover is a temporary truce between the two companies. As part of this agreement, Riot and Bitfarms will table merger talks through Bitfarms' 2026 annual meeting. Thus, Riot is now the largest holder of BITF stock without a clear path toward full ownership of the company at this point in time. Bitfarms: Top 5 Holders Shares Held or Principal Amt Market Value RIOT PLATFORMS, INC. 90,110,912 $184,727,370 Invesco Ltd. 19,712,032 $50,659,922 TIDAL INVESTMENTS LLC 6,617,428 $17,006,789 VAN ECK ASSOCIATES CORP 6,075,744 $11,969,000 STATE STREET CORP 4,853,813 $12,474,299 Source: Whale Wisdom Riot's Bitfarms position represents 19.9% of outstanding BITF common shares and is about four times the daily trading volume for the month of October. This means that even if Riot wanted to unwind its BITF position, it is unlikely to be able to do so without having a fairly significant impact on the share price. One could argue this makes Riot sort of a captive holder of BITF shares. For full disclosure, I actually happen to like BITF as a trade at the moment so I don't think immediate share price declines in BITF will be an immediate risk to RIOT for the time being. But I do think longer term the BITF shares take away balance sheet optionality from Riot management. Closing Summary I've maintained for quite some time through my previous Seeking Alpha work that I don't think Bitcoin miners are great long term investments without a meaningful rise in transaction fees on the primary blockchain layer. That being said, I think there are some miners that are better suited for speculative wagers than others. Yet, I'm struggling to see the bull case for RIOT relative to other opportunities. Perhaps the best thing RIOT has going for it is balance sheet strength with a large cash position and no debt. But the company now seems pot-committed to holding Bitfarms stock, which is eating up a considerable portion of Riot's capital. From an operational standpoint, Riot Platforms isn't historically the most efficient miner measured by BTC per EH/s. The energy/DR credit strategy doesn't seem to be a reliable way to mitigate energy costs. Riot Platforms has the highest SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue of any mining company with a top ten market cap - and by a wide margin. And for that expense, investors are getting a Bitcoin HODL play and 20% of Bitfarms. At this point, I think there are better opportunities elsewhere in both the industry and in the broad market overall.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731362-q3-earnings-an-ugly-quarter-for-riot-platforms?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35397296.jpeg

JPMorgan said the negative reaction was unsurprising given the stock's outperformance this year.  Broker JMP raised its Robinhood price target to $33 from $30 and remained bullish on the stock.  Robinhood (HOOD) shares slumped more than 13% on Thursday after the popular platform missed Wall Street's expectations for the third-quarter earnings. Still, one analyst is brushing off the negative reactions and remaining bullish on the stock.  The company missed many important revenue metrics, including ""account growth, new net assets, trade pricing, new gold account subscriptions,"" the Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan said in a note. Still, it is managing expenses well, which supported earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, the bank's analysts said.  JPMorgan viewed the quarter as a ""seasonal deceleration in the business after a robust 1H24 with record net deposit growth."" It cut its price target on the shares to $20 from $21, while maintaining its underweight rating on the stock.  JPMorgan said Robinhood reported net deposits of $10 billion in the third quarter, the lowest quarterly figure this year and below the bank's estimate of $11.2 billion.  Citi (C) said that despite Robinhood's positive commentary for October, it expects the shares to come under pressure due to a top-line miss and recent outperformance. The bank has a neutral rating on Robinhood stock with a $23 price target.  However, one Wall Street broker, JMP, stayed positive on the stock, saying Robinhood's earnings were in line with its estimates and just a bit shy of consensus.  The broker said that the initial weakness in the shares was a ""knee-jerk reaction,"" as it maintained its bullish outlook on the company and raised its price target to $33 from $30. JMP maintained its rating on the stock at market outperform.

The acquisition will allow Archax to extend its existing brokerage, trading and custody services into the European Union.  Archax, a U.K.-regulated crypto exchange and custodian, agreed to buy Spanish broker King & Shaxson Capital Markets (KSCM) to expand in the European Union as the trading bloc's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) rules take effect.  Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory approval in Spain, the London-based company said Thursday. The value of the transaction was not disclosed.  KSCM started in Madrid in 2019 to service pan-European institutional clients. Following the acquisition, it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Archax. The acquisition will enable the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-registered company to extend its existing brokerage, multilateral trading facility (MTF) and custody services into Europe while adding crypto derivatives to its permissions.  MiCA is set to apply as of Dec. 30, though stablecoin provisions took effect in June.  ""The Archax strategy has always been to expand its regulatory footprint globally, with the EU region being of prime importance for us, post-Brexit,"" Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax, said in a release.

Analysts and investors closely watch this range as BTC inches closer to its all-time high (ATH). Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared key data from CryptoQuant, noting that trading volume has steadily decreased as Bitcoin remains within these levels. Typically, this volume decline signals consolidation, a phase often preceding a major price swing. Related Reading: Dogecoin Metrics Reveal Increasing Network Activity – Is DOGE Ready To Break Yearly Highs? Anticipation is building with the U.S. election just around the corner on November 5. Market sentiment is optimistic, and many expect Bitcoin to break out of this range soon, either pushing into new highs or experiencing a healthy retrace to fuel further growth. The coming days will be pivotal for Bitcoin’s trajectory as traders assess whether the consolidation period will lead to a breakthrough into uncharted territory. As BTC flirts with its ATH, the stage is set for a decisive move that could shape the market’s direction through the end of the year. Bitcoin Price About To Move Bitcoin is at a defining point in this cycle, nearing the end of a 7-month accumulation period and poised to test new all-time highs. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler has noted in a recent analysis on X that BTC is currently range-bound, trading between $72,900 resistance and $71,400 support, with trading volumes showing a gradual decline. According to Adler, this reduced volume in Bitcoin’s confined range hints at an impending breakout. However, a new catalyst appears necessary to drive this shift and launch BTC past its previous highs. The upcoming U.S. election may be that catalyst, with potential market impacts depending on the outcome. Market sentiment suggests that a Trump victory could stimulate bullish sentiment in the financial markets, possibly positively influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Investors are eyeing this pivotal event as a possible trigger to push BTC beyond the $73,794 mark, its all-time high, into uncharted price territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target – Analyst A successful breakout from the current range could usher Bitcoin into price discovery mode, where FOMO (fear of missing out) could drive buying pressure, amplifying the surge. On the other hand, if BTC fails to secure a new high, it may dip back toward lower support levels, potentially consolidating further until the necessary momentum builds. BTC Flirting With ATH Bitcoin is holding strong above $72,000, inching closer to breaking its all-time high (ATH) and entering a price discovery phase. Price discovery typically ushers in significant gains, as fresh highs fuel market optimism and buying pressure. However, BTC has yet to decisively break past its previous ATH of $73,794, and a temporary decline below $70,000 remains a possibility if demand doesn’t strengthen soon. The $71,000 support level now serves as a critical base for BTC. If the price holds above this mark in the coming days, momentum will likely build for a solid attempt to break the ATH, potentially triggering a new wave of bullish sentiment. Traders and investors closely watch BTC’s performance at these levels, knowing that any sustained movement above $73,794 could signal the start of a powerful uptrend as Bitcoin pushes into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Cardano Might See A Massive Pump Around November 18 – Analyst Exposes 2020 Similarities Meanwhile, a short retrace to lower support levels might provide the liquidity needed to propel BTC beyond its current resistance. Whether through a direct push or a minor pullback, Bitcoin’s resilience above $72,000 sets the stage for an imminent test of ATH, with price discovery and new highs on the horizon.

42373445,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNT05,1730368788,Coinbase's Earnings Miss Makes U.S. Election Even Bigger Catalyst: Analysts,"Coinbase shares fell after its third-quarter net revenue missed Wall Street's estimates.  Institutional interest in the stock is growing as it becomes a more important component of various equity indices, JMP said.  The U.S. presidential election is an important short-term catalyst for both Coinbase and the industry, and may lead to a more benign regulatory backdrop, the analysts said.  The U.S. election is now an important short-term catalyst for crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), after it missed third quarter expectations tanking share prices.  The stock dropped more than 7% on Thursday after the crypto exchange reported a top-line miss for the third quarter.  The investment bank KBW said in a research note that the company's total net revenue was 3% lower than its forecast and 5% below consensus estimates. The miss was driven by lower transaction revenues and a drop in subscription and services revenues, the report noted.  Still, reduced operating expenses more than offset the revenue miss and contributed to a better adjusted Ebitda figure, said KBW, which has a market perform rating on the stock and a $165 price target. The analysts noted that retail trading volumes were higher than expected but were offset by a compression in the retail fee rate, adding that fourth-quarter commentary was also weak.  Another Wall Street broker, JMP, saw the crypto exchange's focus on the product roadmap as positive as it is expected to drive further mainstream adoption. The broker also noted that institutional interest in Coinbase is growing as it has become a more meaningful component of various stock indices, which is a positive development. JMP has a market outperform rating on Coinbase stock with a $320 price target.  More importantly, JMP noted that the U.S. presidential election is likely to be a positive catalyst for both Coinbase and the wider crypto market. The election is set to bring forth ""greater clarity and building consensus among legislators on both sides of the aisle in the coming months,"" JMP noted.  Canaccord echoed this sentiment, saying that a change in the regulatory regime following the U.S. election next week could be a larger catalyst in the short term.  A clearer regulatory framework could result in the dismissal of the current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against Coinbase, Canaccord said.  Canaccord, which has a buy rating on Coinbase stock with a $280 price target, also had some positive commentaries on the third-quarter earnings. It said Coinbase continued to grow its business model in the quarter, despite lower market volatility and trading volumes, with more revenue coming from recurring sources such as staking and custody.

35401678,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=99997,1730368380,Chainlink Breaks Free of Long-Term Channel: Is $20 Within Reach?,"Growing out of a falling channel, Chainlink (LINK) is preparing to rally beyond $20 in the new crypto bull run. As the crypto market prepares for the next stage of a bull run, Chainlink signals a massive breakout rally on its way. The recent move above a long-standing resistance trendline of a falling channel pattern indicates a potential bullish trend for Chainlink.Currently, Chainlink is encountering resistance from the 200 EMA, but prices are primed for a post-retest reversal that could extend the bullish momentum. Will this rally push prices beyond the $20 psychological threshold? Let’s explore.Chainlink Channel’s Breakout In the daily chart, the recent bullish reversal from the $8 mark has led to a bullish trend within the long-coming falling channel pattern. With three consecutive bullish candles forming a triple white-soldier pattern this week, Chainlink surpasses the overhead trendline. LINK Price Chart The triple white-soldier pattern accounts for a 15% surge. However, the breakout rally fails to surpass the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $12.438. The dynamic resistance of the 200 EMA, coinciding with the Fibonacci level, plays a crucial role. Facing bearish opposition, the Chainlink price shows an intraday pullback of 2.59%. However, LINK trades at $12.072 and maintains dominance above the 100-day EMA and the broken resistance trend line. This increases the possibility of a post-retest reversal to cross above the resistance confluences. Additionally, the recent bullish influence has resulted in a crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs. The MACD and signal lines also show positive crossovers. With increased buying pressure, technical indicators suggest a potential uptrend for Chainlink. Will Chainlink Cross $20?According to Fibonacci analysis, a move above $12.43 could propel Chainlink’s price to the 50% and 78.60% Fibonacci levels at $15.64 and $19.11, respectively. Conversely, key support is found near the 50-day EMA at $11.39.As the broader market recovers, Chainlink could potentially reach the apex of the falling channel pattern near $21.71. Thus, the likelihood of Chainlink surpassing the $20 psychological mark in the upcoming November rally has significantly increased.",POSITIVE,LINK,LINK | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/10/31/chainlink-breaks-free-of-long-term-channel-is-20-within-reach/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=chainlink-breaks-free-of-long-term-channel-is-20-within-reach,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42373453,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNTat,1730368199,Bitcoin Prices Take Breather as BTC ETFs Record Another Day of Monster Inflows,"Bitcoin experienced profit-taking after a week of gains, dropping by up to 0.5% over 24 hours before recovering to stabilize just above $72,400.  U.S. bitcoin ETFs saw significant inflows for a second day, with more than $893 million invested on Wednesday following $879 million on Tuesday.  High ETF inflows indicate robust institutional interest in bitcoin, particularly as its market dominance grows, some traders said.  Bitcoin (BTC) markets saw profit-taking over the past 24 hours after a strong week in which the largest cryptocurrency posted a seven-day gain of almost 8%.  BTC fell as much as 0.5% before recovering to just over $72,400 during the European morning. It rose as high as $73,200 in early Asian morning hours Wednesday. Major tokens posted losses with Solana’s SOL and BNB Chain’s BNB falling as much as 2.5% while dogecoin {{DOGE}} dropped 1% after several days of outperformance.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens by market capitalization, lost 1.3% in the past 24 hours.  A breather in the market from a wider pump earlier in the week came amid a second straight day of strong inflows for U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ETFs recorded over $893 million in inflows on Wednesday after taking in $879 million on Tuesday, the first back-to-back inflows of more than $850 million. Cumulative net inflows since their introduction in January now total $24 billion, according to data tracked by Farside Investors.  BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for most of Wednesday’s flows, attracting a record $872 million.  Other ETFs posted inflows under $12 million, while Bitwise’s BITB was the only product with net outflows, losing $23.9 million.  The net inflows are a sign of institutional demand as bitcoin’s dominance continues to grow, traders said.  “Strong BTC net inflows indicate robust institutional demand as BTC dominance continues to rise (59.8%) at the expense of ETH,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at DeFi platform SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “BTC has outperformed ETH by nearly 10% on a week-on-week basis.  “Equities are trading with a distinctive ‘Trump-win’ flavour despite official betting odds still calling for a 50–50 race. Similar positive skews can be observed in gold and crypto prices with call skews being bid up post-election as a hedge,” Fan wrote.  Skew refers to the shape of the distribution of returns for a financial asset. Positive skew in an options market context, such gold and cryptocurrency prices, indicates that there's an increased demand for call options relative to put options.

The whale’s portfolio is currently valued at approximately $29 million, primarily consisting of Marinade Staked SOL (mSOL). Its staking account holds 38,043 SOL, valued at $6,622,572.Historical Whale AccumulationsThis recent whale activity builds on earlier acquisitions by other participants. In September, a different whale accumulated 34,807 SOL, amounting to $4.52 million, and has since moved 207,000 SOL to self-custody since February. These holdings were acquired at an average price of $142, and approximately 115,135 SOL, valued at $15.3 million, were subsequently staked.It is important to note that Solana's (SOL) performance in 2024 has shown volatility, but recent data points to renewed whale interest and staking activity. After an early-year surge, SOL encountered resistance at the $200 mark, causing its price to fluctuate between $125 and $180.Projected Uptrend for SolanaThis retracement coincided with technical analysis showing an emerging bullish flag pattern on Solana, potentially indicating a further upward trend. Analyst Xanrox has identified a continuation pattern, suggesting that the current consolidation phase may precede another price increase.For context, over the past week, SOL has gained traction again, reaching $183 after a brief retracement that pulled it back to $174 during this press.According to Elliott Wave theory cited by Xanrox, SOL has already demonstrated impressive gains in wave 3 and is now progressing toward wave 5.Fibonacci analysis from Xanrox outlines two potential price targets for SOL: a 0.382 retracement level at $383.39 and a 0.618 level at $829.17, marking potential gains of 119.9% and 372.77%, respectively.

MicroStrategy released its quarterly attestation on Wednesday, followed by another Bitcoin bombshell. Per the report , the business intelligence firm intends to raise $42 billion to buy more Bitcoin.Having already established itself as the public company with the largest Bitcoin stash, MicroStrategy's longing to expand its portfolio of the premier asset remains unquenchable. It noted that it intends to raise $42 billion over three years to extend its holdings.Notably, the American publicly listed firm stated that, as part of its “21/21” plan, it would realize the targeted capital with 50% from equity sales and 50% from fixed-income securities. This translates to $21 million from each of the financial instruments.MicroStrategy Aggressively Pursuing Targeted EndgameMicroStrategy co-founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, earlier revealed that MicroStrategy aims to become a Bitcoin bank in the future. According to his revelation , the firm will operate inversely compared to typical traditional banks, giving itself to borrowing fiat to acquire Bitcoin rather than lending its stash of the premier asset.This theory implies that MicroStrategy would continue aggressively buying Bitcoin, leveraging investments from interested parties. In return, the firm would offer its equity or an agreed-upon yearly remuneration.Notably, the three-year $42 billion capital fundraiser aligns with Saylor’s disclosure. MicroStrategy has gone on with the ploy since this year, having raised $4.25 billion through stock sales and debt. The firm uncovered $2.1 billion in Q3 alone through this means.BTC Yield Up 17.8% Year-to-dateThe Q3 attestation further disclosed that MicroStrategy’s BTC yield is up 17.8% year-to-date, adding 5.6% from Q2’s 12.2%. The uptick came following the expansion of the firm’s Bitcoin stash by 11% in the last quarter.For context, MicroStrategy acquired 25,889 BTC in Q3, bringing its total holdings to 252,220 BTC . At the current market price, the stash is worth $18.23 billion, with an unrealized profit of $8.27 billion.Other financial disclosures show that MicroStrategy slashed its total annualized interest expense by $24 million. The firm also reported quarterly revenue of $116.1 million, a 10.3% decrease year over year.Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has surged considerably in the past few days, hitting a 25-year high of $266 on Tuesday. On a year-to-date basis, MSTR is up 260%, outperforming major traditional stocks and bonds.

According to Binance, the only question people are interested in is ‘wen’ (when), with the word appearing multiple times on a photo. Only Question SHIBArmy Cares About Interestingly, the team cleverly redesigned the image and the tweet’s caption to push for BONE’s listing on Binance. Reacting to Binance’s post, Shiba Inu revealed that the only question the SHIBArmy is interested in is ‘WEN BONE’ (When BONE). https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1851621255507566739Shiba Inu community members mostly use this phrase to find out exactly when an exchange like Binance plans to list BONE.Shiba Inu Community Advocate for BONE Listing Launched in July 2021, BONE has been listed across multiple centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges, including ShibaSwap, OKX, and MEXC. Despite being in existence for over three years, BONE has yet to secure a listing on a Tier-1 centralized exchange like Binance. Consequently, the community has launched numerous social media campaigns to attract Binance’s attention to BONE. The tweet above exemplifies how the community has been soliciting BONE’s listing on the world’s biggest exchange. Besides the social media campaign, community members have also participated in a voting exercise, dubbed Binance Futures Next, to facilitate BONE’s listing. The initiative requires Binance users to vote for their favorite tokens to be listed on the exchange, with a pick priced at 1 USDT. Despite Shiba Inu enthusiasts heavily voting for BONE, Binance has still not listed the token. Furthermore, the Shiba Inu ecosystem team has also taken pivotal steps toward getting BONE listed on the exchange. In particular, the team renounced the BONE contract, previously seen as a limitation to BONE’s listing on Binance. However, Binance has not disclosed its plans for BONE. Meanwhile, BONE is currently trading for $0.3931, with a 24-hour volume of $4.35 million.

The most recent mint order has raised questions on what the future holds for Tether’s USDT tokens. One of the assumptions is that the recent spike in bitcoin price had caused an increase in the stablecoins. “when they print, we go higher,” one user posted on social media, relating it to the minting of fresh tokens to meet future requests for the issuances. Traditionally, the minting and deployment of stablecoins signal an increasing demand for crypto in a bullish market. An increase in stablecoin’s supply often pushes cryptos’ market prices.

A crypto-friendly White House would benefit the industry globally, Sit said.  HONG KONG — The winner of next week's U.S. presidential election doesn't really matter to Darius Sit, the chief investment officer of QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm.  While there may be some short-term volatility in crypto markets depending on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris becomes the leader of the world's largest economy, what's more important is the broader integration of crypto, especially bitcoin {{BTC}}, into American finance. For example, the widespread adoption of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset-management firm, running the biggest.  ""The biggest change this year has been BlackRock,"" Sit said in an interview. ""Suddenly we have bitcoin being distributed in BlackRock’s extensive network.  Read more Consensus Hong Kong-related coverage here.  ""When you have [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink on CNBC talking about how bitcoin is a store of value, that's when you know crypto has become a part of the American investing narrative,"" he said. ""BlackRock has brought crypto from frontier to mainstream.""  Trump has made part of his election campaign ensuring that U.S. crypto rules are attractive to projects so they can stay onshore, which earned his crypto policy a rare endorsement from CoinDesk. Bettors on Polymarket give Trump a more than 60% chance of winning the election.  One might wonder if a U.S. without a hostile Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led by Gary Gensler might raise concerns in jurisdictions like Hong Kong, which have courted American companies to set up shop in places where rules are more certain.  It's not just East Asia. Earlier this year, QCP opened in Abu Dhabi, and Sit says he's a fan of the regulator's approach to crypto, explaining that the regulator there “didn’t see crypto as a carve-out of capital markets.” Instead, he said, Abu Dhabi views ""digital assets as part of the capital market.""  Still, a rising tide lifts all ships.  “Bitcoin becomes even more of a cornerstone asset if Trump comes in and has more friendly policies,” Sit said, arguing that U.S. growth would likely fuel global opportunities rather than stifle them.  Bitcoin is currently trading above $72,000, up 19% from a month earlier, according to CoinDesk Indices data, coming close to challenging its all-time high.

With the Bitcoin price sustaining dominance above the $72,000 mark and an intra-week gain of 7.27%, meme coins are making a bullish comeback. As the meme coins market cap sustains above $63 billion, the MOG coin shows a promising trend. With four consecutive bullish days, the MOG Coin is inching closer to a significant breakout. Will this breakout rally lead to a new all-time high with a more than 100% price jump? Let's find out. Cup and Handle Breakout For MOGIn the daily chart, the MOG coin shows a cup-and-handle pattern with a neckline at $0.000002355. In the last 7 days, the meme coin has increased by nearly 32% from the 7-day low of $0.000001599. MOG price chart Currently, the MOG coin is trading at $0.00000210459 with an intraday gain of 4.39%. As the meme coin has reclaimed a psychological mark of $0.0000020, the four consecutive bullish candles tease a completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. Hence, the chances of MOG coin testing the neckline have significantly increased. As the bearish histograms decline with increasing bullish influence, the MACD and Signal lines prepare for a bullish crossover. Meanwhile, the crucial 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMA maintains bullish alignment. Hence, the momentum indicator and dynamic lines give a buy signal for MOG. Will MOG Reach $0.0000050?Based on the Fibonacci levels, the neckline coincides with the 100% level at $0.000002355. A bullish breakout of the bullish pattern will likely reach the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $0.0000047623, accounting for a 126% rise. This increases the chances of the bull run reaching the $0.0000050 psychological mark in the ongoing bull trend. On the flip side, the downside risk for the meme coin remains at the $0.000001845 level.",POSITIVE,MOG,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | MOG,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/10/31/mog-coin-uptrend-targets-126-as-cup-and-handle-breakout-looms/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mog-coin-uptrend-targets-126-as-cup-and-handle-breakout-looms,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Nebulor, an advocate of Cardano, recently took to X to share his sentiment about the ADA token, the 11th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $12.45 billion. He noted that, in his view, ADA seems to be emerging as the main character in the market at this time.This opinion quickly gained traction within the community, especially among Cardano supporters. Some resonated with Nebulor's view, noting that ""something big"" is on the horizon, while others found the claim amusing. Among the skeptics, one commenter suggested that Nebulor might just be hallucinating.Cardano Founder ReactsMeanwhile, Nebulor's take on Cardano's current market position received a nod of approval from the founder himself. In response to the post, Charles Hoskinson shared a humorous GIF, smiling and nodding in agreement.https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1851678813207617742Recent Developments Influencing Bullish Views About ADAHoskinson’s reaction further gained traction among enthusiasts, with some pointing to the recent Cardano-Bitcoin integration as a major development for ADA in this cycle.Notably, last week, Cardano partnered with BitcoinOS (BOS) to become a smart contract layer for Bitcoin, aiming to unlock Bitcoin’s $1.3 trillion market. This collaboration will enable DeFi developers to access Bitcoin’s liquidity without intermediaries. The integration will use the BOS Grail bridge, which employs zero-knowledge proofs to secure connections between the blockchains.Hoskinson and Cardano community members have been excited since the announcement, seeing its potential for the Cardano network and ADA’s market value. The integration also enhances Cardano's DeFi capabilities, allowing projects like Fluid Tokens to utilize Bitcoin assets. Notably, the partnership marks Cardano as the first Layer-1 chain to implement the BOS technology.Additionally, just last month, the Cardano ecosystem welcomed its biggest upgrade ever, transitioning the network to be fully community-owned.Essentially, given these crucial developments, community members like Nebulor hope that ADA will emerge as a trending crypto asset in this cycle.ADA Price ActionHowever, the performance of ADA's price has been disappointing. ADA is trading at $0.3550, up only 3% over the last seven days, while Bitcoin has grown by 8%. On a year-to-date scale, Cardano’s current value reflects a significant drop of 40%, while Bitcoin is up by 71%.Meanwhile, top analysts have noted that ADA’s bull run could begin next month, as seen in the last cycle.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/10/31/cardano-founder-agrees-ada-is-the-main-character-in-the-market-right-now/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-founder-agrees-ada-is-the-main-character-in-the-market-right-now,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35401666,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=99946,1730362301,Expert Says This Time Will Not Be Different After Massive Bitcoin Rallies in Last Three US Elections,"Seasoned market analyst Ali Martinez has teased a possible bullish explosion in the Bitcoin price, citing historical performance after the last three US presidential elections. Bitcoin has turned the tides around following a slow start to Uptober . The asset dipped to $59,506 earlier in the month following rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.However, the crypto firstborn has shown resilience, surging 17.7% from the recent low to its current price. It even pushed near its all-time high of around $73,700 on Tuesday but failed to break through the resistance.Notably, a few factors have spurred Bitcoin's recent resurgence, including growing hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut and surging odds that pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump will win the November 5 US election.Amid these bullish sentiments, market expert Ali Martinez has shared thought-provoking data on Bitcoin's performance in the US presidential election years. With the analysis, he has asserted an impeding explosive uptick in the premier asset's price.Martinez Asserts an Explosive Bitcoin RallyIn his October 30 tweet , Martinez shares Bitcoin's price performance after the past three election years. His data covered the asset's behavioral pattern following the 2012, 2016, and 2020 US presidential elections.The data shows that after the November 2012 election, Bitcoin rallied 10,640% to its peak price of $1,137 in early December 2013. A similar pattern occurred after the November 2016 election, as the premier crypto asset surged 2,698% to a cycle top of $18,970 on December 20, 2017.Furthermore, the November 2020 election also heralded a considerable upside. Bitcoin surged 386% to a peak of $69,000 in November 2021. As a result, Martinez believes that this cycle will not be different, expecting Bitcoin to follow historical trends. Bitcoin US Election Performance Chart Bitcoin Peak Price TargetsWith a Bitcoin surge after the US election established, the big question remains which price Bitcoin's price will peak at this cycle. Notably, analysts have placed different price targets for 2025. For instance, leading bank Standard Chartered asserted that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of next year. Brokerage firm Bernstein shares the same price outlook for Bitcoin but noted that the $200,000 was a conservative target.Veteran analyst Peter Brandt set a more ambitious price expectation for Bitcoin, asserting it would trade at $230,000. Notably, he based his prediction on logarithm projections from Bitcoin's November 2022 to March 2024 upswing.Meanwhile, market analyst Sina predicted Bitcoin will surge past $285,000 by 2025, citing a quantile regression model. Interestingly, he noted that the price target was not the top, suggesting BTC could trade past the price mark.At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $72,424, up almost 8% in the past seven days.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/10/31/expert-says-this-time-will-not-be-different-after-massive-bitcoin-rallies-in-last-three-us-elections/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-this-time-will-not-be-different-after-massive-bitcoin-rallies-in-last-three-us-elections,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Some suggested that the second-largest cryptocurrency will soon break from the next resistance level and reclaim the $3,000 mark. Related Reading: Neiro Breaks Above Key Level Following 10% Weekly Drop, Is $0.0020 Next? Ethereum Retests $2,700 Ethereum surged above a key resistance level on Wednesday morning as most of the crypto market soared. The cryptocurrency rallied 3.1% toward the $2,700 horizontal level, hitting the $2,722 mark before retracing to $2,710. Over the past week, ETH hovered between the $2,430-$2,650 range after failing to hold its support. This performance worried many investors and market watchers, who have heavily criticized the crypto’s price action throughout the year. However, today’s jump represents a 5.6% increase in the weekly timeframe, which sparked a bullish sentiment among the community. Crypto trader CRG noted that Ethereum is testing a support level in its trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC) in a higher timeframe (HTF). Per the chart, ETH/BTC is retesting an HTF support at the 0.0377 level. The 0.023-0.040 zone was a crucial area between 2020 and 2021, with ETH’s all-time high rally starting after breaking above the upper line of this range. The trader suggested that Ethereum’s surge would be short-lived as the “King of Altcoins” has had a “disappointing” performance despite the spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval. “ETH is like the toxic ex-gf that keeps you going back,” he jokingly stated. Similarly, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe remarked that it’s time to be bullish on ETH, suggesting that there’s a “massive bullish divergence” in the one-day timeframe of the ETH/BTC chart, while it was “popping up” in the three-day timeframe. Van de Poppe pointed out that the 0.051 area is the crucial zone for a trend reversal. ETH To Hit $3,000 In Two Weeks? Various crypto analysts have set the $2,800 resistance level as the next crucial zone if Ethereum successfully reclaims the $2,700 mark. Analyst Crypto Yapper pointed out that ETH has registered five consecutive green daily candles since bouncing from last week’s lows. To the analyst, if ETH breaks above the $2,800 horizontal level, the cryptocurrency will rally toward the $3,000 resistance level and potentially kickstart the altcoin season. Similarly, van de Poppe suggested that Ethereum will break above the crucial horizontal level in the next two weeks, as it took the liquidity at the $2,450 level and “ran back up to resistance.” According to the analyst, this could propel ETH’s price to $3,000 in November.

This indicator tracks the number of unique addresses engaging with the Bitcoin network, providing insights into the network’s overall activity, investor involvement, and possible market directions. Related Reading: Stablecoins Signal Strong Bitcoin Demand: Could BTC Renew Its ATH Soon? Golden Cross On Bitcoin Active Addresses According to Dent’s analysis, applying a monthly and annual moving average to this number of active addresses metric could indicate a shift toward bullish momentum. A high number of active addresses generally suggests strong participation, while fewer addresses may indicate reduced interest. Dent noted that when the 30-day moving average of active addresses crosses above the 365-day moving average—a phenomenon known as a “golden cross”—it often correlates with upward price momentum in the Bitcoin market. This alignment between short-term and long-term trends can suggest renewed interest among both retail and institutional investors, which could potentially sustain or even increase Bitcoin’s value. Furthermore, the concept of the golden cross in active addresses is significant in light of previous market cycles, Dent pointed out. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the last notable shift in Bitcoin’s active addresses occurred post all-time high (ATH) levels, leading to what is called a “dead cross,” where the short-term average fell below the long-term average. This pattern typically signals bearish sentiment or market stagnation. However, the current reversion to a golden cross shows a different scenario. Transaction volumes are almost double what they were during Bitcoin’s 2021 price cycle, a favourable sign of increased market engagement and potential upward momentum. The analyst concluded that a weaker or inconclusive golden cross could lead to a repeat of mid-2021 trends, where price gains faced strong resistance without maintaining upward movement. BTC On Track For $100k Rally? In the past weeks, Bitcoin has seen quite a noticeable rebound in price, reclaiming price levels it once faced resistance in. So far, the asset has recorded double digit gains in the slightly higher time frames suggesting that a positive momentum has begun. Particualry, in the past 30 days, BTC has increased by 13% and nearly 10% in the past 7 days. This increase has brought the asset price to currently trade above $72,000 as of today. This price zone not only equals 2.3% decrease from its ATH registered in March 2024 but also marks a vital level that makes the increase above $100,000 more likely.

The price is now showing a few bearish signs while Bitcoin and Ethereum eye additional gains. BNB price started a downside correction from the $612 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $595 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $595 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $588 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Dips Again After struggling above $612, BNB price saw a downside correction. The price dipped below the $605 and $600 support levels unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $598 and $595 levels. The price even dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $565 swing low to the $612 high. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $595 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $595 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $595 level or the trend line. The next resistance sits near the $600 level. A clear move above the $600 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $612. A close above the $612 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $620 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $632 level in the near term. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $595 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $590 level. The next major support is near the $588 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $565 swing low to the $612 high. The main support sits at $576. If there is a downside break below the $576 support, the price could drop toward the $565 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $550 level.

This surge in investment comes as the largest cryptocurrency inches closer to its all-time high of $73,700, originally reached in March. This comes as investor sentiment appears to be buoyed by speculation surrounding a potential victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump over VP Kamala Harris, which many believe could foster a more positive environment for the digital asset ecosystem, ultimately favoring crypto prices. Bitcoin ETFs Inflows And Price Rally According to Bloomberg data, Tuesday’s subscriptions pushed the year-to-date inflows for the group of 12 Bitcoin ETFs to over $23 billion. Analysts attribute the growing demand for Bitcoin exposure to Trump’s elevated odds in election betting markets. However, while Trump leads in prediction markets, polls show a tight race against Vice President Harris, who has pledged to support a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Still, Trump’s approach seems to have resonated more with the community. Related Reading: Solana Memecoin Market Thrives: POPCAT Reaches New Record Price Of $1.75 Adding to the speculation, Bitcoin options markets reflect a one-third chance of a price swing exceeding 10% on election day, November 5, as indicated by Nick Forster, founder of the crypto trading platform Derive.xyz. This surge would take the Bitcoin price to a new all-time high of $72,900 in the potential scenario where BTC consolidates above $72,000 for the next few days ahead of the election. Forster believes such volatility often encourages traders to position themselves for potential market movements, increasing demand for Bitcoin ETFs and contributing to the current price rally since the beginning of the week. Expert Warns Of Potential Selloff ETF expert Eric Balchunas has also commented on the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that these funds are on track to reach 1 million BTC in holdings as early as today. In a recent social media post, Balchunas reported that US spot ETFs could surpass 1 million BTC by next Wednesday, potentially surpassing the holdings of Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, by mid-December, with the funds adding approximately 17,000 BTC each week. However, following Tuesday’s performance, Balchunas remarked, “We’re going to need to move up our predictions,” highlighting that Bitcoin ETFs had gobbled up over 12,000 coins in a single day, now holding 996,000 BTC. The expert expressed optimism about the likelihood of breaching the 1 million mark today, stating that the “extraordinary” trading volume from the previous day is likely to translate into significant inflows. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) NVT Ratio Now Highest Since June: What Does It Mean? Balchunas also cautioned that market conditions can be unpredictable. “Anything can happen,” he warned, referencing the risk of a sudden selloff that could delay reaching the 1 million BTC milestone. Conversely, if Bitcoin prices continue to rise and a Trump victory boosts market enthusiasm, a fear of missing out (FOMO) could drive even more rapid accumulation, according to the expert’s analysis. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $72,360, up over 8% in the 7-day time frame.

35370787,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650764,1730343605,"Bitcoin Makes ATH Against Euro Due To Change In Dollar Strength, Details Inside","Although Bitcoin (BTC) is yet to breach its USD all-time high (ATH) value, the flagship cryptocurrency has made a new ATH against the euro (EUR) and some other fiat currencies. Bitcoin Makes Fresh ATH Against Euro Bitcoin surpassed €68,000 ($73,561) on October 29, establishing a new ATH against the euro. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap reached this milestone on multiple crypto exchanges, including Binance. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So This marks the first time since March 2024 that BTC has set a new ATH against the euro. Although Bitcoin came very close to a new ATH in USD, it fell short by approximately $200, dropping from $73,620 to $71,805 at the time of writing. Notably, the discrepancy between BTC’s performance against the euro and the USD is due to changes in the dollar’s strength. On March 14, when BTC last reached its USD ATH of $73,737, the USD/EUR exchange rate was 0.9113. Currently, the rate is 0.9238, indicating a weakening euro against the dollar. One key factor behind the dollar’s renewed strength is the US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. Bitcoin has also achieved a new ATH against the Canadian Dollar (CAD), recording a price of just over CAD 102,000, or approximately USD 73,225. As expected, BTC has reached new ATHs against weaker and hyperinflated fiat currencies, including the Turkish Lira, Argentine Pesos, and Russian Ruble. BTC ATH Against USD Most Awaited Bitcoin’s impressive performance comes at a crucial time, with the approaching US presidential elections, the effects of BTC halving, and a surge in stablecoin demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000 By February 2025? Analyst Explains Why While Bitcoin’s new ATH against the EUR is promising, the wider crypto market eagerly awaits a USD-denominated ATH, as most crypto trading on exchanges takes place in USD or USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Data shows that the BTC/EUR trading pair generates the most volume on exchanges such as Bitstamp ($39.8 million), Binance ($36.7 million), and WhiteBit ($26.7 million). However, these volumes are dwarfed by higher-volume trading pairs like BTC/Korean Won (KRW). BTC/KRW trading volumes reach as high as $400 million daily – almost ten times more than the most-traded BTC/EUR pair. Recent data indicates that, despite flirting with ATH levels, BTC traders are holding off on profit-taking around the $71,000 level, suggesting expectations of further price increases based on current momentum. Commenting on BTC’s trajectory, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt said that the leading digital asset requires a daily close above $76,000 to confirm a true breakout. At press time, BTC trades at $71,805, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

Leveraged Bets Suggest Big Moves Are Coming,"The recent surge in Bitcoin price appears to align with a shift in investor behavior, according to a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘crypto sunmoon.’ In a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst observed that the current bull market is driven by leveraged bets, particularly in derivatives markets. This trend is noteworthy as it contrasts with past market cycles where increased deposits often accompanied BTC bull runs to spot exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility To Peak By November 8 As ‘Trump Trade’ Intensifies – Report Leveraged Bets’ Role in Bitcoin Price Growth Elaborating further on leverage bets involves using borrowed funds to multiply the size of an investment. For example, with 2x leverage, a trader can open a position twice as large as their capital. In Bitcoin futures trading, this approach can be profitable during upward price movements but also comes with risks. If the market shifts against their position, traders can face significant losses called liquidation. The analyst notes that the inflow of Bitcoin into derivatives exchanges signals increased confidence among investors, suggesting a belief in further price gains. This confidence can create a feedback loop, where rising prices encourage additional leveraged bets, further fueling the bull market. Bitcoin bull market begins with leveraged bets “The bull market will continue as #bitcoin continues to be deposited into futures exchanges for leveraged bets using derivatives, rather than into spot exchanges for selling.” – By @t0_god Link 👇https://t.co/1egL7L2YoO pic.twitter.com/uuQPEiSWtb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 30, 2024 BTC Price Performance And Outlook With Bitcoin’s price showing an 8.2% increase over the past week, currently trading at $71,804, the role of leverage becomes increasingly relevant. Notably, BTC saw a slight retracement from its recent 24-hour high of $73,562 yet continues to maintain upward momentum. This steady price growth and leveraged inflows signal broader investor optimism toward Bitcoin’s future price potential. According to the analyst, as long as Bitcoin continues to flow into futures rather than spot exchanges, the bullish sentiment will likely remain strong. Notably, leveraged bets happen to be just one of the several metrics of Bitcoin, suggesting a potential continuity of the ongoing increase in price. So far, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator (SSRO) has seen low levels not seen since 2022. The decrease of this metric into lower levels means more stablecoins are being converted to BTC, therefore suggesting increasing demand for the asset. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Wallet From 2012 Awakens, Moving Millions—BTC Price To Dip? Meanwhile, the technical outlook isn’t left in one of the several metrics indicating more rally for BTC’s price. Earlier today, the renowned crypto analyst Ali highlighted that historically, BTC has increased to 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels. Should the asset follow the same pattern this time, Ali predicts BTC will surge to a price between $174,000 and $462,000.

35361730,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650749,1730332843,"Bitcoin Boom: Is BTC Preparing For Another 6X To $462,000?","Bitcoin is marching higher, easing past $70,000 and $72,000 in the past two days, sparking a wave of demand. Although prices are moving within a tight range at spot rates, the uptrend remains. While there are pockets of weakness, at least seen earlier today, candlestick formation in the daily and weekly charts point to strength. Is Bitcoin Preparing For A 6X Surge To $462,000? In a post on X, one analyst thinks Bitcoin will not only break above its all-time high at $74,000 but can easily 6X to over $462,000 in the coming sessions. To support this outlook, the analyst said the coin is breaking out above key resistance levels, and Fibonacci extension levels mirror this shift in trend after the Q3 2024 plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Daily Close Above $76,000 To Confirm True Breakout: Analyst Based on the analyst’s assessment, historical price action shows that BTC peaks between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci extension levels. Technical analysts use this tool to project how fast prices will rally or drop based on a given range. If history guides and the Fibonacci extension levels remain valid, applying the same pattern to the current cycle could easily see Bitcoin soar to between $174,000 and $462,000. These two levels mark the extension levels’ lower and upper limits that define past cycles’ peak zone. As bullish as this forecast is, it should be known that the range anchoring any Fibonacci extension is subjective. For this reason, it will change depending on the analyst, meaning potential peaks will shift accordingly. Despite everything, the consensus is that Bitcoin could break and reach new all-time highs in Q4 2024. Taking to X, another analyst said Bitcoin is already within a bullish breakout formation, easing above a descending channel or bull flag. At the same time, prices are breaking above the resistance of a “cup and handle” pattern. Institutions Buying As BTC Recovers If bulls take over, pushing prices higher, the evolution would confirm gains of Q1 2024. Subsequently, it would mark the resumption of bulls, an encouraging development following the 30% drop from March highs.
