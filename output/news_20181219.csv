42430057,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3brh,1545258653,The Herd and the HODLers: Recovering from Crypto's Two-Year False Start,"David Nage is the founder of Roadmap, LLC and the former Managing Director of Apeiron Ventures, a private investment office. His crypto writings can be found on Medium at @david_55389https://medium.com/@david_55389.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  ""It is a False Start if the ball has been placed ready for play, and, prior to the snap, an offensive player who has assumed a set position charges or moves in such a way as to simulate the start of a play, or if an offensive player who is in motion makes a sudden movement toward the line of scrimmage.”  Before we can begin to look into our crystal ball and see what our magical internet money is potentially going to do for the world and investors in the coming year, I believe we need an honest and thorough review of the past 12 months and the narratives that played out.  This does NOT mean I am going to discuss how bitcoin was X price in December 2017 and that it has since lost Y percent since then – that, in my opinion, helps no one.  As Winston Churchill said: ""Those that fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.""  The talent before 'the herd'  In February 2018  , TechCrunch wrote that: “requests for on-demand blockchain talent are skyrocketing."" Last year (2017), freelance talent marketplace Upwork saw blockchain rise to the fastest-growing skill out of more than 5,000 skills in terms of freelancer billings — a year-over-year increase of more than 35,000 percent.  These requests span ICO advisory services, engineering projects and overall blockchain consultancy. Since January 2017, the demand for blockchain engineering talent on Toptal has grown 700 percent, and 40 percent of the fully managed software development projects requested in the last month require blockchain skills.  In regards to investment talent, there has been no shortage of institutional professionals that have left to pursue careers in the asset class, especially from Goldman Sachs: Juthica Chou, the COO of LedgerX, spent seven years as a derivatives trader within the Securities Division of Goldman Sachs, where she specialized in algorithmic trading.  Mike Novogratz has hired several high profile people from Goldman including Richard Kim, the new COO of Galaxy Digital who joined Luka Jankovic, another former Goldman Sachs hedge-fund analyst. Esther Babb, a former Goldman Sachs executive, was recently hired by Gemini to become their Director of Business Development.  Babb’s illustrious Wall Street career started nearly two decades back with Goldman Sachs, where she worked with the firm’s data intelligence team. BlockTower Capital recruited former Goldman executive Michael Bucella in January. Former Goldman vice president Matt Goetz founded BlockTower last year.  James Radecki was a managing director at Goldman and left in 2016 to work in strategic investing at another cryptocurrency firm, according to his LinkedIn page. He's now global head of business development at Cumberland Mining, one of the largest traders of cryptocurrencies.  Yet, at the same time, ICO fundraising, based on the $279 million raised last month, is now down by more than 90 percent since from its January 2018 all-time high. Since peaking in January, fundraising figures have consistently declined with only one break in the trend occurring in May 2018. What I find deeply interesting here is that this elongated decline, the “crypto winter,” has not stopped these highly touted professional investors and experienced engineers searching for employment in the asset class.  The herd is...circling  Have you been on a plane heading into a crowded airport, only to find you’re forced to circle around in the sky because the runway is full?  In my opinion “the herd” is circling – yes, Fidelity spent four to five years reviewing crypto because launching FDAS (Fidelity Digital Assets); yes, TD Ameritrade invested in a new cryptocurrency exchange called ErisX in a bid to offer clients digital asset investment options beyond bitcoin. Yes, NYSE/ICE launched Bakkt, a platform for trading, storing, and spending digital assets.  And yes, Yale Endowment, and in some ways the godfather of the endowment investment model, David Swenson, invested in two crypto funds, Paradigm and A16z Crypto. It seems Institutions and Institutional Investors began to understand that investing in crypto provided uncorrelated, enhanced returns compared to traditional investment instruments.  As noted in research prepared by Matt Hougan from Bitwise: “examining the impact that a 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent allocation to bitcoin would have had on a traditional 60 percent equity/40 percent bond portfolio since Jan. 1, 2014 they found that allocating to bitcoin would have significantly increased the portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns assuming the portfolio was systematically rebalanced over time.  The potential impact was large: With a 5 percent allocation, for instance, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio nearly doubled, total returns more than doubled, and the maximum drawdown was substantially reduced.”  Now shifting gears, as Mary Poppins sang: ""A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down...here comes the medicine.""  The two-year penalty  Do you remember last year around this time when that hot new ICO was able to raise $100 million in 30 minutes? Do you also remember all these dapps, with all their 80+ page white papers that no one really read, telling you they were going to reinvent the wheel?  Who can forget Useless Ethereum Token (UET) and Whoppercoin? Hint: me. More bad news: According to deadcoins.com there are now 934 coins that, as the websites name should give it away, are dead.  There’s a few problems aside from these I see overall: one, we have around 2,100 tokens in the market right now, many of who registered as a “utility” and in my opinion will have difficulty passing the Howey Test (*note: I am not an attorney nor have conferred with regulators but am reading the tea leaves given to the general public).  Chairman Clayton gave us the “laundromat” analogy this year in a way to discern if an entity is a  security or a utility:  “If I have a laundry token for washing my clothes, that's not a security. But if I have a set of 10 laundry tokens and the laundromats are to be developed and those are offered to me as something I can use for the future and I'm buying them because I can sell them to next year's incoming class, that's a security. What we find in the regulatory world [is that] the use of a laundry token evolves over time. The use can evolve toward or away from a security.”  From observation a majority of the 2,100 tokens in the market currently may have a very hard time passing the laundromat/Howey Test. This has already begun to play out and will continue to in 2019.  Take the SEC’s order that AirToken and Paragon refund ICO investors.  According to the federal agency, both companies conducted their ICOs in 2017 despite the SEC’s warning that the their tokens are considered as securities, which are defined in the DAO Report of Investigation.  Then there's the issue of a little thing called treasury management.  Many of these new projects did not have great plans for how to execute their ideas with their new capital, and most assumed they had five years of runway to figure it out. Projects raised funds in ether over the last year but forgot to plan any coherent treasury management vision or foresight.  Let’s say project X raised $30 million in ETH around Nov 2017–Jan 2018 at the all-time high price around $1,432. This would have minted the project roughly around 21,000 ETH. If the team did not understand or exercise proper treasury management, overspent on marketing and traveling around the world those 21,000 ETH (assuming they still haven’t spent them) are now worth $2.3 million.  This has already beginning to happen and will accelerate for the first few quarter of 2019: ETCDEV, the startup that led development on Ethereum Classic, which is among the top 20 coins with a market capitalization of about $400 million, announced this week that it’s shuttering operations due to a funding crunch.  Are we fast or decentralized?  Ethereum currently can handle around 15 transactions per second (TPS), although its creator Vitalik Buterin believes testing out zk-snarks could improve that to 1 million TPS. Bitcoin is still hovering around seven TPS.  Due to dAPPs such as CryptoKitties flooding the network with transactions, it has been proven that scalability needs to be improved across the network. The amount of transactions per second in the cryptocurrency space is often benchmarked against the amount of transactions Visa or MasterCard can handle, which is set at around 2,000 transactions per second.  Generally speaking, I believe we are in the Friendster-Myspace era right now; Facebook is a few years away and this relates to TPS and scalability as well. I think 2019 will see a real focus on what zero-knowledge proofs, DPOS or some newer iterations like proof of history can add to the ecosystem.  Many argue no, not yet.  Many of the blockchain space’s projects — Metamask, CryptoKitties, UJO, Radar Relay, Cipher Browser, uPort — utilize Infura’s APIs to connect their applications to the ethereum network.  In doing so, Infura provides the fundamental infrastructure required to handle both the short-term spikes that can often occur during token launches and essential, longer-term scaling solutions. An average of 6.5 billion JSON-RPC requests per day on the ethereum network are channeled through Infura infrastructure, making the project an essential pillar of the ecosystem.  A dream that is crypto  As Marcus Aurelius is quoted as saying in the movie ""Gladiator"": “There was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile.”  Well, 2017 going into 2018 the dream and promise of crypto was definitely not whispered – it was shouted from the tops of buildings and trading floors throughout the world. But was it ready? In my opinion, no. It was used and abused by those, who after 10 years of a drug-induced quantitative easing coma in the public markets, realized the party was coming to an end and needed a new kick.  From an institutional investor perspective, the signal-to-noise ratio was quite high this year; I expect with research and news firms coming online this year and into next that will improve.  On Jan 1, 2016, bitcoin was trading around $420. Even with a significant downturn that we’ve bore witness to over the last few weeks that still represents an 8x over the last two years if you employed the HODL mantra.  Crypto wasn’t ready for prime time, but it most certainly will not die. It will rise from the ashes, stronger, more durable and cautious of who it lets in. It will change the world we live in, providing censorship-resistant protection of assets, new ways to validate identity that don’t rely on antiquated technology like SSN.  It will enable suppliers and buyers to improve their relationship and begin to chip away at the billions of dollars of food we humans throw out each year while people starve and so much more. All the talent it’s brought in this year is building right now as you read this article. It has only just begun and it needs us to give it some time to mature.

42430047,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3bbh,1545254104,Take 2: News Startup Civil Announces Rebooted Token Sale for February,"More journalism, less techno-boosterism.  That's the central message of a new blog post from Civil co-founder Matthew Iles about the company's path forward. Civil aims to use blockchain and an ethereum-based token to breathe new life into the online news industry – though that objective faced a major setback after a failed token sale in October.  As Iles wrote:  ""Civil was never about ICOs and tokens or even blockchain. We’re about community-ownership, transparency and trust. We believe journalism (and media at large) should compete on craft, but collaborate on infrastructure.""  While Civil promises to put reporting first, it has not eliminated tokens from its model.  In the new announcement, Iles confirms that the CVL token will go on sale in February directly on the company's website. Unlike the first go-round, Civil will not impose a deadline or any sort of caps. The tokens will simply be up for sale until all 34 million are gone.  As we previously reported, Civil will use a new model for tokens called the ""consumer token,"" developed by the Brooklyn Project, which, like Civil, is a spoke of ethereum venture studio ConsenSys. That model wasn't enough to make Civil's first initial coin offering (ICO) work, and Civil ended up refunding contributions to those that supported it.  According to Civil, CVL tokens can be used to take part in governance, launch a newsroom and potentially for readers to support newsrooms.  In November, CoinDesk was first to report on journalists in Civil-affiliated newsrooms complaining that the failed token sale impacted their negotiated compensation, which included partial payments in CVL tokens.  New approach  ""This is driven by doing a lot of user research after the token sale and ensuring that we heard and transparently responded to major feedback wherever possible,"" Civil co-founder and spokesperson Matthew Coolidge told CoinDesk in an email Wednesday.  With the launch of the new token sale, Civil will also debut its Civil Registry and Civil Publisher products. The former allows CVL holders to participate in the governance of the network of news organizations. (To that end, the company also announced a new draft of the Civil Constitution today.) The Civil Publisher tool will allow journalists to index documentation for their stories or even to archive content.  On Monday, Civil newsroom and culture publication Popula announced it had archived a news article on IPFS and ethereum, a first for the Civil network and perhaps a first for any news organization.  Civil currently has 18 newsrooms committed and has redesigned its website to help make the output of those affiliates more easily accessible.  Coolidge said Civil has 12 more newsrooms signing on, with one well-known brand that it will announce soon.  Alongside crypto crowdfunding, some of the newsrooms have been going to Kickstarter for fiat crowdfunding. The Colorado Sun and Block Club Chicago both successfully completed campaigns there earlier this year, and Popula just launched its Kickstarter campaign this week.  For Civil itself, though, this remains a crypto-driven fundraising approach. The company assures its supporters that the token purchasing process will be easier this time, but it will also still include a know-your-customer check and a quiz about buyers' crypto knowledge. Those aren't going away yet.  For its part, Civil the company has refocused on bringing small and medium-sized newsrooms into its network. As Coolidge told CoinDesk:  ""Our initial focus is on catering to independent journalists who want to tap into this larger community, and have a more deliberate reason to access their peers, and to get cheaper rates on services like licensing AP content or hiring custom WordPress devs.""  When asked to clarify, Coolidge added that Civil is working to build a vendor network with discounts for Civil members.  ""Civil's 'community-owned and operated model' could just as easily be called a 'journalism co-op,'"" he said. ""Hence all major decisions requiring community consensus to be ratified.""  Correction: An earlier version of this story listed Feb. 20 as the date of the new token sale. No specific date in February has been established by Civil. The story has been updated.

Announced Tuesday, the product, dubbed a ""perpetual swap,"" allows crypto traders to speculate on the future value of OKEx’s bitcoin (BTC) to U.S. dollar (USD) index.  Each swap contract has a notional value of $100 equivalent in BTC, the exchange said in a statement, adding that traders can either long a position to profit from an increase in bitcoin’s price or short a position to profit from the decline in bitcoin’s price.  The new product offers up to 100 times leverage, compared to the 10 times commonly available in traditional capital markets, which OKEx said can reduce the trading cost. Settlement time is at 04:00 and 16:00 UTC daily, while the traded price of a perpetual swap contract is ""closely anchored to the spot market price,"" said the exchange.  OKEx's perpetual swaps also offer a ""tiered maintenance margin ratio"" feature, which allows traders with open positions to adjust their leverage according to their risk appetite and market conditions, and a ""mark price"" mechanism to help traders avoid unnecessary liquidations at times of high volatility.

42430051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3bfh,1545242692,Coinbase Just Moved $5 Billion in Crypto to Prepare for Token Expansion,"Coinbase is moving to significantly expand the number of digital assets listed on its platform – a process that has led to a radical rethinking of how the startup safeguards billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies.  To this end, Coinbase moved retail traders’ crypto assets – worth some $5 billion – into its upgraded storage model last week. According to the company, that migration included 5 percent of all bitcoin, 8 percent of all ethereum, and 25 percent of all the litecoin in circulation, respectively.  Phillip Martin, Coinbase’s head of security, told CoinDesk that the migration process took roughly four months to plan.  “This was a fundamentally new architecture from the ground up,” he said, explaining:  “Regulators and auditors were involved at every stage... One of the biggest things we were worried about is that we don’t move the market with this event, which is why we went to such lengths to coordinate with regulators and manage media speculation around the movements.”  It all began with a new key generation process in October, through which the Coinbase team goes to a secure location with new computers and prints out keys that are then split up using formats that include scannable QR codes.  “We take the private key and apply a cryptographic technique called Shamir’s Secret Sharing, which is an algorithm that’s used to take a piece of private data and split it into a bunch of chunks you can divide,” Martin said. “There’s a threshold splitting system because you can define a threshold by less than the total number of pieces that are sufficient to reconstruct the original.”  The binders full of billions of dollars worth of keys are then divided among various secure locations, requiring multiple Coinbase employees to work together over the phone in order to unlock the cryptocurrency.  While many other bitcoin custodians prefer to rely on multi-signature wallets – rather than a single key divided into parts – Coinbase devised this strategy to accommodate assets that don’t yet work with multisig wallets.  Expansion ahead  Coinbase may have applied this process to the highest volume of assets to date, but the institutional custodian BitGo has also used key sharding in custody solutions for diverse tokens.  BitGo CEO Mike Belshe told CoinDesk his startup won't support any asset that can't accommodate a multisig custody model.  ""In the case of ethereum, which does not support on-chain multisig, we are able to support ethereum by using multisig through smart contracts,” Belshe said, adding that BitGo simultaneously uses both key sharding and a multisig approach. “We’re looking for a much more robust custodial process that is really strong, rather than having a lot of breadth.""  BitGo’s VP of product marketing, Robin Verderosa, said BitGo and Coinbase follow similar reporting and compliance strategies, which could open the door for both companies to add support for new assets and policies in the following months.  “The regulators had to go very deep into our cold storage solutions,” she said.  Looking ahead, insurance providers, auditors and compliance experts will continue to be an integral part of evaluating such processes, which Martin sees as a sign that the market is maturing.  And yet, one thing that makes Coinbase’s game plan unique is that the exchange company wanted a one-size-fits-all cold storage process that would pave the road for speedy expansions.  “When you’re dealing with $5 billion of crypto, based on the asset prices at that time, we can’t change the process as we go. You want to do it a way you know works every time,” Martin explained, going on to say:  “We think it’s critical to our ability to serve the broad spectrum of assets out there as they come online.”  Money origami image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | LTC | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/19/coinbase-just-moved-5-billion-in-crypto-to-prepare-for-token-expansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f451ceacba9e63943638b01f6ce8cca6f313c108-1500x860.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Peter Hiom, deputy CEO of the ASX, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that Masters' departure would not impact its plans to roll out a distributed ledger technology-based clearing and settlement system to replace the incumbent CHESS platform.  DA announced Tuesday that Masters, who helmed the company since she began working there in 2015, would be stepping down for personal reasons. She will be temporarily replaced by DA board of directors member and now-chairman AG Gangadhar while the firm looks for a new permanent chief executive.  ""ASX remains absolutely committed to DLT and our partnership with Digital Asset (DA) - our CHESS replacement program is on track and moving ahead at pace,"" Hiom said, adding:  ""We are working closely with DA at all levels on development, implementation and customer readiness for the replacement system, and we look forward to continuing this work with AG Gangadhar and the DA team.""  Masters' work with DA has helped advance DLT efforts, he added, saying that she ""is a good friend of ASX.""  While ASX initially planned to roll out its new system by 2020, Hiom said Wednesday that the exchange ""remains on track to bring DLT to market by early 2021.""  As such, ASX continues to believe that DLT can both ""drive efficiency and stimulate innovation,"" Hiom said. ""We thank [Masters] and wish her the very best,"" he added.

As part of its efforts to maintain the stablecoin's security, TrustToken is now storing the U.S. dollars backing the token in multiple third-party trust companies. Each trust company is regulated through the State of Nevada Financial Institutions Division.

Today, CoinList announced that it's making ""CoinList Build"" into a product.  CoinList President Andy Bromberg told CoinDesk that these new blockchain-based companies need help getting engineers to try out their platforms. ""They are realizing that developers and users are kind of a virtuous cycle,"" he said.  To that end, CoinList has spun up a new product that makes it easy for crypto companies to pull together online hackathons in very little time. Its first hackathon will take place next month with 0x, the peer-to-peer exchange protocol for ethereum-based tokens.  CoinList is primarily known as a backend solution for running token sales. According to the company, 50 teams have used it to raise $450 million so far.  Hackathons have historically been in-person events, but online contests have been proving more and more workable. ""They are democratized, anyone can participate, you don't have to travel,"" Bromberg said. ""It's a chance to get a bunch of people to build on top of a platform.""  Lowering the barrier to entry, Bromberg contends, fits into the larger values of the blockchain space. ""So many great contributors in the crypto ecosystem have come out of nowhere,"" he said. Not just geographically, but people who proved to be valuable contributors that didn't previously have a big reputation among developers.  ""That's really the community that we would love to get,"" Bromberg added.  This first online hackathon will run from January 10 to February 7, and sign-ups begin today. To entice developers to take part, 0x is putting up $50,000 worth of its token in prizes.  CoinList isn't disclosing how much it will earn for running these events for teams, and Bromberg said that aspect is still under discussion. As a principle, he said, expect to see more money going to event participants than to his company.  Following 0x's event, the company plans to work with more crypto-industry companies to run similar events. It can all come together very quickly when the need to manage a specific location can be removed from the set of logistical roadblocks, explained Bromberg.  ""We think every single team in the space should be running one of these to start getting developers on board,"" he said.  The debut event  To kick off the new product, 0x is inviting developers to participate in its event, dubbed ""Bringing Decentralized Markets to the Masses.""  Bromberg told CoinDesk that its partner is looking for products that speak to three big themes: compliance, decentralized finance and gaming, which includes applications for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  There will be a $10,000 grand prize, a $7,500 community choice award and $2,500 for finalists in each of the three categories. On top of that, 0x will also be giving $100 in its ZRX token to each participant that submits a project.  On top of that, hackathon participants will present before a panel of big-name judges in the space. The judges have been divided by their areas of expertise: product design includes Product Hunt's Ryan Hoover and Tinder's Jeff Morris; compliance includes Messari's Katherine Wu and CoinList's own Georgia Quinn. Gaming includes OpenSea's Devin Finzer and Nick Tomaino, an investor at 1confirmation. Joel Monegro of Placeholder, the crypto venture firm, will also serve as a judge.  CoinList has not yet announced the next company it will work with under the CoinList Build umbrella. It may also develop the product similar to the way it runs token sales, with a CoinList co-branded product and a white-labeled option (like its ComplyAPI) is now.  ""I think every crypto company would want to do this,"" Bromberg said. ""If we're doing – every month – an awesome hackathon, I think that's a good starting place.""

42430039,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3bRh,1545228058,Watch Lambos Battle for Crypto in This 'War Riders' Gameplay Trailer,"How players will battle for crypto in War Riders became a little clearer this morning.  In a gameplay trailer released exclusively to CoinDesk, Cartified, the company behind the game, teases how post-apocalyptic vehicles will duke it out for a crypto token called Benzene (BZN).  And while the game isn't yet live, 3,700 cars have already been sold as non-fungible, ERC-721 tokens, according to the company. Souped-up Car Tanks and War Lambos have sold for anywhere from $450 to $2,200 each, payable in ETH (more affordable cars are coming, Cartified says).  The game itself won't cost money to play. Players simply need to own at least one vehicle.  CoinDesk last reported on War Riders when it was kicked out of Coinbase Wallet at the behest of Apple.  ""Our Pre-Alpha Gameplay Teaser video is released to show the quality of the graphics and what to expect from the actual gameplay,"" Cartified CEO Vlad Kartashov told CoinDesk in a statement. ""We are still keeping most of the actual gameplay mechanics in secret (to prevent copycats).""  We know a bit about the gameplay already, based on what we can see in the video and previous conversations with Kartashov.  First of all, the economy of War Riders runs on BZN, which is an ERC-20 token. Players need BZN to ""survive"" the barren gamescape, so in the world of War Riders it's expected to be the same thing as money. Interestingly, there are plans for BZN to be tradeable in the real world, just like other tokens, making the game a potential bellwether for crypto's gaming use-case.  ""We have plans to add it to an exchange after the end of the vehicle pre-sale/start of the alpha,"" Kartashov said via email.  The game will use an algorithm to determine how much new BZN is needed to keep the economy stable and it will randomly distribute caches around the game world. So, the more a user plays, the more likely he or she is to stumble on caches.  Gameplay  ""Hey, cowboy: mine or die today,"" begins the new trailer. ""I'm thirsty for some BZN.""  In the first portion of the trailer, what appears to be two gangs of vehicles are driving around a desert and firing weapons at each other. The game emphasizes its three-dimensional nature by, for example, showing one car ramping over another and cars knocking each other over through direct hits.  Then a tanker seems to break away and start fueling up with BZN at a way station.  Kartashov explained to CoinDesk that getting the BZN isn't enough. A player won't be able to use it from a personal wallet until they get their cars back to their HQ. If they get a load of the stuff out in the field but other players catch them, they risk losing the loot.  The next part of the trailer is perhaps more telling.  It shows a mission-selection screen where the player can choose to chase after BZN in some wasteland. It shows the player selecting vehicles for the mission. As they select more vehicles, their odds of success increase.  Kartashov told CoinDesk that players will be in control of their vehicle, but there's also clearly some kind of armada element to the game. It could be something like the PC gaming classic Sacrifice, where players both controlled a wizard but also gave broad direction to his army of mythical beasts as they completed missions for different gods.  For now, Kartashov won't say more.  The total amount of BZN is finite and some of might be burned with different uses. Over time, BZN will appear more slowly or caches will contain fewer tokens.  Just like in a real post-apocalypse, ""The fight for it will get more aggressive and more aggressive over time,"" Kartashov predicted.

42430055,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3bnh,1545228004,"MultiChain Releases 2.0 Beta, Adds SAP and HCL as Partners","MultiChain, the enterprise blockchain framework created by Coin Sciences, has released its beta version 2.0 and added over 40 new partners, including big names like SAP and HCL Technologies.  MultiChain 2.0  is a major upgrade to the platform which first went into production back in August of 2017. The announcement of the technological improvements dovetails with a jump in the ranks for its partner program, the roster for which now stands at 86 members.  Version 2.0 includes new features such as “smart filters” – MultiChain's take on smart contracts – as well as support for structured data to be embedded and indexed in the chain, and easy management of off-chain data.  “MultiChain has full off-chain data functionality built in so it makes life a lot easier for developers who are already using this kind of technique but had to cobble things together themselves with multiple pieces,” said MultiChain founder Dr. Gideon Greenspan.  MultiChain’s smart filters approach has elements in common with both R3 Corda's way of doing things, and also how ethereum works; indeed, the main enterprise blockchains all have slightly different ways of coding up rules on the blockchain, said Greenspan. This had led to more design space in terms of how smart contract rules can be expressed and run, and how to deal with things like conflicting transactions, said Greenspan. Each of the main platforms makes some decisions in this design space, the result being that different designs are better or worse suited for different use cases.  “Before choosing which blockchain platform to use you have to actually understand the application you want to build and the types of transaction that application to conduct,” Greenspan noted, adding:  “Make sure that informs your decision of platform, rather than choosing a platform because you've heard about it or because it was in the news.”  Drilling down a little, Greenspan explained there are two types of MultiChain smart filters: transaction filters and stream filters. “The stream filter is particularly good for straightforward data validation, so any kind of use case where you are putting structured data on the blockchain and you want to make sure that the data is clean,” he said.  Transaction filters are well suited for creating niche financial systems running on the blockchain which require some special logic for that case. “This could be some kind of credit point scheme or currency transacting environment in a particular subset of organizations and the transaction filters are well suited for defining extra rules about those sorts of transactions in terms of who can do what and when,” said Greenspan.  SAP effect  Prominent among the new partners is German software giant SAP, which boasts more than 335,000 customers in 180 countries. The company will be adding MultiChain to the SAP cloud offering, along with Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum, the ethereum-derived enterprise platform.  MultiChain’s tracking and verification capabilities have already been put to the test by SAP in a pilot scheme around the authentication of returned prescription drugs, prior to these being reintroduced back into the market.  Raimund Gross, chief blockchain strategist at SAP, said that drugs are oftentimes ordered by hospitals, for instance, in excess of the amount actually required and need to be returned.  Another example might involve an order of a very tailor-made drug which could cost $30,000, which for some reason or other has to be returned.  “Those returned drugs are a significant asset and can represent for our individual customers a total value of between like $2-$3bn a year,” said Gross.

The three projects receiving the 1,000 ETH grants are Prysmatic Labs, ChainSafe Systems and Sigma Prime.  All are projects working to build the blockchain network's next iteration, ethereum 2.0. Sigma Prime is building an ethereum 2.0 client called Lighthouse, Prysmatic Labs is working on ethereum scalability and ChainSafe is also building an ethereum 2.0 client.  The move came in response to a twitter thread in which prominent members of the ethereum community discussed ways in which the technology might be improved, with some citing inadequate funding as a reason for slow development.  Preston Van Loon, co-founder of Prysmatic Labs and a software engineer at Google, tweeted that, even with recent grants, “it’s hardly enough to take the whole team full time with significant pay cuts and it’s certainly not even for us to scale the team to where we need it.”  To that, Buterin replied:  ""Just sent 1000 eth. Yolo [you only live once].""  The comments followed a tweet from Ryan Sean Adams, founder of crypto investment firm Mythos Capital, that cited ""tough love"" comments from VC investor Fred Wilson, and wrote that ethereum is ""missing ship dates [and] are lacking basic operational leadership.""  Ameen Solaimani, CEO at SpankChain, replied in the thread, stating that: “Ethereum has taken its lead for granted for too long (2 years). Needs increased focus and urgency on scalability to reclaim its narrative. Move fast or die slow.”  A second grant was awarded to Sigma Prime, when co-founder Paul Hauner tweeted that his project has ""been knocked back for a couple of grants recently. We can certainly turn 1k ETH into more developers!” Buterin responded with another 1,000 ETH.  The third donation went to Canada-based ChainSafe, after project lead Mikerah Quintyne-Collins tweeted: “I will quite literally drop out if we got $100k in ETH.” Buterin accepted the pledge and donated to the project, stating: “I expect results!”  Buterin, who (now perhaps ironically) describes himself on Twitter as a “Non-giver of Ether” in response to the many crypto scammers on the social media platform, also provided three transaction links confirming the transactions, which come from his known ether address.  Prysmatic Labs and Sigma Prime have previously received donations from Ethereum Foundation. Prysmatic Labs was granted $500,000 in October and $100,000 in March, and Sigma Prime got $150,000 in October.  The current price of ether, ethereum's native cryptocurrency, is about $103 at press time, as per CoinDesk's price index.

42430058,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3bth,1545217225,Bull Reversal: Bitcoin Climbs Key Price Hurdle to Target $4K,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price crossed key resistance yesterday, boosting the prospects of a stronger rally above $4,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value broke out of a bearish descending pattern and closed above key resistance at $3,633 yesterday. That came after picking up a strong bid on the anniversary of its 2017 all-time price high on Monday.  Tuesday’s close has also pushed up the probability of a bullish three-day close above $3,590 being confirmed on Thursday.  So, with the short-term picture looking bullish, the focus shifts to the next major resistance levels lined up at $4,000 (psychological hurdle) and $4,410 (Nov. 29 high).  BTC is currently trading at $3,750 on Bitstamp, having clocked a two-week high of $3,776 earlier today. The cryptocurrency has recovered 20 percent from the recent low of $3,122 but is still down 73 percent on a year-to-date basis.  Daily chart        BTC's close above $3,633 on the daily chart bolstered the increasingly bullish technical setup, as represented by the positive divergence of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) and the high-volume falling wedge breakout.  Further evidence that the bears have weakened is a bullish crossover between the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs).  Hourly chart  On the hourly chart, the bull flag breakout confirmed yesterday created room for a rally to $3,840 (pole height added to breakout price).  Both the rising trendline and the stacking order of the simple moving averages (SMAs) also favor an extension of the ongoing rally.  Monthly chart  The outlook as per the monthly chart would turn bullish if and when prices beat the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month EMA, currently at $5,728.

42430050,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3bhh,1545211822,UK Tax Agency Publishes Detailed Guidance for Crypto Holders,"The United Kingdom's tax agency has just released a comprehensive explanation of how it sees crypto assets and how individuals may be taxed on their holdings.  Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the government agency responsible for collecting taxes and overseeing other aspects of the nation's coffers, explained that Wednesday's report specifically focuses on how individuals possessing crypto assets might be taxed, but does not outline the tax scheme for tokens held by businesses or for business purposes. Guidance on that will be published at a later date.  The document follows on previous reports from the UK government, treating crypto assets more as property than as a form of money.  ""HMRC does not consider crypto assets to be currency or money. This reflects the position previously set out by the report from the Cryptoasset Taskforce (CATF),"" it explains, noting that the task force classified cryptocurrencies as either exchange tokens, utility tokens or security tokens.  Importantly, Wednesday's report notes that how a token is treated for tax purposes depends on the token's use case, rather than its definition.  ""This paper considers the taxation of exchange tokens (like bitcoins) and does not specifically consider utility or security tokens. For utility and security tokens this guidance provides our starting principles but a different tax treatment may need to be adopted,"" HMRC explains.  Investors who purchase tokens specifically in the hopes that their value will increase will be required to pay capital gains tax when they sell, while individuals who receive tokens from their employers as a form of payment, from mining, transaction fees or airdrops will have to pay income tax and national insurance contributions.  The report continues:  ""As set out in more detail below, there may be cases where the individual is running a business which is carrying on a financial trade in cryptoassets and will therefore have taxable trading profits. This is likely to be unusual, but in such cases Income Tax would take priority over the Capital Gains Tax rules. HMRC will publish separate information for businesses in due course.""  Notably, HMRC will not consider the purchase and sale of cryptoassets to be the same as gambling.  The report goes into detail, explaining to UK residents just how and when their holdings – or transactions – may be classified as securities, providing examples to demonstrate.  To simplify the calculations required, individuals can ""pool"" different assets together. Rather than calculating the gains or losses on each asset individually, they can simply look at the total value when placed in the pool and compare that to the value at the end of the tax period.  Forks and losses  The new guidance later outlines how forks of a blockchain may impact taxation, specifically citing hard forks which cause the chain to split and new tokens to be formed.  The section details how forks occur, when a chain might split, and how the value for the subsequent coins would be determined, adding:  ""New cryptoassets can only be disposed of if the exchange recognizes the new cryptoassets. If the exchange does not recognize the new cryptoasset it does not change the position for the blockchain, which will show an individual as owning units of the new cryptoasset. HMRC will consider cases of difficulty as they arise.""  Other provisions account for assets which have lost their value, if tokens are stolen or defrauded from the investor or even if the individual somehow loses their private keys.  Regarding the latter, HMRC advises that an individual will likely have to claim that their cryptoassets now have ""negligible value,"" which could, if approved, allow them to claim a loss.

42430052,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM3blh,1545210033,Venezuela Isn't the Crypto Use Case You Want It to Be,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts love to talk about Venezuelan users – wracked by political oppression, economic collapse and food insecurity – as a prime example of bitcoin’s subversive potential. But the reality is far more complicated.  Venezuelan expat David Díaz of the Blockchain Academy in Buenos Aires told CoinDesk that many Venezuelans are learning about cryptocurrency through forced exposure to the state-issued petro, in addition to aggressive outreach strategies from projects like dash. Many don’t even know that bitcoin is useful itself, beyond its ability to ease the transfer of assets like dash or dollars.  That’s why Díaz is teaming up with fellow expat Jorge Farias of Panama-based startup Cryptobuyer to offer a free educational course about bitcoin to Venezuelans, including online programming and in-person classes in Argentina, Venezuela and Panama. News of the program was revealed exclusively to CoinDesk.  The course, which starts in February, will be very similar to the paid programs Díaz has already run for roughly 2,000 students in Buenos Aires, including a few hundred Venezuelan migrants. But now the focus will be on providing free information that is useful in a Venezuelan context, where cheap Android phones and censored internet access impact usability.  Díaz told CoinDesk:  “The main benefit for Venezuela is the knowledge, what to do with bitcoin, how to escape from the power the Venezuelan government has placed there, not only economically but also for information. There is a lot of censorship there.”  Fellow expat Eduardo Gomez, the head of support at the crypto startup Purse who recently moved to Argentina, now uses the peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins to help his mother pay bills.  “The government has [told] the private banks and government-run banks that external IPs should not be able to access their bank accounts,” Gomez told CoinDesk. “The government wants to control remittance businesses.”  Díaz and Gomez are among the many Venezuelans connecting with their homeland through the bitcoin-centric diaspora. WhatsApp groups and Instagram communities help expats coordinate financial transactions on the ground. LocalBitcoins usage surged throughout the year and now facilitates weekly volumes worth billions of bolivars.  According to a recent report by the United Nations, a whopping 17 percent of the country’s population has fled Venezuela in recent years.  There are now many Venezuelan expats working on various projects to help their countrymen, including Alejandro Machado, co-founder of a San Francisco-based nonprofit called the Open Money Initiative that aims to create fintech products and tools for Venezuela. Machado has helped several Venezuelans use exchange platforms like LocalBitcions and AirTM, since the latter is blocked inside Venezuela.  The challenges Machado experienced helping crypto newbies highlights the discrepancy between the tech-savvy intelligentsia and low-income communities.  “They trust me and I can do it for them, but they don’t trust themselves doing it,” Machado said. “The level of technical sophistication among everyone [in Venezuela] is not the same, and it’s lower than you’d expect.”  Migration risks  Some Venezuelans fleeing the country do so with their assets held in bitcoin, to avoid being harassed at the airport or the border. Both Díaz, who moved to Argentina in 2015, and Gomez, who moved in September 2018, are among them.  “Carrying around cash is so risky, any valuables, jewelry, whatever, it’s so risky,” Gomez told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin helped a lot because we didn’t need to carry anything physical around. We came here to Argentina and all our savings were in crypto.”  Gomez was unbanked in Argentina for several months, until Tuesday, and relied entirely on the Buenos Aires bitcoin community to help him liquidate crypto assets as needed. (Bitcoin's price volatility can feel negligible when compared to the Venezuelan bolivar, which the IMF predicted could hit an inflation rate of 1,000,000% by 2019.)  “This is a real use case, but it’s not something that a lot of people are doing because a lot of people don’t know it’s possible,” Machado said, adding that if crypto UX “doesn’t get any easier, we won’t see this operating at scale.”  Díaz said expats become more involved with the broader bitcoin ecosystem when they leave Venezuela. In part, this is due to fear that public association with crypto inside Venezuela could attract attention from corrupt government officials.  “There was a big community in Venezuela, but we were mostly underground,” Díaz said. “In Argentina, I could find a more open community. We could have regular meetups.”  Although some local projects like EOS Venezuela have so far managed to provide liquidity to small groups of local users without such conflicts, those use cases are both nuanced and nascent.  Borderland economy  Some migration experts compare the Venezuelan crisis to the Syrian civil war, a mass forced-migration movement that leaves many unbanked and desperate for basic necessities.  The difficulty low-income families have in buying food is precisely what the nonprofit GiveCrypto sought to address with its campaign to distribute EOS tokens to 100 families living in the Venezuelan border town of Santa Elena de Uairen.  GiveCrypto’s executive director, Joe Waltman, told CoinDesk that EOS Venezuela provides fiat liquidity to a local merchant while participants use the EOS wallet Bonnum, which does not support bitcoin nor offer users their private keys.  On one hand, this allows several families to use the same phone to access EOS donations. Plus, Bonnum CEO Edmilson Rodrigues told CoinDesk from Brazil that the startup aims to someday offer a blockchain-agnostic wallet.  However, for now, Venezuelan merchants appear to be more interested in using EOS to access fiat than holding crypto itself.  Waltman explained:  “You go to this person and say this dumb foreigner is going to be dropping a bunch of money into this town and it’s only going to be redeemable in a couple of locations. Do you want to be one of those locations?... It hasn’t been a hard sell.”  This experiment originally grew out of Bonnum’s closed beta in Brazil, where the startup discovered a few dozen families were using EOS to buy necessities from a local merchant close to the border who accepts EOS. Those families then routinely trekked across the Venezuelan border, delivering goods to Santa Elena de Uairen. This type of crypto-fueled borderland economy is increasingly widespread.  Jose Antonio Lanz, a Venezuela-based reporter at Ethereum World News, told CoinDesk he used Facebook and Telegram groups to learn about cryptocurrency. Then he sent bitcoin to a Colombian black market dealer who brought medicine across the border for Lanz’s mother, who was battling cancer.  “Now I can say that my mom is alive thanks to bitcoin,” Lanz said, adding that he tried local hospitals and pharmacies but in the end was forced to turn to the black market.  “The important thing is to be able to give the sellers the money as they want. Some wanted bolivars, some wanted PayPal,” he continued.  Crypto limitations  All things considered, there is still a long way to go until crypto is used for its own merits in Venezuela. At the moment, it’s often used as a tool for acquiring or liquidating fiat.  Machado, of the Open Money Initiative, told CoinDesk that daily crypto usage is “not a widespread phenomena” on the ground. Waltman agreed, saying:  “There’s a sad irony. The poorer you are, the less you can actually use cryptocurrency.”  Díaz disagreed, saying that almost every Venezuelan he knows now uses bitcoin for remittance and international transfers. He conceded, however, that most are using it as a tool to get goods delivered to Venezuela or acquire and then store dollars in an offshore bank account.  Dash and EOS may have more merchant adoption inside Venezuela, according to Díaz, but they rely on sponsored liquidity networks and local ambassadors converting new users who often lack a basic understanding of cryptocurrency.  As such, Open Money Initiative co-founder Jill Carlson said that there’s a dire need for more research on the ground in Venezuela. Otherwise, cryptocurrency distribution initiatives run the risk of becoming mere marketing stunts.  “Maybe we find that cryptocurrency is actually, in its current form, not suitable at all for a situation like the one inside Venezuela,” Carlson said. Waltman agreed that GiveCrypto is still figuring out what a long-term strategy in Venezuela would look like.  Speaking to how middle-class households use crypto to store value and buy basic goods like shampoo, Carlson added:  “It’s not just a single experience or situation. And then for us, as entrepreneurs working with technology and crypto, we need to recognize that the person who is worrying about shampoo and the person worrying about how they are going to feed their kids tonight are so, so different.”  As Carlson’s and Rodrigues’ respective projects collect data, Díaz’s upcoming Blockchain Academy program aims to bridge the knowledge gap inside Venezuelan so that newbies can choose which cryptocurrency and storage solutions work best for them.  Meanwhile, the underground migration network continues to spread.  “I know other projects that are helping people to get out of the country with bitcoin,” Díaz said.
