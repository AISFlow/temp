42433449,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQuVh,1608841826,Tierion to Repay ICO Investors Up to $25M Plus Interest in SEC Settlement,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered Tierion to pay back investors in its TNT tokens after finding the data verification startup’s $25 million initial coin offering (ICO) violated securities laws.      TNT holders and ICO investors who sold their tokens at a loss have 60 days to ask Tierion for what is essentially a refund – at cost, plus interest. Node operators can sell their compensatory TNT back to Tierion for .01 cent plus interest.      Tierion must immediately disable trading of its ERC-20 token, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain, under the settlement disclosed Wednesday. It will pay the SEC $250,000 in penalties. Tierion did not admit or deny wrongdoing, according to the SEC. The SEC also issued Tierion a Reg D waiver, meaning it won't have to register future private placements of securities because it cooperated.      The order effectively blows up 1 billion TNT tokens. At the time of its 2017 ICO, Tierion pitched them as the “method of settlement” between users of its data verification network, the “Chainpoint protocol,” and an “incentive” to secure the network. The order said Tierion sold 350 million TNT to 4,800 investors.      But Tierion, which at one point had buy-in from the likes of Microsoft, plans to continue without TNT. Founder and CEO Wayne Vaughn told CoinDesk in a text message the settlement allows Tierion “to move forward without a heavy regulatory burden.” He framed TNT’s demise as the token going into “retirement.”      “This announcement does not impact the availability of Tierion’s current products or open-source software,” Tierion said in a Medium post.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/24/tierion-to-repay-ico-investors-up-to-25m-plus-interest-in-sec-settlement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b04d2d1446476d46632a98b76d178192fb864711-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433461,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQuvh,1608840623,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stays in Tight Range but Gains Dominance as XRP Crumbles,"The Takeaway    Bitcoin (BTC) traded around $23,310 as of 19:00 UTC (2 p.m. ET), slipping 1.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $22,644.56 - $23,672.82 (CoinDesk 20)  Derivatives market hints at more volatility ahead.  With XRP’s sell-off, bitcoin’s dominance of the crypto market increases.    A mere $1.2 billion worth of bitcoin changed on the eight exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20, the lowest level in 10 days.      The relative quiet of the holiday season could potentially give way to some downside at the start of the new year, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies.      “Bitcoin is digesting its gains in a consolidation phase after having confirmed its breakout to new all-time highs with its mid-month push higher,” said Stockton. “Former resistance near $19,500 is now initial support. Overbought conditions have not had an impact on momentum,” she said, though that is “perhaps more likely in January, which appears prone to risk-off positioning as it pertains to other asset classes.”      Traders borrowing to buy bitcoin may also end up endangering prices in the not-too-distant future, according to analyst Alex Krüger.      “The crypto market became extremely levered up since the $20K breakout, and implied volatility spiked higher as traders repriced,” Krüger said. “High leverage translates into weaker hands and makes price vulnerable to large corrections. That is why we have been seeing such large two-way price moves since. This is normal given such market dynamics. In such conditions negative news would have an outsized market impact.”      A hint of what’s to come – as early as Friday – may also be found in the derivatives market.      “We will witness the largest expiry in Deribit’s history tomorrow [Dec. 25] as 86,000 option contracts will expire with a notional value of over $2 billion,” said Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, the world’s largest bitcoin options exchange. About 35% of all options on the exchange will expire Friday, leading them to expect some volatility on Christmas Day.      “Max pain is at a significantly lower level, possibly indicating volatility to come,” Strijers added.      As Deribit defines it, the max pain price is the strike price with the most open interest for puts and calls and the price at which the underlying asset (such as bitcoin or ether) would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.      Thursday also marked the December expiration of bitcoin futures on the CME, with 4,309 contracts changing hands, much lower than the previous day’s 13,829.

Since Monday, when Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse gave the heads-up that the Securities and Exchange Commission was going to file an action claiming that XRP is a security, the cryptocurrency lost more than half its value. While still the third-most valuable crypto, according to CoinDesk 20 data, its market cap is now back down to $26.6 billion, roughly where it was in early November.

42433460,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQurh,1608831603,"XRP Liquidations Soar as SEC Lawsuit, Token Airdrop Whipsaw Markets","Liquidations for XRP futures contracts have soared at year’s end as bullish signals in November followed by decidedly bearish news in December whipsawed the token’s price.      Over $1.5 billion worth of XRP futures contracts have been liquidated since the start of November, per data from analytics provider Bybt. Barely $700 million in liquidated futures contracts were recorded between March and October.      In November, the price of XRP skyrocketed over 220% to two-year highs just below $0.80 as traders anticipated a scheduled token airdrop event by the Flare Network to all XRP holders. In short, anyone holding XRP would automatically receive a portion of the new Spark token, spurring new buyers to accumulate XRP.      Adding fuel to the frenzy, leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced its plans to support the upcoming airdrop, per CoinDesk’s previous reporting.      “XRP experienced massive upward price movements in November due to retail investors' interest on the Spark airdrop scheduled for Dec. 12, 2020,” said Florent Moulin, a cryptocurrency researcher at data provider Messari. “The market also saw experienced investors accumulating XRP in anticipation of a retail-led bull market.”      The acute XRP bull trend quickly ended when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple for allegedly violating federal securities laws in selling the cryptocurrency to retail consumers, which raised $1.3 billion over a seven-year period.      Traders reacted negatively to the news as XRP instantly started giving back large chunks of its gains from the previous month. Institutional investors followed suit with cryptocurrency money manager Bitwise liquidating its index’s entire XRP position and prominent brokerages like OSL notifying clients it halted all XRP trading.      Both events – the airdrop and the lawsuit – have pushed XRP price volatility to its highest level since July 2018, per Coin Metrics data, with a more than 130% increase in volatility since early November.      Sharp downward price action for XRP is probably due to a combination of factors, Moulin told CoinDesk. But the most significant is likely the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple.      Also noteworthy is increased selling by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, who sold over $120 million worth of XRP in December, Moulin said, an amount over three times larger than previous months.      Some of December’s downward price movement was also caused by XRP holders selling after receiving tokens from the airdrop event, Moulin said.      Regardless of the reason, since news of the SEC’s lawsuit broke XRP has dropped over 60% and fallen below its pre-airdrop frenzy levels in early November, hitting $0.21 on Wednesday.      And with the price still dropping and over $350 million in futures contracts liquidated the two days before Christmas Eve, XRP investors are left to face a not-so-happy holiday season.",NEGATIVE,XRP,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP | AIRDROP,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/24/xrp-liquidations-soar-as-sec-lawsuit-token-airdrop-whipsaw-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b295cf858dd927cbc01271d27c029da22b967123-1011x626.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433455,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQunh,1608825625,The Global Challenge of Regulating Virtual Assets,"The convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrencies was more profound than ever this year. From the maturation of crypto-first digital commerce to MicroStrategy’s big bitcoin buy, it was a year of rampant technological adoption.      With the professionalization of the crypto industry came regulatory challenges. Evolving sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and peer-to-peer transfers introduced new problems. Though, in the main, despite high-level confusion both private and public sectors progressed in developing regulatory frameworks and solutions that will continue to affect the crypto industry for years.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Michael Ou is CEO of CoolBitX, an international blockchain security company, and creator of FATF Travel Rule solution Sygna Bridge.  FATF’s ‘Travel Rule’    One of the most important gauges of the maturation of the global crypto asset sector this year was the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) first review of its Recommendation 16, or “Travel Rule” guidance for the crypto asset industry in July.      After adopting it in June 2019, the FATF conducted a 12-month assessment of the regulatory progress made to address the Travel Rule by member nations and the private sector, in particular Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and technical solution providers. The rule requires VASPs, such as crypto exchanges or wallet providers, to collect the names of both transaction senders and receivers as well as the national IDs of the former.      See also: How One Firm Is Addressing the Interoperability Problem Posed by FATF’s ‘Travel Rule’      Noting that jurisdictions from all corners of the world map were close to or had implemented aligning regulations in July, the FATF noted progress and announced a second review in June 2021. Placing emphasis on emerging sectors such as stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC), the FATF made it clear that its second review of Travel Rule implementation was not a sign it would loosen its grip on the industry.      As innovation and emerging financial products in crypto such as DeFi – a challenge to effectively regulate due to their decentralized nature – continue to flood the market, the FATF seemed to have acknowledged the need to monitor and identify emerging risks. This will be something to look out for in its second review come July 2021.    Asia continues to lead the way in crypto adoption    In 2020, Asia continued to lead in cryptocurrency adoption and effective regulation.      Jurisdictions such as Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong have recognized the advantage of being a first mover in crypto regulations and have taken the Travel Rule into consideration when developing frameworks for regulation.      This year, we have seen the significance of Singapore’s progress as Asia’s financial hub with its regulatory developments in the crypto asset space. The city-state has even exceeded FATF Travel Rule requirements with the Payment Services Act (PSA) enacted this year, and has been lauded frequently as an example of comprehensive regulations that do not stifle the progress of the industry.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler – Inside the Osaka Conference Where Crypto Got Serious About FATF’s ‘Travel Rule’      As a result, the nation has attracted a large swathe of VASPs consisting of crypto exchanges such as Huobi, Binance and numerous other businesses. Leaked screenshots also showed that large banks and financial institutions such as DBS Bank have plans to launch digital asset exchanges, signaling the increasing appetite among traditional institutions in the region for digital assets and cryptocurrencies.      In North America, proposed modifications to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirement for financial institutions as well as VASPs to collect and retain information on funds transfers and transmittals of funds would lower the threshold from $3,000 to $250 for funds transfers. Though the results of the U.S. election were made clear by November, uncertainty remains as to the direction of the next administration, with neither candidate expressing a firm stance on the industry.      Meanwhile, the European Commission has proposed a new framework in the form of its Digital Finance Strategy to regulate cryptocurrencies. Uncertainties such as the ongoing Brexit agreement complicate the European landscape, given the U.K. market’s importance to Europe.      In Africa and Latin America – regions with the most pressing use cases for cryptocurrencies and digital assets – regulations have lagged behind as governments adopt a “wait and see” approach when it comes to crypto. South Africa is an exception, after publishing a draft declaration of crypto assets as a financial product.    Private-sector interoperability    As nations and jurisdictions made progress in crypto regulation to varying degrees, the private sector responded to the FATF guidance in a more unified way. On the technical solution side, we saw many working groups such as the Joint Working Group (JWG), made up of several Travel Rule solutions create and implement new data standards for information sharing such as InterVASP Messaging Standard, or IVMS101. Such standards speed up the progress of implementation and interoperability across solutions which will be welcome for VASPs, who will potentially engage with different solutions.      When it comes to meeting the requirements of the Travel Rule, the number of potential solutions in the market renders the necessity to adopt interoperable practices, and larger VASPs are likely to sign up to multiple providers.      With the FATF stressing in their July 2020 the need for interoperability across the private sector, the trend of corporation and partnerships across solutions and VASPs will be likely to continue going into the second term of FATF guidance.    Looking ahead    As COVID-19 took a hit on the global economy, with market downturns, lockdowns and reversing the progress of virtually every nation, the FATF conducted the first review of its Travel Rule guidance to regulators and the crypto industry revealing that full implementation was still on the horizon.      With the FATF’s second review in July 2021, we can expect to see some countries accelerate their efforts to implement aligning regulations, though it might be the case that full alignment might not be reached by this date. Nonetheless, as we expect the private sector to make more progress in implementing interoperable solutions that make for a better experience for VASPs, we can conversely expect VASPs to build out their AML strategies in anticipation of more regulatory scrutiny to come.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Michael Ou,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/24/the-global-challenge-of-regulating-virtual-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd915f695ae0de186517d13bfd48cd8c5e1f1716-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433441,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQuLh,1608824970,Japan Gearing Up to Launch Its Own Digital Currency: Report,"Japan is gearing up to launch a digital currency in both the public and private sectors as it trails China, which is in the trial stage of launching its own.    According to the Japan Times, the country's Digital Currency Forum aims to create “some form” of digital currency similar to Facebook’s diem plan, by 2023.  The group is preparing to conduct a feasibility study for its virtual currency in 2021.  “China has prompted moves toward digital currency (around the world),” Hiromi Yamaoka, a former Bank of Japan official, told the Japan Times.  China has done so at ""surprising speed"" while ""central banks tend to take a cautious stance,” added Yamaoka, who expects China to officially launch its digital yuan in 2022.  China has been accelerating its push toward the adoption of a digital currency as the People’s Bank of China works with banks and commercial entities on public pilots to gauge user experience.  In October the People’s Bank of China launched a pilot program that provided digital yuan to citizens selected by lottery in Shenzhen, and in Suzhou earlier this month.

42433459,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQuth,1608823917,"Coinbase, Other Big Exchanges 'Between Rock and a Hard Place' on Delisting XRP","What happens when a cryptocurrency once positioned as a regulator-friendly alternative to bitcoin gets heat from regulators? Exchanges that trade XRP are about to find out.      U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges have to consider whether to delist XRP in light of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit alleging it is an unregistered security issued by Ripple Labs to raise funds.      Chief among these exchanges is Coinbase, which, in addition to the normal considerations around listing XRP, is also seeking SEC approval to take its shares public and allow retail investors to trade them. If the SEC prevails in its lawsuit, XRP may be classified as a security, meaning under U.S. law entities offering it for trading must register as securities exchanges.      It’s also possible an SEC victory would destroy XRP’s value because the regulator wants to prevent Ripple from selling any more tokens, and for Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen to disgorge their profits, pay prejudgement interest and pay civil penalties.      While some exchanges, market makers and funds have already begun delisting XRP or exiting positions and transactions with the cryptocurrency, it may not be a black-and-white question for larger exchanges.      Anthony Tu-Sekine, a partner at law firm Seward & Kissel LLP, told CoinDesk that trading platforms like Coinbase “are between a rock and a hard place.”      “They can continue to list XRP based on their previous analysis that XRP is not a security, with the hope that a court will find that XRP is not a security,” he said. “Or they can take ‘remedial’ actions such as restricting trading for wallets held by U.S. persons, or take it off their exchange altogether.”      These scenarios are likely already covered by the exchanges’ terms of service policies, he said.      Exchanges like Coinbase would “be crazy not to consider” delisting, said Gabriel Shapiro, an attorney with Belcher, Smolen & Van Loo LLP. Considering the question isn’t the same as actually delisting – or not delisting – the cryptocurrency, however.      “They have to think – including just from a business perspective but also legal – what kind of precedent they’re setting,” he said. “If they delist one [cryptocurrency] just because a regulator accuses it of being a security, what happens the next time that happens? Have you just given the SEC the right to delist anything from your platform just because [it makes] an accusation?”      Delisting digital assets on that basis may not be great for the exchange’s customers, said Shapiro.      “It’s not an easy decision for [Coinbase] to just delist and, personally, if I were them I don’t think I would delist unless I had something more concrete to point to,” he said.      A Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment for this article.    What might happen    Coinbase in particular is in a unique position due to its impending initial public offering (IPO) or direct listing. It has already confidentiality filed its S-1, a form companies use to register their shares as securities. The SEC can provide feedback to the company about how it views potential risk factors or other aspects of its operations.      Last week, Shapiro told CoinDesk that this could include essentially forcing companies to take certain actions. While noting he does not believe the SEC would explicitly tell Coinbase to delist XRP, the agency could say that not delisting XRP might be a risk factor.      “You could say, ‘In your risk factors you haven't properly explained to your investors in your IPO how it is you’ve let XRP and others trade on Coinbase … You need to be really really clear about that … including that we might come after you Coinbase, because you’ve been warned,’” he said.      Coinbase could then decide to delist XRP based on this feedback, or if the compliance burden is too much it could even scrap its IPO ambitions.      What Coinbase cannot do is pretend ignorance of how the SEC views XRP, Tu-Sekine said. The agency’s position is clear.      The SEC appears confident about its chances, and has helpful precedents from its cases against Telegram and Kik, Shapiro said.      “I think we all suspected there’d be a strong case but I don’t think we realized the extent to which Ripple entered into market-making agreements,” he said of the allegations in the SEC’s complaint.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/24/coinbase-other-big-exchanges-between-rock-and-a-hard-place-on-delisting-xrp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1060b123fe2193d6d82c8487ec3c52ce925ef700-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stefan Qin, the 23-year-old founder of Virgil Capital, has been accused by the SEC of “fabricated records” for failing to redeem $3.5 million in investments and attempting to withdraw $1.7 million in investor funds to pay off Chinese loan sharks, the SEC said.  On Tuesday, the SEC applied to U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in the Southern District of New York for an emergency order to suspend $25 million in digital assets owned by another fund managed by Qin.  The SEC accuses Qin of fraud involving the Virgil Sigma Fund LP of New York and VQR Multistrategy Fund LP of the Cayman Islands.  The hedge fund manager is being accused of altering spreadsheet tracking investments at 39 cryptocurrency trading platforms in 2019.  Earlier this year Qin falsely informed investors looking to redeem $3.5 million investments from their funds that the money would be moved to the VQR Multistrategy Fund but the funds were not transferred, according to the SEC.  Qin also asked VQR head trader Antonio Hallak to assist with withdrawing $1.7 million from the fund, claiming he had borrowed money from Chinese loan sharks to invest in the Sigma fund, according to Reuters.  Qin, whom the SEC said is believed to be currently in South Korea, is prepared to cooperate with the SEC and is ""committed to ensuring that no investors are harmed,"" said his lawyers, Reuters said.  The SEC is seeking an order permanently restraining Qin from participating in the sale, issuance, purchase or offer of any security except on his personal account, a disgorgement of profits and civil penalties.

42433442,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQp9h,1608796800,Here Comes the Open Lending Era,"In 2020 we finally saw some of the nearly decade-long blockchain hype fulfilled and the legitimate building blocks of a next-generation banking system emerge.      Open finance, and specifically open lending, has exploded to well over $10 billion this year. This growth has catalyzed a new source of funding for market participants ranging from individuals to corporates to hedge funds. It has also created a new source of liquid “digital yield” for investors, corporates and savers starving for an alternative to the perpetual 0% offered in legacy systems.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Alex McDougall is co-founder and chief investment officer of Bicameral Ventures.    The open lending landscape is formed by decentralized and centralized platforms that pool fiat assets and lend them out against collateral posted as digital assets.      A hallmark of this space is extreme flexibility to lend and borrow at any term, in any currency, at any size, with any level of direct collateral, for any period of time (even on a block by block basis). This ability to customize at low scale opens up an entire “yield-as-service” or capital-as-a-service industry of bespoke solutions tailored for anyone looking for yield or flexible borrowing.      There is one burning question: Is this real? In 2020, the entire digital asset market took a meaningful step forward in maturity. As part of this ongoing evolution, institutional grade financial infrastructure needs to be developed. In 2020, through an influx of capital and talent, open lending stepped up its game and grew from a fringe use case to a burgeoning engine powering the next phase of the digital economy.    The fundamentals    Think about an open lending platform as a super simple, super transparent bank. Banks take in deposits, keep a tiny amount on hand for liquidity and lend the rest out in a complicated and opaque quest to find a spread.      Banks will undertake all sorts of strategies in the great quest for yield including derivatives and esoteric combinations of loan products. Depositors generally don’t think too hard about what the bank is up to with their capital given their deposits are mostly insured by the FDIC. Banks themselves don’t think too hard about it either as governments have proven extremely willing to bail them out if they get the math and modelling wrong.      Open lending, on the other hand, is built from the fundamentals of blockchain: transparent, open and in real time. At their core, open lending platforms are performing similar functions in that they are taking in funds from lenders, retaining a certain amount for liquidity (usually closer to 20%) and lending the rest out.      The key differences between open lending and traditional banking lending products:    Loans are generally collateralized between 100%-300% by liquid digital assets versus collateralized by illiquid or no assets at all.  The net interest margin is mostly transparent and passed on to the actual lender versus kept as profits by the bank.  The majority of transactions, balances and liquidity can be seen in real time on the blockchain versus reported months later on financial statement.    The comparison on its surface boils down to:    Traditional Banks: 0% return, tiny liquidity reserves with limited transparency, poor governance fundamentals and very closely guarded underwriting practices but balances are insured.  Open lending platforms: 8%-10% return, greater and transparent reserves, better governance fundamentals, simple underwriting practice founded on highly liquid collateral but balances are not insured.    Open lending may be relatively basic today, but at its best it offers the building blocks of an entirely re-shaped financial system built on transparent, liquid and open fundamentals.    Decentralized fundamentals    Within decentralized finance (DeFi) there are four key segments, open lending (~45% of the market), decentralized exchanges (~30%), derivatives (~10%) and the rest is miscellaneous. As is expected when you create platforms that are fully transparent, borderless and entirely automated, when you release them into the wild weird stuff happens, especially when these markets interact with each other.      Where there are no frictions and easily accessible short-term leverage, there is nowhere to hide bad code, bad logic or bad risk management. The majority of “hacks” that we’ve seen in the DeFi space have been, quite frankly, ingenious manipulations of this decentralized, automated logic to arbitrage gaps in either the internal logic of platforms or between rules of two or more automated platforms.      While this may sound intimidating, it is not meant to be. It means that suboptimal platforms fail almost immediately as hundreds of thousands of users try to poke and prod at their infrastructure for their own gain on a 24-hour cycle.    In 2020, the entire digital asset market took a meaningful step forward in maturity.    See also: DeFi Startup Brings Corporate Lending Terms to Miners, Traders and Market Makers      This is as compared to the “traditional” world where rules, regulations and frictions ensure safety, but also that often opportunities are only able to be exploited by those with the biggest accounts, fastest connection speeds or best relationships. This isn’t even touching the “too big to fail'' problem where governments have frequently bailed out banks that have proven to be poor stewards of capital and by doing so removed the majority of market discipline.      This has a very profound implication: If an open-sourced, transparent and decentralized finance protocol has a meaningful wall-clock time, it is very likely “fair.”      Fair establishes excellent fundamentals, but it doesn’t mean perfect. In the open lending space there are meaningful gaps in what the technology can enable in a true purely automated fashion. Key among the limitations of decentralized open lending platforms are:    Risk-based collateralization: In the DeFi world, your collateral is the platform’s underwriting. Anyone who shows up to Compound with $100 of ETH can borrow exactly $75 of USDC as calculated by the protocol, not a penny more or less. This is both wildly refreshing from an inclusion perspective but also inefficient and exclusive in its own way as it limits access to capital to only those who have collateral to post. There is enormous potential as we build tools that allow more discretion in autonomously underwriting specific borrower risks based on provable, on-chain risk factors.  Across-chain and off-chain integrations: No decentralized platform can currently allow me to borrow fiat against BTC collateral. I can borrow a U.S. dollar stablecoin against an Ethereum wrapped version of BTC (or soon native BTC) as a proxy. But every wrapper or abstraction layer adds risk and complexity and is never as functional as the underlying asset. There again is enormous value in mixing and matching what assets function as collateral and what assets I can remove from the platform against that collateral.  Direct posting of collateral: This is a nuanced point, but in on-chain lending pools lenders do not have a direct claim over any of the collateral posted by the borrowers. You have a claim to a certain amount of assets from within the pool but you are relying on the automated interest rate, margin call and liquidation mechanics to ensure that borrower risk is being managed and that there will be sufficient funds for you to withdraw when you need to. This is extremely efficient as all collateral is automatically rehypothecated (when deposit institutions re-lend or reuse customer collateral) and redeployed within the pools to fund loans and withdrawals leading to higher yields and lower borrow costs, but it is a very different paradigm than many institutional lenders are used to operating in.    See also: What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors    Best of both?    Into this decentralized functionality gap step the centralized open lending players. At their best, these players are taking the “fair” best practices from decentralized platforms of transparency and algorithmic risk management and leveraging their centralized authority to fill in the limitations outlined above.      At their worst, though, centralized lending platforms can recreate the worst pieces of our existing financial infrastructure by creating opaque, over-risky, relationship-based, unauditable systems that cannot withstand the stress of a volatile market. There are illuminating examples of every flavor ranging from the reassuring (BlockFI and other platforms having zero losses despite a ~55% reduction in collateral value in March) to the unnerving (Cred’s murky bankruptcy proceedings in November).      The best in the business follow a few best practices:    Algorithmic underwriting: All collateralization and underwriting methodologies should be as algorithmic and transparent as possible with clear data-driven risk ratings that do not have exceptions.  Transparent rehypothecation: Rehypothecation is the act of utilizing assets that are pledged as collateral either for re-lending or to fund withdrawals. All rehypothecation practices should be transparent, traceable and rigidly enforced (ideally with the borrower receiving direct interest credit for their collateral like on decentralized platforms).  Automated unhealthy loan procedures: Margin call and liquidation practices should be automated and without exceptions as digital assets never stop trading.  Automatic pool sizing mechanics: Utilization rates (i.e. the amount of borrowed funds that are lent onwards, effectively the reserve ratio) should be transparent, targeted and adhered to and interest rates changed algorithmically to ensure that the pool to fund withdrawals stays sufficient (ideally with interest rate algorithm being disclosed publicly as on decentralized platforms like Compound).  Transparent Pool Balances: Pool sizes should be visible on-chain and wallets should be disclosed to leading Block Explorers to allow real-time external auditing, although it is acknowledged that privacy of individual lenders and borrowers does need to be considered. Celsius’ recent partnership with Horizen to explore zero-knowledge proof of reserves is an evolution in this vein.  Isolation of risk: Funds loaned into the pool should avoid being commingled with funds for other pieces of the business. Further, the terms and conditions or master loan agreement should specifically state that all lent funds will be used for pooled lending purposes.    See also: NLW – Why Bitcoin and Rehypothecation Don’t Mix    Where do we stand?    There are several key factors that need to be understood to properly evaluate centralized platforms:    Rehypothecation is frequent and necessary    Given the high liquidity and high fungibility of the collateral posted, rehypothecation is somewhat more straightforward than in the more-bespoke, less-liquid collateral scenarios seen in traditional prime brokerage situations. Also given the extreme overcollateralization prevalent in the industry, rehypothecation is a critical piece of the business model and necessary to maximize returns, minimize borrow cost and maintain the “open term” liquidity of the platforms.    Collateral practices do vary by platform and by borrower    Most platforms have an institutional desk that will have a more flexible collateralization policy than the two to three times overcollateralization that is the industry standard. This is because the institutional desk is doing additional diligence and risk rating these borrowers. In a vacuum there is nothing wrong with this, but it does enhance the counterparty risk given it is additional, non-transparent discretion given to the platform operator and these practices need to be well understood.    Characterization of relationship is not consistent    The relationship between a “lender” and the centralized company running the lending pool can either be terms of service based more akin to a technology platform, or master loan agreement based and more akin to a traditional financial instrument. There are important distinctions between the two, and properly characterizing your relationship with the party governing the platform is critical to proper evaluation of risk.    There is fluctuating willingness to post collateral directly to a lender.    There is willingness by centralized platforms to post collateral from the pool directly in the name of the borrower in exchange for a reduction on yield. This yield spread is a function of what the collateral is and the opportunity cost of that asset within the platform and varies by platform. However, there are certain platforms that, as a rule, do not post collateral and maintain it exclusively within the pool. As a rule of thumb, it generally costs between 2%-6% to fully collateralize a stablecoin loan with BTC collateral.      See also: Haseeb Qureshi – The DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack That Changed Everything    Maturing market    In all, our takeaway from the open lending industry is that in 2020 it started growing up. There is a ton of work to do on transparency, messaging and optimizing risk controls, but there is legitimate business activity happening in this open lending space.      From trading, to hedging, to working capital, to treasury, tax and capital call management there are serious teams running serious operations, particularly at the institutional grade lending platforms. Decentralized platforms have shown the way and created “counterparty risk free” lending pools with total transparency, now it’s time for their centralized counterparts to leverage these fundamentals and continue picking up the slack to create the institutional grade money market industry and new generation banks we all need. To be clear, it’s happening, and rapidly.      The building blocks of the next generation of financial services are in view. With careful, thoughtful analysis of the right factors and with careful diversification across technology and counterparty, forward thinking investors and borrowers can meaningfully improve their bottom line and risk-adjusted returns without sacrificing liquidity in a way completely inaccessible to those not willing to lift up the hood and dig in.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Alex McDougall,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/24/here-comes-the-open-lending-era,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5568ff2ddbe93a17f75ad14fcb5743f9409dd34-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
