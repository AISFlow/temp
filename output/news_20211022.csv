13222326,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=474422,1634943654,"Analyst Puts Bitcoin Bottom At $50,000, Here’s Why","With bitcoin rallying, all the focus has been on predicting where the price of the asset will be by the end of the year. The digital asset is undoubtedly going to enter a period where various crashes will send the price down, popularly known as a bear market. Not a lot of attention has been paid to where the price of the asset might bottom out when the market inevitably goes into another bear market. This usually long stretch of low momentum has seen bitcoin lose 94%, 87%, and 84% of its peak value respectively in the last three bear markets. One recurring theme of the bear markets has been the diminishing percentages of total value lost. At this rate, it is expected that BTC will see between 75% and 80% loss from its peak this cycle. Market analyst Justin Bennett uses this to predict where BTC will bottom out next. The Next Bitcoin Bottom Bennett put the next bitcoin bottom at $50,000 after analyzing the possible price movements of the digital asset. With the current cycle, the analyst sees the price of bitcoin hitting $200,000 before the bull run is over, hence a 75% to 80% pullback in a bear market will see the bottom of the asset land around the $50,000 range.

42421025,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHUT,1634938810,"After ‘Stealing’ $16M, This Teen Hacker Seems Intent on Testing ‘Code Is Law’ in the Courts","Some $16 million in cryptocurrency was pilfered in an exploit of a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol last week, and the victims believe they know exactly who did it.  Despite threats from the team, however, the alleged attacker – a Canadian teenaged graduate student – is refusing to return the funds, potentially setting the stage for a groundbreaking legal confrontation.  On one side of the conflict is a child math prodigy and an outspoken champion of DeFi’s self-regulating “code is law” ethos. On the other, a pair of DeFi developers and their advisers who felt forced to make an unprecedented series of troubling ethical choices on behalf of a DAO community.  At stake in the fight are a number of thorny issues that have so far been successfully obscured by DeFi’s explosive growth: What is the role of law enforcement in an unregulated $220 billion sector? When, if at all, should the gendarmes be summoned? And, most importantly, is the notion of “code is law” sufficient to grapple with all of DeFi’s ethical complexities?  First breach  On Oct. 14, the official Twitter account for Indexed, a DAO-governed DeFi protocol, reported an error with two of its index fund-style automatically rebalancing liquidity pools, one that had drained nearly half of Indexed’s $34 million in total value locked.  An analysis from exploit-focused publication Rekt shows the error was in fact an attack launched from an Ethereum address funded by privacy mixer Tornado Cash. From that address, an attacker used flash loans to knock the balance of the pools out of kilter and buy out component assets at a heavily discounted rate.  In the days since, the Indexed team and an ad-hoc “war room” of industry experts convened to mitigate the damage and gather information. And in the course of their investigation they believe they have found the attacker’s real-world identity: It’s an 18-year-old mathematics prodigy who goes by “Andy.”  Both the Indexed core team and DeFi community members who claim to have spoken with Andy say that he has refused to return the funds, and that he intends to face any criminal charges resulting from his exploit in court – arguing that he simply executed a fully legal arbitrage trade.  A tweet thread from an account claiming to belong to Andy thanked well-wishers for their comments over the past week and asked for lawyer recommendations on Thursday. Likewise, in an email exchange with CoinDesk, Andy did not confirm he had conducted the attack, but did say that he was seeking legal counsel. (Andy has since stopped returning CoinDesk’s emails, though other attempts have been made to contact him.)  If the case does go before a judge, it could be a test of “code is law” – a popular phrase in DeFi circles referring to a common mindset. In the absence of regulation, the thinking goes, the DeFi ecosystem is purely adversarial and anything permissible by code is also by nature ethically permissable. Where one man might see an exploit, another may just see “crypto trading.”  A number of legal experts who spoke to CoinDesk dismissed this notion, however, and said that while a case might be complex and perhaps novel, a court will not necessarily cede to DeFi’s unofficial ethos.  ‘War room’  Shortly after the attack was discovered, the core Indexed team found a number of clues leading them to believe that they had identified the hacker: a young developer who had been speaking with team member Laurence Day for months.  “It was perfectly affable, friendly, smiles, lots of emojis. A perfectly normal dude,” Day said of Andy in an interview with CoinDesk.  While Day did not write the code for the protocol, he maintains it and, as a result, “understands it pretty deeply.”  “I don’t feel like I got catfished or something because I was discussing information that was publicly available, but this did take me by surprise,” Day added.  Once they had a suspect, the team assembled its online “war room.” Members included Curve contributor Julien Bouteloup, Rotki founder Lefteris Karapetsas and pseudonymous Yearn.Finance core contributor “Banteg,” among others.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Banteg said the decision to join the war room was an easy one.  “I don’t turn these invitations down because I know how it feels when you find yourself in a situation like this, and I believe I can provide meaningful support and the needed outside perspective to help handle it gracefully and avoid stupid mistakes caused by stress no human should endure alone,” Banteg said.  Ethical debate  Once the team had information on the attacker, they decided to issue an ultimatum: Return the funds or be reported to law enforcement authorities.  In the past, threats of doxxing have proven to be effective. Following a $3 million exploit of a non-fungible token (NFT) drop in September, developers successfully intimidated the attacker into returning the stolen funds after, among other negotiation tactics, ordering miso soup to the attacker’s house.  Read more: $3M Was Stolen, but the Real Steal Is These Kia Sedonas, Say Anonymous Developers  Actually following through with the threat is perhaps novel, however, and the decision prompted significant internal debate among the team.  According to core Indexed contributor Dillon Kellar, the nature of Indexed’s DAO structure played heavily into the team’s thinking.  “Once he made it clear that he’s not gonna give up, that he doesn’t care we’ve found this damning evidence on him, at that point we had a difficult decision because if we just go to law enforcement, if we keep that information to ourselves, we’re effectively taking ownership of the situation ourselves, and we couldn’t do that,” Kellar said.  Other DAO members may wish to individually or collectively pursue remuneration in civil court, and if core team members withheld Andy’s personal information, it could prevent them from doing so – ultimately prompting a moral argument in favor of doxxing.  “We’re not comfortable with the idea of publicly doxxing, but Indexed is not a legal entity – it’s a DAO. And Dillon and I don’t have the right to solely own this information, or to take ownership of the legal battle. This is a cornered response,” said Day.  Banteg likewise expressed discomfort with the decision, but backed going forward with it.  “It’s unprecedented. Ethics-wise, as you can imagine, all this feels quite uneasy. I believe Indexed gave the hacker more than enough ways out, but he thinks he’s invincible.”  In the end, the war room had a full consensus.  “There’s no one in the room that’s given serious pushback to the route that’s been taken. We know we’ve done everything we can,” said Day. “I don’t care for the edgelords and the frogs. Anyone who has something valuable to say on this is with us.”  Child prodigy  However, as the team’s deadline passed with no word from Andy, Banteg made a surprise discovery: The attacker isn’t just “immensely talented” – at just 18 years old, he’s a teenage genius.  According to a cached version of his now-defunct personal website, Andy will soon complete his master’s degree in applied mathematics from the University of Waterloo in Ontario (also Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s alma mater); he has authored papers on smooth Schubert varieties and Riemann spheres, among other complex subjects; and according to a 2016 article from Canada’s Globe and Mail, he completed high-school math at just 13 years old.  His online presence also indicates a vainglorious streak. On a Wikipedia forum in 2016, Andy referred to himself as an “expert in mathematics and theoretical physics.” He even entered himself in a game show wiki as a “notable mathematician.”  The claim is now a “dark joke” in the Indexed war room, Day said: He’s become exactly that, though not for his scholarship.  “I guess he out-manifested all of us,” Day added.  Paternal concerns  This discovery presented the war room with yet another ethical conundrum, as many felt that reporting a teenager carried additional weight. The new information prevented them from “dropping the hammer” immediately, as Kellar put it.  “I taught computer science and I never had someone quite of Andy’s level, but I know the type. When you’re this particular type of person – look, 18 is a man in the eyes of the law, but mentally you’re still a child,” said Day. “I don’t know if that comes off as denigrating to him or whether I’m sounding excessively sympathetic, but I think this is a case of vast, vast skill at the expense of almost everything else.”  Likewise, Jason Gottlieb of U.S. law firm Morrison Cohen framed the situation in paternalistic terms. Gottlieb was retained by Day and Kellar to represent Indexed in reporting the crimes to law enforcement.  “I think the fact that he is only 18 is something that could be some cause for empathy. I have a son who is close to that age, so from a dad’s viewpoint I have some empathy, knowing that teenagers can do stupid things. I know I did stupid things as a teenager,” said Gottlieb.  However, the new information led the team to new leads, including the discovery that Andy had allegedly been frequenting extremist circles online. During the investigation the team found he was part of a data leak from a web service hosting alt-right communities.  There are also a host of other clues suggesting hateful ideologies: the calldata for Andy’s attack included a racial slur; the attacking Ethereum address starts with “BA5Ed1488,” a numerological reference to a neo-Nazi slogan; a bizarre tweet thread from ZetaZero included bracketing certain words in triple brackets, a popular anti-Semitic dog whistle.  Additionally, the ZetaZero account recently retweeted a post referring to Andy as “the Dylan Roof of Balancer pools,” a reference to a white supremacist terrorist who killed nine black churchgoers in 2015.  While members of the war room said they could not identify a particular moment where they made the firm decision to release Andy’s information despite his age, the ties to extremism played into their thinking.  “The frustrating thing is, until he had made all these ugly parts of himself known – the white supremacy, the anti-Semitism, the general, unbearable dickish nature of him – if he had returned 90% and kept a bounty, we would have at least asked him to audit code. And had he disclosed this stuff with us, we would have given him $50K to $100K and had him join the team in a heartbeat,” said Day.  Kellar also said that age alone could not distract from the gravity of Andy’s actions.  “For a regular 18-year-old, I would have concerns about releasing his information. And it’s not to say I still don’t, but the fact is he’s a very advanced 18-year-old. He has a master’s degree. He finished high school at 13. And he has taken the action of stealing $16 million. And if he’s going to be adult enough to do those things, he’s adult enough to face the legal consequences,” said Kellar.  Codeslaw  In the eyes of some members of the DeFi community, however, Andy didn’t steal anything at all.  A popular rallying cry for many DeFi die-hards is “code is law,” often derisively referred to as “codeslaw.” This view, perhaps best elucidated in an essay by pseudonymous e-Girl Capital intern “Odette,” holds that there is no such thing as a “hack” or a “rug pull” in DeFi, and that it’s the responsibility of each actor to thoroughly vet all on-chain actions – if you lose money to a hack or a faulty contract, it’s on you.  Because all information is freely available on-chain and actions on-chain are immutable, DeFi is ultimately then a self-contained and deterministic environment operating outside of normal regulatory and ethical parameters, or so the thinking goes.  Day worries that a faction of the DeFi community who believes in code is law is now egging Andy on.  “I think he’s listening to a legion of frogs. They’re calling him based, and asking him for money, and hailing him as a hero,” he said.  Admirers flocking to successful hackers isn’t unusual. In the wake of the $613 million Poly Network hack, panhandlers and admirers used messages on the Ethereum network to cheer the culprit on.  Social consensus  However, in practice, the notion of “code is law” may have already been disproven.  “Frankly, it’s tiring,” Lefteris Karapetsas told CoinDesk. “We had this fight five years ago.”  Back in 2016, Karapetsas was the technical lead for Slock.it, a startup that spearheaded The DAO – a notorious early investment experiment whose failure led to a chain split that led to the creation of Ethereum Classic.  “The ‘code is law’ version of Ethereum was born out of that. It’s called ETC and it still exists. The coleslaw proponents can just go play there,” Karapetsas said.  The current, canonical Ethereum chain is the result of the community reaching social consensus to effectively “undo” The DAO hack rather than let code be fully deterministic – and that’s a good thing, according to Karapetsas.  Read more: The DAO Hack Is Still a Mystery  “No builder in this space in their right mind believes that code is law. It’s just a meme that is perpetuated by anon on-lookers who just like to see chaos unfold,” he said.  He added that if the community were to embrace such principles, the end result would quickly turn dystopian.  “If code was law then this field would just be a playground for hackers who will be continuously trying to steal funds out of protocols. They would be eponymous and idolized. While the users would be blamed for ‘not reading the code well enough.’ Which is essentially what every coleslaw proponent says,” he said.  Legal wrinkles  The question now turns to whether “code is law” will hold up in a court of law.  Gottlieb confirmed to CoinDesk that he has turned over all relevant information to multiple law enforcement agencies, but declined to specify which ones.  While it’s an open question as to if those agencies will have the technical expertise to analyze the case and issue an arrest warrant, Gottlieb suggested they’re further along than some DeFi-natives might think.  “I wouldn’t assume that the authorities are not familiar with these sorts of things,” he said. “I’ve already reached out to contacts that I have in various agencies in law enforcement, and there are folks in law enforcement who deal with cryptocurrency hacks and thefts.”  Gottlieb noted that the individuals he’s spoken to are “very sophisticated” in their understanding of the space and that they are “interested” in the case.  Regardless of whether he’s arrested, Andy may also have grounds to file counter-charges.  Matt Burgoyne, a securities and crypto lawyer at Canadian firm McLeod Law LLP, said that even before the case gets before a judge there could already be complications. Burgoyne told CoinDesk he is not representing Andy.  “Doxxing can be illegal in Canada and the extent of legal consequences depends on the circumstances. Doxxing can give rise to charges of criminal harassment, invasion of privacy and stalking. I don’t believe this will go to court and if it did, I’m sure there would be damages on both sides,” he said.  Erich Dylus, a legal engineer for the oracle network API3, voiced personal discomfort with doxxing and also said it may lead to counter-charges.  “I think public doxxing can be extremely dangerous and often leads to undesirable misplaced vigilantism or trial by public opinion. Not to mention potentially opening avenues of liability for the doxxers,” he said.  In a tweet on Thursday, Kellar said Andy and his family have been receiving threats, and called on the community cease with the abuse and to pursue other “legal remedies.”  Stealing from the collection plate  Once these grievances have been parsed, however, the question then turns to whether a court can grapple with the complexity of weighted automated market makers (AMM), flash loans and so-called “economic exploits.”  Geoff Costeloe, an associate at Canadian firm Lindsey MacCarthy LLP and LexDAO member, said that Indexed’s DAO structure could lead to hiccups.  “I’m going to be following the recovery side of the matter,” he said. “Because Indexed is a decentralized DAO, I am curious to see how they file their claim and how they describe their relation to the protocol and other DAO members. Will they say it is a partnership or a corporation? Or will they say they are individuals?”  Gottlieb, the Indexed lawyer, brushed these concerns aside. He compared the exploit to a church congregation which had raised funds for some cause: if stolen, it’s no less of a crime just because it would be difficult to track precisely who owned what at a specific time.  Pure delusion  Of the half-dozen lawyers CoinDesk spoke to, all agreed that while the potential case may seem as if it will set a number of precedents at first blush, the reality is that a court will likely evaluate the exploit in simple terms.  Crypto attorney Stephen Palley warned that if the case does make it to court, it could be a moment that definitively ends DeFi’s fanciful notions of self-regulation.  “It’s the height of stupidity to say ‘code is law’ in this situation. It’s a magical incantation that means nothing,” the Anderson Kill lawyer told CoinDesk.  “There’s nothing terribly new here,” he added. “Old wine, new bottles; self-serving human greed. Is robbing a bank an ‘economic exploit?’ Saying that is frigging stupid. There’s nothing about this, if handled properly, that is groundbreaking precedent.”  Multiple lawyers and Indexed core team members pointed in particular towards signs of Andy’s intent that might erode his defense.  “This wasn’t some case where there was a contract that just had a simple mistake, what some people are calling an economic exploit,” said Kellar, the Indexed core team member. “He didn’t pull a lever that spit out too many coins, it was a sophisticated attack that exploited a very specific vulnerability that nobody found for a year.””  A sequence of actions leading into the attack will undermine any attempt by Andy to frame the exploit as a “happy accident,” Kellar added.  “If a [bank] teller or system makes an error and someone gets unjustly enriched, that certainly doesn’t impose criminal sanctions on the individual who received a boon,” said Costeloe, the MacCarthy LLP lawyer. “They may have been unjustly enriched but they were also innocently enriched, with no intention on their part. The situation with Indexed is a bit different than that because the hacker wrote code and attacked the protocol in a way that shows clear intent to enrich him or herself.”  In the end, multiple lawyers dismissed the “code is law” argument, referring to it as “delusion” and holding it as “delusional.”  Grim determination  On Thursday morning, Andy’s alleged ZetaZero Twitter account posted a short thread in which he framed the forthcoming legal battle as a “duel.”  Despite the seeming inertia tilting towards a legal confrontation, both Gottlieb and Palley noted that if Andy were to return the funds there’s a chance the incident might not have to be litigated.  Palley said that returning the funds “doesn’t undo the crime,” but it could lead a prosecutor to decline to pursue charges.  The core Indexed team, however, has reached a point of “grim determination,” according to Day.  “I’ve had the time to process all of this now, and there’s going to me a maelstrom that kicks up on Twitter, but on the balance of things I know this was the right thing to do. Dillon [Kellar] and I will be pariahs in parts of the space now, but it was the right thing to do,” he said of doxxing Andy.  Kellar made it clear that they’re also viewing court as an increasingly likely outcome.  “Some people have said he might move to Venezuela or some place without extradition – I don’t think that will happen. It really seems like he wants this to be a precedent-building case, so if he doesn’t returns the funds I expect this to go to court,” said Kellar.  “He’s trying to stamp his name in history, and he’s going to get it, but ruinously so,” said Day. “It’s a little bit heartbreaking. A colossal waste of talent, time and money. And for what? I just want to say to him, ‘God damn it, Andy, why have you made us do this?’”",NEGATIVE,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | REGULATION | FORKS,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/22/after-stealing-16m-this-teen-hacker-seems-intent-on-testing-code-is-law-in-the-courts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c49d63f371a7e50e273774a3e0df64c747a8c12-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It could enable banks to have digital currencies as assets for trading.  The determination, which was never made public, counters the aggressively anti-crypto stance of the former President, who in a June interview with Fox Business said that bitcoin seemed “like a scam.”  Three weeks after the 2020 Presidential election, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong even took to Twitter to blast rumored plans by the U.S. Treasury Department to attempt to track owners of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets with an onerous set of data-collection requirements.

42375953,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDGHX,1634934628,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Retreats From All-Time High; Ether Outperforms,"Bitcoin’s price continued to decline on Friday, ending the week down about 2% compared to a 1.7% gain in the ether cryptocurrency. Some traders who went long on BTC ahead of the launch of ProShares’ futures-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week appear to be taking profits.  Still, some investors expect pullbacks to remain limited for the remainder of the year. And one firm mentioned that alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether could see further upside relative to bitcoin.  “We remain optimistic but are cautious about downside risk,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement. The firm noted that leverage levels are high in the bitcoin futures market, which typically precedes a price pullback. QCP also expects ether to outperform bitcoin in the near term.  Valkyrie Investments’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF, another futures-focused product, went live on the Nasdaq under the ticker BTF on Friday. The ETF’s share price tracked bitcoin lower during its first day of trading, down about 4% and closing at $24.30.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $60,815, -3.0%  Ether (ETH): $3,974, -2.4%  S&P 500: $4,544, -0.11%  Gold: $1,793, +0.62%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.65%  BITO pushes limits on CME Group  The amount of money locked in the CME-based futures contracts has tripled this month, with more than $1.5 billion flowing into the market after the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE: BITO) went live on Tuesday, reported CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  However, BITO could be exposed to a significant tracking error, or the difference between bitcoin’s performance and actual returns from the fund.  This is because the CME allows a single entity to own a maximum of 2,000 contracts in the front-month futures while capping the overall positions across different maturities at 5,000 contracts. BITO appears to be close to hitting the limit in the October expiry and may continue to snap up longer duration futures, according to Godbole.  Ether gaining ground relative to bitcoin  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, slipped below the $4,000 price level on Friday. Similar to bitcoin, technical indicators show ether is at its most overbought point since September, which preceded a sharp price pullback. This time, however, ETH’s pullback could be limited to around the $3,700 support level.  The ETH/BTC ratio stabilized over the past week, suggesting that traders are beginning to rotate out of BTC and into ETH. The ratio held support around 0.06 and could face short-term resistance around 0.07 and 0.08.  Altcoin roundup  ETH second in Coinbase exchange trading volumes. Last week, ETH landed the second spot in terms of trading volume on the Coinbase exchange. “The ETH buy ratio has picked up, suggesting a bounce in ETH/BTC might be in the making,” Coinbase wrote in a Friday newsletter. Elsewhere, some layer one protocols maintained their relatively lackluster volumes.  Current taps Bison Trails to support Polkadot DeFi plans: Fintech company Current is working with Bison Trails, a blockchain infrastructure that was acquired by Coinbase in January, to sync up with Polkadot parachain networks Karura and Acala in an effort to bring DeFi services to its three million users, CoinDesk’s Eli Tan reported. The company has partnered with Ripple and Ethereum before but neither came to fruition due to technical limitations, the company said.  Ripple CEO says the SEC helped ether overtake XPR as no. 2 crypto: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says ether was able to surpass XRP as the second-most popular crypto by market cap because it had been granted a regulatory green light and received favorable treatment by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Cointelegraph reported. The SEC has been pursuing Ripple over claims that its associated XRP currency is an unregistered security. The SEC does not consider bitcoin or ether to be securities.

42421707,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDJN,1634923780,The US Needs a Dedicated Crypto Regulator,"The crypto regulatory situation in the U.S. is sad. Not because the Securities and Exchange Commission or Department of the Treasury keep proposing new, unpopular rules but because there is a lack of depth and insights into most of the positions and intended actions coming out of U.S. regulatory agencies.  What we have today is hastily concocted and coordinated decisions from various departments that have all been reactive and not proactive. Most of these end up delivering superficial, rushed, harmful, reactive or incomplete policies, not always aligned with helping the industry grow, but often obsessed with preserving the status quo.  William Mougayar, a CoinDesk columnist, is executive chairman at the Kin Foundation. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  Here’s how the mess is created, as each regulator takes a narrow issue and makes it their sole priority.  The Department of the Treasury is mostly worried about crypto tax evasion.  The Federal Reserve is scared about the impact of stablecoins.  The SEC sees everything from a security/non-security vantage point.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) looks at these instruments as commodities. It has progressive ideas but those aren’t always in lockstep with the SEC.  The Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is generally focused on anti-money laundering.  The Department of Justice is targeting know-your customer (KYC) and catching crooks who target crypto ransomware.  These regulators are acting based on what they see from where they sit. They all want to force-fit crypto into their own models as if there was nothing different here. In reality, no one has the full picture! And not one of the current regulators is displaying a genuine understanding of where the industry is headed.  Sadly, we are where we are because none of these existing regulatory bodies have exhibited a deep enough sophistication to get them to implement the right regulation.  They saw crypto as a distraction, not something to study. Now they’re cramming. And by that, I mean, cramming crypto into their current regulatory models – unable to admit that novel technology calls for novel solutions.  The U.S. Congress doesn’t do well passing laws in new areas when they have not been properly researched and crafted. Take the hastily inserted clauses targeting crypto in the bipartisan infrastructure bill or the initial attempt to limit stablecoin issuance rules. Both the House of Representatives and Senate have been on the receiving end of telegraphed policies or viewpoints, and not from a lack of trying. More than 18 bills have been put forth in 2021 by the Congress, each one claiming to be more comprehensive than the next.  Enough of that.     We don’t need 18 bills and six departments fumbling their way into crypto regulation. How about one single entity with a full-time responsibility for this agenda, not half a dozen others with part-time dedication and short-term attention?  The only way to be innovative is to have an expert regulator drive new regulations across the several other mosaics of regulators. The only hope for birthing the right type of regulation is to have someone who is fully dedicated to crypto.  For example, this could start in the form of a special-purpose task force commissioned by the White House, or by creating a temporary agency that could obsolete itself after two to three years of strategy, planning, coordination and thought leadership work in the field of crypto regulation.  The job would involve making the other existing agencies more coordinated, knowledgeable and careful about what they propose. And it would have a holistic approach that takes into account the full spectrum of how cryptocurrency and the blockchain are impacting the U.S. market.  The field of crypto is full of minutia, details and nuances that only a dedicated entity will discern. In the corporate world, it is common practice to create a dedicated team of people when a new field emerges. There is a need to create real experts who can spread their wisdom into other parts of the organization, rather than having disparate groups struggle on their own to master a topic when it has not been on their full-time radar.  The U.S. regulatory landscape is already specialized, but that’s after years of regulatory experience and maturity. Now, if U.S. regulatory entities took it upon themselves to deal with the parts that touched them, crypto would die by a thousand cuts. They will mix the good with the bad, and they will throw the baby out with the bathwater more than once.  We are already seeing this lack of good chemistry exhibit itself as regulatory agencies and government departments continue to produce un-coordinated, piecemeal approaches, while Congress receives bill after bill and struggles to make sense out of them. Regulatory fatigue is setting in.  In contrast, take Switzerland or Singapore. Because they are smaller jurisdictions, they can more accurately wrap their heads around their target areas. In the U.S., there is no single entity that can be the driving locomotive for all other regulators, even if the SEC is believed to be that one.  See also: Coinbase Proposes US Create New Regulator to Oversee Crypto  In an ideal world, innovation precedes regulation. Initially, innovation is allowed to circumvent or avoid regulatory scrutiny. Then, regulation comes in to provide clarity, formalize rules or provide specific guidance that allows many parts of the technology to thrive. The internet was allowed to flourish during the mid-1990s when U.S. policy was driven by a strong White House special adviser, Ira Magaziner, who acted as the internet and e-commerce czar and dictated policy strategy after he deeply studied the topic. As a result, the U.S. became the undisputed early leader in this field.  In contrast, currently U.S. regulators are coming to crypto with the aim to dial back on the innovation and not to set it on the right track. Ultimately, it’s the entrepreneurs who create all the value, and they should be the ones to empower in order to secure U.S. global leadership in this sector. Otherwise, the innovation drain and non-U.S. based activities will continue to grow elsewhere. Not only does this hurt entrepreneurship, but it also prevents millions of consumers from benefiting from wealth creation opportunities around cryptocurrencies.  Will history repeat itself? Will Americans do the right thing after they have exhausted every other possibility? Now is the time to break the existing pattern of crypto regulation by Whack-a-Mole. Now is the time to jump into a new paradigm of holistic, expert and more-sensical regulation.

42376291,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4RL,1634922393,Why US Policymakers Should Embrace Web 3,"In 1997, the Clinton Administration published the groundbreaking “Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,” which set forth five key principles:  Governments should recognize the unique qualities of the internet.  The private sector should lead.  Governments should avoid undue restrictions on electronic commerce.  Where governmental involvement is needed, its aim should be to support and enforce a predictable, minimalist, consistent and simple legal environment for commerce.  Electronic commerce on the internet should be facilitated on a global basis.  In the ensuing decades, the internet transformed our economic and social interactions in ways that have profoundly changed society – for better and worse. Today, we stand at a similar moment for the next generation of the internet, and it’s time for a new set of principles that incorporate lessons learned over the past 25 years.  Tomicah Tillemann is global head of policy for crypto and James Rathmell under him at a16z. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  Policymakers are finally taking a long overdue interest in Web 3. But the conversation is overwhelmingly about what policymakers don’t want from technology: fraud, illicit use, unsustainable energy consumption, systemic risk. We believe it’s time to establish an affirmative vision of what we do want from technology. Open societies need a North Star to guide our efforts and innovation.  Web 3 is the most credible alternative for reshaping and redeeming institutions that have fallen short over the last few decades. The list includes Big Tech, Wall Street banks and broken public assistance platforms that have failed to quickly and efficiently deliver needed help to Americans in times of crisis.  Big tech has been embroiled in an unending series of controversies over the past decade, ranging from poor stewardship of consumer data and privacy breaches to disinformation and algorithmic bias. But these platforms are now being disrupted and disintermediated by Web 3. For instance, decentralization has opened up the possibility of a world in which people can own their data and grant applications permission to use it on a limited basis, rather than having that data littered across hundreds of centralized databases.  See also: Crypto Is Too Big for Partisan Politics | Kristin Smith  Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another area that holds great potential. If fintech platforms like mobile payments revolutionized the frontend of finance, we can think of DeFi as revolutionizing the backend – laying new pipes and rails that are easier and more efficient to access, audit and upgrade.  This new generation of digital infrastructure could help realize goals that have long eluded policymakers, such as expanding access to consumer finance products, reducing the cost of capital, enabling capital formation for small businesses worldwide and improving compliance through easy, instantaneous auditability. Policymakers will still need to develop thoughtful regulatory frameworks in this space that protect consumers from bad actors and ensure the stability and integrity of our financial system. However, if we are judicious in how we incubate these tools, we can usher in a new renaissance of economic opportunity.  Web 3 also holds tremendous promise for government itself. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led the federal government to make a major investment in Americans who were struggling to make ends meet. The proposals now being considered in Congress would bring even more aid to working families across the country. Yet, our antiquated financial systems leave far too many people waiting weeks or months for help to arrive in moments of desperation, and then even longer for checks to clear.  At the same time, existing systems have proven shockingly vulnerable to exploitation by foreign organized crime rings, which stole tens of billions of dollars from taxpayers by exploiting weaknesses in our increasingly decrepit financial architecture. Tools like stablecoins and digital identity – if embraced by Washington – can enable more efficient distribution of aid to working families and protect our systems from exploitation by foreign criminals.  Decentralization is more than a buzzword. It puts power and control back in the hands of consumers and individuals. Web 3 systems can be more inclusive, more equitable and more resilient. Simply put, they’re a dramatically better alternative to a broken digital status quo.  Technological innovation is often necessary to unlock social change and economic growth, but it is certainly not sufficient. Without a well-conceived public policy framework that recognizes the wide diversity of the Web 3 ecosystem, we may never realize the benefits of decentralized digital transformation.  Failure to get this right would mean two things:  First, other countries – potentially countries with values contrary to our own – would set the standards that define the next generation of global technology.  Second, we will miss what may be our only opportunity to apply the lessons learned from the failures of Big Tech, Wall Street and broken institutions, to implement a new vision for the role we want our technology and our institutions to play in people’s lives.  See also: DeFi Is Like Nothing Regulators Have Seen Before. How Should They Tackle It?  The growth of Web 3 has been driven by entrepreneurs who grew up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and want to improve on the systems of the past. And consumers are actively participating as well: we already see almost one in six Americans under the age of 35 years old investing in crypto, with strong engagement especially among Black and Hispanic Americans. These technologies are addressing a deep demand for solutions in communities that have not always been well-served by traditional finance.  Since its founding, the United States has been home to innovation, imagination and independent thinking. The success of the country has been anchored in philosophy and practice of decentralization – a belief that many independent actors could create a whole that was more than the sum of its parts, and deliver outcomes that were better than what could be achieved by concentrating power in the hands of the few. Web 3 can bring us back to those core values and revive their attendant inheritance of progress, opportunity and inclusion.

42421712,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDMT,1634920690,Is ‘DeFi Regulation’ an Oxymoron?,"We’re nearing the end of “Policy Week” here at CoinDesk, which I’ve spent focused on the particularly thorny issues of regulating decentralized finance (DeFi). The technology, which removes intermediaries like banks and exchanges from asset trading, may require a major rethink of how securities regulation works. In the short term, though, there will likely be serious crackdowns that test the reality of that decentralization.  There has been a recurring theme in the reactions to these pieces: that “DeFi” subjected to any sort of limits or controls whatsoever isn’t really “DeFi.” On one level, that’s true enough: As crypto-lawyer extraordinaire Stephen Palley laid out when discussing enforcement, the sort of kill switches or other controls necessary for regulation to work are usually controlled by a small group of insiders. It’s an open question whether entirely open and anonymous DeFi systems will be able to survive once enforcement really gets rolling.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa). It published first in The Node newsletter. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But on another level, knee-jerk declarations that only anonymous systems qualify as “DeFi” are narrow-minded. There are unique features to the technology, such as self-custody and shared liquidity pools, that don’t depend on anonymity and that could offer real benefits to the way we run mainstream asset markets.  It seems entirely fair to debate whether “DeFi” is still the right term for permissioned trading protocols, but we should also be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. That’s particularly true because DeFi could lead to innovations in know-your-customer (KYC) practices that would significantly increase privacy and security for individuals even in a regulated environment. This morning, we published a conversation with Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov that delves into this “soft KYC.”  Personally, I think the best-case scenario long term is that a large portion of DeFi gets regulated, and slowly eats away at more traditional trading technologies. Meanwhile, a smaller group of protocols that are truly and carefully decentralized will continue operating outside of regulation. The stakes are quite different, but you might compare it to the way online media piracy has evolved: Law enforcement has applied enough pressure to make it really hard to continue running a torrent site (prayers up for What.CD), but you can still find all the free Game of Thrones you could ask for if you’re willing to do some research and take some risks.  The specific benefits of keeping stateless DeFi alive include giving dissidents and others access to tools that circumvent governments and corporations. That option only becomes more important as government and corporate oversight of our finances and internet activity becomes more terrifyingly normalized. Just as bitcoin will serve as a useful check on misguided national monetary policies, cultivating autonomous zones outside of state control will be a check on the most authoritarian impulses of lawmakers and regulators.  And just as the stateless utility of bitcoin is improved by the continued health of regulated centralized exchanges and other fiat onramps, regulated DeFi might be a net positive for its free-range counterpart. Both that potential and the concrete utilitarian benefits of even regulated DeFi make it worth thinking seriously about regulation, instead of just dismissing it out of hand.

42390167,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bW6DNp,1634919276,Why a Bitcoin Futures ETF Is Bad for Investors,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighting a futures-based exchange-traded fund for bitcoin has been a boon to holders of the cryptocurrency this week, with bitcoin hitting all-time highs just shy of $67,000 on news of the ETF’s clearance. But let’s be clear: It’s a horrible deal for investors in the fund itself.  Due to a common phenomenon in futures markets known as contango, the manager of the newly listed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF looks likely to incur such significant costs that investors will earn a dramatically lower return than if they’d invested directly in bitcoin. The loss is so large it makes any concerns the SEC had about volatile, inconsistent reference prices for spot-market bitcoin ETFs seem trivial.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In choosing the futures road to an ETF rather than approving a spot market-backed fund, the SEC seems to have chosen the easiest route from a regulator’s standpoint, given that the underlying contracts – the CME Group’s bitcoin futures – are themselves regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  If it had instead blessed one of the many spot market-backed ETF proposals submitted over the past eight years, it would have needed to approve the prices quoted by exchanges whose bitcoin listings aren’t regulated by either the SEC or the CFTC. Nevermind there are now sophisticated, trustworthy indexes – such as CoinDesk Indexes’ XBX index for bitcoin – that would serve that role perfectly well. It seems the SEC just couldn’t get beyond the global, unregulated world of bitcoin exchanges and the prices they produce. So it punted to a futures solution.  Yet, in choosing that path over the spot market and essentially approving contango-based losses, the SEC may be doing more harm to the small investors it is supposed to protect than they would incur from whatever uncertainty the spot market brings.  Contango pain  My colleagues David Morris and Omkar Godbole have already done a fine job explaining the challenges posed by contango, where the prices for longer-dated futures contracts are higher than the short-dated ones. (In essence, there’s a cost involved in the ETF manager having to “roll the contract” every month, because the manager will have to sell the lower-priced, expiring current-month contract and buy the higher-priced next-month contract. The greater the contango effect, the more a futures strategy will underperform the price of the underlying asset the futures contracts intend to track.)  But it wasn’t until I talked with another colleague, CoinDesk Indexes Managing Director Jodie Gunzberg, that I realized just how costly this phenomenon is for a bitcoin ETF. (She described the concept as “fatally flawed” in an appearance on CNBC.)  According to Gunzberg, the average “negative yield” per monthly roll on bitcoin futures for the past few years of its existence has been 2.29%. On an annualized basis, if investors held shares in a bitcoin futures fund that had rolled over every month for the past year, they’d have ended up with a cumulative cost of 28% relative to the spot market.  Read More - Policy Week: How Crypto Is Reckoning With Regulation, and Vice Versa  The monthly average negative yield for bitcoin futures is above the average contango cost incurred by crude oil futures, at 1.69% per month, and only slightly below that of unleaded gas, at 2.85%. It’s significantly higher than the monthly contango costs incurred on gold futures, which average at 0.23%.  For commodities, a great deal of the contango effect is explained by storage costs, which mount up over time and thus make longer-dated futures contracts more expensive. Those costs vary from commodity to commodity. Gas and oil are costly to store; gold is not. Hence the disparity in the average negative yield roll.  Yet, bitcoin, which according to Gunzberg’s analysis is in a state of contango 58% of the time, is even cheaper than gold to store. Storage is not a factor at all in its tendency toward contango, which is explained purely by hyper-bullish future price expectations. In fact, the absence of any storage problem makes managing bitcoin futures a very different – and arguably more difficult – proposition than for commodity futures.  Although the overall cost of storing commodities grows over time, the marginal cost of adding more storage time tends to decline the longer the commodity is held. That means the negative yield burden is often lower for longer-dated futures in contango. Savvy investors will offset their losses in shorter-dated contracts by buying the longer-dated ones.  But in the case of bitcoin, where there’s no real storage cost to speak of, that longer-term effect simply doesn’t occur.  “The price of bitcoin futures contracts is reflecting very purely the higher expected spot price in the future,” says Gunzberg. “And there is no convexity in the back end. It’s just straight up. You can’t even play those back-end contracts to your benefit. There is nowhere to hide.”  The other contango-related problem with a futures-backed ETF is that fund managers are forced to hold a large amount of cash to cover the roll payments over time, which creates an opportunity cost because those funds aren’t exposed to bitcoin’s gains. By contrast, spot market-backed ETFs can invest the bulk of their funds.  “Our ETF has 95% of funds under management invested directly in physical bitcoin,” says Alex Tapscott, managing director and head of digital assets at Toronto-based Ninepoint, one of four firms now managing spot market-backed ETFs north of the U.S. border.  None of this – not the comparatively better performance in either Canada or the bitcoin spot market – has deterred U.S. investors so far. It took just two days for the ProShares ETF to surpass $1 billion in assets under management, a record for any ETF.  Demand is so strong, Bloomberg reported, that ProShares is close to exceeding the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s limit on the total number of contracts an entity can own. Bloomberg’s analysis found that, with a stash of 1,900 contracts in the current October month – just shy of the 2,000 limit for a single month – the fund has had to diversify into longer-dated contracts. It now holds 1,400 November contracts, but may have to go further out the curve into December if demand keeps up. Even then, the fund faces an absolute limit of 5,000 contracts  A decision by the CME to raise the front-end month limit to 4,000 from 2,000 starting in November could ease some of the pressure on ProShares. Meanwhile, competing bitcoin futures ETF from Valkyrie and VanEck will likely pick up some of the slack from pent-up investor demand and take the pressure off ProShare. But if investors respond negatively to the underperformance of their fund relative to bitcoin’s soaring spot price, the rush for the exits could become a stampede.  All of which raises the question: Why on earth did the SEC, with a mandate to protect small investors, take this route? It’s time for a proper, spot market-backed bitcoin ETF.

ZkLink aims to become the first multi-chain DEX to enable one-click, cross-chain transfers across both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM-compatible chains.  At launch, the first layer 1 chains to be supported will include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi Eco Chain and Polygon.  The cross-chain quest  DEXs can be difficult for beginner users to navigate. Users also often have to use a different DEX for each blockchain network, complicating cross-chain asset transfers.  ZkLink connects separate layer 1 networks with a single layer 2 network for easier token exchanges from a single interface, a structure that also lowers gas or transaction fees.  The project launched its testnet in July and the protocol experienced a 40% spike in users over the past 30 days, coinciding with China’s latest crypto trading crackdown. ZkLink now has close to 10,000 users participating in its open beta ahead of the mainnet, or live blockchain, launch.  Key backers  Other participants in the funding round included Arrington Capital, DeFi Alliance, Huobi Ventures, Ascensive Assets, Morningstar Ventures, GSR and Marshland Capital.  “Interoperability is the goal of many blockchain projects but ZkLink fully backs up the talk, allowing intuitive cross-chain exchange across multiple chains,” Andrew Durgee, head of Republic Crypto, said in a press release. “We’re very excited to see zero-knowledge technology implemented in this way in the realm of decentralized finance and look forward to supporting the ZkLink team throughout their journey.”  Read more: Zero-Knowledge Credit Risk Platform X-Margin Raises $8M  “Trustless interoperability is the Holy Grail of blockchain, but there aren’t many projects and products tackling cross-chain from a user perspective,” Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington Capital, said in a statement. “ZkLink’s innovative decentralized exchange is tackling this obstacle and making it easier than ever for anyone to take part in secure, safe cross-chain asset swaps.”  The ZkLink investment comes during a busy October for Republic, which consists of several arms, including a private capital division and the crypto consultancy business.

42390166,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bW6A9n,1634914109,Gensler for a Day: Regulating DeFi With Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov,"Today’s “Gensler for a Day” is Michale Shaulov, CEO of decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and custody firm Fireblocks. Fireblocks occupies an extremely interesting position in the DeFi ecosystem: Late last month, it was proposed as the first “whitelister” for Aave Arc, a version of the Aave DeFi protocol aimed at serving institutions. That means higher regulatory compliance, including permissioned access to reduce or eliminate users’ risk of entanglement with money laundering or other malfeasance.  This interview is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  As a DeFi professional who’s very focused on compliance, what’s your wish list for DeFi regulation?  I would like to see basically four important areas addressed. The first one is around the legitimacy of [each] protocol and what it does. All the disclosures [should be] provided for users, in a way that they can understand. Right now, you have to go read the white paper, which can be very very technical. I think there’s a middle ground.  Second is the risk controls of the protocols. How much auditing is being done, what are the amounts that can be deposited based on different audit levels. Not to restrict people from developing and launching things – if someone has a clever idea, they can launch something without spending a lot on the audit. But there need to be some limits on the risk.  The third aspect is really around anti-money laundering (AML). I think it is very important, because we don’t want to see this thing leveraged by bad actors to do things that are objectively bad for humanity. The solution for that is a kind of “soft KYC [know-your-customer]” rule. Let’s say you have KYC with Binance and they give me a token that says I was KYC’d, you’re in this jurisdiction and you’re a high net worth individual. And then if I want to work with Aave, for example, they can query that token. They don’t know it’s Michael Shaulov, but they can get an attestation that I was certified, and they can certify some parameters about my identity.  Then the fourth element is around custody, the whole interaction with the protocol that I think right now is very limiting. Right now there isn’t a definition for institutional investors as to how you’re supposed to interact with it. I think there need to be technical regulations that establish the rails and protection.  Let’s go deeper on KYC/AML issues. One major feature of DeFi for some users is anonymity and privacy. Can we preserve individual user anonymity in any way as we move towards more regulated DeFi?  There are basically two approaches. One is [what you see with] with Aave Arc, which is where there is KYC on all participants. I think this is an overcorrection [that’s useful] for the time being.  I think what will happen over time is some form of soft KYC, where there is a token, or some sort of identification that the wallet has been screened. It [might] provide some sort of KYC score for that particular wallet. There will be some sort of rules in the DeFi protocols that represent regulatory constraints on what you can do with certain tokens.  An example might be with banks right now. If you do a transaction under [a certain threshold], nobody is going to be looking at that. There might be something similar that allows anonymity at very small amounts, but you would have to obtain a higher and higher level of scoring that would be provided by different KYC providers. And based on that you can do certain things.  See also: Self-Sovereign Identity Explained  I think it is important to maintain an open infrastructure. What’s happening right now from a KYC perspective in CeFi [centralized exchanges and services] is, if you open an account with Binance you have to provide them details, then do the same thing with Coinbase or Gemini.  It’s not just annoying from a user perspective, it increases [security] risks … Most of the data breaches in the crypto space are actually KYC and user information that’s stolen. There is [also] a relationship between KYC and new data regulations. Right now the KYC regulations around crypto are completely conflicting with [Europe’s] General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  While some will actively choose to be regulated, do you think other DeFi systems will choose to continue operating in an unregulated way?  I think it will eventually be hard. Right now, the problem is that there isn’t any applicable regulation. You don’t have some reasonable middle ground that was purpose built for the technology, for the use case. Right now, either you take regulation from the 1940s and try to interpret it for 2021, or you basically are saying it’s irrelevant, so there’s no regulation.  My view is that at the end of the day the regulators work on behalf of the people. If DeFi [becomes] a very important aspect of our day-to-day lives from a financial standpoint, the regulators will have to make an applicable framework that is reasonable and relevant. And by that I mean the service providers, DeFi protocols, will have to comply, but they won’t have to break the bank for five years to earn a license.  Clearly a lot of the rhetoric around DeFi has to do with democratizing and decentralizing governance. In the real world, though, there are pretty obviously small groups of individuals running most protocols. Where do we go from here in terms of who’s really in charge?  We’re currently going through a governance proposal with Aave Arc, and it’s a very interesting experience. I think that in many ways that will be the way to go – decentralized governance. I think there will be some regulation on that, because how do you actually [set standards], make sure the minority isn’t being abused?  Right now a lot of control lies with VCs [venture capital firms], and you can have some risk of manipulation. For example, if they go to the market and buy all the governance tokens to pass a resolution, that’s manipulation, and it should be illegal, in the same way they currently have rules against market manipulation in traditional markets.  But the advantage of decentralized governance is that it actually crowdsources the efforts of the regulators or enforcement. If there’s a regulation, people will start asking, “Why are [we] offering to do XYZ if it’s not in compliance with regulation?” They’re basically outsourcing the vetting process.  Centralized exchanges have used geofencing to comply with regulation, but that’s been shown to be very flawed. What role will geography have in DeFi regulation?  They’ll need to approach it the same way they approach the internet, because it’s effectively the same thing. Whether [traffic is] going to Web 3 or Facebook, you don’t know.  At the extreme side is China – with the Great Firewall, they can decide what to block and what not to block. I don’t think any of that is aligned with Western values. I don’t think that will be perceived as a reasonable practice in any Western jurisdiction. And it would require an investment in technology similar to the Great Firewall.  See also: China’s Latest Crypto Ban Is Its Most Severe, Insiders Say  This is a really big challenge for regulators. Because it’s not only that money transmission laws are very local, it’s that they’re used by nations to enforce sanctions. Those regulations are built to be used as a political weapon. Once you lose that capability, it becomes a challenge, that’s pretty clear.  Who’s supposed to dictate for the majority of the Western world how the regulation looks? Is that some kind of multinational body, and then it boils down to specific laws in each country? It’s possible. It might not be different from some of the international laws you see around child pornography, where you have an international body that’s restricting that globally on the internet, and every country adopting some form of that.

The new Valkyrie fund, officially the called the Bitcoin Strategy ETF, went live on the Nasdaq under the ticker BTF when stock markets opened Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET, but premarket trading started earlier.  But after roughly a few hours of trading, the stock was changing hands at $24.01, down 4% from the initial price, according to the Nasdaq.  The early performance appeared to track a decline in bitcoin’s price, which was lower for the second straight day, around $60,095 – slipping further from the all-time high close to $67,000 earlier in the week. Valkyrie had recovered by the end of trading to finish at $25 per share.  BITO, the ProShares ETF, also fell Friday, down 4.4% on the day to $39.04 a share.  After months of waiting, the cryptocurrency industry is finally getting the U.S. ETFs that fund executives have long sought – as a way of attracting money from investors who want exposure to bitcoin price via the stock market. While cryptocurrency analysts say the new offerings, focused on bitcoin futures contracts, are less ideal than an ETF backed by bitcoin directly, the reception so far among investors has been overwhelming.  The first U.S. bitcoin futures to go live, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (stock ticker BITO), launched Tuesday and attracted more than $1 billion of assets in just two days, the fastest-ever ETF to hit the milestone. VanEck’s bitcoin futures ETF offering is slated to trade starting early next week.  Bitcoin spot markets rallied to new all-time highs Wednesday amid the filings parade. Bitcoin-linked ETFs are seen as an easy way for traditional investors to chase crypto market exposure from their brokerage accounts.  ProShares’ juggernaut bitcoin futures fund debut indicated interest runs deep. The first-ever U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF hauled in $570 million of assets in its first day, with over $1 billion in trading, one of the most successful ETF launches ever.

The SWIFT network is a messaging network used by many banks and financial institutions to send and receive money and information around the globe.  “But unlike SWIFT, XanPool is compatible with modern payment solutions like cryptocurrency, fast-payments and e-wallets.

Following the attack, which threatened the petroleum supplies of five eastern states in the U.S., DarkSide’s share of the amount paid in ransom remained dormant until Oct. 21, Elliptic said Friday in a blog.  The developer of “ransomware as a service,” DarkSide, maintained a wallet to hold its share of the funds, which included 11.3 BTC. That was identified by Elliptic using its intelligence collection and analysis of blockchain transactions.  DarkSide subsequently said the wallet had been claimed by an unknown third party, sending 107.8 BTC ($6.8 million) to a new address.  These bitcoin have now been sent through a series of new wallets over a period of several hours, with small amounts being ejected at each step – a common money laundering technique to make funds harder to track.  Elliptic has linked this activity to ransomware group REvil, with which DarkSide has close ties, being hacked and forced offline by a U.S. government-led operation.

42375976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDJ59,1634900560,CME Takes Over as Largest Bitcoin Futures Exchange as BITO Pushes Limits,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has replaced Binance as the world’s biggest bitcoin futures platform, thanks to the strong investor appetite for the recently launched ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF.  As of writing, the CME accounts for 22% or $5.68 billion of the total global futures open interest of $25.7 billion, while Binance is contributing $5.66 billion to the worldwide tally.  The amount of money locked in the CME-based futures contracts has tripled this month, with more than $1.5 billion flowing into the market after ProShares’ bitcoin ETF went live on Tuesday.  Launched under the ticket BITO on the New York Stock Exchange, the ETF has amassed $1.2 billion worth of assets in the first three days and could soon hit the CME’s position limits.  At the end of Thursday, the ETF held 2,133 contracts of November futures and 1,679 contacts due to expire on Oct. 29.  The CME allows a single entity to own a maximum of 2,000 contracts in the front-month futures while capping the overall positions across different maturities at 5,000 contracts.  “Exchanges enforce positions limits to keep a single entity from establishing unilateral control over the market and prices,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, said, adding that limit sizes vary from market to market and are flexible.  ProShares’ fund also appears to be close to hitting the limit in the October expiry and may continue to snap up longer duration futures.  That would expose the fund to a significant tracking error – the difference between bitcoin’s performance and actual returns from the fund. That’s because longer-duration futures contracts trade at a considerable premium to the spot price. As such, the fund could up selling low and buying high while rolling over positions on expiry, leading to contango bleed, as CoinDesk reported earlier this month.  The situation is expected to ease as more ETFs go live, and the CME raises caps on maximum positions a single entity can hold.  “Position limits are less of a concern as more ETFs enter the space, because there will be large holders of these contracts, and it will be harder for one entity to control the market,” Leah Wald, Valkyrie, CEO of Valkyrie Investments, said during an interview with CNBC on Thursday.  Wald added that Valkyrie’s futures-based ETF would begin trading on Friday. VanEck’s fund is also expected to go live in the next few days.  The CME recently announced that starting from November, the position limit for the front-month bitcoin futures, options on bitcoin futures, and micro bitcoin futures, will be raised to 4,000 contracts.  Each standard bitcoin futures and options contract on the CME represents 5 BTC, while the size of the micro futures contract is 0.1 BTC.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/22/cme-becomes-largest-bitcoin-futures-exchange-as-bito-nears-position-limits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2317f72bd1fde0fcbe7d1d1d85f1fc7c8d6d82f-1200x670.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Specifically, there is uncertainty as to whether the registry – which aims principally to combat money laundering – is designed for financial institutions that are already regulated entities.  “It would not make sense for a bank to have to go through the requirements imposed, since these entities are already directly supervised,” Gloria Hernández Aler, a partner at regulatory advisory firm finReg360, said.  “However, it does make sense for them to notify that they are going to provide this type of service and, probably, they will need to change their money laundering policy to adapt it to the dynamics of crypto assets.”  Lacking firm direction from the central bank, several of the large financial institutions’ compliance departments have set about finding out whether they have to be registered to offer crypto services, El Pais reported.

All newly authorized plants will be limited to using just 1 MW over two years, according to an Oct. 1 draft signed by the newly appointed energy minister, Magzum Maratuly Myrzagaliev. The ministerial order doesn’t say if the restriction ends after that period.  Kazakhstan has become the second-biggest contributor to the bitcoin network after a crackdown in China that started in May drove out crypto mining companies. It now accounts for 18% of the global hashrate, a measure of computing power used to mine bitcoin, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.  The 1 MW limit is far below what many existing industrialized mines operate on, but is more than many small cities consume. For example, earlier this week BIT Mining said it is investing in a site in Ohio to take capacity to 100 MW.  The ministerial order takes effect 60 days after its publication.  Increased demand for electricity is testing the Central Asian country’s electricity grid. Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, was hit by a total blackout in mid-July. Coal plants suffered outages in October, adding to the power shortages, Reuters reported.  At a Sept. 30 conference, the energy minister blamed the crypto mining boom for the power shortages, local news site Kazakhstan Today reported.  The order also called on the country’s national grid operator, KEGOC, to audit any power plants with capacity of 5 MW within 10 working days. KEGOC is to look for ways crypto miners can use to plug into electricity plants and submit its findings to the ministry.

42375977,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDJ6P,1634889849,"Bitcoin Bull Market Has Plenty of Steam Left, Indicators Suggest","Bitcoin’s price has risen over 40% this month, reaching a new record of $66,879 on expectations the recently listed ProShares exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the cryptocurrency’s futures would bring more mainstream money into the market.  Such a steep ascent often has investors assessing whether the party is coming to a close, especially when popular technical indicators like the relative strength index (RSI) signal overbought conditions, as with bitcoin.  However, blockchain metrics like the market value-to-realized value (MVRV) Z-score and a lesser-known chart-based indicator, Mayer Multiple, suggest the bull run has plenty of steam left.  The MVRV Z-score that measures the deviation of market value from realized value and is used to assess undervalued and overvalued conditions, has doubled to 3.91 this month. However, the value is nowhere close to the red zone above 5.00 that has historically marked the final leg of a bull market.  The market value represents the total network value of the cryptocurrency and is calculated by multiplying the total circulating supply by the last traded price. Meanwhile, the realized value is calculated by valuing each coin at the price it was last moved.  Although bitcoin market valuations may not be cheap, they do not appear to be overstretched either, with there being a scope for an extension of the price rally.  “When market value is significantly higher than realized value, it has historically indicated a market top (red zone), while the opposite has indicated market bottoms (green zone),” blockchain analytics firm Glassnode said in the MVRV Z-score explainer.  The Mayer Multiple, which measures the spread between bitcoin’s price and the 200-day moving average (MA), also shows the bull market is still far from peaking. While the metric has risen to a five-month high of 1.39, it is well below the 2.4 threshold, above which previous bull markets peaked.  Both indicators back up analysts’ expectations of a continued price rally toward $100,000 in the coming months. That said, it may not be a smooth ride, and the cryptocurrency may see price pullbacks depending on the degree of leverage in the market.  The cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to macro risks and potential risk-off in traditional markets.  According to Reuters, there is a growing view in the market that the U.S. Federal Reserve may soon feel compelled to scale back stimulus more aggressively to contain inflation. “U.S. traders are now pricing a full rate hike into the Fed’s September policy meeting next year. But by that time, New Zealand’s central bank would have hiked five times, Canada’s three times and England’s four times,” a Bloomberg report said.  Should the market start pricing more aggressive Fed rate hike bets, risk assets, including bitcoin, may face some selling pressure.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/22/bitcoin-bull-market-has-plenty-steam-left-indicators-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf76ce80f6916df05350260c9e706f28ac226329-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Altman, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence firm OpenAI, unveiled his “Worldcoin” (WC) project earlier on Thursday, promising fair distribution among as “many people as possible.”  “If a cryptocurrency were adopted at scale, it would vastly increase access to the internet economy and make applications possible that are now unimaginable,” the project’s webpage reads.  However, there is another WorldCoin (WDC), conceived as far back as 2013. It is a cryptocurrency “designed to be the world’s first digital currency of the future,” according to its website. The goal of this altcoin is to become the “cryptocurrency of choice” for merchants and consumers for everyday transactions.  Over the last 24 hours, WDC’s price has gone from $0.05 to around $0.09, and is currently up 68.4%, according to data by CoinGecko. So traders are apparently aping, or buying without having done much research, into the wrong coin.  The Altman-backed WC coin centers on a novel device WC developers call “the Orb.” The device captures an image of a person’s eye, which is converted into a short numeric code, making it possible to identify whether a person has signed up already.  If not, they receive their free share of Worldcoin.

42375960,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDIon,1634874872,Pakistan High Court Grants Commission to Weigh Crypto Legality in Sindh Province: Report,"A high court in Pakistan has approved a committee to explore whether cryptocurrencies are advisable under the country’s legal system, according to a report Friday by The News International.  The High Court of Sindh, the highest-level judicial body in the southeastern province of Sindh, granted permission for the committee to consider crypto trading and report its findings to the province’s Ministry of Finance.  Should the committee find crypto trading permissible under Pakistani law, recommendations are to be forwarded to the ministry alongside a draft framework for crypto regulation, subject to modification.  The committee is to be chaired by a deputy governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) along with officials of Ministries Of Finance, Information Technology, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, according to the report.  The court conceded that a decision whether to provide greater oversight around crypto trading activity in Pakistan came not by choice but from pragmaticism over the potential black market business dealings currently outside government purview.  Cryptocurrency has experienced a boom in recent weeks, with the price of bitcoin hitting a new all-time high on Wednesday above $66,000.  Popularity in trading digital assets and, therefore, tax receipts that occur from such activity are considered a strong source of revenue for governments looking to get their hands on a piece of the action.  Higher prices are continuing to drive new traders and are raising the industry’s profile among the mainstream.  While crypto trading is not strictly illegal in Pakistan, under current regulation imposed by the SBP in 2018 a ban is in place for those firms it regulates that are dealing in crypto.  In 2019, Pakistan’s federal government put in place tougher regulations for the crypto industry by mandating all Electronic Money Institutions be licensed to provide crypto assets under recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force.
