42412155,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIh5D,1634489689,Bitcoin Futures ETFs May Boost Cash and Carry Yields,"Several bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) may debut in the U.S. in the coming weeks. These products may revive interest in the famed “cash and carry” arbitrage strategy, which in turn would bring more buying pressure to the spot market.  The ETFs would buy bitcoin futures contracts, primarily front-month trading on a regulated venue like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in a bid to mimic the cryptocurrency’s price performance instead of purchasing actual coins.  Assuming Wall Street embraces these ETFs, the futures premium, or the spread between futures prices and spot prices, would rise significantly, boosting yields from cash and carry strategy, which involves buying the asset in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures contracts. Carry trades are direction-neutral and profit from an eventual convergence of the two prices. (Futures price converges with the spot price on expiry).  “If the futures ETF comes out, there will be more inflows into buying futures. That would drive the futures curve further into contango [a situation where the futures contracts trade at a premium to the spot price], offering a strong incentive to carry traders,” said Ilan Solot, global market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. “They would start the trade by buying BTC in the spot market, creating an initial push up in spot prices.”  Cash and carry arbitrage was a big hit among institutions early this year as futures premium spiked to 20% or more on the CME and other exchanges alongside bitcoin’s price rise. So, several firms could lock in annualized returns of over 20% by selling front month or three-month futures contracts and buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market. Premiums, however, fell to single digits following bitcoin’s 35% sell-off in May and as major exchanges like Binance and FTX cut back on leverage.  Premiums have risen sharply this month with the return of the bull to the crypto market. On the CME, the front-month contract is currently trading at an annualized premium of 16% versus a discount of -0.4% at the end of September, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. With futures-based ETFs likely coming soon in the U.S., double-digit futures premiums appear sustainable.  “One key effect of a futures-based ETF is the possible increase in yield in the space,” QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel on Friday. “With the ETF funds forced to buy futures instead of spot, the futures premium would be driven higher. A ‘risk-free’ rate [cash and carry yield] of 10-20% could be the new norm.”  On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened the doors for the masses to invest in bitcoin with its tacit approval of a futures-based bitcoin ETF. ProShares may be the first to launch next week, although it may not begin trading immediately.  In the week gone by, crypto lender BlockFi and Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management put their names on applications for futures-backed bitcoin ETFs. Meanwhile, Valkyrie Investments updated its futures-backed ETF prospectus with the ticker BTF, hinting at a possible launch. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, the regulators were considering nine bitcoin futures ETF applications at the beginning of the month.  The consensus is that the futures-based ETFs would bring more mainstream investors to the crypto market. However, these products are vulnerable to contango bleed and usually underperform the underlying asset.  Also read: Dying for a Bitcoin Futures ETF?

42410959,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtk9M,1634485800,Bitcoin Mining Is Decentralizing – Here’s Proof,"There’s at least one industry where the United States now has China beat: bitcoin mining.  After Beijing’s crackdown on crypto in September, the U.S. took the reins as the leading location for bitcoin mining, according to data compiled by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and released last week. Just two years ago, China accounted for three-quarters of all of bitcoin’s total hashrate (the computational power used to mine bitcoin), while the U.S. contributed a scant 4%. As of August, China’s bitcoin miners were gone, while the Americans were responsible for 35%.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  A recurring criticism of bitcoin mining in the past was that so much of it came from  China. So long as that was the case, the more extreme arguments said, the Chinese government could somehow pressure miners to do its bidding. Whether that was the case is now moot because that government rescinded any opportunity to do so by kicking its miners out of the country.  Adding Kazakhstan’s 18% with the U.S.’s 35% means that more than half of all bitcoin mining is happening in just two countries. That may seem like bitcoin is pretty much as concentrated as it was when China was the dominant player, but one index is showing that concentration has declined significantly with China’s exit.  Let’s get HHI  The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI)is often used by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to determine the concentration of an industry. The higher the index, the more control of that industry is in the hands of a few players. It’s calculated by adding up the squares of an individual company’s market share (after multiplying each by 100). Doing so amplifies the weight of those firms with larger market shares.  The DOJ puts markets into three buckets based on their HHI score:  Unconcentrated Markets: HHI below 1,500  Moderately Concentrated Markets: HHI between 1,500 and 2,500  Highly Concentrated Markets: HHI above 2,500  The regulators use this as a tool to determine whether to greenlight a merger or acquisition. If combining the two companies would raise the HHI by more than 100 points in a moderately concentrated market, that could raise red flags. Doing so in a highly concentrated market significantly decreases the chances such an M&A deal will go through.  Using it for countries? Are you HHI?  HHI is generally used to look at companies in an industry. Applying it to country market share isn’t quite the same thing. After all, within each country many firms could be vigorously competing for their tiny slivers of the overall market share. And one firm could have facilities in multiple countries, making this even more an apples-to-oranges comparison.  Nonetheless, coming up with an HHI figure for how concentrated bitcoin mining is by country does give some insight into whether bitcoin mining is as diversified as it should be if it’s to survive the whims of any one government’s capriciousness.  As it turns out, the market as it pertains to hashrate after China’s crackdown is now down to “moderately concentrated,” down from “highly concentrated,” if one were to use the DOJ’s measures.  Back in September 2019, the HHI using just the top nine countries was an astounding 5,774 because China’s share was 76%. A year later, it was down to 4,637, with China’s share falling to 67%. While lower, that is still a number that would make a trustbuster apoplectic.  Interestingly, a major falloff happened in Q3 of 2020. That’s when China made it harder for miners to use over-the-counter trading desks to sell their product. In November of that year, China’s share of hashrate fell to 56% and the HHI of the top nine countries hit 3,306. Again, that’s still highly concentrated.  Yet, now with China out of the picture – at least on paper (”While there are certainly ongoing covert mining operations in China, those would have to be small-scale to avoid scrutiny,” tweeted CCAF’s Michel Rauch) – the HHI has fallen to “moderately concentrated” territory. The top nine countries produced an HHI of 1,871 in August, based on the most recent data available.  For those who wonder about the rest of the world besides the top nine, their hashrate in total never amounted to more than 9.4% (and that was in August), contributing just 89 points at the most if one were to lump them all together.  Regardless of one’s political uneasiness about any one country potentially controlling bitcoin mining, bitcoin proponents should at the very least cheer any reduction in concentration. After all, if bitcoin’s promise was to make finance decentralized, that should include mining, too.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/17/bitcoin-mining-is-decentralizing-heres-proof,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4f999c8a4aacf1f9ebea0f45c1afb9980846f47-3527x2408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The communications director for Grayscale said the company would file to do so “once there’s official and verifiable evidence of the SEC’s comfort with the underlying #Bitcoin market.”  She said that evidence for that comfort would “likely come in the form of a Bitcoin Futures ETF being deemed effective.” The Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighted the investment vehicle on Friday, and ProShares confirmed in an SEC filing that it will launch its bitcoin futures ETF on Tuesday.  While the exact timing of Grayscale’s intended filing may be new, the world’s largest digital asset manager has made no secret of its intent to seek approval for a spot bitcoin-based ETF once a futures-based one cleared the commission.  Grayscale’s ETF would be backed by actual units of the cryptocurrency, not simply linked it via derivatives contracts such as futures. Should the proposal gain approval, it would be a further expansion of the leading cryptocurrency as a recognized investible asset.  Some analysts predict the $38.7 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), whose shares already trade in public stock markets, has no chance of winning approval anytime soon for its current plan to convert into an ETF backed by the cryptocurrency.  Once the filing is made, the SEC will have 75 days to review it.  Separately on Monday, Grayscale announced that three of its trusts focused on altcoins – Grayscale Zcash Trust, Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust and Grayscale Horizen Trust – are now available on the OTC Markets under the symbols ZCSH, GXLM and HZEN, respectively.  The move is part of Grayscale’s announced intention to eventually turn all of its private placement vehicles into ETFs, with the next step being to turn them into SEC reporting companies. It now has 9 publicly-quoted products, with its bitcoin and ethereum trusts also being SEC reporting firms.  Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.
