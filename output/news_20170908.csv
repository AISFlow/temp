42400388,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJS50,1504907908,"Bitcoin Price Sinks Below $4,200 on China Uncertainty","Markets for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have fallen over the course of the day, following contested reports that regulators in China are looking to shut down the country's exchange ecosystem.  CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is currently at about $4,184, representing a nearly 10 percent decline since the start of the day's trading. Markets peaked today at $4,698.73, per the BPI, though prices began to tumble around 13:20 UTC.  Additional data from CoinMarketCap reveals that – perhaps unsurprisingly – China's top bitcoin exchanges are reporting some of the steepest price declines. The BTC/CNY market on OKCoin is at $3,650.71, while Huobi and BTCC are reporting prices of $3,657.84 and $3,656.57, respectively, at press time.  Other major bitcoin exchanges, including Bitfinex and Bistamp, are reporting current prices above the $4,100 level, according to data from BitcoinWisdom.  As reported earlier today, Chinese news source Caixin, citing unnamed sources, said that regulators are looking to shut down the exchanges. That decision, the newspaper claimed, has already been made and disseminated to other sources. Yet in the wake of that story, exchanges in China said they haven't receive any notices from the Chinese government, casting doubt on the veracity of the Caixin report.  Amidst the uncertainty, other cryptocurrency markets have seen notable declines as well. Ether prices are down more than 10 percent today, trading at around $295.93. Broad market declines have pushed the collective cryptocurrency market capitalization below $150 billion, after spending several days above the $160 billion level.

42400383,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJRz6,1504901225,"Blockchain Firms Ripple, R3 File Dueling Lawsuits Over Crypto Contract Dispute","Distributed ledger startups Ripple and R3 have become embroiled in a new legal battle, with both startups filing lawsuits related to a contract dispute between the two firms.  Ripple alleged in a complaint filed today in the Supreme Court of California that R3 failed to honor an agreement that included an option to purchase 5 billion XRP, the cryptocurrency of Ripple's distributed ledger network. According to Reuters, R3 asked the Delaware Chancery Court to uphold the deal, which would have allowed it to buy the XRP at a price of $0.0085 per token before September 2019.  Currently, XRP is currently trading at roughly $0.21 apiece, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  A copy of R3's complaint was not available at press time. According to Ripple's complaint, R3 and Ripple allegedly struck a deal to create a joint commercial venture, which would have followed an earlier test, centered around XRP, that involved a number of banks involved with R3's consortium effort.  In the complaint, Ripple accused R3 of failing to uphold its end of the bargain as its fundraising efforts picked up steam, ultimately concluding with a $107 million funding round announced this spring.  Ripple also accused R3 of hiding the fact that several of its consortium members, including Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander, among others, were looking to exit the group despite promises of advancing XRP to the banks involved.  A spokesperson for Ripple told CoinDesk in a statement:    ""Our filing is straightforward – R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP’s ~4000% increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement. We wish them well as they continue to try and build their consulting practice. In the meantime, Ripple is focused on serving our ecosystem of nearly 100 customers and signing up more.""            When reached, a representative for R3 declined to offer specifics on the case but struck an optimistic note about the firm's prospects in court.  ""R3 does not discuss the details of pending litigation,"" the spokesman said. ""We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter.""  The suit is a notable one, given that R3 and Ripple are two of the industry's best-funded startups and both focus their products primarily toward financial institutions. R3 and Ripple have raised $107 million and $96 million, respectively, in venture capital to date.

The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) granted the registration to cryptocurrency investment firm First Block Capital Inc. Based in Vancouver, First Block Capital offers investment services aimed at the emerging digital asset class.  The BCSC stated that, by registering the firm, market overseers are able to access ""unique mechanisms to monitor operations.""  Zach Masum, leader of Tech Team, the fintech arm of the BCSC, urged other groups working with cryptocurrencies to contact the regulatory body, stating:  ""We strongly encourage other companies in British Columbia, whether they are potential new registrants or existing investment fund managers, to contact the BCSC's Tech Team if they are considering pursuing cryptocurrency investments in their funds.""  The registration grant marks the latest indication that securities watchdogs in Canada are looking to adopt a more proactive and, to a degree, accomodative approach to firms looking to create products and services around the tech.  This even extends to the area of initial coin offerings, or ICOs, which have sparked warnings from securities regulators in countries like Singapore, the US, and, perhaps most notably, China. By comparison, Quebec's financial services regulator recently accepted an ICO into its so-called regulatory sandbox, as CoinDesk reported on Wednesday.

42400387,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJS32,1504891230,Howard Marks 'Willing to Be Proved Wrong' on Bitcoin,"The Oaktree Capital co-chairman who called cryptocurrencies ""not real"" in July appears to be rethinking his earlier position.  In a new investor note published September 7, Howard Marks revisited the topic he explored earlier this summer, when at the time he dubbed cryptocurrencies ""an unfounded fad"" that had created a high-risk market bubble.  Marks still thinks the cryptocurrency market is in bubble territory, but he acknowledged in the note that the ""particularly spirited response"" to his remarks caused him to rethink his earlier approach. After walking through the characteristics that make something a currency – that it's accepted for exchange and serves as a store of value – Marks ultimately agrees that bitcoin qualifies as one in this regard.  He wrote:  ""Bitcoin fans argue that it qualifies as a currency under these criteria: most importantly, it's something that parties can agree to accept as legal tender and a store of value. That actually seems right.""  That said, he's not completely convinced about the cryptocurrency market's long-term prospects, according to the note. On this point, he highlights the proliferation of other cryptocurrencies, wondering aloud ""who knows which one will turn out to be the winner?""  All the same, Marks concluded that while his perspective on cryptocurrencies has shifted, he doesn't plan on putting any money in the market either.  ""I think I understand what a digital currency is, how bitcoin works, and some of the arguments for it. But I still don't feel like putting my money into it, because I consider a speculative bubble,"" he wrote, adding:  ""I'm willing to be proved wrong.""

42400384,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJS14,1504888262,Report Casts Doubt on Future of China's Bitcoin Exchanges,"Regulators in China are said to be considering a move to close all domestic bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges.  According to a report from business media Caixin, sources close to China's internet financial risk rectification work group, have said the decision has not only been reached, but delivered and deployed to local authorities.  The work group was first launched by China's State Department in 2016 to tackle market risks in the country's financial technology industry such as p2p lending. Located in the People’s Bank of China, it also consists of representatives from China’s banking and securities commissions.  As of now, no official announcements from regulators have been seen. However, there are reasons to believe the report may be authentic.  For example, on September 2, Caixin revealed that the same central work group had delivered internal documents to local authorities regarding the ban on token fundraising activity including the ICO, two days before the official announcement.  In a latest Tweet, People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, said that ""Chinese supervisory authority has decided to close local virtual currency exchanges."" However, the news outlet did not link to any more information for elaboration.  Such a move, if true, may further tighten the regulation in China regarding cryptocurrency activities, as by aiming at major exchanges, it may put restrictions on how bitcoin and ether can be traded for traditional currency in the country.  ""That is to say, there will not be any so-called platforms in China that offer exchange service among tokens, cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies,"" the source said.  However, at press time, local exchange operators are said to be pushing back on the claims.  When reached, Huobi said it was operating normally, and that it has not received any notification from authorities on the matter. Other exchanges including OKCoin, BTCC and Binance did not respond to inquiries.  ""BTCChina Exchange is operating normally, and has not received any new directives from Chinese regulators,"" the exchange said on reddit.

42400393,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJS9v,1504887340,Sprint and SoftBank Back New Blockchain Consortium for Telecoms,"A group of telecommunications carriers has launched a new blockchain consortium.  Some of the notable firms involved include US-based carrier Sprint, Japanese telecom giant SoftBank, and FarEasTone, one of Taiwan's largest.  The effort, dubbed the Carrier Blockchain Study Group, seems to have grown out of a collaboration announced between the companies in February. At the time, Sprint and others revealed that they were testing a platform, developed by blockchain startup TBCASoft, aimed at improving communications between carriers. The consortium will officially be unveiled during the Mobile World Congress Americas on September 12.  So far, the consortium has already successfully tested mobile payment systems and recharging prepaid phones across different carriers using the platform. In the future, the group will roll out applications for connected computing, personal authentication, and and debt resolution.  Doug Garland, Sprint's VP for innovation and partnerships, said in a statement:  ""CBSG is leading the telecommunication industry’s understanding and development of blockchain technology. The disruptive potential of blockchain on a global scale will be fully realized when carriers work together and leverage the new platform and ecosystem.""  The firms involved expressed hope that the consortium will attract other carriers. The consortium, according to the announcement, will act as a hub ""for telecom carrier members to resolve issues related to technology, business and the regulations of various jurisdiction.""

42400400,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJSFp,1504885807,Broken Hash Crash? IOTA's Price Keeps Dropping on Tech Critique,"The IOTA-U.S. dollar exchange rate (IOT/USD) has plummeted in the last 24 hours following revelations from Boston University and MIT researchers that cryptographic vulnerabilities had led to a patch in the widely touted cryptocurrency's code.  Heralded for its corporate partnerships and unique technology that enables fee-free micropayments, the project had long attracted grumblings from developers who questioned the strength of its design. Still, market sentiment has been bullish, with IOTA's market capitalization rising to more than $1 billion on its unprecedented debut in June.  While developers involved in the project have pushed back against the claims, and their impact, the high-profile assessment was nonetheless pointed in its critique.  Neha Nerula, director of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, wrote:  ""When we noticed that the IOTA developers had written their own hash function, it was a huge red flag. It should probably have been a huge red flag for anyone involved with IOTA.""  The market, it seems, is now in the process of pricing in that critique – and IOTA has certainly taken one on the chin.  The cryptocurrency traded at the daily low of $0.5210 at press time. As per CoinMarketCap, IOTA has lost more than 20 percent in the last 24 hours and, week-on-week, is down 23 percent.  The news of IOTA's broken hash function is certainly bearish in the short run as it means investors will need to come to terms with the reality that the cryptocurrency space is still new and thus vulnerable to such errors.  However, on a monthly basis, it is still up 16 percent, thus the broader trend is still bullish.  The fact that the error was detected and reported by reputable researchers, and the flexibility and speed shown by the IOTA team in fixing the bug, could end up boosting confidence that, in the long run, robust and useful technologies will one day emerge from the sector.  Falling channel breached to the downside  Daily chart  Investopedia defines ""falling channel"" or ""descending channel"" as a price action contained between two downward sloping parallel lines: i.e. lower highs and lower lows.  The falling channel has been breached to the downside, in the case of IOTA. An end of the day close below the channel would signal the bears have regained control.  View  A daily close below the falling channel would open up downside towards $0.3633 (September 4 low) and $0.2365 (July 25 low)  The 14-day RSI is bearish, suggesting scope for more sell-off of IOTA  Only a move above $0.7488 (September 6 high) would signal trend reversal from bearish to bullish.

The testnet will be deployed on September 18, following a discussion between ethereum core developers today. Byzantium is the first of two phases in the 'Metropolis' update, set to be followed by 'Constantinople' at a later time.  The actual network upgrade release will likely be launched in early October, depending on the length of the testing period and any issues that may arise during that time. Observers had predicted that the Metropolis upgrade could come as early as this month, but ongoing development pushed that date to later in the fall.  As developer Hudson jameson, the unofficial release manager for Metropolis, said during the meeting:  ""For all the coin media that keep saying September – it's not September. It's October 9 unless something goes wrong with the testnet.""  Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum, said during the meeting that he anticipates the Byzantium test phase will last between three and four weeks.

42400368,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQWa,1504879206,Increased Hashrate Forces Premature Monero Hard Fork,"A planned hard fork of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero is to occur sooner than expected due an increase in its hashrate.  Originally planned for September 21, the fork – intended to bring enhanced privacy features to all users – is now likely to occur on September 16, as revealed at a developer meeting last week. The question of whether to adjust the block number to prevent a premature fork was addressed in the meeting – however, the developers have instead formally adjusted the date on the hard fork schedule.  In cryptocurrency mining, the hashrate is the speed at which computations are performed. When hashrate increases, miners find blocks more quickly, propelling the blockchain forward.  The impending hard fork will introduce the mandatory use of so-called ""ring confidential transactions"" (RingCTs) on the network, though the majority of monero users are already utilizing the currently optional technology.  Introduced on January 10, RingCTs are an upgrade from the older ring signatures, and better obscure transaction outputs, meaning no one can view the details of a transaction outside the parties involved. The technology builds on monero's existing privacy features, including hidden accounts, hidden transactions and trustless coin generation.  Monero is currently the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which currently stands at $1.94 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. Notably, it achieved an all-time high of over $150 on August 28. At press time, a monero token was worth around $125.

42400378,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQgQ,1504872014,Malaysian Finance Regulator Warns Investors Over ICO Risks,"Malaysia's Securities Commission, the statutory body that oversees and enforces financial regulation, has issued a statement warning investors of the risks involved in initial coin offerings (ICOs).  According to the statement, released yesterday, ICO schemes may be unregulated, possibly exposing investors to fraud, and could also be involved in money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  Further, the operators of token sales could be based outside the country, meaning recovery of investments ""may be subject to foreign laws or regulations.""  Investors should be diligent and ""carefully weigh the risks before parting with their monies,"" the regulator concludes.  The statement follows a wave of countries issuing similar warnings against token sales, including Russia and China – where they were recently banned. In the U.S. and elsewhere, authorities like the SEC have also moved to classify ICO tokens as securities in some cases.  Such moves threaten to dampen the soaring popularity of the nascent funding method, which has seen even institutional investors take note.  According to CoinDesk's recent State of Blockchain report, ICOs emerged in Q2 as the world's most important crowdfunding tool in the blockchain space, outstripping VC investment, as well as Kickstarter and other funding platforms. According to the research, venture capital funding reached a total of $235 million for the quarter, while ICOs topped out at $797 million – more than three times as much.

42400361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQQg,1504868457,33 Cases: Cryptocurrency Fraud Is on the Rise in Japan,"Japanese consumers reported 33 cases of cryptocurrency-related fraud in the first seven months of 2017, representing more than half a million dollars-worth of losses.  According to reports from Nikkei and The Yomiuri Shimbun, the National Policy Agency (NPA) reported roughly ¥76.5 million ($710,848) in fraud-related thefts between January and July. The pace of those complaints appears to have picked up as the year progressed – corresponding to the rising cryptocurrency market – with ¥17.3 million reported stolen in July alone.  The cases involved cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether and Ripple's XRP, the reports said, with the majority of the year's reports thus far relating to thefts of bitcoin.  According to The Mainichi, another Japanese newspaper:  ""Damages by virtual currency up to June 2017 were the most for Ripple, at 29.6 million yen, followed by bitcoin at nearly 29.3 million yen. Damages in other currencies ethereum and NEM amounted to 200,000 yen and 100,000 yen, respectively, among others.""  The article notes that while many of the victims' accounts did not have two-factor authentication implemented, at least three accounts did. Two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to digital accounts, and requires a digital token to be able to log into an account.  The NPA did not reveal how the cryptocurrency thieves bypassed two-factor authentication to transfer the funds. And to date, none of the funds identified have been recovered. According to The Mainichi, the police agency said the stolen funds may have already been converted to other forms of money, including cash.

42400364,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQUc,1504864865,The US Government Needs an IT Reboot – And It Wants the Blockchain's Help,"Uncle Sam wants to make government more transparent and accountable, and blockchain will be part of the solution.  At least that's the message the Emerging Citizen Technology (ECT) program, an inter-agency working group within the U.S. government, is now seeking to deliver to blockchain entrepreneurs and businesses.  Today, representatives from government agencies and the private sector will convene to draft the Fourth U.S. National Plan of Action for Open Government – a set of goals and deliverables on how blockchain, artificial intelligence and smart automation can be leveraged to improve bureaucracies and bring antiquated IT systems up to speed.  According to those involved, it's this willingness that makes the effort stand apart, since many claim work within the government is done in uneasily tapped bureaucratic silos.  Justin Herman, head of the ECT program at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), told CoinDesk:  ""This isn't what we'd call a 'participatory theater' where we say we're taking in the voices of people but we're not really reading the comments. This truly is 'We want to hear from people; we want ideas on the table.'""  Participants in today's workshop include blockchain and non-blockchain companies, as well as groups and associations with an interest in the technology, such as the Chamber of Digital Commerce, New America and R Street Institute.  ""One of the challenges we face in the public sector blockchain community is that often people have a hard time differentiating between the federal government and regulators. People hear 'the government is getting interested in blockchain' and they think regulators instead of thinking partners, collaborators or contributors,"" Herman said.  Knowledge gap  Herman sees this ideation process as important for countering the many commonly held misconceptions about the government and its approach to technology.  By leaning heavily on the wisdom of the collective blockchain crowd, he hopes to help shift the narrative so that private sector innovators think of the government as co-creators.  And this is particularly important, he believes, as the chasm grows between the U.S. government's interest in blockchain and the institutional knowledge and understanding of the technology within the various agencies.  ""The investment is happening right now. The decisions are being made right now, and we don't have enough partners in the private sector who can give time to just meet with federal agencies and walk them through the process,"" Herman said.  This could be problematic since taxpayers will ultimately be on the hook for clumsy or misguided federal IT solutions that don't deliver.  ""There's a steep learning curve. The worst thing that could possibly happen is agencies get a half idea of what blockchain is and move forward in the wrong way,"" he said, adding:  ""We've even seen some companies trying to sell blockchain services that aren't even blockchain to agencies.""  Action plan  As such, once the National Action Plan (NAP) draft document is complete, it will be opened up to the broader blockchain community for comments, suggestions and new ideas before a final version is codified.  The NAP is drafted every two years pursuant to the U.S.'s membership in the Open Government Partnership – a group of 75 countries that have committed to using innovative solutions to improve government responsiveness to citizens.  It seeks to put forth a series of ""bold and ambitious, yet achievable and measurable"" goals for how the public sector can use technology to be more transparent and accountable to its citizens, explained Herman.  Herman, who authored the most recent such report, stressed that blockchain is a hot topic in government circles. Point in case, the GSA, where Herman works, has separately begun moving forward in developing a blockchain-based prototype for IT procurement.  He concluded:  “This will be the first time that we are elevating blockchain to the level of proposing national goals, specifically for transparency and accountable government.”  Old computers image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Aaron Stanley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/09/08/the-us-government-needs-an-it-reboot-and-it-wants-the-blockchains-help,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9831093a46b34348116d68b7ac3b49079eb2e391-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Further down the line, GMO indicated it plans to begin offering cloud mining services, through which customers can buy a certain amount of hashrate over a period of time to potentially earn bitcoin. Notably, the company also plans to use the mine to support its cryptocurrency exchange, with the coins generated being used to provide liquidity for its marketplace.  The announcement comes on the heels of another blockchain-based loyalty point project from GMO.  Cryptocurrency mining  is the energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, creating new coins as a reward in the process.

42400365,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQTd,1504858821,Lightning's Next Act: Decentralizing Bitcoin Mining?,"Developer Chris Belcher has an idea for how to fix bitcoin mining – and it notably takes its inspiration from the network's much-discussed Lightning Network proposal.  The idea is notable in that it showcases both the evolving nature of bitcoin as a technology, as well as how its developers are finding new ways to explore long-established issues. For example, while the Lightning Network was proposed for tackling bitcoin's infamous scaling hurdles, Belcher believes the concept could help decentralize mining, thereby strengthening the protocol's value proposition as an censorship-resistant money.  It's an idea not without precedent. At least one mining pool, P2Pool has already tried to decentralize mining, but less than one percent of miners use it, primarily because it doesn't pay out miners in a timely way compared to more centralized options.  But using the ""hub-and-spoke"" payment channel model behind Lightning Network could help the pool increase how often payments are made, in turn making the pool more attractive to miners, according to Belcher, who's also the developer behind bitcoin privacy mixer JoinMarket.  Belcher explained:  ""I propose an improved scheme using payment channels which would allow far more individual hashers to mine on p2pool and result in a much lower payout variance.""  The problem  Mining pools exist in general because as mining became competitive – block rewards are worth roughly $58,000 at press time – individual miners and small mining operations struggled to keep up in the race to win rewards.  Mining pools put their combined power toward the goal of finding blocks and securing the rewards, which are then distributed to members based on how much computing power each has contributed. Introduced in 2011, P2Pool tries to mirror the benefits of a bitcoin pool, without an operator in control.  To accomplish this, P2Pool creates it's own blockchain, known as a ""sharechain,"" that only the miners in the pool contribute to. The pool determines how much computing power each miner is contributing by how many ""shares"" they win in a certain period of time.  The problem is that once too many miners join the P2Pool, the sharechain has the same ""high-variance"" problem as the main bitcoin blockchain, making miners wary of using it. Smaller miners can't put forth the amount of computing power necessary to secure enough shares to cash out often.  Centralized mining pools also work on shares, but those shares often can be immediately cashed in for bitcoin, whereas shares on the decentralized sharecoin cannot.  The solution  The key thing, then, for P2Pool (and future decentralized pools), according to Belcher, is making payments off-blockchain in a payment channel hub, instead of paying them directly via the bitcoin blockchain.  On the bitcoin developer mailing list, Belcher said:  ""What's needed is a way to use off-chain payments where any number of payments can be sent to each individual hasher without using the blockchain.""  He added that the payment channel hub, which has proven more flexible for small payments, could have a channel open with each miner so they get paid every time P2Pool finds a block.  While the idea is still in its early stages, feedback is trickling in. At least one P2Pool contributor, veqtrus, has reviewed the proposal.  And bitcoin developer Alphonse Pace believes the proposal ""seems promising,"" though he wonders whether there are other reasons P2Pool isn't ""terribly popular."" Linking up a miner to the decentralized pool, for example, is a complicated process.  ""People pay for convenience,"" he argued.  Yet, there could still be reasons for joining decentralized mining pools that trump convenience. For example, decentralized pools wouldn't be able to steal the miner's money, as could be possible of operators of centralized mining pools.  Using the technology underpinning the Lightning Network as a way to alleviate mining centralization would be an unexpected add-on benefit.
