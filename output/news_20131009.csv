42376629,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTmT,1381337116,"Invoice in US dollars, get paid in bitcoins with Coinvoice","A new company is hoping to marry bitcoins and invoicing, enabling people to invoice customers in US dollars, but get paid in the cryptocurrency.  Coinvoice  launched at the start of this month, is the brainchild of Jacob Yocom-Piatt, founder of software development house Conformal Systems. The team behind the service had already toyed with the idea of a bitcoin exchange, explains Coinvoice COO Daniel Tobin, but had been deterred by the regulatory environment in the US.  Instead, it adopted a payment processor model, which it says exempts it from FinCEN’s rules requiring certain bitcoin-related businesses to obtain a money transmitting business (MTB) licence.  Here, he is drawing on a blog post from incumbent bitcoin payment processor BitPay, which highlights exemptions B and F in FinCEN document 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5).  Payment processors acting to facilitate your payments, and who accept and transmit funds only integral to the sales of goods or services, are exempt from the guidance, the literature says.  Coinvoice is a payment processor like BitPay, but it offers a different service, focusing on invoicing rather than processing immediate online transactions or mobile transactions. Tobin said:  ""Everybody here is a firm believer that this is at least the beginning of a new direction in payment systems, and it's something that is long overdue. Worldwide transactions would benefit everyone in the economy.""  Someone wanting to invoice their customers through Coinvoice would register with the company and go through the appropriate KYC procedures before being approved, said Tobin. They would then invoice their clients in US dollars using the Coinvoice interface.  When the client paid the invoice in dollars, Coinvoice would settle the transaction by converting them into bitcoins using the Bitstamp price at 9:00 on the morning that it received funds from the client. It charges a 3.99% commission, and then, the Coinvoice user is paid.  Because users cannot control when their clients pay them, this makes them vulnerable to the volatility of the market, perhaps more so than someone trading on an exchange, who gets to decide when they buy and sell their bitcoins.  ""This is something that people have already accepted, and people that want to use bitcoin for all its other benefits have already made that calculus,"" Tobin said. ""There really is nothing you can do to guard against exchange volatility.""  The benefits will outweigh the risks to some companies, he asserts. Coinvoice is dealing with an Argentinian company which welcomes the chance to be paid in bitcoins. It has some industrial clients in the US.  ""With the currency controls limiting their ability to transfer dollars into Argentina, they are losing a significant percentage of every payment,"" he said. Bitcoin is a useful alternative.  The service will also appeal to freelancers who generally prefer to be paid in bitcoin, Tobin added.  What should those freelancers do about tax? The Inland Revenue Service has issued only sketchy guidance on virtual currencies and economies, and Tobin says that the company will not give its own guidance to customers.  However, it will enable them to set tax on their invoices, and will pass on those tax payments to its customers from their clients.  The service includes a dashboard that allows Coinvoice customers to see every transaction that they have submitted.  However, there is not yet a facility to run reports (in the same way that you might with FreshBooks, a traditional fiat invoicing system). This is something that the site hopes to introduce in the future.

42376614,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTYd,1381327895,Kraken partners with Fidor Bank to offer bitcoin trading services in the EU,"Digital currency exchange Kraken has forged a partnership with Munich-based Fidor Bank to offer its European customers regulated bitcoin trading services.  Jesse Powell, CEO of Payward Ltd, which is the developer of Kraken, said the exchange has found its ""ideal partner"" in Fidor Bank.  He described the bank as a ""responsible, forward-thinking financial institution"" and praised its desire to combine the ""predictability and stability of traditional banking relationships with the social and economic benefits of new digital currencies"". Powell added:  ""From the beginning, our goal has been to establish bitcoin and other digital currencies as legitimate complements to the euro, the pound and other traditional, government-issued currencies.""  Kraken is now looking to offer its services outside the EU by cooperating with financial industry partners and regulatory authorities across the world.  This isn't the first bitcoin company Fidor has partnered with – back in July the bank teamed up with German bitcoin marketplace bitcoin.de, which is operated by Bitcoin Deutschland GmbH.  Upon the announcement of this partnership, Oliver Flaskämper, managing director of Bitcoin Deutchland GmbH, said: “With Fidor Bank AG as our partner, the digital bitcoin currency, which was initially smiled at as internet play money, is increasingly turning into a serious alternative currency after only four years.""  Fidor Bank says its long-term goal is to bring important market innovations to its customers. Matthias Kröner, CEO of Fidor, said the bank has noticed digital currencies start to emerge as ""serious and useful alternatives to government-issued currencies"".  ""With Kraken, we can enable our customers to trade bitcoin and other digital currencies just as securely, easily and flexibly as they trade other foreign currencies today,"" he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/09/kraken-partners-with-fidor-bank-to-offer-bitcoin-trading-services-in-the-eu,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1aae65e709380a620ff33773eccb34d3f333b35-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376637,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTu1,1381320929,Bitcoin: freeing coffee from the middlemen,"From among the jungles and rice paddies of central Bali, Indonesia, a website popped up last week selling freshly roasted coffee beans from local producers. Technology and travelers have made direct-from-source coffee popular for a while now, but this operation has a unique point: it will trade beans only for bitcoin.  The business is The Roast Station Project and leading it is JB Allen, aka the 'Java Nomad'.  It's not his first e-commerce foray. Allen became internationally mobile by ""taking full advantage of the freedom the internet provides ... creating and marketing online educational courses, software and other B2B tools"" on the more traditional market. Along the way he dabbled in e-currencies by paying employees in Second Life's Linden Dollars.  Allen's lifestyle has hauled him through 20 countries, living in South Korea, Japan and New Zealand before finding himself in the town of Ubud. Bali's tourist scene is a mixture of Western travel cultures, and Ubud's industry caters more to eco-tourists and yoga instructors than the neon-drenched binge-seekers on the beaches further south.  Allen is one of a growing number of laptop-powered entrepreneurs to make a home, or at least a string of temporary bases, in Southeast Asia.  In 2010s parlance, they're digital nomads, Lifestyle Businesspeople, Tropical MBAs or just location-independent CEOs. Whatever names they choose or reject, this class of adventurers follows a similar path to the hippy backpackers of the 1970s but with a decidedly more entrepreneurial bent.  The Asian tropics provide as many cheap workspaces as beaches, an affordable IT-trained workforce, decent bandwidth and proximity to a large proportion of the world's manufacturing centers. Even for those not producing physical goods, the atmosphere and cost of living are magnetic enough.  They also tend towards a libertarian worldview, tired of the borders and bureaucracies and, above all, local currencies they encounter on a regular basis.  Interest in digital currency  ""I've been a follower of digital currencies for years, including earlier gold backed digital currencies like e-gold and convertible game currencies such as the Linden Dollar,"" said Allen.  ""In fact, years ago I'd hire writers from inside of Second Life to create website content for my clients. I would interview, hire and pay the writers all from within the game with the in-game currency, and my real-world clients then paid me in 'real' money. I think this was the first proof to me that an all-digital currency was completely viable.""  ""I began noticing references to bitcoin pop up on many of the free market/libertarian blogs and websites I follow about a year and a half ago. Soon after, I downloaded my first wallet and started 'playing' with the currency – this is back when it was trading around USD$8 for one BTC. I purchased some, locked them away in a wallet and then just kept up on the news, always keeping an eye open for a way I could make good use of their potential.""  Allen found the catalyst for that after arriving in Indonesia and becoming involved with the world of coffee. He saw how middlemen within the coffee trade ecosystem serve as a series of barriers that distance bean growers from their final consumers: coffee connoisseurs like home baristas, specialist roasters and cafes offering high quality, single-origin and estate coffees to their customers.  Loans to farmers by brokers and middlemen from large corporate buyers force them to sell massive quantities of product for a bargain basement price. With time pressures and prices so low, there is little incentive to produce a higher quality harvest. The end result is low-quality, unripe or even rotten beans finding their way into consumer packaging.  Smaller buyers can always find farmers or co-ops willing to raise quality in a portion of their crops for a premium price, and work directly with them. The Roast Station Project sources its Kintamani Arabica beans from one such location. But as Allen says, ""there is still a planet full of coffee growers and coffee fanatics who would benefit from fewer middlemen in the way.""  Removing the middlemen  One thing bitcoin does quite handily is remove lots of middlemen.  ""Bitcoin has opened the door to a whole new level of person to person exchange and individual freedom, which is one reason why I wanted to be involved,"" said Allen.  ""I imagine a world where a large coffee farm or the head of a farming co-op can deal directly with both smaller end-buyers and even the larger multinationals on a much more level playing field if they could sell, trade and auction their coffee directly via bitcoin. If they can accept a 'currency' that's used by buyers from many different countries – and then use or convert that currency in their own area – everyone benefits.""  Allen absorbed as much knowledge of the local coffee industry as possible: visiting local farms to learn about production, meeting dealers to learn about processing and pricing, and getting to know roasters and cafe owners to learn about flavor profiles and the retail side of the equation.  He purchased his own small-batch gas roaster (a 1.2kg w600 designed in Indonesia) to begin roasting the different coffees he sourced direct from the farms. That's when his 'hobby' started to become a full-time passion.  ""Word got out quick and many people began visiting and sampling my coffees, and I found myself roasting a lot for my neighbors here and also shipping a lot out as gifts to my friends and family all over the world. This wasn't done as a business though – so I haven't yet sold coffee for fiat currencies.""  Allen needed something more substantial to convince the locals of bitcoin's benefits, so the Roast Station Project exists now to prove a point. He needed to show them customers would not only pay a premium price for coffee roasted and shipped immediately from the source, but they would also use an unfamiliar electronic currency to make fast, secure transactions.  The Roast Station Project might be only a week old, but a few posts on the bitcoin Reddit feed has seen it ship several orders, all within 72 hours of roasting to arrive anywhere in the world within 12 days, ""at the peak of freshness.""  ""To me it's just natural that a product like really good coffee would be of interest to fellow bitcoiners. Nearly all of the laptop nomads, location-free entrepreneurs and traveling programmers I know are coffee fiends and are familiar with bitcoin,"" Allen said.  ""I'm able to live the way I do because of technologies that encourage international trade, cross cultural communication and individual freedom. Bitcoin helps with all of that – at a whole new level.""",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/09/bitcoin-freeing-coffee-from-the-middlemen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e359f895fe3eeb6b3ea190cc2f833860b537e00d-1000x741.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376612,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bPC9,1381310458,Why do so many Chinese bitcoiners use Linux?,"Unlike commercial operating systems such as Windows or Mac OS X, Linux stands alone because of its unique nature. One of the major benefits of using this OS is that it is open source, meaning that the underlying source code may be used, modified, and distributed as its users see fit.  There are very specialized flavors of Linux such as Bedrock, which can utilize the benefits of various other Linux distributions. Then there are companies like SuSE that provide enterprise-grade Linux for those, mainly corporations, looking for a high degree of stability in server functionality.  But why is it that a higher percentage of bitcoin enthusiasts in China than anywhere else seem to use Linux to download the bitcoin client (Bitcoin QT)?  Take a look at the statistics below and you’ll see that over a third of users downloading the bitcoin client in China chose the Linux version in August alone.  Compare that to the US or UK, which only had a 5% download rate.  Since August up until this week, Chinese users have downloaded the Linux client 17% of the time, tops for the five major countries overall that download it.  It’s not because of regular, everyday use  At first glance, one might think that the reason why so many users in China are on Linux is because Windows is so expensive to use. Why pay for Windows when you could just use Linux? That does seem logical, but that’s not the real reason.  Anyone who is familiar with China's lax laws regarding copyright protection knows that all you have to do is go down to the local pirated DVD seller and a Chinese language version of Windows is available for cheap.  This is further substantiated by operating system browser usage in China. It’s clear that the majority of Chinese internet users are not using Linux when you take into account StatCounter data, generally respected as a good source for statistics on browser versions and thus as a subsidiary operating system usage.  What the Chinese are using the Linux bitcoin client for  It becomes pretty obvious after looking at a few factors that the only reason the Chinese are overwhelmingly using the bitcoin client on Linux for mining coins is to solve cryptographic problems in order to unlock additional units of BTC. And that makes sense because resources can be better pooled using Linux than with other operating systems.  This may be one of the biggest indicators that it is the Chinese who may be the biggest miners of bitcoin overall, and that shouldn’t be surprising to anyone who has been following the ASIC mining race.  Hunter Sherman, a software developer working on content distribution and data gathering solutions, believes that the Chinese are simply harnessing the computing power of older hardware.  “Bitcoin mining is about raw CPU, so a bunch of two year old machines running a low overhead OS like Linux have more power and is an overall cheaper solution then a new PC. They can also throw the money spent on Windows or OSX at more hardware,” says Sherman.  The incentive to mine  Ankur Nandwani, a bitcoin enthusiast running the open BitMonet microtransaction project, believes that Linux's open nature is a component to the rise in mining in China.  This was widely reported in a recent article called ""Bitcoin Mania Grips China"" for Bloomberg Businessweek.  ""Being open-source, miners can easily optimize Linux for bitcoin mining"", says Nandwani. ""Also people have written drivers that enable Linux to run on different ASIC's, so that might be another reason motivating miners to use Linux.""  Linux and its relative technological freedom could also be considered a counterbalance to what China has done for some time to control its currency, the yuan.  ""Currency controls seem to be the driving force behind the growth of bitcoins in China,"" says Nandwani. ""Also, considering that bitcoin might become really popular in the future, the Chinese government might be further incentivized to promote mining in China.""  Conclusion  It would seem that, given the Chinese government's history of controlling the value of its currency, it would not readily embrace the idea of bitcoin. It's not something they can control, though, and that is perhaps why instead of enacting rules regarding it they have tacitly accepted it.  One way they expressed this was by showing a documentary about bitcoin on national television. Yet China's central bank has issued warnings on virtual currencies in the past.  Tencent QQ, the popular instant messaging service with over 798 million active users, has its own virtual currency called Q Coin. QQ users trade in Chinese yuan for Q Coin to purchase mostly virtual goods. But it has also been traded amongst QQ members and used to buy real-world products and services.  This has led the government to issue a warning regarding the use of Q Coin to launder money through it by taking illegitimately earned money and trading it through the virtual currency.  Bitcoin has this same propensity, and China would have a harder time controlling that than to simply tell Tencent, the operator of QQ, to simply shut down Q Coin.  What do you think about bitcoin in China? Do you think that the government there will accept bitcoin long-term? Do they have a choice? Let us know in the comments.
