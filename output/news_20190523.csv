42381933,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qIIV,1558635945,Coinbase Opens DAI Stablecoin Trading to Retail Customers,"Crypto exchange Coinbase will now let its retail customers buy or trade the DAI stablecoin, so long as they don't live in New York.  The exchange announced Thursday that it was adding DAI on its website, as well as its Android and iOS apps, letting customers buy, sell, convert, trade or store the stablecoin.  Customers in every jurisdiction – except New York initially – can now access the cryptocurrency, which runs on top of the ethereum blockchain.  Although Coinbase did not explain why the token is not yet available in New York, it may be waiting on approval from the state's Department of Financial Services, which in the past has reserved the right to approve tokens before they are listed on exchanges.  Unlike other stablecoins, DAI is backed by collateral on the MakerDAO platform, but still seeks to maintain a peg to the U.S. dollar, the exchange noted, adding:  ""The relevant whitepapers explain that MKR and DAI tokens form a paired set of assets in which MKR provides governance, and DAI is a decentralized, collateral-backed stablecoin.""  Other stablecoins, such as the Gemini Dollar or the Paxos Standard, are backed on a 1:1 basis by dollar holdings.  Peg problems  The stablecoin has notably had difficulty maintaining its peg in the past, with MKR token holders voting repeatedly to increase the so-called ""stability fee"" in an effort to ensure that DAI continues to hold its peg.  As a result, the stability fee, which acts as a sort of interest rate on new DAI issuance, came close to 20 percent over a period of five months.  Borrowers pledge ether as collateral to take out DAI; when they want to get their ether back, they have to return their DAI, plus the stability fee, payable in MKR or DAI. Hence, increasing the stability fee incentivizes borrowers to return their DAI, reducing the supply on the market and theoretically driving their price back up to $1.  More recently, token holders voted to decrease the fee, but this decrease failed to activate due to a lack of voter turnout. As of press time, the fee remains at 19.5 percent.  DAI became available to Coinbase Pro, the exchange's platform for day traders, in December, but now even entry-level users can buy it too.

42381936,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qIJl,1558630801,Coinbase's Merchant App Hits $50 Million in Volume Since 2018 Launch,"People really do seem to be buying things with cryptocurrency.  Announced today, Coinbase Commerce – the exchange unicorn's app for online retailers – has exceeded $50 million in transactions since launching in February 2018.    ""Volumes really started picking up in Q2 [2019],"" Justin O'Brien, the product lead for Coinbase Commerce, told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""They've been on an upward trend since we launched.""    Coinbase Commerce allows merchants to easily accept crypto and is built to integrate with existing payment flows. At launch, the product was already integrated with e-commerce giant Shopify.  Coinbase Commerce is now also integrated with Magento, OpenCart, PrestaShop and WooCommerce. To use Coinbase Commerce, merchants need to set up an account and create a non-custodial wallet for receiving cryptocurrency.  At the beginning, O'Brien noted, it was a minimum viable product meant for crypto enthusiasts. Now, he said, it should have all the features a merchant could want, which makes adoption easier. Once merchants join the network, he said, they tend to keep their accounts live.  While Coinbase Commerce has built an experimental point-of-sale feature, this has really been a product operating in the e-commerce realm. Primarily, it's been serving the crypto industry – for example, companies providing portfolio management tools or taxation services.  But there are some non-crypto companies joining the network as well. Said O'Brien:  ""We have a grocery store in Madagascar that's accepting cryptocurrency with Coinbase Commerce.""  More coins, more features  Payments received via Coinbase Commerce go to the wallet and remain as crypto. In order to shift funds to fiat, merchants need to withdraw the cryptocurrency and sell it.  At launch, the service worked with BTC, BCH, LTC and ETH. On Monday, USDC – the stablecoin created by Circle and supported by Coinbase – was added to the mix.  With its last update, the service is potentially ready to accept any ERC-20 token, O'Brien told CoinDesk.  In integrating USDC, Coinbase took advantage of a new feature of Ethereum's Constantinople upgrade called CREATE2. This improves the trustlessness of Coinbase's facilitation of payments between customer and merchant, O'Brien explained.  A stablecoin gives a merchant a way to accept crypto without the fear of volatility wiping out their income, but O'Brien argued that somewhat stable prices for crypto itself have helped spur consumer usage.  When there is less volatility, O'Brien said, ""people are more likely to actually spend their cryptocurrency rather than hold onto it.""  E-commerce has been a recurring theme for the cryptocurrency sector. Stablecoin competitor Terra was initiated by a coalition of Asian e-commerce giants, primarily as a way to curtail credit card fees from eating into very thin margins.  Online payments are also seen as a major motivation behind the cryptocurrencies being developed by social media giant Facebook and messaging app Telegram.

42381931,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qIEj,1558630216,SEC Sues Alleged $26 Million 'Crypto' Ponzi Scheme Operator,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing a California resident on charges of selling unregistered securities and conducting a Ponzi scheme disguised as a cryptocurrency.  The SEC announced Thursday that it had filed for an injunction against Daniel Pacheco, claiming that he sold unregistered securities through IPro Solutions LLC and IPro Network LLC, giving investors ""points"" which they could theoretically convert to PRO Currency, a digital asset affiliated with the companies.  Pacheco allegedly raised $26 million through the scheme.  Moreover, investors in the project could earn extra points or cash commissions by recruiting new members to the network, a common facet of Ponzi schemes.  In a statement, Michele Wein Layne, director of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office, said that the respondent ""hid an old fraud under the guise of cutting-edge technology,"" adding:  ""He enticed investors by offering them the opportunity to speculate in cryptocurrency, when in fact he was simply operating a pyramid scheme.""  Pacheco allegedly used the funds he raised to purchase a $2.5 million home and a Rolls Royce, resulting in him being unable to pay his investors' cash commissions or other bonuses.  In its release, the SEC said that ""Pacheco’s offer and sale of IPro instructional packages constituted an unregistered sale of securities because the IPro instructional packages involve (i) an investment in a pyramid scheme; and/or (ii) an investment in the PRO Currency digital assets, and therefore must be registered with the SEC unless an exemption applies.""  In its actual complaint, the SEC also lists seven entities or people that allegedly possess funds belonging to IPro's investors, though they are not accused of any wrongdoing.  Data site CoinMarketCap lists a ProCurrency, trading around 0.196 cents as of press time. However, it is unclear whether this is the same cryptocurrency involved in the scheme.

42381948,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qIYr,1558629929,Vitalik Proposes Mixer to Anonymize 'One-Off' Ethereum Transactions,"""We need a first step toward more privacy,"" Vitalik Buterin, founder of the ethereum blockchain network, said Wednesday.  In a new HackMD post, Buterin detailed a design to help obscure ethereum user activity on the blockchain. More specifically, Buterin proposed a ""minimal mixer design"" aimed at obfuscating user addresses when sending fixed quantities of ether (ETH).  According to Buterin, users can transact in one of two ways. ""The default behavior"" is to send and receive ether from a single account, which, of course, also means that all of a user's activity will be publicly linked on the blockchain. Alternatively, users can transact through multiple accounts or addresses. However, this too isn't a perfect solution to obfuscating user activity on the blockchain.  ""The transactions you make to send ETH to those addresses themselves reveal the link between them,"" detailed Buterin in his post.  As such, by creating two smart contracts on ethereum – ""the mixer and the relayer registry"" – users can opt-in to making private transactions on the ethereum blockchain through what is called an anonymity set.  Buterin told CoinDesk in a follow-up email:  ""Anonymity set is cryptography speak for 'set of users that this thing could have come from.' For example if I sent you 1 ETH and you can't tell who exactly it was from but you can tell that it came from (myself, Alice, Bob or Charlie), then the anonymity set has size 4. The bigger the anonymity set the more privacy you have.""  Buterin added that the design does not require any changes to ethereum on a protocol level but could be something implemented by a group of users today.  To this point, Eric Conner, product researcher at blockchain startup Gnosis, noted that a key strength of Buterin's proposal was precisely its ease for integration.  ""Strengths are it gives us a solid privacy solution if users want it,"" Conner explained. ""The goal is to make a solution that can be easily integrated into current wallets.""  At the same time, the design proposed by Buterin does require users to pay a fee – called gas cost – in order to send private transactions. However, for the use cases that Buterin envisions in his mind the fee won't be a major deterrent for users.  Buterin tweeted about the design:  ""The main use case I'm thinking of is a one-off send from one account to another account so you can use applications without linking that account to the one that has all your tokens in it. So even though it is a 2m gas cost, it only needs to be paid once per account, not too bad.""

Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Bank of Russia, said Thursday that her institution is to review a proposal for the development of the cryptocurrency.  Nabiullina said at the nation's lower house, or Duma:  ""As for mutual settlements, we will consider, of course, [the] proposal on ... a gold-backed cryptocurrency. But, in my opinion, it is more important to develop settlements in national currencies,"" she said at the State Duma.  She added that fiat currency settlement systems within the Eurasian Economic Union are improving and have ""good dynamics.""  The news is perhaps surprising, as Russia's government has been famously anti-crypto in past years, moving to block foreign exchange platforms from the country in 2017 and even blocking media sites that covered the topic back in 2015. A minister once said that Russia would never make cryptocurrencies legal.  However, the nation has softened its stance somewhat in more years, with moves to legislate around cryptocurrency starting in 2017. A digital assets bill could be passed this current session of the Duma, TASS indicates.  According to today's report, Nabiullina said that, while it may mull the use of the gold-backed cryptocurrency, the central bank is against the use of cryptocurrency in Russia's monetary system.

42430548,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvWph,1558618214,Japan Scrutinizing Crypto Exchanges Ahead of G20 Summit,"Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is said to be scrutinizing cryptocurrency exchanges in the country to ensure anti-money laundering (AML) processes are in place.  A report from the Nikkei Asian Review on Wednesday, citing an unnamed FSA official, said that inspections are being carried out ahead of the G20 summit next month. The G20 – the international forum of which Japan holds the presidency for 2019 – is planning measures to crack down on money laundering using cryptocurrency and, hence, the country aims to ensure that it has its financial house in order, they said.  Adding to the pressure, global money-laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), will review Japan’s domestic money laundering laws this autumn – an investigation that will include cryptocurrency platforms.  Cryptocurrency exchanges are, therefore, being asked by the FSA to clearly explain what measures they are taking to prevent money laundering, such as verifying user IDs to prevent anonymous transactions.  Last month, cryptocurrency exchanges Huobi Japan and Fisco were reportedly investigated by the FSA to assess their customer protection and AML provisions.  The FSA official said in today's report:  ""We'll continue with the on-site inspections, and we'll make sure everything is sound.""  Japan is also trying to make improvements after receiving the FATF's lowest rating for customer identification processes at financial institutions in 2008, the official added.  The FATF published a draft document earlier this year, proposing a number of measures that national governments should adopt to more effectively supervise cryptocurrency transactions, and therefore lower money laundering risks.  Japan has already been making moves to tighten up the crypto industry. The nation passed a law in April 2017 that brought cryptocurrency exchanges under AML/know-your-customer (KYC) rules and mandated that such platforms must be licensed. The law also notably recognizes bitcoin as a legal method of payment.

The issue of domain registrars booting objectionable platforms surged into public view after GoDaddy removed social network Gab following the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting last October.  “In the old world, GoDaddy is the custodian,” Kam said. “In this world, you control the domain yourself and no one can take it from you.”  When asked if censorship-resistant websites may offer a safe haven for toxic content or illegal use cases, Kam said:  “Similar comments were made about bitcoin early on as well. The reality is the nefarious purposes are not the main purposes.”  Users of the service control their own .zil domains, which are stored in a wallet, just like a cryptocurrency. The service is built on the Zilliqa blockchain and the website content itself is stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or other decentralized storage networks, according to the company.  Importantly, Unstoppable’s .zil domains can also serve as human-readable addresses for accepting a variety of cryptocurrency payments.  “Unstoppable in the short term is solving the largest crypto UI problem, creating human-readable addresses, and, long-term, providing the toolset for creating and maintaining uncensorable websites,” Boost VC partner Brayton Williams told CoinDesk. “The way all companies have traditional website domains today, all individuals will have unique blockchain domains in the future for all info and payments.”  The San Francisco-based company was previously funded by the Boost-led $730,000 seed round in December 2018, as well as grants from the Ethereum Foundation (as BrowsEth) and the Zilliqa Foundation. The partnership with Zilliqa led to the creation of the .zil domain extension, which is set to go live after a domain auction in June.  “By decentralizing domain names, Unstoppable Domains has the potential to spread free speech around the world,” Tim Draper, managing partner of Draper Associates, said in a statement.  Kam said the company could potentially offer more domain extensions in the future, though currently .zil is the only one available. The company’s website offers regular .zil domains for $10 and premium domains for $250. Kam declined to share current user numbers.  Added Boost’s Williams:  “The Unstoppable team has proven their ability to ship quality product that has closed contracts with partners and generated significant revenue.”  CEO Matthew Gould and CTO Braden Pezeshki photo via Unstoppable Domains",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/23/decentralized-domain-registry-raises-4-million-from-draper-boost-vc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0299205eb98053b42a98c04a88ef82d8992a59f1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430564,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvXBh,1558616441,"DeFi Pioneer Compound Partners With Coinbase Wallet, Zerion for V2 Launch","HODLers looking for returns on their crypto now have more flexibility in the Compound app.  The decentralized finance (DeFi) pioneer's latest version launched Thursday with a number of new features, including tokenization of user deposits.  ""Version 2 allows the protocol to support every traded ethereum asset, as well as enable developers to more easily build applications on top of the protocol,"" Compound founder Robert Leshner told CoinDesk.  Compound is a lending platform that gets its principal from people who want to earn money from their crypto holdings without selling. Rates are set algorithmically by supply and demand on the protocol. For borrowers, it's a fast way to borrow crypto (typically for trading) at clear, publicly stated prices. This is especially useful, for example, for shorts.  In Version 1, users could deposit any of five tokens – ETH, BAT, DAI, REP and ZRX. With this new version, USDC will be immediately available and a total of 50 tokens will be available for depositing and lending by year's end.  Institutional-friendly  Tokenizing deposits should make it more attractive for potential institutional depositors.  Leshner explained that Version 2 will create a token for each deposit someone makes. So depositing BAT will yield cBAT. Anyone who returned cBAT to Compound will get back their original BAT plus whatever interest those deposits had earned.  Additionally, Compound has managed to engineer the smart contract in such a way that all cBAT are fungible.  These tokens are tradeable, though Leshner does not expect many users to take advantage of that functionality early on. More likely, the chief use case will be cold storage.    ""Institutions aren't using web apps with MetaMask,"" Leshner said, referring to the popular ethereum browser extension. Instead, Leshner says institutional dev teams can build ways to put their Compound tokens into cold storage, giving them much higher security.    Developer-ready  Compound wants to be wired into other apps.  Previewed on Medium in April, the vision for Compound has always been interoperability with third-party applications. This functionality has been enhanced with the new version, and it already has several partners who have built the new version into their applications.  Coinbase Wallet will let users see their balance on Compound in the app.  Zerion will make it easy to deposit and track interest gains.  Opyn will connect Compound to Uniswap for easy margin trading.  As CoinDesk previously reported, even Compound's first version worked with Staked, a staking-as-a-service provider.  With an initial backing of $8.2 million, Compound has notable investors including Bain Capital Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and Coinbase Ventures.  Over $100 million moved through Version 1, Leshner told CoinDesk. He said that even he was surprised by the amount it was used.  Said Leshner of Version 2:  ""This is the 'real' product.""

42430567,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvXLh,1558612845,Rep. Eric Swalwell Is Accepting Crypto Donations in Bid for US Presidency,"Rep. Eric Swalwell is accepting donations in cryptocurrencies to support his bid for the U.S. presidency in 2020.  Announced Thursday by blockchain firm The White Company, which is providing the tech for the crypto donations, Swalwell will accept six supported cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, stellar, bitcoin SV and The White Company's native token White standard (WSD) – on a dedicated web page.  Speaking generally about the technology, Swalwell said:  “Blockchain can change the world, if we let it. So much of our public life now exists online, and there's no reason to believe we can’t extend this further into our democracy and our economy – from exercising our right to vote, to how we look at cryptocurrency.”  Swalwell  , 38, is a Democratic elected to represent California’s 15th Congressional district in 2012. He also serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Judiciary Committee.  The representative is already involved in affairs around cryptocurrency, recently signing a letter to the Internal Revenue Service seeking more clarity on cryptocurrency tax rules.  For the donations, The White Company said it uses a stellar-based stablecoin, allowing Swalwell to have “instant” access to funds, with transactions that are “less than a penny and settle in 3 seconds.""  Elizabeth White, founder of the startup, said:  “By enabling crypto donations, Swalwell not only makes it easier for [public] to support his campaign but also shows how he values the democratization of financial services to everyone, not just the wealthy.”  With the news, Swalwell becomes the second 2020 presidential hopeful to accept cryptocurrency donations after an announcement by Democrat leader Andrew Yang earlier this month.  Yang has also released a policy statement for crypto-assets, indicating his goal is to “create clear guidelines in the digital asset world so that businesses and individuals can invest and innovate in the area without fear of a regulatory shift.”  The White Company suggested Swalwell’s campaign donations can be made “much faster” than those for Yang, as contributors don't need to make a 30-minute compliance call, and can further donate a wider range of cryptocurrencies.  A look at Swalwell's crypto donations page suggests that to send a donation, supporters need only provide name, phone number and address, along with occupation and employer, before getting to make the transaction.

42430571,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvXNh,1558609231,Price Dip Leaves Bitcoin Exposed to $7.2K Support,"View  Bitcoin suffered a contracting triangle breakdown on Wednesday, as expected.  The range breakdown is backed by bearish developments on the daily and 4-hour chart indicators. BTC, therefore, risks falling to $7,206 (May 18 low) in the next day or two.  A UTC close below $7,206 would confirm a double-top breakdown and open doors for a drop to $6,070 (target as per the measured move method).  The outlook would turn bullish if the price finds acceptance above $8,050 in the next 24 hours.  Bitcoin (BTC) dived out of a narrowing price range on Wednesday, opening the doors for a deeper drop to $7,200.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell below $7,850 in the U.S. trading hours yesterday, confirming a downside break of a contracting triangle pattern – a series of higher lows and lower highs – created in the first two trading days of the week.  The period of indecision ended with sellers gaining an upper hand, and the resultant range breakdown neutralized the immediate bullish view put forward by the near 13 percent price rise seen on Sunday.  As a result, BTC could continue to lose altitude in the short term. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,530 on Bitstamp, representing a 4 percent drop on the day. Prices hit an intraday low of $7,468 earlier today.  Looking forward, the focus is on the key support at $7,200– a level the bulls must defend, as a break lower would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change on the technical charts.  4-hour chart  BTC dived out of the contracting triangle yesterday, validating bullish exhaustion signaled by multiple rejections at $8,300.  More importantly, the range breakdown is backed by a bearish below-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI) and a drop into bearish territory below zero on the the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram.  The path of least resistance, therefore, is to the downside.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, early signs of temporary bearish reversal have emerged in the form of a ""hanging man"" candle, as discussed earlier this week. Further, the daily MACD has turned bearish for the first time since May 2 and the RSI continues to create bearish lower highs.  BTC, therefore, could complete the forming double-top pattern seen above with a drop to $7,206 (May 18 low) in the next day or two.  A UTC close below $7,206 would confirm a double-top breakdown – a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change – and would create room for a slide to $6,070 (target as per the measured move method).  That said, the historically strong support of the 30-day moving average (MA) is currently located at $6,475. That average is seen sloping upwards to $6,500 in the next couple of days. As a result, any following sell-off could be cut short near that level.  The outlook would turn bullish if prices rise above $8,050 in the next 24 hours, contradicting the bearish developments on the short-term charts. In that case, a rally to $8,500 (June 2018 high) could be seen.

Kohari helped kickstart the bank’s wide-ranging technology transformation program structured on a bedrock of distributed ledger technology (DLT) from the point he joined State Street in September 2016. Prior to that, he spent five years as head of technology innovation for London Stock Exchange Group.  While Kohari and the co-founders of his new project are officially in stealth mode, he said that at a high level, the incipient startup will focus on the data privacy space and how enterprises interact with users in this area.  Kohari told CoinDesk:  “We are looking at how best to create a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that allows enterprises to really provide compliance to [data privacy] regulations and at the same give control of that data directly to the users. It will use both DLT and traditional types of data stores such as [Amazon Web Services'] S3. We think this is an underserved area and a great opportunity.”  Data as an asset  Kohari explained that the work he did in the open source community building a DLT backbone for State Street’s custody business informs the new privacy project. The difference is that the latter treats data itself as the asset class.  “Normally we don't think of data as an asset class,” said Kohari citing as typical examples consumers' personally identifiable information (PII) or the way data is managed in the adtech space. “It’s about how do you represent that information in such a way you allow consumers to take direct control of that data, instead of enterprises allowing it to happen via archaic interactions in emails and written communications.""  Many of Kohari’s team members have been working as maintainers of Hyperledger Fabric for some years now and adopted the open-source blockchain tech with his team at State Street. Kohari further confirmed that work on Fabric continues within the bank.  “That journey continues in full force and I'm very excited to see where that will land and the huge implications of how that changes the custody world so you can create reconciliation-less systems,” he said.

42430551,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvWxh,1558579207,Binance CEO CZ Is Suing VC Giant Sequoia for Reputational Damages,"Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao is taking a unit of Sequoia Capital back to court after the VC investor's case against him was dismissed.  The crypto exchange mogul, nicknamed CZ, claims Sequoia Capital China hurt his reputation and prevented him from raising money at favorable valuations and wants the VC giant to compensate him.  According to a filing submitted on May 20 to the High Court in Hong Kong and obtained by CoinDesk, Zhao has sent an application via his attorneys for a hearing before the court chambers on an order for ""immediate summary of assessment of damages.""  A hearing for the case, HCMP 2770/2017, will take place on June 25, according to information available on the court's website, between Zhao and SCC Venture VI, a company incorporated as a special purpose vehicle of Sequoia Capital China.  The application demands an inquiry be held to determine if Zhao ""has sustained any and what damages"" resulting from the injunction order Sequoia obtained on Dec. 27, 2017, which prevented Zhao from raising capital from other investors until March 1, 2018.  If it's decided that ""any such damage has been sustained,"" Zhao asks that Sequoia pay him the amount determined at the inquiry. (He did not suggest an amount.)  Zhao stated in the new filing:  ""The injunction order has caused loss to me for which I am entitled to reasonable compensation by Sequoia. In particular, I have suffered i) a loss of chance to raise capital through successive rounds of financing at increasing high valuations; and ii) damage to my reputation.""  Sequoia Capital China has not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment as of press time.  Zhao's punch-back follows a December 2018 decision by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, which dismissed all of Sequoia Capital's claims that Zhao had breached an exclusivity agreement when negotiating Binance's Series A equity financing.  'Abuse of process'  The case began when Sequoia Capital obtained the December 2017 injunction order in an ex parte or unilateral procedure without notifying Zhao and subsequently filed a notice for arbitration in January 2018 as a claimant against him.  Sequoia accused Zhao of breaching exclusivity by talking to IDG Capital when still in discussions with Sequoia for the Series A round.  Three months later, following an April 11 hearing, a Deputy High Court Judge ruled in a judgment on April 24 that Sequoia ""was wrong to pursue the ex parte application without notice to Zhao,"" since there was no explanation or evidence as to why no efforts were made to involve both parties.  ""I agree that the use of the ex parte procedure without notice to D. [Defendant, Zhao] was an abuse of process,"" the judge said. ""If the Injunction were not already spent, I would have set it aside on that basis alone.""  The parties then proceeded with the arbitration in the following months in 2018 with the submission of various evidence before a three-member tribunal at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center.  According to a final decision made on Dec 12, 2018, the Tribunal dismissed Sequoia's claims that Zhao had breached exclusivity based on the findings that the discussion with IDG Capital was, in fact, for a Series B round financing.      ""The Tribunal finds that that the negotiations with IDG were not in respect of a 'rival transaction' to the Series A Financing but were in respect of a proposed Series B financing transaction which was not in competition with the Series A Financing and which did not become a Series A Financing,"" the Tribunal stated in its decision.
