42381822,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pqqL,1557083972,Bitcoin's Lightning Comes to Apple Smartwatches With New App,"You can now receive bitcoin's experimental lightning payments with a few taps of an Apple smartwatch.  Launched Sunday by Bluewallet, one of the more popular lightning network wallets, their new app for Apple Watches allows users to receive bitcoin over its new, risky (but nonetheless promising) payment technology: lightning. Transactors can use the smartwatch app to generate a QR code -- a square-shaped barcode -- that someone else can then scan with their smartphone to send over a payment.  Bluewallet tweeted a sneak peek of the app weeks ago. But as of today, it's officially downloadable from the iTunes store.  Product and UX engineer Nuno Coelho framed the app as an experiment, telling CoinDesk:  ""It's a small experiment we're doing to put wallets on the watch. The first releases will be simple, allowing you to receive lightning payments.""  Why might someone want to receive lightning transactions via a smart watch? you might ask. Smart watches aren't as popular as smartphones, but many use them for the convenience of tracking health and viewing phone notifications without actually pulling out the phone.  Bluewallet, to that end, is testing to see if users might like to use them for bitcoin payments as well.  ""Sometimes the convenience of just [receiving bitcoin] with two taps from your wrist can be a relevant user experience, specially on the go or if you need to be fast,"" Coehlo said, adding it might be useful if you're buying bitcoin from someone, but ""don't feel comfortable"" taking out your phone, you could just use the watch instead.  But Coehlo stresses that this is an experiment, since lightning technology itself is still very experimental, and they're not sure how many users will actually want to use the app.  ""If feedback is good, we'll spend more time on the project,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It's a very early stage industry so we're trying to figure out how to build this stuff properly.""  Bluewallet, helmed by a team of three developers, is also working on other features to expand the wallet. ""We would also like to move from being a third-party service, minimizing trust. That's our most important goal at the moment,"" Coehlo said.

On May 4, Renrenbit, a crypto-lending application founded by Bitfinex shareholder Dong Zhao, started taking in pre-orders from users who want to participate in the public phase of the exchange’s upcoming $1 billion token sale.  Zhao said Bitfinex is aiming to list the exchange token, dubbed LEO, for trading in about a week after the token offering completes, and that Bitfinex and iFinex will not hold any LEO tokens.  According to Renrenbit’s official Telegram channel, retail investors who have completed know-your-customer verification on the application are already committing each up to $1,000 worth of tether (USDT), the crypto stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar operated by Bitfinex’s affiliated company Tether.  Users with more than $1 million worth of USDT on Renrenbit, however, are considered accredited investors and will not have limitations on the maximum commitment for pre-orders.  Notably, it was Zhao who suggested Bitfinex to conduct an exchange token offering as a way to solve the issue of $850 million being frozen after a lawsuit from the New York Attorney General’s Office. The move also comes just a day after Zhao disclosed via his Weibo account a summarized draft white paper for Bitifnex’s offering of its LEO token, which is aimed to raise $1 billion via a private sale closing on May 10, after which a public sale will take place if it’s not yet fulfilled.  However, it’s not yet known at the moment when the public sale, if it happens, is scheduled to complete. Zhao declined to share how many pre-orders its platform has gathered since the effort began or how many tokens in total his platform will offer on behalf of its users.

Ripple announced the news last week, saying that Kitao will be replacing the CEO of SBI Ripple Asia Takashi Okita.  Kitao has over 40 years of work experience in global financial markets. He established SBI Holdings in 1999 and has previously worked with Softbank Corporation and Nomura Securities, according to the announcement.  Ripple co-founder and executive chairman of the firm’s board of directors, Chris Larsen, said:  “Approximately half of our customers are located in Asia-Pac today, and we’re rapidly expanding our global footprint across the region. Mr. Kitao comes at a perfect time for Ripple as we look to deepen our customer base in Asia and beyond.”  The relationship between Ripple and SBI is not new. Back in 2016, the two firms formed a joint venture called SBI Ripple Asia. The joint venture received a license to launch its blockchain-based payments app for consumers last September, and a month later the app MoneyTap went live.  SBI Ripple Asia also formed a consortium last year to research the use of blockchain technology in securities products, aiming to improve efficiency for customers and reduce operational costs for firms.

We received the following document ""in confidence"" from a source and found it lacking in details. It also took bios for the Bitfinex founders from the original website and reproduced them verbatim.

42381827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pqvN,1557059455,Ethereum 2.0's Nodes Need to Talk – A Solution Is 'Hobbits',"Developers working to create the next iteration of the ethereum blockchain have developed code intended to help client developers boost their testing efforts ahead of the upgrade.  Ethereum 2.0  is by far the biggest upgrade on the agenda of developers said to bring massive improvements to scalability and usability on the now four-year-old blockchain network, which with its $17 billion market capitalization is the world's second-most valuable blockchain. The work on the 2.0 iteration (also known as Serenity) continues apace, and according to Fredik Harryson, chief technology officer for client developer Parity, code specifications for the initial phased roll-out of the upgrade are about half complete.  As such, while many aspects of the upgrade are still under research and presently being finalized, on April 23 new code was unveiled that, if approved and ultimately implemented, will facilitate the basic communication between nodes that run the ethereum 2.0 software.  The protocol, called Hobbits, was developed in partnership between blockchain performance testing company Whiteblock, ethereum venture capital studio Consensys, and ethereum 2.0 implementer teams Chainsafe and Yeeth.  In a blog post introducing the tech, Trenton Van Epps wrote:  “As Ethereum 2.0 clients get closer to live testnets, they’re going to need a way to pass information back and forth between each client. This occurs over a set of links called the wire protocol.”  The wire protocol gets at the heart of how these distributed networks work, because nodes pass critical information between one another -- namely transaction histories -- that compose the blockchain itself.  Speaking to CoinDesk back in February, ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin explained that a wire protocol essentially determines “the rules for what messages get sent across the network.”  “For example, if two nodes talk to each other and one node wants to sync to the blockchain or publish a block, then how do you say I want to hear about a block? How do you say I want to hear about transactions? ” Buterin told CoinDesk.  Ethereum 2.0 will be actually be leveraging a wire protocol called “libp2p” developed and maintained by San Francisco-based startup Protocol Labs, the firm behind projects like Filecoin and IPFS. However, until that implementation is fleshed out for all ethereum 2.0 clients, Hobbits is envisioned as a means to establish cross-communication between those clients who don’t have libp2p ready.  Jonny Rhea, a protocol engineer at Consensys who contributed to building Hobbits, explained to CoinDesk:  “We don’t have libp2p yet so we needed to find a minimum wire protocol, sort of like a test wire protocol, just until we can put all the pieces together.”  Libp2p  Every blockchain, Buterin pointed out at the time, has a wire protocol or “mini-language” to define how messages get transmitted and received across the network. For bitcoin and ethereum presently, the wire protocol uses what are called gossip networks.  As Buterin told CoinDesk:  ""For bitcoin and [ethereum 1.0], they’re both what we call gossip networks. Anything that’s broadcasted eventually reaches everyone but for [ethereum 2.0] we can’t do that because there’s more total messages than any single node can download.”  As such, the new ethereum 2.0 wire protocol – libp2p – will have two major benefits. It will first leverage a new protocol design called “gossipsub” to prevent the network from being flooded and congested every time a node wants to send a message.  “If I have a new block and I’m connected to six of my peers, I’ll randomly send that block to two or three of my peers,” Rhea said. “I propagate that message. Then those nodes have peers, they don’t send it back to me, but they probabilistically pick two more peer to send the message to.”  More generally, the second benefit of using a libp2p wire protocol Rhea adds is modularity.  “The nice thing about libp2p is that it is modular,” Rhea said. “Let’s say you don’t like … how one node finds another node on the Internet. That can be replaced. It can be swapped out.”  At present, according to Van Epps, there are only two implementations of libp2p for ethereum clients written in programming languages Go and Rust.  However, Van Epps notes that ""the long path to a ETH 2.0 launch hinges on having proper implementations of libp2p for each client language.""  As such, until these other implementations in programming languages such as Java, Javascript, and Swift reach completion, Hobbits will serve as a ""minimal transport spec that supports basic messaging types and allows nodes to communicate with one another.""  Rhea told CoinDesk:  ""There's a lot of [research and development] stuff that we want to be able to test. We developed this basic wire protocol so that our team, Chainsafe and any other team that doesn't have a libp2p implementation in the [programming] language their developing in can all make a [test network] and basically still be able to communicate.""
