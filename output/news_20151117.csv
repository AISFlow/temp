42378382,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i61l,1447797631,Bank of America CEO: Blockchain Interest is About Education,"Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan touched on blockchain technology during a speech in New York today, citing the innovation as an example of how his company is becoming more attuned to disruptive forces in finance.  Speaking  at the 2015 Banking and Financial Services Conference, Moynihan addressed the subject during a question-and-answer session in which he was asked about the potential for financial services to be disrupted by new technologies in a similar manner as brick-and-mortar retailers.  Moynihan remarked that he intends to foster a culture of innovation at Bank of America in order to guard against this risk to its business, going on to say:  “The question is a cultural one, of keeping your company always pressing and learning and being curious. [It’s] learning from all these companies what’s going on and why, what blockchain means versus what bitcoin meant, what the aggregators and other types of people are doing in wealth management management [with] robo-advisers.”  Though long one of the less vocal financial firms on the subject of bitcoin or the blockchain, Bank of America announced in September it had partnered with distributed ledger startup R3 to explore enterprise use cases for the technology.  As such, Moynihan went on to caution that he believes the company must be on the lookout for change, but that market observers may overestimate the pace of these transitions.  “We have to keep challenging ourselves and learn from those industries that made the mistake of being complacent,” he continued.  Elsewhere, he discussed the need to reduce costs through automation and about the power of mobile technology, which he said has changed how bank customers want to be served.  Still, he voiced his opinion that the best thing thing for Bank of America to do was to learn from new entrants into the financial services market, adding:  ""There's a ton of people trying to disrupt our industry. They’re exciting, interesting companies and we try to learn from them.""

42378383,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i60V,1447792534,European Commission to Assess Bitcoin's Role in Terrorist Financing,"The European Commission said today it is assessing whether digital currencies like bitcoin fuel terrorist financing and money laundering as part of a new security report.  In a 17th November memo, the Commission outlined its view of the state of security in the European Union (EU), a publication that comes days after more than 100 people died in a series of attacks in Paris, France.  According to the memo, the Commission is investigating terrorism financing risks in the EU following the adoption of an anti-money laundering framework earlier this year, a process it said will pay ""particular attention"" to digital currencies.  The memo stated:  ""Among the sectors under assessment, the use of virtual currencies will be subject to particular attention, as requested by the European Council of 26th January, 2015.""  Following the review period, the Commission said it will release a series of measures designed to address the risks identified during the assessment. This is expected to be completed by June 2017.  ""Member states will have to comply with such measures or explain the reasons why they ask for derogations,"" the memo read.  It goes on to outline the Commission's plan to create a blacklist comprising ""a list of countries which present some deficiencies in their anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing regimes"" and would be subject to expanded financial monitoring.  The assessment and forthcoming recommendations follow the adoption of AML and terrorism financing measures in May of this year.  Though no elements of that proposal relate specifically to digital currencies, aspects that pertain to money exchange services will likely be applied to firms that offer digital currency services.  According to the Commission, the goal of this framework is to ""ensure full traceability of fund transfers both within the EU and to and from the EU"".

42378380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i5zF,1447783226,Japanese Regulators Discuss Policing Domestic Bitcoin Exchanges,"The Japanese government is gearing up to regulate bitcoin activity more actively in the wake of the collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  Nikkei reported earlier today that members of a select panel within the country's Financial Services Agency – its top finance regulator – are looking to draft a regulatory framework for bitcoin-related businesses.  The government has indicated in the past that it intends to seek greater oversight over bitcoin businesses in response to the bankruptcy of Mt Gox. CEO Mark Karpeles has faced multiple arrests this year, bringing new attention to the 2014 collapse of the Japan-based company.  ""Japan needs an adequate oversight mechanism for virtual currencies, including ways to confirm identities and block money laundering, Financial Services Agency panel members agreed in a meeting Monday,"" the service reported.  The Financial System Council reportedly discussed registering bitcoin exchanges and adopting measures related to consumer protection.  According to the report, those at the meeting expressed openness to working with the industry and ""invited operators of virtual currency exchanges to share their knowledge and regulatory ideas"".  Reports  that the Japanese government was moving to police bitcoin activities – while simultaneously exploring blockchain concepts more broadly – emerged earlier this year. At the time, Finance Minister Taro Aso said that the government needed to ""carry out studies"" to inform the steps it would take.  The FSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42398831,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbghDG,1447779920,New €100 Million Fund Considering Blockchain Startups,"Finnish investment firm Open Ocean Capital has suggested it may consider European blockchain firms as recipients for funding raised as part of its recently closed €100 million fund.  An investor in startups including photo editing app EyeEm and phone number search tool Truecaller, Open Ocean is primarily focused on opportunities involving early-stage startups raising Series A and Series B rounds.  As part of its funding announcement, Open Ocean revealed Orchestream and Tideway Systems founder Richard Muirheadhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Muirhead would join as a partner.  Notably, Muirhead voiced his enthusiasm for the blockchain, the underlying distributed ledger on which the digital currency bitcoin is based, stating:  ”I couldn’t be more excited at its prospects for technology-fuelled and entrepreneur-led growth in the next. Forty billion-dollar tech successes in Europe since year 2000 have brought well-deserved confidence, fuelling further world-class innovation in sectors such as security, data science, blockchain and cloud infrastructure and automation.”  A blog post on the announcement suggests the fund will focus on enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS), cloud infrastructure, big data, machine learning and mobile solutions. Blockchain technology was not mentioned specifically, though a subsequent TechCrunch article cited FinTech among its areas of focus.  European Investment Fund, Finnish Industry Investment and other undisclosed institutional and private investors participated in the round.  Open Ocean did respond to requests for further comment.

42398834,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbghEF,1447773028,"CME, London Stock Exchange Form Blockchain Settlement Group","A group of banks, exchanges and clearing houses has formed a working body to discuss how blockchain technology might be used to settle transactions.  Three meetings have taken place in the past few months between the CME Group, Euroclear, LCH.Clearnet, London Stock Exchange, Société Générale and UBS, according to a report from Financial News that cited sources with knowledge of the discussions. CME Group confirmed its participation to CoinDesk, but declined to comment further. Other alleged participants did not offer comment as of press time.  The group is said to be operating under the moniker ""Post Trade Distributed Ledger Working Group"", and according to the report, the discussions are focused on ""post-trade operations"". A steering committee has also been appointed by the group to guide the process further.  A spokesperson for the London Stock Exchange told Financial News that it believes collaboration and strategic partnerships will best allow incumbent financial institutions to unlock the benefits of distributed ledgers.  ""Our view is the technology needs to be developed in a considered and rigorous manner, in partnership with clients, to provide the right service and benefit to them,” the spokesman continued, later saying that the London Stock Exchange ""has significant technical expertise to bring to the discussion"".  Representatives for Euroclear and Société Générale were not immediately available for more information. The London Stock Exchange and UBS did not respond to requests for comment.

42398822,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgh3Q,1447768807,KPCB Leads $12.5 Million Round for Blockchain Firm Align Commerce,"Blockchain payments startup Align Commerce has raised $12.5m in Series A funding led by storied Silicon Valley investment firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB).  Rounding out the all-star cast of investors were first-time and repeat firms including Digital Currency Group, FS Venture Capital, Pantera Capital, Recruit Ventures Partners and SVB Ventures, the investment arm of Silicon Valley Bank.  Founded by Marwan Forzley, a former Western Union general manager, Align Commerce is seeking to disrupt the small business (SMB) cross-border payments market, one it believes is characterized by high costs and poor customer experience. Prior to joining Western Union, Forzley was the founder of eBillme, a payments startup acquired by the remittance giant.  Forzley told CoinDesk:  ”We believe cross-border payments are broken, and using new technology to help reduce some of that friction, that’s where we use the blockchain, that’s where we get the benefits of a global payments rail.”  With this focus, Forzley asserts the product improves over traditional wire transfers for cross-border transactions as it reduces forms and fees with its solution, alongside other benefits.  ""We simplify a painful experience by allowing SMBs to enter their bank account and email address and send the money to the receiver,"" Forzley said. ""The whole experience is fundamentally different than wire, it’s designed to dumb down the whole cycle.""  The new funding, which follows an undisclosed seed round in April, will be used to expand Align's service beyond the 60 countries it serves today. Forzley declined to provide details such as the current volume transacted by the company, but suggested the funding round is proof of its success in building its business.  The funding round comes amid an overall downturn in industry investments that began in Q3 but has so far extended into Q4. At $12.5m, the Series A is the largest observed since September when Abra and Chain raised $12m and $30m, respectively.  As part of the deal, KPCB general partner Randy Komisar, a founding director of TiVo and former senior counsel for Apple will join the company’s board of directors.  Early blockchain believers  Though one of a number of firms focused on applications for bitcoin and the blockchain in payments, Align is perhaps unique in its early emphasis on the blockchain, using the language as part of its public messaging as far back as January 2015.  As noted at the time, Align’s product allows SMBs to send US dollars and for a receiver to receive euros, for example. Both end users still use traditional bank accounts, however, Align converts the sender’s funds into bitcoin, selling the digital currency at an exchange for the desired currency of the recipient.  Forzley stated that the blockchain allows Align to facilitate this process with little exposure to bitcoin's price volatility due to its number of exchange partners.  In addition, he said the blockchain allows Align to offer merchant customers other benefits, such as timely information about their money transfer.  “You can track your shipment online, but you can’t track your payment on wire. The blockchain has an elegant tracking mechanism to figure out where the payment is,” he said, adding:  “Is this new tech different from existing options? Yes, it’s cheaper, faster and more trackable.”  Disrupting correspondent banking  More specifically, Align Commerce uses its technology to replace correspondent banks in the cross-border process, which it argues results in a cheaper transaction for merchant clients.  The market positioning is similar to that of distributed payment protocol provider Ripple, which recently announced a new emphasis on the cross-border payments in October, a transition that coincided with two product launches aimed at this use case.  Forzley, however, suggested the two startups are not competing for the same customer base, despite similarities in their approach to the technology.  ""Ripple is going after the banks, we’re going after the small business market,"" Forzley explained.  He went on to state another difference was Align Commerce’s current use of the bitcoin blockchain, though he said the firm’s technology is designed to be blockchain agnostic and could use Ripple distributed ledger if required.  ""We're an application layer,"" he continued. ""We're designed so there's an API on multiple cryptos. We can swap in and out of any cryptocurrency.""  Bitcoin exchange dependency  While Align is using the bitcoin blockchain today due to its scale and liquidity, Forzley said that the startup needs to help the bitcoin ecosystem grow to supports its ambitions.  To offer its services in a certain jurisdiction, Align Commerce must be able to offload the bitcoin it sells for local currency, meaning it benefits from the availability of local bitcoin exchanges.  Forzely declined to state any specific partners, but said the bank now maintains its own bank accounts for bitcoin trading in areas with no exchange coverage.  The goal, while laudable for the ecosystem may be challenging given the current difficult climate for bitcoin exchanges, which have suffered due to the digital currency's long periods of price stability, increased competition and a pressure to lower fees in 2015.  Still, Forzley was optimistic about the coming effort. ""We'll be spending more time and more effort to expand exchanges,"" he said, concluding:  ""We think that's an important development that needs to happen in the market.""
