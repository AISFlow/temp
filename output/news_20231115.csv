42392020,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzMwX,1700092671,"NYDFS Rolls Out Stricter Guidelines for Cryptocurrency Listings, De-listings","The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has said it strengthened its guidelines for listing or de-listing cryptocurrencies in a move to beef up protections for crypto investors throughout the state, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris said Wednesday in a statement.  The updated guidelines will require crypto companies to submit their coin listing and delisting policies for NYDFS approval. The firms' policies will be measured against more stringent risk assessment standards to ensure that de-listings occur ""in an orderly way that protects consumers and minimizes market disruption,"" according to the statement.  “This guidance continues the Department’s commitment to an innovative and data-driven approach to virtual currency oversight, keeping pace with industry developments,” Harris said.  The new rules also require companies to give advance for token de-listings and to be more transparent with their customers about removing support for cryptocurrencies they once listed. In addition, the companies must formulate their policies based upon “specific business model, operations, customers and counterparties, geographies of operations, and service providers; and to the use, purpose, and specific features of coins being considered.”  The NYDFS' rollout of the revised guidance follows a feedback period that began in September.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/15/nydfs-rolls-out-stricter-guidelines-for-cryptocurrency-listings-de-listings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fec926667f19e94d3937a575e1814b989f6738d-2307x1298.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20241402,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560799,1700089213,"Ethereum Breakout: Analyst Explains Why The King Of The Altcoins Is Destined For $10,000","Crypto analyst Tony The Bull, founder of CoinChartist, has revealed why Ethereum is destined to cross $10,000. According to the crypto analyst, the king of the altcoins has its top just right after $10,000 using the Fibonacci extension. How Ethereum Gets To $10,000 In the latest issue of the CoinChartist newsletter, crypto analyst Tony The Bull used the Hurst Cycle Theory which showed cyclical reoccurrence across the ETH/USDT chart. As the analyst explains, the uptrend noticed in the Ethereum charts has usually come from the accumulation of the token. Related Reading: Stunning Correlation Emerges Between XRP And XLM, What’s Going On? Tony points out that this accumulation has always taken place “at the bottom boundary of the Ending Diagonal pattern.” The analyst further added that “Since intracycle harmonics come in twos and threes, three cycles should complete one larger cycle that concludes with a breakdown of this Ending Diagonal pattern.” Taking this Ending Diagonal Pattern into account, Tony reveals that the top of the pattern puts the ETH price at $10,000. However, this is not the only pattern that suggests that the king of the altcoins will end up beating the $10,000 level. He also pointed out that the previous ETH rally had started at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension and reached 1.414 the last time that the ETH price peaked. The analyst notes that Ethereum is once again at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension which led to a break out in the price and the same could happen here. But this time, the target is able $10,000 if the 1.414 Fib is reached again. ETH price reaches $2,019 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com ETH Moves Into Overbought Territory One interesting fact that the analyst points out in the newsletter is the fact that Ethereum is currently in overbought territory. However, where this would usually signal a bearish reversal coming for the digital asset, Tony does not believe this is the case here. Rather, he explains that a cryptocurrency being overbought usually means that it is “a powerfully trending asset.” So even though it could lead to a reversal, it does not invalidate the bullishness of that digital asset. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 8800% Ascent to $35 Cardano (ADA), Here’s When He also mentions that “the Stochastic has confirmed a 1M above 80 on the Stock.” Now, whenever this has happened for Ethereum, it has often resulted in a pushup for the price. At the same time, ETH is moving to the upper Bollinger Band. Both of these setups could paint a bullish breakout for the asset. Source: CoinChartist However, the analyst warns that for this bullish scenario to play out, the Ethereum price would have to close above $2,450 this month. If the Stochastic moves back below 20, it could invalidate it and trigger a downtrend. “But if ETHBTC can push back above 20 this will generate a buy signal on the 1M Stochastic and kickstart Ether’s over-performance above Bitcoin,” Tony concluded.

42392022,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzNBv,1700085891,"Congress Gets the Runaround From Regulators, Again","This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week, presented by TaxBit. Kristin Smith is CEO of Blockchain Association. Miller Whitehouse-Levine is CEO of the DeFi Education Fund.  The long-running scramble for control between America’s administrative agencies and our elected representatives passed another important milestone this week.  As the U.S. Treasury Department prepares to finalize a new, expanded definition of who it considers to be a “broker” subject to tax reporting obligations, Congress has yet another opportunity to show renewed vigor in its efforts to set clearer rules across many aspects of our lives touched by regulation, and reign in the metastasizing power of administrative agencies.  While the broker issue may seem narrow and important only to the digital assets industry which it targets, the process from which the new definition arose illuminates the imbalance between the power assumed by regulatory agencies and Congress’s role to set limits on such power.  As recent court rulings have shown, on issues such as regulating greenhouse gas emissions and student loan forgiveness, our legal system is putting the ball squarely back in Congress’ court with a tacit message: the power to answer these tough questions lies with our elected lawmakers. The broker issue, in particular, demonstrates the unfortunate outcomes of limited checks on the power of federal agencies to interpret statutory language set by Congress.  Infrastructure Act fallout  In the summer of 2021, while Congress debated the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, there was one issue that riled the entire crypto industry, and almost stopped the legislation in its tracks: how the bill’s language defined a “broker” for digital assets-related tax information collecting and reporting purposes.  At the time, many in the industry warned that the bill’s definition was overly broad and would sweep up people not actually engaged in any broker-like activity, including software developers, and force them to not just furnish information they would otherwise collect, but also to proactively collect that information from people with whom they have no relationship.  Several Senators, including the primary sponsors of the legislative package, agreed with this interpretation, though their legislative fix was not considered because amendments to the broader bill would have slowed its enactment. And thus, the future viability of the digital asset economy in the United States was delivered into the hands of the Treasury Department, with the hope that the IRS would interpret the definition as Congress meant it and leave out the breadth of entities that Congress did not explicitly intend to capture. That hope was misplaced.  If the broker rule proceeds as is, it will surely spell the near-total collapse of the crypto industry in the United States.  Fast forward two years and fears about the broker definition have come true. It’s clear that the Treasury decided to broaden the scope of what it deems a broker irrespective of the statutory language set by Congress. While there are many in the digital assets industry that do fit the natural and traditional understanding of the term “broker,” such as centralized, custodial exchanges, it is obvious that others, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) software developers and non-custodial wallet software providers, shouldn’t be swept up by this definition.  For instance, under the new definition a broker’s ""reporting"" requirement becomes, explicitly, a collection and reporting requirement because it includes ""those in a position to know"" information about other people (without explaining what “being in a position to know” actually means in practice). This contortion of the statutory language set by Congress gives the IRS a comically wide brush to paint any number of persons and entities as “brokers.”  See also: Coin Center on the Proposed IRS Broker Rules | Tax Week 2023  Under this perspective, who isn’t a broker? As the comment period for the rulemaking closed this week, more than 120,000 letters had been submitted, a staggering amount demonstrating the real impact the application of this updated definition would have for real people.  Broad interpretation  This type of broad interpretation of powers at regulatory agencies happens often. In some cases, it is understandable to rely on the expertise of agency staffers to design and implement complex rulemakings to address subject matter issues. In other cases, these agencies have been deemed to have exceeded the power set to them by Congress.  The courts have agreed with the latter sentiment in several recent high profile cases, including decisions to limit the power of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate some sources of greenhouse gas emissions and the ability of the federal government to forgive a meaningful amount of outstanding student loan debt. While many conservatives have cheered these decisions, it stands to reason, with a different Supreme Court makeup and later Democratic presidents, that there will be future decisions on regulatory power that will displease those same people.  See also: Cryptocurrency Industry's Objections to Proposed U.S. Tax Rules to Be Heard  The issue is that executive orders, guidance documents and rulemakings might reflect the current administration's priorities but that none can actually change the laws on the books, leading to endless rounds of disputes and protracted litigation. Tit for tat governance creates whipsawing national policy, undermining the rule of law and continually raising the stakes of each presidential election. No small-d democrat should want to see this dynamic continue.  In the instance of the broker definition, the issue is stark: Congress continues to try to fix the issue — including Rep. Patrick McHenry’s Keep Innovation in America Act, a bill that aims to narrow and refine the definition of a broker — while the Treasury Department seems intent on ignoring those aims. This is simply undemocratic, subverting the will of our elected representatives, and causing unnecessary harm to the growing digital assets economy.  If the broker rule proceeds as is, it will surely spell the near-total collapse of the crypto industry in the United States.  The issue of how to define a broker may seem small in the larger scheme of fights between Congress and the administrative state, but the battle lines on this issue make clear the stakes: who is the ultimate arbiter of how our society is governed?  Congress should wrest back the initiative from federal regulators and tip the rulemaking balance back to democratic control.

The analyst, @rektcapital, believes the recent price action on the weekly chart points to strength. Moreover, the possibility of FET bulls flowing back and driving prices above the immediate resistance level registered in early November remains elevated at spot rates. FET Remains Bullish, Up 770% From 2022 Lows Looking at the candlestick arrangement in the weekly chart, FET buyers have had the upper hand. To quantify, the coin is up 140% from July 2023 lows and may be preparing for even more upsides if prices break above $0.46 recorded in the first week of November. As it is, FET is up by over 770% from December 2022 lows when the coin plunged to as low as $0.0570. Related Reading: If Your Bitcoin Wallet Is A Product Of The 2016 Technology, You Could Be In Trouble – Here’s Why From technical analysis, FET recovered from around $0.17, representing the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the trading range established in the first half of 2023. FET prices may rise, building on the bullish engulfing bars of late October and early November 2023, breaking above $0.46. This expansion, in turn, may create the base for the next leg up to $0.60, marking 2023 highs. Despite the current rally, whether FET prices will find the momentum to retest 2021 highs of $1.20 is still unclear. Even so, as FET expands, there is a notable change in participation levels, looking at trading volume, between 2023 and 2021. Prices might be down 65% from the September 2021 peak, but associated trading volume is higher, suggesting more support. If trading volume is a leading indicator, it is highly likely that even if FET moves in a green path as @rektcapital predicts, the odds of the coin retesting 2023 and 2021 highs will be high and the uptrend possibly rapid.

42392019,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzMrP,1700082372,The Subtle Art of Slow: The CBDC Adoption Journey,"In the era of rapidly evolving monetary systems, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a new frontier.  Already live in various developing and emerging market economies — namely Nigeria (e-Naira), Jamaica (Jam-Dex), the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (DCash) and the Bahamas (Sand dollar) — these national digital currencies seek to reshape our economic interactions.  However, reactions to these fledgling systems have been a mixed bag. While central banks hoped for quickly-embracing citizen response, the reality has been a slower uptake than expected.  This slower pace may be viewed as disappointing by some, but is it really as underwhelming as it appears? Or is it, perhaps, simply reflecting another aspect of how transformative technologies often find their footing amidst hesitance and a lack of understanding? Could it be that ""slow and steady"" isn't a setback but rather a necessary, anticipated part of the CBDC adoption process?  We will address these questions in this article with lessons from history on payment innovation as well as CBDCs launched in developing and emerging market economies.  Unlike the rapid viral adoption witnessed in social media platforms and conversational artificial intelligence (AI) like ChatGPT, the cautious and gradual acceptance of CBDCs, can be seen as the standard trajectory historically observed in the introduction of novel monetary instruments, reflecting the prudence and meticulous validation typically exercised in the financial sector to safeguard stability and trust in monetary innovations.  CBDCs are navigating a path characterized by deliberation and measured, but consistent, growth. The philosophy of ""slow and steady"" isn't simply a lack of urgency by citizens to use CBDCs or a failure to kickstart into a sprint. Instead, it's also a thoughtful, measured approach that, albeit seemingly slower, is endorsed by its benefits. CBDCs aren't stepping into a void, but rather into a bustling, ever-crowded digital money landscape, making it all the more crucial to build a stable foundation amidst this clamor.  Adopting CBDCs at a slower pace contributes to sustainability, allowing for rigorous tests and updates to technology, fostering a comprehensive policy creation process and encouraging stepwise public awareness.  Through gradual CBDC adoption, central banks ensure they find their “sweet spot” in the furiously competitive arena of digital money.  Current state and the slow march of CBDCs  The slow and steady CBDC adoption can be seen in different jurisdictions worldwide. Numerous countries, including India and China, are running pilot programs to assess the viability of CBDCs. Launched CBDCs:  Bahamas: Launched Sand dollar in October 2020  Eastern Caribbean countries: Started introducing DCash in March 2021  Nigeria: Launched eNaira in 2021  Jamaica: Launched JAM-DEX in 2021  Each of these four countries has launched CBDCs with a focus on financial inclusion, yet the adoption rates remain relatively low. The following figure compares the four CBDCs.  Bahamas: Sand dollar is reported to have had an adoption rate of 7.9%. The adoption rate reflects the proportion of Sand dollars in circulation relative to the total number of Bahamian dollars circulating within the country as of 2022. Many Bahamians still prefer to use debit and credit cards instead.  Eastern Caribbean Currency Union: After the two-week outage in 2021, questions were raised about the long-term adoption of DCash.  Nigeria: The International Monetary Fund mentioned that eNaira's adoption was disappointingly low, with only 860,000 retail wallet downloads by mid-November 2021.  Jamaica: As of March 2022, there were 190,000 JAM-DEX users, with low adoption rates resulting in multiple incentives being rolled out to boost usage.  While banks and financial institutions worldwide experiment with CBDCs and launch pilot programs, it is clear that adoption remains steady, albeit slow. A key takeaway, however, is that there is a consistent and growing interest in CBDC globally, even as authorities proceed with caution.  Little by little becomes a lot: Navigating the slow adoption landscape  When assessing the adoption rate of CBDCs, it is useful to compare their trajectories to other transformative technologies or financial services that have, over time, become integral in our lives. Disruptive innovations such as credit cards, online banking and digital wallets and mobile payment systems like Google Pay or Apple Pay have all exhibited a gradual widening of their user base.  See also: CBDCs Good for Payments, Even With Competition: IMF  A comparison can be made to the introduction of other major technologies.  Modern credit cards: Invented in the 1950s, credit cards didn't see widespread adoption until decades later, as infrastructure, regulations and trust in these financial tools matured over time. For example, it wasn't until the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970 and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in 1974 that clear rules for fair lending were established, eliminating rampant discrimination. Despite skepticism and high-levels of defaulting, long-term consumer trust in credit cards was gradually built through consistent regulatory oversight and value-added services, effectively paving the way for their widespread use today.  Online banking: Internet banking was introduced in the late 1980s, but saw slow and steady adoption as concerns around online security, computer literacy and access to the internet were addressed. The journey began with United American Bank offering the first home banking service in 1980. Shortly after in 1981, New York City became a testing ground for remote services, with four major banks providing home-banking access. The U.K. followed suit in 1983 with Bank of Scotland launching the Homelink service. Stanford Federal Credit Union revolutionized the scene in 1994 by offering internet banking services to all of its customers. By 2006, approximately 80% of all U.S. banks provided internet banking services. In 2009, the world saw the establishment of its first all-digital bank, Ally Bank. As of 2022, 80% of banking customers globally use mobile banking technology regularly, signifying the constant evolution of online banking.  E-wallets: Digital wallets and mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay experienced a similar journey, gradually making headway in the market as people became aware of their convenience, versatility and security. Adoption rates skyrocketed as more merchants began accepting mobile payments and e-wallets became more user-friendly.  Reasons for slow adoption and roll-out  Consumer behavior: Adopting new technology takes time as people need to become familiar with and trust the technology, especially when dealing with finance matters.  Infrastructure development: For CBDCs or other developments to succeed, a robust and scalable infrastructure must be in place to support them. Building this infrastructure is an incremental process.  Policy and regulation: As novel technologies emerge, governments and regulatory authorities need time to formulate relevant policies, ensuring the protection of users and maintaining market stability. The establishment of such frameworks can take time and require constant revision as technology, usage and interactions with numerous components of the monetary ecosystem mature.  Competition: Disruptive innovations often enter markets with already established solutions (e.g., cash, existing digital payment systems). It takes time to convince users that the new products or services are worth changing their habits for.  Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet: Benefits of gradual adoption  There are substantial benefits to the steady adoption of technology. Patience does bear fruit, especially when it concerns something as potentially disruptive as CBDCs. Let's explore some benefits along with relevant examples:  Gradual user acceptance and learning: Slow adoption enables people to become comfortable at their own pace. They can learn about the technology, understand its implications and adapt their behavior to use it effectively. This gradual approach fosters trust and acceptance, critical for financial technologies. For instance, consider how contactless payments initially struggled with user trust; over time, as people familiarized themselves with the technology, it has become a common method of transaction in many countries.  Adequate time for testing and improvement: Slower adoption provides developers ample time to test their technology rigorously, identify flaws and make necessary improvements. Building reliable and secure technology is a process of continuous refinement. Microsoft's iterative update approach with Windows is a prime example — each version based on extensive user testing and feedback, allowing for improved security and functionality.  Thoughtful regulation and policy making: Technology often advances much more rapidly than legal frameworks can adapt. Taking time for thoughtful regulation helps ensure CBDCs operate within a legal environment that anticipates potential issues, mitigating harm to users while facilitating innovation. Careful regulation creation also offers the protection individuals need in a quickly evolving digital world towards fostering trust in new monetary mediums.  Economically stable introduction: Rapid adoption of a financially pivotal technology like CBDCs could in the most extreme case lead to economic instability. By allowing the introduction to occur slowly, economies can adapt smoothly, preventing shocks. The gradual rollout of Social Security in the U.S. during the 1930s provides an example of how major financial programs can be introduced carefully to prevent economic turbulence. This is also why (temporary) limits on CBDC holdings are a promising way to enable a smooth transition into a world with CBDC.  Slow and steady wins the race: The road to widespread CBDC adoption  While it would be convenient to have a precise time frame for CBDC adoption, it’s critical to understand that adoption isn't a one-size-fits-all process due to the varying economic contexts and technological infrastructures across countries. Instead, let's rely on indicators from the benefits discussed above.  CBDCs aren't stepping into a void, but rather into a bustling, ever-crowded digital money landscape, making it all the more crucial to build a stable foundation amidst this clamor.  If we consider the adoption timeline of technologies akin to CBDC, such as online banking or mobile wallets, we can estimate a 10-20 year timeline for CBDCs to reach maturity from inception, just as these services did. However, the landscape is different today — technology adoption rates have accelerated due to increased global connectivity and tech-savvy populations. Therefore, in an optimistic scenario, we might see widespread adoption in countries with robust digital infrastructures within the next 5-10 years.  It's critical to remember, though, that this timeframe should not be a rushed deadline but perceived as a balancing act of gradual public acceptance, regulatory readiness and technological robustness. Scaling CBDCs is less a sprint and more a patient journey to ensure stable, secure and efficient digital currencies for everyone.  Prudence over pace: How 'haste makes waste' in the realm of CBDC adoption  Let's take a moment to ponder the flip side of the coin. While the previous section highlighted the numerous benefits of a measured approach to adopting CBDCs, it's equally crucial to consider what could go awry with an approach that prioritises velocity over meticulous planning and strategic foresight.  Adoption stagnation  Adoption stagnation refers to a scenario where the uptake of CBDCs plateaus, failing to gain the intended traction among users. This could stem from various factors such as technological barriers, lack of public awareness or skepticism regarding the utility and safety of using CBDCs.  See also: Privacy Concerns Dominate CBDC Discussion at Consensus  Stagnation in adoption not only hampers the potential benefits that CBDCs can bring to the financial ecosystem, such as enhanced payment efficiency and financial inclusion but also may deter further investments and innovations in the digital currency space.  It’s imperative that central banks and policymakers actively engage in creating an environment that fosters trust, education, and ease of use to avoid stagnation and ensure gradual growth in adoption.  Loss of relevance (rise in alternatives):  The loss of relevance in the context of CBDCs pertains to the overshadowing of these digital currencies by alternative digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and other private digital currencies. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, a plethora of alternatives with potentially more attractive features, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and tokenized deposits, are emerging.  These alternatives might offer enhanced privacy, investment opportunities or global reach, which could divert attention and utilization away from CBDCs. Central banks, therefore, face the challenge of ensuring that CBDCs remain relevant, innovative and competitive beyond the initial uptake by offering distinct advantages, robust security and integrating features that align with user needs and global trends all while adoption grows steadily.  Policy objective hindrance  The hindrance of policy objectives refers to the potential impediments in achieving the desired economic and financial goals set by policymakers and central banks due to ineffective CBDC design and implementation. CBDCs seek to foster financial inclusion, and enhance payment system resilience, amongst others. However, if CBDCs fail to function as intended, due to a focus on fast adoption, it could inadvertently obstruct the achievement of these policy objectives.  Steady as she goes: Facilitating the steady growth of CBDCs  Let’s pivot towards a few key factors that can guide this gradual transition. While there are myriad factors that contribute to the successful adoption of CBDCs, in this section, we'll touch upon selected pivotal aspects, providing a glimpse into the multifaceted world of digital currency implementation and the strategic considerations that can guide a stable and well-received rollout.  Together, these elements form a solid foundation upon which the gradual and stable growth of CBDCs can be facilitated and sustained.  Continuing efforts in education and awareness  As the introduction and adoption of CBDCs require substantial time and effort, promoting education and awareness should be fundamental. Educational endeavors would focus on different aspects of CBDCs, including their benefits, potential risks and usability. By highlighting the potential benefits that could be reached with a promising CBDC design, like offline, digital, private payments and wide acceptability, stakeholders can encourage adoption.  Meanwhile, providing transparency about potential drawbacks or vulnerabilities could also help prepare end-users and limit shocks and surprises.  Maintaining a focus on technological advancements and security  To ensure steady growth of CBDCs, it's crucial to focus on technological advancements and security. Constant development and improvement in technological infrastructure can accommodate increasing transaction volumes and global usage. Safeguarding transactions with robust security practices is imperative to protect against potential threats and to instill confidence among users.  Prioritizing safety precautions and continuous upgrades will be key in maintaining trust and meeting users' evolving needs. The trajectory of CBDC adoption, like other digital innovations, is set to be intrinsically tied to the evolution and advancement of technology as a key enabler and catalyst for widespread adoption.  Encouragement of regulatory development that supports CBDC growth  Regulatory support is another major factor in facilitating the growth of CBDCs. Establishing clear, harmonized regulations is needed to provide a stable and consistent environment for growth. Central banks and financial regulators should engage in policy-making efforts that adequately protect individuals and entities against financial risks, upholding transparency while promoting innovation and advancement in this domain.  Collaboration  In the intricate web of CBDC adoption, collaboration emerges as a cornerstone, bridging the gap between conceptualization and practical implementation. Engaging merchants, commercial banks, payment service providers (PSP) and other intermediaries in the CBDC development and adoption processes is not merely a strategy but a necessity, ensuring that the digital currency seamlessly integrates into the existing financial and commercial landscape.  Merchants: Their role is pivotal in ensuring that CBDCs are accepted widely across various sectors and industries, facilitating everyday transactions for consumers. Engaging with merchants helps in understanding their needs, challenges and expectations from a digital currency, ensuring that the CBDC framework is designed to address these aspects.  Commercial banks: These entities play a crucial role in the distribution and management of CBDCs, acting as an interface between the central bank and the public. Their involvement ensures that CBDCs are not just circulated but also managed effectively, adhering to the monetary policies and regulatory frameworks.  Payment service providers: Facilitate smooth, secure and efficient transactions involving CBDCs. Collaborating with payment service providers ensures that the CBDC transactions are integrated into the existing payment networks, providing users with a familiar and efficient transaction experience.  Through a symbiotic relationship among these entities, CBDCs can be seamlessly interlaced into the financial network of society, ensuring that the transition is not just technologically sound but also commercially viable and user-friendly.  Slow and steady wins the race  The process of CBDC adoption cannot and should not be rushed. As the saying goes, ""slow and steady wins the race.""  See also: Central Banks Successfully Test Over 30 CBDC Use Cases  A gradual approach allows citizens, regulators and financial entities to understand, adapt and incorporate CBDCs effectively into the existing monetary architecture. By maintaining a consistent, manageable pace, security measures can be put in place, learning curves can be flattened and potential economic shocks mitigated.  Moreover, encouraging acceptance and support for a steady expansion pace of CBDC usage can help counter resistance that may stem from a lack of understanding or fear of the unknown. A community that accepts and comprehends the CBDC would be better equipped to integrate it into their everyday lives, making digital currencies a welcome reality, rather than an intangible concept.  As the global economy shifts towards digital innovation, recognizing the importance of a ""slow and steady"" approach will be crucial in ensuring the successful integration of CBDCs into our financial systems.  While we argue that “slow and steady” is a sound approach for successful CBDC implementation, we would also like to emphasize the need for robust value propositions. CBDCs must offer unique features that surpass the capabilities of existing monetary systems.  A CBDC that merely replicates current digital money, differing only in its central bank backing(largely imperceptible to citizens), won't attract widespread citizen use. While we support a gradual, methodical rollout, we maintain that without distinct advantages/incentives, this approach is unlikely to gain traction.

While global markets have been riding buoyancy, with investors embracing a more risk-on attitude following softer US inflation data, Bitcoin has charted its own path. Bloomberg reported since the release of the US data on Tuesday, an index of global shares surged by 2% on speculation that the Federal Reserve might halt interest rate hikes and lean towards reductions in 2024. In this context, Bitcoin has seen a decline in the short term but overall gains on the longer time horizon. Related Reading: From $35,000 To $500,000? The Bitcoin Rollercoaster This Expert Sees Ahead This unusual behavior has resulted in a significant shift in the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional stock markets. The report read: A 30-day correlation coefficient for Bitcoin and MSCI Inc.’s gauge of world stocks now sits at minus 0.23, the most negative since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020. This data corresponds with the expectation that falling bond yields and rallying equities, combined with a potential Federal Reserve policy reversal, would also benefit crypto like Bitcoin, often seen as harbingers of high-risk investment appetites. Bitcoin’s Cautious Trajectory Amid ETF Anticipation Furthermore, the dynamics of Bitcoin’s market behavior have so far proved to be notably influenced by anticipations surrounding US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investing directly in BTC. Bitcoin had already surged over 100% in 2023, fueled by optimism over regulatory approvals for these spot ETFs. In the past week, the asset has seen quite a retracement, dropping from trading above $37,000 last week to a current trading price of $36,434, at the time of writing. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, notes that the recent selloff in Bitcoin could be attributed to ‘weak hands folding,’ given the absence of sustained upward momentum over the past week. This sentiment reflects a cautious approach among investors, weighing the prospects of Bitcoin in the context of its recent performance and the broader expectations of developments such as the approval of a BTC spot ETF in the crypto space. Further Sentiments On Bitcoin Alongside Sycamore’s insights on Bitcoin’s price movements, other experts and analysts have shared their perspectives on this leading cryptocurrency. Financial commentator Tedtalksmacro pointed to a notable increase in open interest, hinting at possible significant market shifts or ‘fireworks’ ahead. Another analyst, CryptoCon, predicts a surge in Bitcoin’s price. CryptoCon analysis suggests Bitcoin is entering its fourth mid-cycle phase, a crucial period for forecasting the crypto’s future direction. According to the analyst, this phase could lead BTC to a ‘mid-top’ cycle peak, potentially reaching around $45,500. Conversely, JPMorgan analysts have expressed skepticism about the recent rally in the crypto market, suggesting it might be more speculative than substantive. Their report adopts a cautious tone, hinting that the market’s enthusiasm might not be fully grounded in strong fundamentals.

42392017,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzMmH,1700078914,Does Crypto Finance Hamas and Other Terrorists?,"Does crypto finance Hamas and other terrorists?  In the last few weeks, we’ve heard a lot of back-and-forth on this question without ever really getting a definite conclusion.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It all started with a report in the Wall Street Journal in early October claiming that Palestinian groups had received about $130 million in crypto to finance their war in Israel.  Shortly after, 100-plus U.S. lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), signed a letter to President Biden raising concerns about crypto’s role in financing terrorism. (Warren is leading efforts to pass a digital assets anti-money laundering act.)  After that, blockchain forensics groups, such as Chainalysis and Elliptic, said the numbers reported by the WSJ were likely “overstated.” (The research the WSJ initially cited was provided by Elliptic.) The estimates, Chainalysis wrote, included funds “not explicitly related to terrorism financing.”  Experts like Chainalysis argue that blockchains help reveal illicit funding flows, which is why Hamas actually disavowed crypto fundraising back in April. Its supporters were getting wrapped up precisely because they used public cryptocurrency networks, like Crystal, allowing intelligence agencies to track them.  The crypto community, led by commentator Nic Carter, has called for the WSJ to disavow its original report, lest it poison the wider debate about crypto regulation. But the WSJ has refused to do so.  And, in fact, this weekend it showed why the question of crypto financing of terrorism is so complicated.  The new report, based on findings from Israel’s National Bureau for Counter-Terror Financing, shows that Hamas has moved on from using bitcoin, instead preferring the tether stablecoin and the Tron blockchain.  Per the report:“The use of crypto by the Gaza money exchanges was more sophisticated than Hamas’s earlier fundraising efforts in bitcoin. Digital wallets connected to the companies moved funds overwhelmingly in the form of the stablecoin tether on a blockchain system called Tron, which has heightened user privacy.  To obscure the money trail, the exchanges often changed the wallet addresses they used each day, and sent funds through mixers, Israeli officials said.”Intelligence chiefs say hawala networks – informal remittance systems – have funneled millions of dollars from Iran to Hamas’s military wing and that the wallets identified and targeted by Israel are probably just a fraction of those in existence. (Mixers combine currency transactions, making them harder to trace.)  All of which shows the adaptability of terrorists to find new ways to cover their tracks. As the WSJ shows, when Hamas found bitcoin was too public, it switched to an asset and chain that offered better secrecy.  “Terrorists are not stupid. They look at the capabilities of blockchain intelligence companies and they start to understand ‘okay, well, they can track us.’ So we need to be clever,” said Nicholas Smart, head of research at Crystal, another blockchain analytics firm.  See also: Hamas Crypto Funding Likely 'Overstated' – Chainalysis  In the past, terrorists were said to have used privacy coins like monero. But because of the relatively low liquidity of such projects in secondary markets, they are less popular now. Tether, on the other hand, has a market cap of $87 billion. Smart said there are limits to what online researchers like himself can unearth.  Blockchain analysis might be good at showing the “raise,” “store” and “move” aspects of crypto transactions, but not necessarily how the money was spent. One issue with the original WSJ reporting was it quoted numbers showing the amounts of crypto raised, but not the amount that actually reached terrorists or the front lines. “Crypto solves some problems for terrorists but creates others,” said Smart.  Analytics reveals little about private peer-to-peer transactions, for instance. “It’s a big unknown how [crypto] is being used in covert channels. If there’s a Signal group between members of a terrorist group and un-hosted wallets, we can’t see that. That’s where intelligence services earn their money and understand what’s going on,” Smart said in an interview.  In other words, the inherent transparency of blockchains might help us to discover more about terrorism financing. But it’s a mistake to think it reveals everything and that analytics firms can give us the final word on whether crypto funds groups like Hamas. Smart said we need old-fashioned human intelligence allied with the blockchain type to get at the truth of these complicated funding flows.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/15/does-crypto-finance-hamas-and-other-terrorists,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48ee38f943ac8ea313d785edc8a6e30208734e6c-2482x1172.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20230213,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560797,1700078409,Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu: Which Meme Coin Is More Profitable For Holders?,"DOGE and SHIB holders have had different things to talk about in the past month. As two of the most popular meme coins, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu seem pretty similar at first glance. Both digital assets have pushed themselves to the very best as they look to upgrade from the meme token status. Everyone seems to have an opinion on which one will make holders more money, but on-chain metrics reveal different victors for different time frames. According to IntoTheBlock’s profitability metric, more DOGE holders are making money since the launch of both assets. On the other hand, SHIB dominates in terms of profitability in relation to the present market price. How Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Holding Up? When it comes to profitability, Dogecoin has proven itself to be the top meme coin for holders over the long run. Despite being a meme coin, the crypto has grown to create a strong community and is one of the top 10 in terms of market cap. Shiba Inu has also closely followed behind in terms of growth, with constant updates to its ecosystem in hopes of creating real-world value for its holders. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says MATIC Price Will Rocket Above $1.5 If This Happens In terms of price action, both cryptocurrencies have had similar gains in the past month. DOGE is up by 24% while SHIB is up by 21.5%. However, on-chain data shows a varying level of profitability for traders. IntoTheBlock’s profitability metric follows wallets that are “in the money,” “at the money,” and “out of the money.” “In the money” tracks those making a profit at the current price while “out the money” tracks those encountering losses. According to the Global In/Out of the Money, around 49% of holders are making money at DOGE’s price of $0.07394, while only 22% of SHIB holders are making money at its current price of $0.000008523. This is not surprising, as DOGE has existed for a longer time and has a higher market cap. Source: Into The Block However, IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price metric tells a different tale. This metric tracks addresses that bought around the current market price. According to this metric, 49.13% of DOGE addresses that bought between $0.062467 and $0.085278 are making a profit at the moment. On the other hand, a better portion of 59.21% of SHIB addresses that bought between $0.000007 and $0.000010 are making money at the moment.

The agency has also delayed action on Grayscale's attempt to launch a new futures-based ether ETF.  Hashdex filed to convert its bitcoin futures ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF in September. Grayscale (a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group) filed for its ether futures ETF that same month. Both filings faced initial deadlines of Nov. 17 for a decision, but the SEC today said it was extending this window, according to a pair of Wednesday filings.  The delays come amid heightened anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF approval by the federal regulator, which has so far rejected every attempt to list such a product for the general investing public. Over a dozen companies have filed to launch spot bitcoin ETFs in 2023, with several others now applying for similar products exposed to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  The regulator has yet to indicate how it might ultimately rule on the latest slate of applicants. Previous rejections raised concerns about the susceptibility of bitcoin to market manipulation and a lack of surveillance-sharing agreements, among other concerns. Applicants now say these concerns have been addressed or are no longer relevant after the approval of bitcoin futures ETFs, a view an appeals court echoed earlier this year. The SEC has so far delayed making final decisions on these applications.  Today's delays don't seem to be putting a dent in the price of bitcoin [BTC], which has moved higher by more than 5% this afternoon to $37,500.

20228527,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560843,1700074851,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Inflows Hit $1.2 Billion In Past Month,"On-chain data shows exchanges have registered Bitcoin deposits of about $1.2 billion in the past month. Bitcoin Exchange Supply Has Seen A Significant Increase In The Past Month As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, exchanges have seen hefty inflows recently. The relevant indicator here is the “balance on exchanges,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When this metric’s value rises, these platforms are receiving a net amount of deposits right now. Generally, one of the main reasons investors would choose to transfer their coins to exchanges from their self-custodial wallets is for selling purposes, so a high amount of inflows can be a sign that a selloff may be taking place in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Decline To $1,700 Based On This Pattern, Analyst Explains On the other hand, the indicator’s value going down suggests the holders are withdrawing their coins currently. The investors usually transfer their BTC to self-custodial wallets to hold onto them for extended periods. This kind of behavior, when sustained, could prove to be bullish for the price in the long term. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin balance on exchanges over the past couple of months: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent weeks | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin balance on exchanges has been rising during the past month, suggesting that a net amount of supply has been constantly flowing into these platforms. This latest uptrend in the indicator started around when BTC’s recent upward push began, a potential sign that the deposits were being made to take advantage of the profitable exit opportunity. The metric’s rise had been slow at first, but after Bitcoin’s latest adventure above $37,000, the exchanges have seen a sharp growth in their supply. This elevated selling pressure could be why the asset has slowed down in the last few days. The exchanges have received inflows of about 34,000 BTC in the past month, equivalent to about $1.2 billion at the current exchange rate. While this is significant selling pressure in the short-term, this amount is still not much in the grand scheme of things, as the total balance on exchanges is of the scale of more than 2.5 million BTC right now.

42392033,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzO1D,1700073822,The Protocol: Ethereum Layer-2s Keep Coming as OKX Apes In,"As blockchain developers head into the final stretch of 2023, a few trends stand out: the proliferation of Ethereum layer-2 networks, the ascendancy of zero-knowledge cryptography and the appearance of tokens, smart contracts and now file hosting on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Another theme gathering momentum is interoperability – the idea that all of these blockchains and layers might eventually be connected. For today's feature, Sam Kessler examines ""intents,"" a type of blockchain interaction that's rooted in the idea that the broader ecosystem of these increasingly intertwined networks could become more challenging to navigate.Everybody's doing it – launching new layer-2 blockchains atop Ethereum to provide a venue for cheap and easy transactions. This week brought the news (thanks to this scoop from our Margaux Nijkerk) that the crypto exchange Kraken may be considering its own layer-2 network, just months after rival Coinbase launched a layer-2, Base. Details below.  Also:  Protocol Village: Infura, Zircuit, Rarimo, Agrotoken, Upshot  Ordinals inscriptions activity linked to surge in Bitcoin transaction fees.  Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin puts ""plasma"" networks back in the mix.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  LAYER 2'S EVERYWHERE: In last week's The Protocol, we dedicated a not-inconsiderable quantity of ink to the fast-growing list of new ""layer 2"" blockchains aiming to provide a venue for fast and speedy transactions atop Ethereum. Grab another well, cause there's been plenty more announcements already this week. The most notable was inarguably Tuesday's disclosure by the crypto exchange OKX that it plans to build a layer 2 using Polygon's technology. Wednesday brought the news of Kinto, which has raised $5 million this year to develop a layer-2 network that's fully compliant with anti-money-laundering laws using Optimism's OP Stack, and Redstone, an ""alternative data availability"" chain designed by the Lattice team for OP Stack. There are nagging questions about just who is going to use all these networks, but developers suggest there's still not enough. ""We're going to need a lot of L2s,"" Ryan Wyatt, who was just hired by a unit of the Optimism Foundation as chief growth officer after leaving Polygon Labs several months ago, told CoinDesk TV this week. ""One chain, a mainnet, is not going to do it."" Even Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson tried to elbow into the mix, posting Sunday on X (formerly Twitter) that ""I'm game if you are"" – attaching a link to CoinDesk's article last week about Kraken's discussions with prospective layer-2 technology partners including Polygon, Matter Labs and Nil Foundation – and tagging Kraken Chairman Jesse Powell. One snarky poster replied, ""If this is how we reaching out, most likely not happening.""  ALSO:  Bitcoin researcher Robin Linus has ignited fresh buzz with ""BitStream"" paper on file hosting using the original blockchain, just a month after his ""BitVM"" paper stirred up the community with the prospect of Ethereum-style smart contracts.  Plasma blockchain designs, all the rage after they were first invented in 2017, could come back in vogue after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote in a blog post Tuesday that the category ""opens the door to very large scalability gains.""  Former boxing champ Manny Pacquiao’s foundation will use the Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, from the SHIB-token-focused Shiba Inu project, for its operations.

El Salvador remains in the red on bitcoin holdings, but losses are narrowing.  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.  1. Ethereum platform Infura takes step toward decentralization with Microsoft, Tencent.  2. Zircuit, a new EVM-compatible ZK rollup, is announcing its public testnet launch. According to the team: ""Zircuit uses a hybrid approach that combines the latest ZK proofs with optimistic infrastructure. More efficient proof generation results in reduced fees and the development of new compression algorithms increases transaction speeds and saves users gas..  3. Rarimo, an interoperability protocol for cross-chain identity and asset management, has launched version 2.0 of its Proof-of-Humanity plug-in, a solution that enables Web3 dApps to verify its users are humans instead of bots, according to the team.  4. Agrotoken, the first global tokenization infrastructure for agricultural commodities, has announced its plans to launch on Polkadot, to enable seamless tokenization of agricultural commodities. According to the team: ""Visa-backed Agrotoken is to build a Polkadot parachain that tokenizes soybeans, corn and wheat.""  5. Upshot, a protocol for decentralized delivery of alpha signals, announced its Machine Intelligence Network, according to the team: ""The network crowdsources financial alpha produced by disparate machine learning models. 'Alpha Miners' contribute insights to the network in the form of proprietary data, predictive model features, or predictions, then are rewarded based on how useful their alpha is (as determined by our new 'Proof of Alpha' scoring mechanism).""

The Tuesday letter cites recent Wall Street Journal reporting and blog posts from crypto analytics firms, saying there is a concern about Hamas receiving crypto funds but that ""it remains unclear"" the extent to which this is a problem.  ""Congress must understand the size, scope, and duration of Hamas’s digital asset operations, as well as whether the United States has had success in seizing illicit digital assets,"" the letter said. ""It is important to understand the scope of Hamas’s digital assets fundraising campaign in the context of its traditional funding activities. Not accounting for the funds Hamas receives from Iran or through donations, it is estimated that Hamas’s global investment portfolio generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. This could far exceed the amount Hamas has received through digital asset donations.""  The letter lists a number of questions for the Treasury Department and administration, ranging from how long Hamas may have been raising crypto to how much in digital assets the organization may have actually raised.  Other questions are meant to examine the U.S.'s role in sanctioning wallets and seizing funds that may be tied to Hamas or other organizations.

Brace yourself, for trouble may be lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce on the unsuspecting. In the fast-paced realm of cryptocurrency, your digital fortress could be nothing more than a relic of the past, leaving you vulnerable to the merciless winds of technological evolution. Recently, cryptocurrency startup Unciphered revealed a potential security threat to Bitcoin wallets created prior to 2016. Related Reading: Celestia Strikes: How This Lesser-Known Coin Went Berserk With 126% Price Explosion Known as “Randstorm,” this software flaw encompasses a combination of bugs, architectural choices, and API (Application Programming Interface) modifications that heighten the vulnerability of Bitcoin wallets crafted between 2011 and 2015. The genesis of this issue dates back to last year when Unciphered was assisting a customer who found themselves locked out of a Bitcoin wallet originally created on what is now recognized as Blockchain.com. Unveiling The Risks: The Potential Perils Lurking In A 2016-era Bitcoin Wallet During the investigation to recover the wallet, Unciphered stumbled upon a critical flaw in wallets generated by BitcoinJS between 2011 and 2015. Unciphered, in its report on Tuesday, highlighted the significance of this flaw, suggesting that it may have impacted approximately 1.4 million Bitcoin. This means, that if 3 to 5 percent of these wallets were affected, the potential value of the at-risk coins could range from $1.2 to $2.1 billion. Eric Michaud, co-founder of Unciphered, stated that BitcoinJS was severely flawed until March 2014, and anyone using it directly faces a significantly high risk of being attacked. Unciphered has dedicated several months to notifying a substantial number of individuals, over one million, on the vulnerability of their wallets. The Dangers Of Holding Wallets On Obsolete Crypto Platforms A significant number of individuals remain uninformed due to their possession of wallets constructed on defunct digital currency platforms. Unciphered clarified that finding vulnerabilities doesn’t imply that Bitcoin or technology, in general, is fundamentally flawed. Instead, it reveals a chain of programming errors that occurred across various technologies from 2011 to 2015. There are serious problems in a lot of the wallet code, Unciphered has discovered, and the companies who employed that technology may vanish. Bitcoin slightly above the $36K level today. Chart: TradingView.com Despite that, though, it serves as a stark reminder that open-source projects that little to no one oversees lie beneath software infrastructure of all types, even those specifically aimed at raising capital. Michaud asserted that imperfections within every human-made technology stem from its creators. “Every man-made technology contains flaws that originate within its creators,” he said. The wallets’ software developer, Stefan Thomas, told The Washington Post that he created the wallets as a pastime. He said that without checking the program’s validity, he had stolen a significant portion of the code from a page belonging to a Stanford University student. “Instead, I was obsessed about making sure that I didn’t make any mistakes in my own code I’m sorry to anyone affected by this bug,” he added. Source: Unciphered In layman’s words, Unciphered called the vulnerability “Randstorm” since wallet software that produced cryptographic keys wasn’t sufficiently random was the source of it. They produced electronic keys with a randomness factor that was easier to hack, only one in a specific number of thousands, as opposed to ones that were incredibly unique and hard for someone else to copy (like one in a trillion odds). Related Reading: Red Hot Ethereum: Breach Of $2,000 Draws Major Players Into the Fray Navigating Cryptocurrency’s Hostile Landscape Security expert Dan Guido said that the world of cryptocurrency is quite unfriendly. It’s filled with individuals attempting to undermine what you’re constructing, whether through hacking attempts, regulatory challenges, or others keen on causing harm to Bitcoin. “Crypto is a pretty hostile place, to be honest, full of people attacking what you’re building,” he said. As the curtains draw on the unsettling revelation of the “Randstorm” vulnerability, it’s a stark wake-up call for those still tethered to Bitcoin wallets from the pre-2016 era. The ominous specter of technological evolution looms large, and the recent exposé by Unciphered sheds light on the potential peril faced by those oblivious to the vulnerabilities embedded in their outdated digital fortresses.

TIA's rise doesn't correlate to an uptick in blockchain usage; though the Celestia blockchain facilitated 350,000 transactions in the first twodays following its launch, it has only added another 160,000 transactions since then, according to MintScan.  By comparison, rival modular blockchain Arbitrum has averaged between 550,000 and 920,000 daily transactions over the past seven days, Arbiscan data shows.  Another metric to assess the scalability of blockchains is transactions per second (TPS). Celestia is currently totaling 0.13 TPS. Arbitrum, meanwhile has a daily average of 8.01 TPS, according to L2Beat.  It's worth noting that as Celestia only rolled out a fortnight ago and adoption is not expected to match that of Arbitrum, which has been operational since May, 2021, but it is now facing competition from industry heavyweights like NEAR, which has joined the race with Celestia to provide data availability services to Ethereum rollups.  Data availability ""allows network nodes to download, store, and make transaction information accessible for verification,"" said Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at FundStat, in a note earlier this month.  Despite a lack of immediate demand for its data availability functionality, Celestia's tokenomics have caught the attention of traders. Just 141 million tokens of the 1 billion hard cap are circulating, with the majority of the total supply being locked up until October 2024 and October 2026. Trading volume for TIA is around $900 million over the past 24 hours, exceeding the market cap of all tokens in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap.  The rally can be compared to Aptos, which like Celestia issued its APT token in the form of an airdrop when it launched last year.

Nerayoff Accuses Buterin Of Invention Replication Former Ethereum Advisor, Steven Nerayoff has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to accuse Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin of copying his inventions. Nerayoff criticized the intelligence of the current Ethereum leadership, making contentious remarks about Buterin and co-founder of Ethereum, Joseph Lubin. Related Reading: Solana Institutional Inflows Surge In One Week, Can The Price Reach $100? “Vitalik slept on my couch & copied my inventions. He and SBF are images. They’re not smart because something seems off, something is off. The recording shows his and Joe’s stupidity and ignorance. Hear who understood Ethereum, me or them,” Nerayoff stated. The former ETH Advisor continued on his tirade of allegations, casting doubts on Buterin’s contributions to the network. He stated that Buterin had never invented anything substantial and that the ETH founder was the sole reason behind the network never scaling. The accusations also suggested that the only significant achievement in the Ethereum ecosystem was the issuance of utility tokens on ICOs, which Nerayoff claimed he had invented. Nerayoff also made startling revelations, accusing Buterin and Lubin of deliberately damaging the cryptocurrency by focusing on issuing fraudulent ICOs to unsuspecting investors and potentially harming them. “Did Vitalik invent anything? No, he did not. Ethereum never scaled bc of him. The only killer app was issuing Utility Tokens on ICOs, both of which I invented. Vitalik & Lubin sabotaged crypto. Their focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people,” Nerayoff stated. Ethereum Founder’s Scalability Competence Questioned In an X post on Tuesday, Stephen Nerayoff presented thought-provoking questions to the crypto community about Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum scalability capabilities. Related Reading: New XRP Ledger Upgrade Goes Live, What’s New? Nerayoff released a video on X by a community member, Mr. Huber which featured Vitalik Buterin describing plans for the ETH Network. He told the crypto community to remember the video when he eventually released evidential recordings of his conversation with Buterin about his ideas for ETH 2.0. “Remember this video when I drop the recording and what I tell Vitalik about 2.0 and to fix misaligned incentive structures. Is Vitalik the savior they bill him as to make Ethereum scale or is he the reason it never scaled? Decide for yourselves,” Nerayoff stated. The question raised by the former ETH Advisor has sparked debates and differing opinions about the Ethereum Founders. Although no proper evidence has been presented regarding the accusations laid against Buterin, the crypto community continues to watch and analyze the situation as it unfolds.

42392036,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzOGb,1700066700,What an SEC Proposal Means for RIAs in Crypto,"Imagine meeting with your financial advisor to plan for retirement, and seeing crypto products offered alongside other safe and regulated financial products. You decide to allocate to crypto products — not only as an investment vehicle, but also as a tool to execute tax-loss harvesting. What was once a holy grail in crypto adoption is quickly becoming a reality.  Demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs) to provide digital assets to end-clients is greater than ever. Just take a look at recent headlines from crypto wealth management platforms like Eaglebrook Advisors, Fidelity and L1 Advisors.  But against the backdrop of rising institutional demand, a little-watched SEC proposal could radically reshape how RIAs and asset managers access the digital asset class.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  What has the SEC proposed?  In February 2023, the SEC proposed changes to the “Custody Rule.” The Rule, which has been a key protection in U.S. financial services regulation for decades, requires RIAs to safeguard client funds and securities with a qualified custodian.  The recent proposal would broaden the current scope of the Custody Rule by requiring RIAs to safeguard all client assets — including digital assets — with a qualified custodian.  In choosing a qualified custodian, bankruptcy protections are key. Bankruptcy-remote custody solutions — like Anchorage Digital Bank, a federally chartered bank — would still meet the SEC definition of a qualified custodian. The analysis is more nuanced with respect to state-chartered trusts, which may vary widely in compliance standards, bankruptcy protections, and key storage safety.  Toward regulatory clarity  The SEC proposal shouldn’t be a surprise; in traditional finance, it’s well-established that RIAs must keep client assets with a qualified custodian.  While we have expressed some concerns with the SEC custody rule proposal, it is a step in the right direction.  If adopted, the SEC proposal would mark a significant step toward bringing crypto further under the fold of traditional financial regulation in the US—a win for consumers, a win for RIAs and a win for regulators.  Outlook for RIAs in crypto  The SEC is now considering next steps in the rulemaking process, after the public comment period closed late in October.  While the SEC has yet to make a final decision, the answer is clear: RIAs in crypto need to take a serious look at regulated custody.  In light of the proposal, RIAs offering crypto should consider a number of separate — but related — questions, including:  Are you safekeeping client digital assets with a qualified custodian?  Is your digital asset custody solution bankruptcy-remote?  Does your crypto partner provide compliant recordkeeping and reporting to meet SEC requirements?  Advisors are one of the most promising areas for institutional and mainstream adoption of crypto. Client interest is only growing, especially with recent movement around spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rise of crypto SMA platforms.  Safekeeping client digital assets with a qualified custodian allows RIAs to future-proof their crypto offerings in a changing regulatory environment, while meeting growing client demand for safe, secure and regulated access to the digital asset economy.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nathan McCauley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/15/what-an-sec-proposal-means-for-rias-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d6ad5ae0f0745e720da84a41efa063bdb797463-5270x3513.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392035,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzOBT,1700066700,Navigating the Next Wave of Crypto Institutionalization: A Due Diligence Primer,"Leading financial services institutions in the US are keenly awaiting the SEC's decision on their Bitcoin ETF applications, with critical deadlines from January to May 2024. The anticipated approval of these ETFs, already influencing Bitcoin’s price with a 26% surge in the last three months, marks a pivotal moment in market evolution.  The crypto sector is drawing attention due to factors like the upcoming Bitcoin halving (which is due to fall in April 2024), its status as an uncorrelated asset class, the “digital gold” narrative and prevailing macroeconomic conditions.  Bull runs in crypto markets have historically attracted significant interest from institutional investors and financial service providers that work with Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to offer trading, custody, and structured products, enabling an expansion beyond bitcoin into areas like tokenization, stablecoins, staking and private equity.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The entry or re-emergence of institutions in this space highlights the need for robust due diligence. A lack of understanding about the unique risks associated with digital assets and their management became evident following the collapse of FTX and findings from the recent trial.  A comprehensive due diligence framework that captures the unique risks in digital asset space is essential in guiding institutions through this complex landscape. It should include:  Governance & Operational Resilience: This involves risk management frameworks and control functions to address board effectiveness, roles, responsibilities, and leadership accountability. Operational resilience covers business continuity, disaster recovery, third-party oversight, and segregation of duties. It also includes understanding the governance and decentralization of Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains, where applicable.  Regulatory Compliance: VASPs should implement robust processes for evolving regulations, encompassing KYC/AML controls and crypto intelligence tools, trust structures, client asset segregation, data protection, conflict of interest and ethics.  Digital Asset Operations: Prioritizing the secure custody of digital assets is crucial. Technology controls should cover key lifecycle management, stablecoin management, staking activities, account management, transaction handling, change management, and an understanding of tokenomics and blockchain technology. Contrary to popular belief, reviewing a SOC report may not be sufficient to address the risks in these business operations.  Financial Analysis & Reporting: VASPs should focus on financial metrics beyond traditional assessments, including on-chain reviews for insights into management and transactions, initial distributions, key personnel holdings, and related party transactions. Understanding reserve asset management, customer liabilities, balance sheets, and digital asset encumbrances is vital. Additionally, evaluating accounting treatments and counterparty risks provides a comprehensive view of financial health and exposure. While proof of reserve is gaining momentum, there are currently no standards from professional accounting bodies to ensure its sufficiency.  Financial Risk Management: Strategies for liquidity risk management, funding strategy assessment, digital asset liquidity and quality, and supporting systems are necessary. VASPs should also have mitigants for financial risk metrics, stress testing for liquidity events, capital management processes, and frameworks for credit, interest rate, and currency exchange risk. The presence of an internal audit department is a positive indicator.  Each category in this framework demands thorough exploration to uphold higher standards in managing risks effectively, fostering a more matured and secure crypto industry.  As the crypto market continues to evolve and intersect with traditional financial systems, the importance of these due diligence practices cannot be overstated. They are not just compliance checkboxes but vital tools to safeguard the integrity of the financial market and protect investor interests.  It's imperative for institutions to move beyond mere participation in the crypto space to becoming informed, responsible actors. This responsible approach is crucial for ensuring that the crypto market's potential is fully realized, paving the way for its sustainable growth and integration into the broader financial landscape.

42392030,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzNlp,1700065213,"CBDCs Good for Payments, Even With Competition: IMF","A well-designed central bank digital currency can improve payment systems even as other solutions proliferate, according to staff at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) who are getting ready to publish a handbook on the subject.  A paper presenting initial findings on CBDCs to the IMF's executive board published Tuesday said it offers ""initial guidance"" to policymakers on how to explore broader implications of national digital currencies. The planned handbook coming after the 2023 annual meetings will address a range of frequently asked questions covering everything from policy objectives and legal considerations to cyber resilience and readiness to issue.  Governments around the world are feeling pressure from international organizations to consider digital versions of sovereign currencies as a way to strengthen digital payments and improve financial inclusion. During a Wednesday speech, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said CBDCs could replace cash in island economies, and that the public sector should continue working to support the issuance of such currencies.  While policymakers in the U.S. are not too sweet on a digital dollar, other major jurisdictions like the European Union seem more amenable to CBDCs, with an official at the Bank of Italy telling CNBC on Wednesday that a digital euro would be the answer to private crypto that reference fiat currencies – known as stablecoins – and that CBDCs protect public interest where private cryptocurrencies do not.  ""If appropriately designed, CBDC has the potential to improve payment systems and support a role for central bank money even as other digital payment solutions proliferate. But the appropriateness of CBDC will vary with country circumstances. Given the complexities and the novelty involved, policymakers need to explore CBDC carefully and systematically,"" the IMF paper said.

42392023,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzN6n,1700064694,CFTC Chief: Nothing Changed After FTX Meltdown to Empower Agency to Prevent Repeat,"U.S. regulators don't have any more authority now to head off another major crypto collapse than they did when FTX imploded and took much of the industry with it, said Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam.  ""Nothing has changed, and we could be in a position where another FTX-type event happens,"" Behnam said Wednesday at the Financial Markets Quality Conference 2023 at Georgetown University. However, he noted that the crypto investing enthusiasm has calmed since the months before FTX, and ""the market environment is much, much different today than it was a year ago.""  He noted – as he routinely does – that the CFTC has limited powers over the markets in which assets such as bitcoin trade directly. In that spot market, his agency only has the authority to intervene when market-manipulation and fraudulent activity is pointed out to the regulators. CFTC officials don't have the reach they do in the crypto derivatives sector, where they can assess companies' registrations and supervise their behaviors directly. And the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) only polices the securities markets.  While SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly said he believes the bulk of crypto tokens are securities, there are some cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, that don't fall under that regulator's jurisdiction. Behnam also puts ether on that list, noting Wednesday that the non-security crypto tokens make up ""easily 50% – if not more – of the marketplace.""  Legislation  Since FTX, U.S. lawmakers have pursued legislation to give the CFTC jurisdiction over direct, cash markets, but those crypto market-structure bills still await action. One of them was approved by committees in the House of Representatives and would need a vote from the overall chamber, but the Republican-led effort so far lacks support in the Democrat-controlled Senate.  ""There's obviously a lot going on in Congress these days,"" Behnam said. ""These bills have been caught, I think a little bit in a holding pattern.""  Crypto lobbyists had hoped that crypto bills – also including one that would set up U.S. guardrails for stablecoin issuers – would get a House floor vote before the end of the year. But Congress has largely been occupied with keeping the federal government open as lawmakers hash out spending bills, and the House was recently sidetracked after Republicans ousted former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and replaced him with Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.).  Prediction markets  The CFTC chief also addressed his agency's court fight with prediction market Kalshi over political-outcomes betting. His agency has opposed Kalshi's election contracts and was taken to court over that decision, depending in part on deciding whether there's societal value in hedging political risk by being able to engage in contracts that pay if – for instance – a certain person or party is elected.  ""If there are allegations of fraud or manipulation in an election – whether it's a local district in Iowa, or any other state – you can imagine we then become an election cop,"" said Behnam. ""If there's a listed futures or unlisted derivative on an election and there's an allegation of fraud in that election, that fraud would presumably have affected the price revaluation of the listed future.""  He said he doesn't want the CFTC to have to assume that role in U.S. elections.

However, the crypto asset has regained bullish momentum from this dip, signaling an upward trajectory. XRP Experiences Rebound After Plunge XRP daily chart has shown resiliency recently, pulling off a noteworthy rebound following a drop that unnerved traders and investors. The chart shows that the cryptocurrency is speedily recovering from its fall. The recent price movement indicates that XRP might be approaching the $0.70 mark. The token’s capacity to stay above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages indicates a bullish outlook for the asset. According to the chart, XRP may be ready for a run at the next resistance level, around $0.65, if it can sustain above the $0.60 mark. If the token manages to go past $0.65, the $0.70 mark seems plausible. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction – Breaking This Resistance Could Spark Fresh Rally These averages are significant pointers frequently pointing to the market’s long-term prospects. The fact that the price of XRP is rising above these lines indicates that the market is very confident. In addition, the digital asset’s RSI has leveled off following a brief excursion into the overbought area. This suggests that the recent price rebound was sustained market interest rather than a fluke. The RSI returns to neutral levels without a notable price decline, sparking possible future growth. XRP’s market is on an uptrend; the token seems to have benefited from these positive market emotions by raising its price. The price of XRP is growing and might keep rising, per a crypto analysis by ProSignalsfx on TradingView. Nonetheless, the crypto asset is still relatively down from the $0.75 price mark it experienced on November 13. This was due to a false report shared by an X user about an exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing by BlackRock. However, the crypto experienced a price correction immediately after the report was debunked. The Crypto Asset Is Set To Do Well In The Next Bull Run According to crypto influencer BoringSleuth, since XRP has no ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its price could gain impressively from the bull market. The influencer believes cryptocurrencies not connected with the CCP will benefit from the next bull run. “The protocols that weren’t in bed with the CCP will be the benefactors of future bull cycles. A protocol like DAG, which works with the DOD is one example of a well-positioned protocol. XRP is another,” he stated.

42392025,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzNMB,1700063896,The Global Movement to Promote Crypto Tax Transparency — What You Need to Know,"This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week, presented by TaxBit. Erin Fennimore is the VP of Tax Solutions at TaxBit.  The digital asset industry has seen significant regulatory movement in the United States and abroad, all to promote tax transparency.  This trend for global transparency is driven by many factors, such as tax evasion and avoidance, and the overall goal of ensuring a fair and transparent global tax system.  The primary vehicle of tax transparency is the exchange of information between enterprises and local tax authorities. Outside of the U.S., the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G20 have led the initiative to promote global tax transparency.  This article will help highlight the key takeaways from the proposed digital asset broker regulations in the U.S. and other key initiatives across the globe, highlighting important commonalities and timelines.  U.S. proposed digital asset broker regulations  The U.S. Treasury Department issued proposed regulations clarifying the definitions, requirements and implementation timelines for digital asset brokers' tax information reporting requirements as outlined in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) passed by Congress in 2021.  See also: The IRS Should Offer a Free Tax Reporting Tool to DeFi Users | Tax Week  ""These proposed regulations are designed to help end confusion involving digital assets and provide clear information and reporting certainty for taxpayers, tax professionals, and others,"" said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.  The regulations are a significant step in the regulation of digital assets in the United States. They are expected to have a significant impact on the digital asset industry. The regulations are also expected to increase transparency in the digital asset market and help combat money laundering and other financial crimes.  Key takeaways:  It is important to note that these regulations are not finalized. The IRS is accepting comments on the proposed regulations and held a virtual public hearing on Nov. 13. All comments made to the IRS are public and can be viewed on the federal commentary docket website.  The key areas that highlight the impact on the digital asset community are summarized below.  Digital asset broker  A “digital asset broker” in the proposed regulations is defined as any person who provides services facilitating the sale or exchange of digital assets, including centralized exchanges, digital asset payment processors and certain decentralized protocols where there is sufficient control or influence over the protocol to make changes to it.  Along with the clarification and more narrowly tailored digital asset broker definition, the proposed regulations refined the language to focus on three types of enterprises.  Centralized exchange operators that facilitate digital asset transfers on behalf of users  Digital asset payment processors  Decentralized protocols accessible to U.S.-based individuals that meet certain requirements.  The third categorical example necessitates the most nuanced analysis. At a high level, an enterprise that falls into the third category will need to determine if two factors are met under the proposed regulations:  Provides a facilitative service and  Based on the nature of the service, would know or be in a position to know both (1) The identity of the party making the sale and (2) the nature of the transaction potentially giving rise to the proceeds from the sale.  Looking at the first factor, the regulations define facilitative services as facilitating the sale (or exchange) of digital assets regardless of whether that is done through an autonomous protocol, access to a trading platform, automated market maker systems or any order matching service. This approach illustrates the Treasury’s understanding of how digital asset trading services differ from traditional financial broker services.  Regarding the second factor, the regulations explain that a person would know or be in a position to know if they can set or change the terms under which the services are provided. This focuses on whether a person has sufficient control over an autonomous protocol to make changes, updates or otherwise influence its operation.  Suppose the DeFi protocol can be managed, controlled or overwritten by a centralized group in any way. That protocol will likely be viewed as sufficiently centralized to be treated as a digital asset broker. Conversely, suppose the protocol truly operates autonomously, without any oversight, intervention or influence from a particular group. In that case, it will not be considered a digital asset broker and not be subject to the reporting requirements.  Along with helping to define who is in scope, the proposed regulations specified who will be considered out of scope, including miners, stakers and wallet software providers.  Digital assets defined  Digital assets are defined as assets that include any digital representation of value that is recorded on a cryptographically secure distributed ledger, even if not every transaction is individually recorded. These proposed regulations clarified that stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are considered in scope and is already a key area of focus for the commentary that the IRS has received.  Form 1099 reporting  The core function of being a broker involves broker related onboarding procedures, cost basis tracking and ultimately 1099-B reporting. Historically, Form 1099-B has been used in traditional finance to report the required information. Although not specifically referenced in the proposed regulations, the IRS has commented publicly about creating a new form (1099-DA) to be used for digital assets.  See also: Form 1099-B Is Not the Solution to Your Cryptocurrency Tax Woes | Tax Week 2023  Similar to reporting on traditional financial assets, digital asset reporting will require a broker to include the following pieces of information for each transaction:  Name, address, taxpayer identification number  Digital asset details (name, type, number of units)  Date and time (UTC)  Gross proceeds of the sale and adjusted cost basis  Transaction ID or hash  Digital asset addresses involved  Form of consideration received  For assets that were transferred into a Broker and subsequently disposed of, the following information will also be required:  Date and time of such transfer-in transaction  Transaction ID or hash of such transfer-in transaction  Digital asset address (or digital asset addresses if multiple) from which the transferred-in digital asset was transferred  Number of units transferred in by the customer as part of that transfer-in transaction  Customer tax onboarding requirements  To effectively comply with 1099 reporting, digital asset brokers will need to know who their customers are for tax reporting purposes. This means they will need to be able to identify and collect the following information for reportable accounts:  Identification of accounts as U.S. or non-U.S.  Collection of names, addresses, and certified U.S. tax identification numbers (TIN)  Brokers within the traditional finance industry currently have an obligation to collect certified tax identification numbers (TINs). Accordingly, digital asset brokers will assume that same obligation. This requirement will impact digital asset customer onboarding in a significant way.  Digital asset brokers will be required to collect certified taxpayer identification numbers (TINs), achieved by collecting a Form W-9 or Substitute W-9. The information collected on a Form W-9 is used to populate and file Form 1099-B, and the new Form 1099-DA, specific to digital asset broker reporting.  Global trends for tax transparency  The U.S. is not the only country issuing regulations related to digital asset tax transparency. With the rise of use cases with digital assets across the globe, there has been a myriad of proposals and frameworks that have also arisen for enterprises within digital assets and e-money. While the objectives of these frameworks and regulations all center around tax transparency, it is important to understand their differences, timelines and impact to your enterprise.  Crypto-asset reporting framework  On Oct. 10, 2022, the 38-member country OECD published the final guidance for the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). It read: “In light of the rapid development and growth of the crypto-asset market...”  On Nov. 10, approximately 47 countries published a statement that they plan to “swiftly transpose” the CARF into domestic law, and intend for active exchange of information to commence by 2027. The intended effective dates for the remaining 38 countries are still unknown, but the OECD, intends to work towards global adoption and implementation of the framework, so it’s incorporated into the local laws of member states.  The DAC8  On the heels of CARF, on Dec. 8, 2022, the E.U. Commission issued the seventh amendment to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8). The adopted directive entered into force on Nov. 13, 2023 and E.U. member states will have until Dec. 31, 2025 to transpose the new rules into local law with the first application from Jan. 1, 2026.  The DAC8 will extend the scope under DAC to crypto service providers on exchanges and transfers of crypto assets and e-money. The provisions of DAC8 have significant overlap with CARF, and will ultimately mean that crypto asset service providers will be obligated to report certain information about transactions involving EU residents.  Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)  On June 30, 2022, the European Parliament and Council reached a provisional agreement on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA’s objective is to increase the safeguards for digital asset investors by requiring common E.U.-wide definitions and rules. MiCA requirements will be effective as of Dec. 30, 2024.  See also: U.S. Crypto Tax Proposal Lets Miners Off the Hook  As a result, crypto-asset service providers operating in E.U. providers will be required to have registered offices within the trading bloc.  CESOP  The Central Electronic System of Payment Information (CESOP) is a new E.U. initiative to combat Value Added Tax (VAT) fraud related to cross-border payments. By Q1 2024, payment service providers in the E.U. will be required to report cross-border payments on a quarterly basis. This initiative aims to bring transparency and compliance to cross-border transactions, particularly those involving e-money institutions.  Crypto exchanges should be aware of CESOP as it will likely have an impact when an exchange facilitates the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies between a buyer and seller across different E.U. member states  CESOP reporting will be triggered when a buyer (i.e. payer) is located in the E.U. and has engaged in a cross-border transaction with a seller (i.e. payee) in either an EU or non-E.U. state  CESOP limits reporting in a variety of ways, primarily by requiring 25 or more cross border payments to a seller (i.e. payee)  CoinDesk does not share the editorial content or opinions contained within the package before publication and the sponsor does not sign off on or inherently endorse any individual opinions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Erin Fennimore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/15/the-global-movement-to-promote-crypto-tax-transparency-what-you-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/409437dae2710cc3aa82a3cdd84aee8978bc50a0-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

RIOT's strategy revolves around building and controlling two massive facilities in Texas to take advantage of cheap power. RIOT has the potential to become a dominant player in the BTC mining industry, but it faces geographical risks and a time crunch for facility construction. The article below will detail my thoughts on Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), one of the largest Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners, after the recent release of its recent earnings report. The report was met with some skepticism as the equity skidded lower at the close of trading. Bitcoin Ecosystem Before delving further into RIOT's prospects, an overview of the BTC ecosystem is necessary to better understand the importance of the role of the mining community. Simply stated, the integrity of the BTC blockchain is guaranteed by the relentless increase in the network's hash power, which renders the possibility of a 51% attack more remote as the network expands. Hash power is not ubiquitous as the provider is burdened with real costs to add value to the network. In my view, the optimal comparison is the costs incurred by the Gold Miners ( GDX ) to extract gold from the earth. Some of the disconnect revolves around the ephemeral nature of BTC. BTC does not have a physical form, yet it lives in the abstract, which I believe causes many to disavow it or view it as a scam. The network offers miners remuneration in the form of a block reward for every block mined. Depending on the value of BTC at the time the reward is earned, it can be very lucrative, similar to the late 2021 timeframe, or barely covering costs such as the 4th quarter of 2022. Enter Riot Platforms The BTC mining industry remains highly fragmented, yet two clear dominant firms are beginning to emerge based on market cap. RIOT's market cap is nearly identical to its primary rival , Marathon Digital ( MARA ). I recently covered the opportunity in MARA and their unique strategy for building their hash power. Please click the link for those not familiar with the work . RIOT is embarking on a radically different strategy than MARA, which, given ample time, will clearly differentiate between the two. Basically, depending on how the strategy works out, one will become the king of the miners while the other will fall off. Why is the strategy radically different? It depends on how you view events unfolding in the industry, with the coming halving cycle a key catalyst. A halving cycle occurs in BTC once 21,000 blocks from the last halving cycle are mined. Once the threshold is triggered, the block reward is cut in half, with the current reward of 6.25 BTC per block reduced to 3.125 BTC. A halving cycle is typically a bullish event as it decreases the new supply of BTC, thus creating a positive feedback loop that has triggered some outstanding runs. The reduction of supply and subsequent increase in price is the classic boom-bust commodity cycle that seems promising. RIOT's strategy revolves around building and controlling two massive facilities in western Texas, the home of abundant cheap power. Cheap power is the proverbial lifeblood of a BTC miner, as the lower the power price, the more certain you are of your ability to weather a downcycle in the commodity. RIOT has built out its first facility in TX, dubbed Rockdale, with a deployed hash rate of 10.9 EH/s as of the Q3 earnings report . Once the Corsicana facility comes online beginning in early 2024, EH/s should nearly double to 20.2 EH/s. The Power of Hash Rate In my view, the key to becoming the dominant BTC miner is to have as much Hash installed and mining prior to the halving while retaining as much coin post expenses. I believe post the halving, some of the smaller miners may not be able to keep up or invest in more efficient machines, thus seeding additional market share. Eventually, I firmly believe BTC mining will consolidate among a few well-capitalized players. RIOT has the potential to become one of the dominant players, with an average cost to mine BTC of $14k prior to curtailment credits or $5,537 with the credits. Remember that the credits equal basically no mining activity for the majority of the day as the TX grid requires the energy as mandated by ERCOT. There is an opportunity cost involved as you ceded production. To add some numerical context, RIOT mined 1,108 BTC in Q3 vs 1,775 BTC in Q2. Q3 also has a bump in the hash rate of 0.2 EH/s, making the numbers even worse. The strategy is numerically sound, yet is the steep drop in production what most investors crave when investing in a BTC miner? Risk Factors RIOT has significant geographical risk as its operations are all based in Texas. I view the lack of diversity as a potential source of concern as inclement weather, whether a massive snowstorm similar to Feb of 2021 or the typical scorching summer heat that is typical of West Texas summers. Hash rates will be negatively affected, with RIOT believing the power credits will offset the loss in mining revenue. I am sympathetic to this argument. However, the next expansion should be in a different geographical location in the US, with the colder border states such as South Dakota as an excellent example. RIOT faces a bit of a time crunch via the construction of its Corsicana facility, which should lead to a doubling of its hash rate. The current price per hash rate via the AntPool site is 0.08 cents per TH. So, for every 100 Th machines, you can expect to generate approximately $8 less cost of electricity. In the case of RIOT, let's use 2 cents per Kw/h. You can expect a profit of $6 per machine prior to depreciation and amortization. The rate per TH is one of the best in the past two years, and miners are flocking to come online to capture this attractive rate. The network Hash Power has now exceeded 504 EH/s, a nearly 25% jump from the end of September 2023!!! Concluding Thoughts RIOT is an interesting way to gain additional exposure to the BTC ecosystem. Using the AntPool numbers discussed above, we can understand how levered the miners are to a higher net BTC price. The recent run-up in the BTC price post the excitement of a potential BTC spot ETF has emboldened the BTC bulls to come out of hibernation and push prices higher. Some are hesitant to back the miners out of fear of the upcoming halving, yet I do not view the event as a negative for the larger, more well-capitalized players such as RIOT or MARA. Any drop in hash power will allow both to gain a larger share of overall block rewards, with the real payoff coming if the typical boom-bust commodity cycle plays out again. A successful investment in the miners will require a bit of patience to allow the full cycle to play out, assuming history will repeat, which is not guaranteed. I am looking for RIOT to double if BTC can eclipse its all-time high after the halving in April 2024.

20221962,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560790,1700060457,"Ethereum Could Decline To $1,700 Based On This Pattern, Analyst Explains","An analyst has explained how a pattern forming in the 3-day Ethereum chart could signal that a decline toward $1,700 may be coming. Ethereum Has Recently Formed A TD Sequential Sell Setup In a new post on X, analyst Ali talked about a sell signal that has taken shape in the ETH 3-day chart. The relevant technical indicator here is the “Tom Demark (TD) Sequential,” which is used to spot reversals in the price of any asset. The metric is made up of two phases; a setup phase and a countdown phase. In the former, candles of the same polarity are counted up to nine following a reversal in the price. Once the ninth candle is hit, the indicator signals a probable top or bottom for the asset (depending on whether the trend until now was towards up or down). Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Plunge To $30,200 If This Level Is Lost: Analyst Once the setup is completed, the 13-candle-long countdown phase begins. At the end of these 13 candles, a potential reversal once again takes place for the asset. Ethereum has registered a sharp rally recently, but according to the analyst, the cryptocurrency has now finished with the setup phase of the indicator, implying that the asset could be heading towards a period of downtrend. The below chart shows this pattern in the 3-day price of the coin: Looks like the indicator is giving a sell signal at the moment | Source: @ali_charts on X In the same chart, the analyst has drawn an ascending triangle pattern for Ethereum. “Ascending triangles” are made up of two lines: one parallel to the x-axis drawn through the highs in the price, while the other is made by connecting higher lows. Generally, the price feels resistance at the upper line and support at the lower one. A break out of either of these lines suggests a continuation of the trend: bullish in the case of a surge above the former, while bearish in the case of the latter. From the graph, it’s visible that Ethereum has recently been retesting the $2,000 to $2,150 zone, which happens to align with the resistance level of this ascending triangle. Thus, it’s interesting that the ETH TD Sequential setup phase has finished just as the coin has encountered this line that it has been rejected from in the past. Related Reading: Chainlink Declines 6%: Rally Over Or Is There More To Go? “A pullback from this resistance level could lead to a dip toward the triangle’s hypotenuse at $1,700, setting the stage for a potential uptrend continuation,” explains Ali. The analyst also notes, however, that the $2,150 level could be one to keep an eye on as if the asset can see a 3-day candlestick close above this level in the coming days, the bearish outlook could be nullified. ETH Price Ethereum had risen above $2,100 recently, but the coin has seen some pullback in the past day, a potential sign that the sell signal may already be in effect.

42392032,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzNw5,1700060400,"'Intents' Are Blockchain's Big New Buzzword. What are They, And What Are the Risks?","A quiet revolution is underway transforming how we use blockchains, and at its core is one of crypto's latest buzzwords: ""intents.""  Simply defined, an intent is a specific goal a blockchain user wants to accomplish. While no two ""intent-centric"" systems are the same, they all work similarly: users, be they traders or protocols, submit their intent to a service, and then it is outsourced to a ""solver"" – it could be a person, or an AI bot, or another protocol – that does whatever it takes to get the job done.  These are becoming important now because blockchains are expanding so rapidly. With Bitcoin, Ethereum, a host of alternative layer-1 networks, layer-2 networks, and now even layer-3 networks proliferating, accompanied by myriad ""bridges"" and other ""interoperability"" solutions connecting them all, it's all becoming more daunting to navigate.  As the crypto market has matured, ""the number of possibilities that you can do on blockchains has compounded,"" Arjun Bhuptani of Connext, an interoperability protocol, explained. ""You have an infinite possible way of doing a transaction at a given time.""  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Newer intent-centric services promise to find users the best way to get things done – allowing them to maximize trading profits and save on gas fees, among other benefits.  But with the advantages of these platforms come risks, and some observers are already ringing alarm bells: While we might welcome the help of third-party solvers to take care of our blockchain busy work, new services could give rise to a new breed of monopolists.  Understanding intents  Blockchains can be thought of as massive, global computers. Traditionally, users provide detailed instructions (e.g., use Uniswap to swap token A for token B at a specific price), which the blockchain executes step-by-step.  In the new world of intents, however, this model is flipped on its head. Users express what they want to get done (e.g., swap A for B at the best price) without specifying the how, letting the protocol manage the details.  Consider the analogy of hailing a taxi. Traditional blockchain services are like giving the driver turn-by-turn directions, which can be tedious and costly if your route involves twists or hard-to-find shortcuts. With intents, all you need to do is provide the taxi driver with a destination, then sit back and trust your driver.  A new wave of blockchains and protocols, including Anoma, Flashbots and CoW Swap, are already offering intent-centric services to crypto users. Users can submit a general goal to one of these services, like ""swap these tokens for the best price,"" and have it handled by a third-party solver for a fee.  How it all works  Different platforms apply different verbiage to the idea of 'intents,' but the general premise remains the same.  Most intent-based protocols today start with some kind of ""intent-discovery"" system, a place ""where users broadcast the things that they want,"" Bhuptani explained. In blockchain parlance, these discovery venues could be considered ""mempools"" – waiting areas for yet-to-be-processed transactions.  An intent ""could be something like, 'I have USDC, I want to figure out how to turn it into XYZ asset, and I want to do that on another chain or in some specific way,'"" said Buhptani. ""There's no limitation as to the complexity of the intent that one could express.""  ""Then you have a marketplace of solvers,"" Bhuptani continued. Solvers ""listen"" for intents, and they fulfill them if the price is right. ""These intent solvers are automated actors that are basically saying, 'Oh, a user wants to do XYZ?' Okay, let me do it on their behalf because I can earn some fees for it.""  At a high level, this might all sound familiar. Aren't we expressing an intent when we ask Coinbase to swap ether [ETH] for bitcoin [BTC], or if we instruct an exchange aggregator like 1inch to sell our Solana tokens to whatever market features the highest price? Well, yes. ""Intents,"" like so much else in the world of crypto, are a fancy way of describing a phenomenon that already exists.  The trick with intents in 2023 – and the reason why the term has picked up steam in the past year – is due to the number of services, new and old, that are trying to squeeze user-friendly intents into boxes that conform to crypto's decentralized ethos, and can be dragged and dropped into virtually any use-case.  Most new intent-based protocols ""decentralize"" their systems by outsourcing to a network of solvers that compete to fill user requests for the best possible price. This competitive system is meant to ensure that no central third party is tasked with satisfying all user needs.  Intents in action  Intent-centric systems are already live for a variety of use cases.  Bhuptani's Connext protocol uses intents to shepherd transactions between different blockchains. Users can express the intent to transfer a token from one chain to another, for instance, and a network of solvers will find the optimal route.  Anoma, the protocol that popularized the concept of blockchain-based intents, offers what it calls, simply, ""intent-centric infrastructure."" In basic terms, Anoma's infrastructure is designed to extend intent-centric functionality to virtually any use case, helping other services match intents to a network of solvers.  SUAVE, an upcoming blockchain from the maximal extractable value (MEV)-focused infrastructure firm Flashbots, is one of the most talked-about services designed around a version of intents, which it calls ""preferences."" When SUAVE launches, users will be able to submit ""preferences"" to a competitive market of network operators that bid against one another to fill them. The system is built to help to balance user priorities with MEV.  The risk of rent-seekers  While intent-centric services offer a wide array of user experience benefits, one need only look to the taxi analogy to see where the systems can go wrong.  Providing detailed directions for all of our taxi rides, akin to the traditional model of specifying every step in a blockchain transaction, would be burdensome and error-prone.  But there's also a problem with the ""trust the driver"" approach that more closely resembles intent-centric systems: We've all had the experience of hopping into a taxi in an unfamiliar city for what we expect to be a quick ride, only to sit awkwardly as our driver takes a suspiciously long route, running up the meter.  The taxi driver in this analogy is like the solver in an intent-centric system: trusting the solver to take care of a task means trusting them to execute it honestly.  Intent-centric programs typically have systems in place to keep solvers honest, meaning a more apt analogy might be to Uber, which keeps drivers in check with its up-front pricing and in-app routing. But ride-sharing apps only further underscore the risk of intent-based systems: anyone who has experienced the rising prices of Ubers in recent years has seen firsthand how convenience can entrench big players at the expense of end users. The real risk with intent-centric systems isn't just dishonesty, but the potential for new monopolies.  Paradigm, a prominent blockchain investor and researcher, highlighted these risks in a blog post: ""While intents are an exciting new paradigm for transacting, their widespread adoption may imply an acceleration of a larger trend of user activity shifting to alternative mempools,"" wrote Paradigm’s researchers. ""If improperly managed, this shift risks centralization and entrenchment of rent-seeking middlemen.""  As we become more comfortable relying on these third parties to satisfy user intents, it is possible that these companies will begin to act in their own self-interest – either by charging higher fees (e.g., Uber) or by filling orders in a manner that serves them instead of users.  Although most intent-centric services outsource to a competitive market of solvers – ostensibly as a way to avoid centralization – there's still the potential that some companies might dominate the space.  For instance, one could imagine a crypto exchange building solvers to dominate the ""buy"" and ""sell"" use-case – effectively driving all market activity to its own book. The exchange could subsidize its fees at first as a way to edge out competitors, only to hike up its prices once it has taken over the marketplace.  In the best case, intent-based models can usher in a new wave of blockchain-based systems that save time and money for users – making the technology more accessible to more users. But realizing this future will require proceeding with care.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/15/intents-are-blockchains-big-new-buzzword-what-are-they-and-what-are-the-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c6548cf821bde046446bfef591f62f168705c9b-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round was led by CoinFund and Distributed Global. Arrington Capital, Breyer Capital, CMT Digital, Department of XYZ, Folius Ventures, Galaxy Digital, HackVC, Modular Capital, Nascent and Road Capital Management also participated.  Superstate focuses on developing regulated, compliant investment vehicles using public blockchains that U.S-based investors are able to access. The company – helmed by Robert Leshner, founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Compound [COMP] – has earmarked the funds for team expansion, creating private funds for institutional investors and crafting a framework for tokenized public funds.  The investment highlights the growing trend toward the use of tokenized assets as traditional finance and blockchain technology converge. Tokenization means converting traditional investments such as bonds or gold – known as real-world assets (RWA) – into virtual representations that can be recorded on a blockchain as a token.  Even big banks have joined the race to unlock what some say are the advantages of tokenization: increased efficiency and transparency, speedier settlements and broader access to investors.

42392021,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzN1f,1700059417,"El Salvador Remains in the Red on Bitcoin Holdings, But Losses Are Narrowing","In November 2022, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced a country-level dollar cost averaging (DCA) plan, promising to buy one bitcoin every day.  At the time, the country – based on public statements from Bukele - was already the owner of 2,381 bitcoins purchased at an average price of roughly $44,300. The price then was just $19,000, putting the country at about a $60 million loss on its holdings.  Bukele has kept pretty quiet about El Salvador’s purchases since and the exact amount of bitcoin that the country owns is not clear as there is no public government record.  Assuming that the country did indeed purchase one bitcoin per day over the past year, CoinDesk estimates El Salvador's holdings would sum to 2,744 bitcoin as of Nov. 14. Based on the median price of BTC over each of those days, the country's average purchase price would have drifted down to roughly $41,800.  Figuring a current bitcoin price of $36,000, El Salvador would now be sitting on a loss of about $16 million on its bitcoin holdings.  Since Bukele moved to make bitcoin legal tender, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly warned of increased risks to the country's economic growth and ability to make good on its debt. Despite the modest paper losses on the nation's bitcoin holdings, things to this point appear to be on a good path.  El Salvador's bonds in mid-August had posted a 70% year-to-date return, with a number of big-name banks recommending that more gains were coming. The country's debt earlier this month was upgraded at S&P Global to B- from CCC+. Bukele recently announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and polls show him with an overwhelming lead.  As to whether the populace is rushing to adopt a bitcoin standard, questions remain. One place to check would be remittances from outside the country, given the economy's reliance on those payments. According to central bank data, of $7 billion in remittances from abroad in 2022, just 1.2% used cryptocurrency wallets.

20220146,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560767,1700056803,Lido DAO (LDO) New All-Time High? One Analyst’s Perfect Setup To $37,"Lido DAO has grown over the years to become the leading liquid staking protocol on the Ethereum network and its native LDO token has enjoyed tremendous success on the back of this. The protocol’s continuous growth has been purported to be what will push LDO to new all-time highs and one crypto analyst has revealed how high the token’s price could go. Lido DAO To Beat Previous $7.22 All-Time High Back in the bull run of 2020-2021, the price of Lido DAO’s native LDO token soared with the rest of the market and eventually touched its all-time high price of $7.22. Naturally, this has been the level that bulls have been trying to get back to that would put all holders back in profit. However, crypto analyst Weslad expects the altcoin to completely clear this all-time high price by at least a 4x. Related Reading: BlackRock’s XRP ETF Filing, Everything You Need To Know In an analysis posted on the TradingView website, Weslad reveals the roadmap for LDO’s price to rise another 1,400% from here. According to the analyst, the LDO/USDT has been showing a “robust ascending triangle pattern.” This pattern, the analyst says, suggests that LDO could move to test the Neckline which is a critical supply zone for the asset. The analyst who is obviously very bullish on LDO expects that this level will be breached and that the altcoin will eventually turn this resistance mark into support. “The Buy back area on the chart should give all the bull an opportunity to accumulate the coin before major move begins and at same time the chart indicates the outlined target,” Weslad says. The first target in this setup is already above its ATH price at $9.,176. From here, the analyst expects another bounce up to take the Lido DAO price above $15.9, double its previous all-time high. But it still doesn’t end here. Source: Tradingview.com A final setup outlined by the crypto analyst brings the next target to $29.3. After that comes the coveted $37 level, which is at the very peak of this expected rally. Just below the buy back zone at around $1.9, the analyst outlines a stop loss zone below $1.473. “The stop loss range is an important area that need to be watched closely should incase price turn around,” the analyst warns. LDO Enters Top Gainers The bullishness surrounding Lido DAO and the native token LDO is not without metric, especially given the token’s performance in the last week. LDO has seen its price rise approximately 27% in one week to breach the $2.47 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Ready To Go ‘Supersonic’, Analyst Says Even more impressive is its 24-hour positive moves that have come out to 10.5%. This rise puts it in the list of the top 10 gainers in the last day behind the likes of Kaspa (KAS) and PancakeSwap (CAKE). LDO’s large transaction volume has also fallen in the last week which suggests that whales are winding down their activities. While this could mean there is not a lot of buying going on by these large whales, it also suggests there is not a lot of selling happening either. This could point toward a tendency to hold and wait for better prices rather than selling tokens now.

42392042,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzZlX,1700056200,"Ethereum Platform Infura's Step Toward Decentralization Includes Microsoft, Tencent","Infura, the crypto infrastructure firm from Consensys, is one of the most popular solutions for developers to hook up applications to blockchains. The platform has grown into a core pillar of the blockchain world – powering many of the largest apps on Ethereum and a variety of other blockchains. But it's also become an object of criticism.  For years, Infura came under fire for being too ""centralized,"" its dominance seen as a single point of failure for the wider crypto ecosystem. Using Infura has historically meant plugging one's blockchain app directly into Infura's own servers – trusting Infura for uptime and data accuracy. Occasionally, this has led to mishaps and controversy, such as when Infura dropped offline or opted to censor data to comply with government sanctions.  So when Infura announced more than a year ago plans to finally ""decentralize"" key elements of the service, it seemed intent on addressing these criticisms.  ""There's that ethos in Web3 about decentralization being a core value,"" Thomas Hay, the lead product manager for Infura, told CoinDesk. ""We know there are advantages to a centralized service in terms of the ease of use and the ability to get up and running, but moving in the direction of being a decentralized service allows some really interesting things to get done.""  On Wednesday, Infura is taking its first concrete step towards decentralization. With its new ""Decentralized Infrastructure Network,"" or DIN, Infura is joining with Microsoft, Tencent and a variety of crypto firms in what it described in a press release as ""a powerful new way for developers to connect to Ethereum and other top-tier blockchains.""  'Failover' switch  The broad strokes of how Infura works are not changing under its new program, at least not yet, and it may seem a bit of a stretch for Infura to call its hand-picked network of infrastructure partners ""decentralized."" However, the first new Infura feature to come from DIN could go a long way towards helping the platform address one of the biggest challenges it currently faces around reliability.  The new feature is a ""failover"" switch that Infura users can optionally flip on to protect against network hiccups.  ""If we're experiencing conditions where the service is suffering for the end user, we have routing in place in failover,"" explained Hay. In the event that Infura's own blockchain nodes go offline, ""requests are then able to move to a partner who has been vetted through a series of load and quality assurance tests.""  Failover, which will begin by rolling out to Ethereum and Polygon, could help Infura guarantee greater uptime to developers. This single feature – and Consensys' ""federated"" network of partners – doesn't do much to address broader concerns around data integrity and censorship, but it is just a first step in Infura's roadmap towards ""progressive decentralization.""  ""It's a progressive movement,"" explained Hay. ""Instead of jumping all in and saying, 'We're gonna open up and have all these different features,' let's start with a feature that really everyone needs.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SPONSORED,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/15/ethereum-platform-infuras-step-toward-decentralization-includes-microsoft-tencent,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00f0416f45ad2652decc59e39f201da76b188a67-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Singapore's central bank is starting to test tokenization use cases alongside major traditional finance players including JPMorgan, DBS, and BNY Mellon. The tests will examine bilateral digital asset trades, foreign currency payments, multicurrency clearing and settlement, fund management and automated portfolio rebalancing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said Wednesday. JPMorgan and Apollo have carried out a ""proof of concept"" to demonstrate how asset managers could tokenize funds on the blockchain as part of the project, the firms announced concurrently with MAS' statement. The initiative is part of Project Guardian, a policymaker group that includes Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), the U.K's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to advance asset tokenization.  OKX, the second-largest cryptocurrency trading platform, is providing derivatives trading without the counterparty risk associated with assets being held on the exchange, enriching an existing arrangement with asset manager CoinShares and custody joint venture Komainu. Since FTX blew up last year, a number of players in the crypto space have devised ways to trade and settle off-exchange from the safe confines of a trusted custody setup. Off-exchange settlement is relatively easily done for spot markets, said Lewis Fellas, the head of hedge-fund solutions at CoinShares. A big differentiator, he said, is providing a similar arrangement when it comes to derivatives trading.  SC Ventures, the fintech investment and venture arm of banking group Standard Chartered, announced new tokenization platform on Tuesday. Libeara will enable the creation of a tokenized Singapore dollar government bond fund for accredited investors, according to the announcement. The platform has also partnered with FundBridge Capital, an organization for fund managers in Singapore. By working with Libeara ""we are ensuring that we can provide additional investment opportunities enabled by lower operating costs, higher transparency and higher operational efficiency,” Sue Lynn Lim, CEO and COO of FundBridge Capital said in a statement.

Terms of the arrangement between the NHL and Sweet weren't disclosed.

The central bank conducted the first issue of the digital tenge on a platform launched in ""pilot mode,"" but with real users in the form of second-tier banks and their clients, according to an official announcement.  The CBDC platform is powered by technology that underlies crypto, testing automated and blockchain-based smart contracts for settlements. Participating banks have issued digital vouchers and cards to facilitate transfers.  Wednesday also marked the publication of findings from a project exploring the issuance of a digital tenge in Kazakhstan, and a central bank official reportedly demonstrated the first payment with the CBDC.  Global financial institutions have repeatedly called on countries to set up legislation and conduct research into the issuance of national digital currencies. Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Wednesday that CBDCs can replace cash and offer financial resilience to economies. But major economies have so far shied away from making a decision on issuance.  Kazakhstan has been prepping for a CBDC since at least 2021.

SOL crossed $63, reaching a level previously seen in May 2022. Daily trading volumes also spiked to over $3.5 billion, up more than 70% from average levels of $2 billion at the start of November.  While there was no immediate catalyst for Wednesday’s bump, optimism around Solana has recently bumped after the end of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial. Bankman-Fried was a prominent backer of Solana and acquired over $1 billion worth of the tokens through his companies Alameda Research and FTX.  SOL prices took a drastic hit in November 2022 after a CoinDesk report first drew light to possible cracks in Bankman-Fried’s empire, but sentiment has recovered since the once-crypto titan was jailed and pronounced guilty on seven charges. Meanwhile, wallets linked to the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, controlled by the debtors group, have an estimated $102 million in SOL tokens to crypto exchanges in the past few months. Moving to exchanges may likely indicate a sale of those tokens on the open market, however, SOL prices have continued to grow.  Some market watchers have hypothesized that the FTX estate may soon run out of SOL, citing data from the on-chain analytics tool SponOnChain.  Data suggests institutional investments into SOL tokens may have picked up in the past weeks. Last week, shares of the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) hit a premium of nearly 900% to the spot SOL held in each share – indicative of rampant demand for the token among regulated funds.  Elsewhere, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in a CNBC interview on Tuesday that Solana was possibly a better bet than Ethereum, the world’s most used blockchain, in terms of technical capabilities.

20216659,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560775,1700049639,XRP Will Not Become A Stablecoin For Banks After AMM Launch: Expert,"In the wake of Ripple’s announcement regarding the integration of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) into the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the community has been abuzz with speculation and debate. Central to this discourse is the potential transformation of XRP in light of this update, particularly in regard to its classification and function as a digital asset. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, previously hailed this update as the most significant for XRPL, raising expectations among stakeholders. Additionally, at the recent Swell conference, Ripple revealed plans to integrate its rebranded Ripple Payments product with the XRPL’s native decentralized exchange (DEX), further stirring discussions among community members. The community’s response has been a mix of euphoria and confusion. Digital Perspectives, a key community influencer with over 150,000 followers on X, expressed concerns over the potential implications of this update: “Are we watching XRP become a stablecoin with the introduction of AMMs and the Prudential Treatment requirements from the Bank of International Settlement [BIS]? Cat 1 vs Cat 2, where would you classify XRP?” Related Reading: New XRP Ledger Upgrade Goes Live, What’s New? He further questioned, “When XLS-30D passes and AMMs become an integral part of the XRPL, will it change the characteristics of XRP and qualify as a group 1b asset for BIS and other banks?” XRP Price Volatility Is Necessary Panos Mekras, the co-founder of crypto-focused company Anodos, quickly intervened to dispel the rumors and speculation about XRP morphing into a stablecoin to fit into the 1b asset class of the BIS with the advent of the AMM. Mekras, who has previously clashed with Digital Perspectives over misinformation, laid out a detailed refutation of the idea that XRP could become a stablecoin. He emphasized, “The fundamental nature of XRP as the native coin of the XRP Ledger, a decentralized digital asset traded freely, is unchangeable. It’s technically impossible for XRP to transform into a stablecoin, a concept that completely contradicts its inherent design.” Related Reading: Stunning Correlation Emerges Between XRP And XLM, What’s Going On? He further delved into the dynamics of AMMs, noting that they are most effective in environments with high volatility. This volatility benefits liquidity providers (LPs) by attracting more traders and, consequently, increasing trading volume and fees. According to Mekras, the AMM is tailored to take advantage of such market conditions. Mekras also highlighted the potential impact of the AMM on XRP’s market dynamics. He suggested that the AMM’s implementation might lead to an increase in buying pressure on XRP. A significant portion of the token is expected to be locked in the AMM, which would enhance its liquidity and attract more traders. This, in turn, would make the crypto token more versatile and efficient for various use cases. In his concluding remarks, Mekras called for a more informed understanding within the community. He stressed the need to focus on the technical aspects of XRPL and the AMM, advising against following individuals who propagate misinformation. “The community should stop following and paying attention to enablers of misinformation such as Digital Perspectives and learn more about the technicals of the XRPL and the AMM,” Mekras said. At press time, the XRP price found support at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level in the 1-day chart and traded at $0.6333.

42392055,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzaqD,1700049600,Blockchain Startup Kinto Plans 'First KYC'd' Ethereum Layer-2 Network After Raising $5M,"Ethereum-focused blockchain project Kinto disclosed it has raised $5 million in fundraising rounds this year to develop a layer-2 network that's fully compliant with anti-money-laundering laws, aiming to connect financial institutions and real-world assets with decentralized finance (DeFi) rails.  The project is built using the OP Stack, which is a set of software tools created by the developer OP Labs that companies can use to easily spin up their own customized layer-2 networks. The technology derives from Optimism, the second-biggest layer-2 network atop Ethereum. Coinbase, the big U.S. crypto exchange, famously relied on OP Stack to build its own layer-2 blockchain, Base.  Kinto secured $1.5 million in a pre-seed investment earlier this year from Kyber Capital Crypto, according to a press release on Tuesday. It received another $3.5 million recently in a round led by Kyber Capital Crypto, Spartan Group and Parafi. SkyBridge Capital, Kraynos, Soft Holdings, Deep Ventures, Modular, Tane and Robot Ventures also participated in the round.  The Kinto network features native know-your-customer (KYC) checks – a type of anti-money-laundering prevention – and investor accreditation mechanism to help onboard regulated financial institutions – solving a major headache for them if they want to access blockchain-based protocols, Kinto co-founder Alan Keegan said in an interview with CoinDesk.  According to the press release, Kinto becomes the ""first KYC'd layer 2 (L2) blockchain capable of supporting both modern financial institutions and decentralized protocols.""  Only KYC'd entities can transact on the network, so this way Kinto can eliminate anonymous exploits and scams that proliferate on DeFi platforms, Keegan added. The network also offers insurance and developer incentives to build applications from transaction fees.  ""We believe that a fully KYC'd layer 2 on top of Ethereum is an inevitability, and we have extremely strong conviction that Kinto is the right team to execute this vision,"" Alex Klokus, co-founder and managing partner at Kyber Capital Crypto, said in a statement.

20214913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560768,1700046001,"Solana Institutional Inflows Surge In One Week, Can The Price Reach $100?","Institutional inflows into digital asset investment products based on Solana spiked last week, particularly as these investment products saw a 7th consecutive week of inflows. Digital asset investment products have had inflows since the end of September and throughout October, reflecting the bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market. As a result, inflows into Solana have increased steadily, and last week jumped by 15% compared to the week before. Solana Institutional Inflows Surge Solana has been on an incredible run recently and has had one of the best price gains this month. Solana’s native token SOL has seen its price skyrocket over 160% in the past 30 days alone amidst the wider buying in the crypto industry. The crypto is up by 33% in a 7-day timeframe, despite the ongoing consolidation in Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and a few other cryptocurrencies in the same timeframe. Related Reading: New XRP Ledger Upgrade Goes Live, What’s New? According to CoinShares’s latest weekly report on digital asset funds, inflows into digital asset investment products did not mirror this consolidation, as inflows reached $293 million last week. Solana had around $12.4 million in inflows, up from $10.8 million the previous week. As a result, its year-to-date inflows have now crossed over $120 million. On the broader end, total exchange-traded products have now crossed a historic $1 billion mark this year and are now at $1.14 billion. This was particularly fueled by inflows into Bitcoin investment products, which made up around 19% of the cryptocurrency’s total trading volume last week. Bitcoin saw inflows totaling $240 million last week, pushing its year-to-date inflows to $1.08 billion. On the other hand, short-bitcoin saw $7 million in outflows, indicating an ongoing positive sentiment. Ethereum also witnessed an inflow of $49 million, while Litecoin and XRP had outflows of $0.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Can SOL Reach $100? Solana is now definitely on its way to the $100 mark, as shown by technical analysis and fundamental analysis of strong bullish price action and institutional inflows. Solana is now looking to shake off the deterrence from the FTX fiasco and is now up by more than 520% since the beginning of the year. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says MATIC Price Will Rocket Above $1.5 If This Happens On-chain data also shows that Solana has grown its DeFi TVL by $136 million since the beginning of November. According to DeFiLlama, the total TVL on DeFi protocols based on Solana now sits at $546 million. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $58, still a long way from its all-time high of $260. However, SOL has been predicted to surge more than 80% in November. If the crypto’s momentum keeps accelerating at this pace, a return to the $100 price target seems well within reach.

42392052,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzaap,1700045030,"Central Bank Digital Currencies Can Replace Cash, Offer Resilience: IMF Chief","Central bank digital currencies can replace cash in island economies and offer resilience in more advanced economies, according to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.  The public sector should, therefore, continue to prepare for CBDC deployment, she said.  Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) can replace physical money, especially in economies where cash deployment is costly, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva said during a Wednesday speech.  CBDCs are digital iterations of sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro issued by central banks, potentially utilizing technologies that underlie cryptocurrencies. Governments worldwide see these currencies as something that could support the digitization of payments, improve the efficiency of cross-border payments and help financial inclusion – by bringing financial services to unbanked or underbanked populations.  While some institutions like the European Union’s apex bank ECB have insisted that a CBDC will not replace cash, Georgieva’s comments indicate it could be a possibility – and even beneficial – for some economies.  “CBDCs can replace cash which is costly to distribute in island economies. They can offer resilience in more advanced economies. And they can improve financial inclusion where few hold bank accounts,” she said at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Wednesday.  While there is “so much uncertainty” over applications for CBDCs and adoption is very low, there is also space for innovation, and “this is not the time to turn back,” Georgieva said.  “The public sector should keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future,” she said, adding that these platforms should be designed from the start to facilitate cross-border payments, which are currently “expensive, slow and available to few.”  While financial institutions like the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have called on countries to set up relevant legislation to support CBDCs, major jurisdictions still haven’t made any decisions on whether to issue them.  Georgieva also echoed BIS Chief Agustin Carstens’ recent comments that CBDCs will be central to financial innovation and that the private sector will have to play a major role in bringing the currencies to market.  “Country authorities wishing to introduce CBDCs may need to think a little more like entrepreneurs. Communication strategies, and incentives for distribution, integration, and adoption, are as important as design considerations,” Georgieva said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/15/central-bank-digital-currencies-can-replace-cash-offer-resilience-imf-chief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acba61996c985a4852a83d9129830f170df56117-2917x1641.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The surge in the DYDX price comes as the project, previously just a decentralized exchange (DEX), launched its layer-1 blockchain based on Cosmos – a move that enables validators to receive a portion of trading revenue as a reward for staking.  Over the past 30 days, DYDX has more than doubled in price as speculators anticipated the token's migration from Ethereum to the dYdX chain. However, a large token unlock in just over two weeks has the potential to damp spirits. There are 179 million DYDX tokens in circulation, and the upcoming unlock will increase that to 395 million, according to token.unlocks.  The unlock was meant to take place in January this year, but was shelved until December, a decision that spurred an initial price hike earlier this year.  Research published earlier this year from The Tie reveals that large token unlocks lead to a decline in price as demand for the asset can't keep pace with the increase in supply, known as inflation.  DYdX CEO Antonio Juliano has attempted to remedy that by incentivizing staking, a method that involves locking tokens on a blockchain to receive rewards.

This blockchain powerhouse has solidified its position as the industry leader, particularly renowned for its association with blockbuster titles such as Gods Unchained and Guild of Guardians. The native token IMX of Immutable X has had an amazing upswing, rising by an astounding 140%, in an intriguing turn of events. From the bottom of a bear market, when it was trading at under $0.50, it has made a spectacular comeback and is currently trading at a healthy $1.12. Immutable X: Distinctive Mark On Digital Horizon With the yearly high of $1.56, which was reached in March, rapidly approaching, it begs the crucial question: Will this increasing trend in values continue? The scene is set, the figures are moving, and analysts keep a close tab on the next developments in IMX’s financial story. Related Reading: Celestia Strikes: How This Lesser-Known Coin Went Berserk With 126% Price Explosion In the ever-evolving landscape of digital entertainment and blockchain technology, Immutable X has carved a niche for itself by not only powering but revolutionizing the gaming experience.

IMX market cap slightly above $1.4 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Immutable has recently announced a new collaboration with Ubisoft, a prominent gaming company known for its successful series such as Assassin’s Creed and Prince of Persia.

42392044,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzZvn,1700042400,Blockchain Developer Lattice Unveils 'Alternative Data Availability' Network for Optimism,"The Optimism blockchain ecosystem is getting its own ""alternative data availability"" or ""alt-DA"" chain, called Redstone – courtesy of the development team Lattice.  Currently still operating as a test network, Redstone aims to be cost-effective for on-chain games and decentralized applications.  Optimism is an ecosystem of so-called layer-2 chains, designed for cheaper and faster transactions, including the original OP Mainnet, currently the world's second-biggest layer-2 network in terms of value deposited. The affiliated networks rely on ""optimistic rollup"" technology – a reference to how transactions are settled to the main ""layer-1"" or ""L1"" Ethereum blockchain. In October 2022, developers at OP Labs, who helped create OP Mainnet, released OP Stack, allowing developers to create their own blockchains.  According to a blog post shared with CoinDesk, Redstone would operate “like a traditional optimistic rollup, except instead of posting the input state to L1, we post a data commitment hash. The input state corresponding to the input commitment is stored off-chain by a data availability provider.”  Redstone is technically considered a ""plasma rollup blockchain,"" according to the team.  ""We call it alternative data availability, because the transaction data is available off-chain, not on Ethereum. To maintain security with this architecture, that’s why we have the permissionless on-chain DA challenge so that when the data is not available or doesn’t correspond to the data commitment, one can challenge it to be excluded,"" Justin Glibert, founder and chief executive officer of Lattice, shared in an email to CoinDesk.  The Lattice team plans to join the Optimism ecosystem and contribute to the OP Stack as core developers, according to the press release.  Data availability has been a major topic of discussion in the Ethereum ecosystem, as developers look for ways to store and provide consensus on the blockchain data availability for transactions – without adding to on-chain congestion.  Other solutions for data availability, such as data availability layers like Celestia and Avail, have formed to address tackle the challenge. Near Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the Near blockchain, last week announced the rollout of a new ""NEAR DA,"" where posting data could be 8,000 times cheaper than posting on Ethereum.

The tests will examine bilateral digital asset trades, foreign currency payments, multicurrency clearing and settlement, fund management and automated portfolio rebalancing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said Wednesday.  JPMorgan and Apollo have carried out a ""proof of concept"" to demonstrate how asset managers could tokenize funds on the blockchain as part of the project, the firms announced concurrently with MAS' statement. The initiative is part of Project Guardian, a policymaker group that includes Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), the U.K's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to advance asset tokenization.  The MAS is also exploring the design of a digital infrastructure to host tokenized assets and applications, called Global Layer One (GL1), to enable cross-border transactions and allow tokenized assets to be traded across global liquidity pools.  Tokenization, the term used for minting real-world assets as blockchain-based tokens, is one use case for digital asset technology attracting the attention of the world's most prominent mainstream financial institutions due to its potential to expedite processes and make them more efficient and less costly.

42392043,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzZgP,1700040018,Bitcoin's Options Market Has Overtaken Its Futures Market in a Sign of Growing Sophistication,"The bitcoin options market is now bigger than the BTC futures market in terms of notional open interest.  The flipping is a sign of market maturity and the influx of sophisticated traders in the market.  The crypto market has come back to life this year, with bitcoin [BTC] doubling in value, supposedly on the back of haven demand, spot ETF excitement in the U.S. and dovish Federal Reserve expectations.  While most activity was initially concentrated in bitcoin's spot and futures markets, options tied to the cryptocurrency, which offer a cheap way to bet on a price rise or drop, have become more prominent.  In terms of open interest (OI), the BTC options market is now bigger than the futures market. At press time, the U.S. dollar value locked in active options contracts stood at $17.39 billion, almost 10% more than futures' open interest of $15.84 billion, according to data source CoinGlass.  Increased activity in the options market is a sign of market sophistication, according to Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of leading crypto options exchange Deribit.  ""The surpassing of BTC options open interest over futures OI is a clear sign of the market maturing,"" Strijers told CoinDesk. ""This shift indicates a growing preference for options as tools for strategic positioning, hedging, or access to the recent rise of implied volatility, reflecting the market's evolving sophistication.""  A bigger options market also means traders need to consider the impact of quarterly and monthly settlements and market makers' hedging activities on spot prices.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put confers the right to sell.  Traditionally, options are used to mitigate risk, although some speculators use them like futures to amplify returns. Bulls typically buy puts to protect against a potential downside, while bears use call options to protect from a sudden upswing in prices. Efficient use of options is contingent on a thorough understanding of key metrics, the so-called Greeks – delta, gamma, theta and rho, that affect the price of an options contract.  One possible reason for options' growing popularity is that they allow traders to not only hedge against and profit from the bitcoin price, but also other factors such as volatility or the degree of price turbulence and time.  Writing or selling options to profit from a market lull and collect an additional yield on top of the spot market holdings were popular strategies earlier this year. More recently, traders have bought options to benefit from the renewed volatility explosion. Volatility has a positive impact on options' prices.  Unlike options, spot and futures markets are one-dimensional, allowing speculation only on the direction of the price.  Futures contracts commit a buyer to pay for and a seller to deliver a particular asset at a future date. Futures are generally considered more risky than options, involving greater leverage and allowing traders to control assets of much greater value. That exposes futures traders to outsized losses that exceed the value of their initial deposit and to forced liquidations by exchanges.

Central banks representing 67% of countries around the world and 98% of global gross domestic product (GDP) are exploring CBDCs, and 33% of them are in advanced stages, the report said.  A CBDC is a digital currency that is issued by a government and is normally a tokenized form of the country’s fiat currency.  “The Federal Reserve (Fed) continues to pilot CBDCs but has not committed to a CBDC and will not issue one without executive branch and Congressional support,” analysts led by Alkesh Shah wrote.  “CBDC benefits and risks depend on the design and issuance approach, but we expect CBDCs to provide a more efficient and less costly payment system for cross-border and domestic payments, a tool for monetary policy implementation and improved financial inclusion,” the authors wrote.  Still, “they may also drive competition with bank deposits, more frequent bank runs, loss of monetary sovereignty and tensions among countries globally,” the bank said.  Central banks and governments are expected to drive digital asset innovation by “leveraging the private sector and beneficiaries to emerge across all phases of CBDC implementation.”  Bank of America reiterates its view that CBDCs have the “potential to revolutionize global financial systems.”  The Swiss National Bank (SNB) said earlier this month that it was working on a wholesale CBDC pilot alongside the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) and six commercial banks.

20210503,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560734,1700037047,"Bitcoin Macro Index Enters ‘Expansion’, Echoing 400% Bull Run Surge","In a detailed market update, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investment, has provided an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s current market position, highlighting a pivotal shift to an ‘expansion’ phase in the Bitcoin Macro Index. This transition is particularly noteworthy as it parallels conditions observed prior to historical price surges in Bitcoin’s valuation. Bitcoin has recently experienced a sharp uptick, ascending from $34,000 to an interim high of $38,000. After a brief period of resistance, the price corrected to approximately $36,500. Edwards highlights this movement as a critical technical victory, with Bitcoin overcoming and holding above the major resistance benchmarks of $35,000 on both the weekly and monthly timeframes. Related Reading: Bearish Divergence? Bitcoin Price Rises, But Network Growth Sends Warning Signals This consolidation above key resistance levels sets a bullish context in the high timeframe technical analysis, positioning Bitcoin in a strong technical stance according to traditional market indicators. “The recent breakout into the 2021 range offers the best high timeframe technical setup we have seen in years. Provided $35K holds on a weekly and monthly basis in November, the next significant resistance is range high ($58-65K).” Bitcoin Macro Index Enters Expansion The crux of Edwards’ update is the shift in the Bitcoin Macro Index, a complex model synthesizing over 40 metrics encompassing Bitcoin’s on-chain data, macro market indicators, and equity market influences. The index does not take price as an input, thus providing a ‘pure fundamentals’ perspective. The current expansion is the first since November 2020, and only the third instance since the index’s inception, with the two previous occasions leading to substantial price rallies in the following periods. Edwards elucidates this with a direct quote: “The transition from recovery to expansion is simply the optimal time to allocate to Bitcoin from a risk-reward opportunity for this model.” Related Reading: Why $36,300 Is the Key For Bitcoin’s Next Big Bounce: Insights From Liquidity Map A look at the Bitcoin chart reveals that the Bitcoin price rose by a whopping 400% during the last bull run from early November 2020 to November 2021, after the Macro Index entered the expansion phase. The first historical signal was provided by the Macro Index on November 9, 2016, which was followed by a massive bull run of almost 2,600% until Bitcoin reached its then all-time high of $20,000 in February 2018. Short-Term Technicals And Derivatives Market Analysis In the short term, the technical outlook presents a mixed picture, according to Edwards. The derivative markets are indicating an overheated state, with low timeframe analysis suggesting a retracement could be imminent. Edwards introduces the ‘Bitcoin Heater’ metric, recently launched on Capriole Charts, which aggregate various derivatives market data and quantify the level of market risk based on the open interest and heating level of perpetuals, futures, and options markets. The below chart shows that most of the time when the Bitcoin Heater is above 0.8, the market corrects or consolidates. “But there are large exceptions to the rule: such as the primary bull market rally from November 2020 through to Q1 2021. We should expect this metric to be high more frequently in 2024 (much like Q4 2020 – 2021),” Edwards stated. The analyst concluded that the overall trend for Bitcoin remains positive, with major data points indicating a strong bullish scenario. However, he also cautioned about potential short-term risks in the low timeframe technicals and derivatives market. These, according to him, are common in the development of a bull run and could offer valuable opportunities if dips occur. At press time, BTC traded at $35,626.

42392054,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzafx,1700034136,Crypto Futures Funding Rates Normalize After Bitcoin Drops to $35.6K,"Funding rates on the futures of major tokens have started to revert to normal levels after recent euphoria led to traders paying unusually high fees to remain in their long positions.  Large movements in spot markets led to open interest surging to over $35 billion over the weekend, indicating highly leveraged bets from traders hoping for even higher prices. This was a near 40% increase since the $24 billion level at the end of October, data shows.  The levered pile-on meant funding levels moved to some of their highest in recent months. Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets.  Data shows traders were paying anywhere from 0.2% to 0.5% in fees every eight hours on their borrowed funds to remain in their long positions. This meant speculators paid as much as 50 cents to exchanges on a $100 position.  However, some market watchers warned of a dump as traders were more incentivized to go short or bet against, a price rise as such positions earned fees from those going long. In futures trading, longs pay shorts when funding is positive, and vice-versa when funding is negative.  This likely culminated in Tuesday’s market drop as traders took profits on a week-long rise.  Nearly 90% of bullish bets were liquidated, amounting to over $300 million, with bitcoin traders losing $120 million as prices sank 4%. Ether traders lost $63 million, while XRP and Solana’s SOL-tracked futures saw over $30 million in cumulative liquidations.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move. As such, funding rates are back to normal levels of an average of 0.01% on most exchanges as of Wednesday morning.  Crypto markets added over 6% in the past week on the back of heightened expectations of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S., with some analysts reiterating a 90% chance of a January nod.

Since FTX blew up last year, a number of players in the crypto space have devised ways to trade and settle off-exchange from the safe confines of a trusted custody setup.  Off-exchange settlement is relatively easily done for spot markets, said the head of hedge fund solutions at CoinShares, Lewis Fellas. A big differentiator, he said, is providing a similar arrangement when it comes to derivatives trading.  “We've taken a collateral mirroring agreement and embedded that so we can trade the full suite of OKX products in the derivatives platform,” said Fellas in an interview. “This is a lot more complicated, because you've got margin financing, you have to deal with risk mitigation on the downside, for instance; so if the client puts on a huge position and it goes down, how do you deal with collateral calls, etc.”  As well as rolling out Komainu custody-based derivatives trading with the main Coinshares entity, a gaggle of other hedge funds will be using the new system, Fellas said without naming the funds. The settlement system will also be expanded to other exchanges in due course, he said.  OKX began working with custody specialist Komainu, a joint venture between Japanese bank Nomura, CoinShares and crypto storage firm Ledger, back in June of this year.  As well as dealing with the complexity of derivatives and swaps from the trading perspective, the firms have also created a standardized legal agreement that can then be adopted by a multitude of counterparties, said Sebastian Widmann, head of strategy at Komainu.  “If spot settlement is 0.1 of this phase, I think now with derivatives, we have reached 0.2,” Widmann said in an interview. “We are trying to bring standards into the marketplace as more firms enter, especially institutional players who are accustomed to having custody and exchange segregated.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/15/crypto-giant-okx-goes-live-with-off-exchange-derivatives-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d31629581c4d4f8d6cc95d29632609547664c3a2-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

JPM Coin: Ambitious Growth Goals Farooq expressed his aspiration for a substantial increase in transaction volume, aiming for a growth rate ranging from five to 10 times over the specified period. “We really think it’s going to start taking off,” he said during an interview with Haslinda Amin of Bloomberg TV Wednesday, on the sidelines of the Singapore FinTech Festival. Although the billion-dollar daily transaction volume achieved by JPM Coin is notable, it represents only a small fraction of the colossal $10 trillion in daily US dollar transactions managed by JPMorgan.

JPMorgan’s Onyx Digital Assets collaborated with interoperability layer Axelar, infrastructure provider Oasis Pro and Provenance Blockchain to manage large-scale client portfolios, execute trades and enable automated portfolio management of tokenized assets, according to the release.  After this article was published, press statements revealed several other participants in the demo: Interoperability protocol LayerZero; Ava Labs, creator of the Avalanche blockchain; Web3 developer Biconomy; and asset manager WisdomTree.  Oasis Pro enabled the tokenization of assets, such as Apollo funds, on the Provenance Blockchain Zone, according to the release.  The initiative is part of Project Guardian, a collaborative effort led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) alongside traditional finance institutions to discover opportunities and potential risks using decentralized finance. The announcement was made at Singapore’s Fintech Festival.  The demonstration also allowed wealth managers to purchase and rebalance their positions in tokenized assets across multiple chains.  “Our goal is to create solutions that bring significant efficiencies and enable better outcomes for asset and wealth managers and investors through personalized, highly scalable portfolios, regardless of asset class or where those assets are managed and recorded,” Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets, said in the release.  The move comes as a number of traditional finance institutions are showing growing interest in the blockchain industry. Earlier in the year, financial heavyweights including Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments announced the start of cryptocurrency exchange EDX Markets.  Onyx used the Axelar network to enable interoperability with the private blockchain, Provenance Blockchain Zone, used for the project. Oasis Pro, a fintech infrastructure provider for real-world-assets, implemented the tokenization of the assets on the Provenance Blockchain Zone.  “This is believed to be a first-of-its-kind blockchain interoperability solution for institutional financial services,” said Anthony Moro, CEO of Provenance Blockchain.  Provenance Blockchain has supported over $16 billion in transactions and currently has $9 billion in real-world financial assets on-chain, according to a press release.  JPMorgan carried out its first live blockchain-based collateral settlement transaction involving BlackRock and Barclays in October.

At spot rates, FTT trading volume, looking at how the token performs in Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, remains elevated at November 2022 levels. In November 2022, FTX, led by Sam Bankman-Fried, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Related Reading: BlackRock’s XRP ETF Filing, Everything You Need To Know Before this bankruptcy filing, FTT, which served several purposes in the FTX ecosystem, acting as a governance token and providing access, plunged in early November following allegations that the exchange had misappropriated user funds. There was a significant collapse on November 8 when FTT fell by 90%, taking the coin from around $22 to as low as $2. FTT is trading at around $3.22, up 232% from October 2023 lows, looking at the performance in the daily chart. As fundamental events around FTX unfold, FTT’s trading volume also rises. Compliance With The Law Is Crucial: SEC Chairperson There could be more gains for FTX in the days ahead should there be more solid news of an FTX 2.0 relaunch following Gary Gensler’s comments last week. Then, Gensler told CNBC that a revived FTX could see the light of day if only leaders taking over clearly understood existing laws. Related Reading: Crypto.com Acquires License In Dubai As Cronos (CRO) Price Slips The SEC chairperson’s comments follow speculations that the former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) president, Tom Farley, is among the three bidders planning to buy FTX. “If Tom or anybody else wanted to be in this field, I would say, ‘Do it within the law. Build investors’ trust in what you’re doing and ensure that you’re doing the proper disclosures — and also that you’re not commingling all these functions, trading against your customers. Or using their crypto assets for your purposes.” A jury in early November found Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, guilty of all criminal charges, including wiring fraud and money laundering. Bankman-Fried is set for sentencing in March 2024.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $36,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could trade in a range before the bulls attempt a new increase in the near term. Bitcoin Price Revisits Key Support Bitcoin price failed to surpass the $37,500 resistance. BTC started a fresh decline from the $37,423 high and declined below many supports. There was a move below the $36,000 and $35,500 levels. The price even spiked below $35,000. It retested the $34,650 support zone. A low was formed near $34,666 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $35,000 level.

Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The first major resistance is near $36,780, above which the price might accelerate further higher. In the stated case, it could test the $37,000 level. Any more gains might send BTC toward the $37,500 level, above which the price could gain bullish momentum and rally toward $38,000. More Losses In BTC?

20201030,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560709,1700017208,Crypto Analyst Reveals 10 Top Altcoins To Watch This Week,"The altcoins market has recently witnessed a resurgence of interest and confidence, primarily driven by the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). This renewed enthusiasm has resulted in a bull uptrend, with most of the top 100 cryptocurrencies benefiting from Bitcoin’s resurgence. However, the market is currently experiencing a correction as Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) face pullbacks after failed attempts to breach upper resistance lines. Despite this correction, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher shares insights and highlights several altcoins with potentially significant gains. SOL Emerges As Safe Haven In Crypto Market Correction Solana has exhibited remarkable growth, even as the broader market experiences a correction. With a 0.5% gain in the past 24 hours, SOL’s potential for further upside cannot be ignored. Deutscher suggests that SOL may continue to benefit from the ongoing rotation of investments from other Layer-1 solutions like Avalanche (AVAX) and Fantom (FTM). Thorchain (RUNE) has been on an impressive upward trajectory, prompting investors to consider buying on deep corrections and wicks. The primary decentralized exchange (DEX) on Thorchain, THOR, has also shown positive movement, further bolstering the growth potential. Polygon (MATIC) has recently shown signs of strength and has generated whispers within the crypto community about a potential zero-knowledge (ZK) narrative. If this narrative materializes, MATIC, a leader in the space, could attract significant positive flows. Related Reading: Cardano: Midnight Devnet Goes Live – Trigger For New ADA Rally? Within the ZK narrative, altcoins like Dusk Network (DUSK), Loopring (LRC), and Mina Protocol (MINA) are poised to benefit. Deutscher believes that each altcoin offers unique strengths and value propositions, and their performance will depend on the strength of the emerging ZK narrative. Soteria (SEI) has gained attention as it enters the top 10 for volume traded by pairs on Upbit. Considered a “new coin,” SEI exhibits fundamentals similar to the next altcoin on the watchlist. Tidal Finance (TIA) is a relatively new token similar to the early days of Aptos (APT). The market tends to favor new and innovative tokens, and although TIA’s rally may have started to cool off, it still holds explosive potential. With a current market capitalization of $700 million, TIA remains an intriguing opportunity for investors. DEX And Gaming Altcoins Poised To Thrive In addition to altcoins, perp decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens like GMX, DYDX, and Gnosis (GNS) are positioned to benefit from market volatility. According to Deutscher, these tokens have shown a correlation between price movements and fundamental factors. If volatility persists, these tokens could present favorable medium-term investment opportunities. Yield Guild Games (YGG) and Gamestarter (GMT), gaming tokens with initial upward movements, are expected to continue outperforming the broader market. These gaming tokens could witness sustained growth with the YGG conference scheduled for November 18. Related Reading: Crypto.com Acquires License In Dubai As Cronos (CRO) Price Slips While the current correction in the cryptocurrency market has led to pullbacks in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the altcoin landscape still offers potential opportunities for investors. Solana’s continued uptrend, along with the prospects of altcoins like Thorchain, Polygon, and those associated with the ZK narrative, suggest possible avenues for growth. Additionally, emerging tokens like Soteria and Tidal Finance, perp DEX tokens, and gaming tokens may also provide favorable investment prospects.

20199315,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560703,1700013641,Solana Is Up 520% In 1 Year: Why Is This Metric Worrying For Bulls?,"Solana (SOL) has been soaring, looking at the performance in the daily chart. At spot rates, the coin is trading above $50, up 520% in the past year when it slipped below $8 following the collapse of FTX, a now-defunct crypto exchange, and Alameda Research, a trading wing linked with FTX and one of the leading crypto market makers. Solana Blistering Rally At The Back Of Dropping Liquidity? Though Solana is “blistering” and at new 2023 highs, Kaiko, a crypto analytics platform, is concerned about the disparity in liquidity in USD and “native unit” terms. Typically, the “native unit” refers to the base unit of account of any currency, in this case, SOL. Native units can be used to measure market depth since it provides easier access for gauging the relative liquidity of the coin without the need to convert it to other denominations, like USD or BTC, for example. Related Reading: Celestia Strikes: How This Lesser-Known Coin Went Berserk With 126% Price Explosion As Kaiko notes on November 14, at a 1% market depth, Solana’s liquidity in USD terms is at the highest level since the collapse of FTX. However, looking at SOL’s liquidity through another lens, the coin is struggling. Using “native units” as a liquidity gauge, it is at the lowest point since the FTX collapse. SOL Still Reeling From FTX Collapse, What Happens Next? The collapse of FTX was critical not only for SOL and its native tokens but also for the broader crypto markets. Following the bankruptcy of the Sam Bankman Fried exchange in November 2022, SOL prices cratered as fear of contagion across the board also saw Bitcoin (BTC) prices shrink, failing at its perceived role as a safe haven. By November 2022, Bitcoin had flash crashed below $16,000, with Solana dumping from highs of $220 to as low as $8. This contraction also saw crypto’s liquidity, which was more adverse in Solana. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Plunge To $30,200 If This Level Is Lost: Analyst Looking at how liquid SOL is in its native units, it is apparent that liquidity is yet to recover and might require more time despite the general optimism across Solana communities. According to Kaiko, it suggests that market makers are opting to maintain stable liquidity for SOL even with soaring prices in USD terms. Presently, SOL prices are steady above $50 but maintain an uptrend versus the USD. There are a series of lower lows in lower time frames, early indicators that the upside momentum might be cooling off, and SOL traders possibly exiting their long positions. Even so, $38, marking November 2022 highs, is a vital reaction point for technical analysts.

42392068,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzkGv,1700011136,India's Supreme Court Turns Away Petition Asking Government to Frame Crypto Guidelines,"India's Supreme Court refused to entertain a petition which sought a direction to the government to frame legislation for crypto.  The petitioner is currently in judicial custody, accused of ""inducing people to invest money in a scheme.""  India's Supreme Court, a historical hope for the nation's cryptocurrency industry, turned away a petition that sought to direct the government and relevant authorities to frame guidelines for regulating the trading and mining of cryptocurrencies.  The public interest litigation (PIL) by Manu Prashant Wig against the Union of India and others, which also asked for a direction for the prosecution of cases involving digital assets, was denied on Friday.  ""Though the petition is under Article 32 of the Constitution, it is evident that the real purpose is to seek bail in proceedings which are pending against the petitioner. We are unable to subscribe to this course of action,"" the order said. Article 32 of India's Constitution allows an individual to directly approach the highest court to protect their fundamental rights.  Wig, a Director at Blue Fox Motion Picture Limited, the entity purportedly behind Tokenz Limited, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, is currently in judicial custody, accused of ""inducing people to invest money in a scheme"" in a case filed by the Economic Offence Wing of Delhi Police, according to Bar and Bench, a domestic news platform covering India's courts. More than 130 victims have alleged that they were defrauded. Earlier this year, Wig's wife also filed for and won anticipatory bail from a court as the investigation team sought to question her.  In 2020, the Supreme Court overturned a 2018 notice from India's central bank which effectively banned banks from supporting or engaging in crypto transactions, giving life to the industry. But in 2022 India introduced stiff taxes – which the industry saw as a ""shadow ban."" Payment processors cut off local crypto exchanges, and the government undertook enforcement actions against at least 10 crypto exchanges, leaving them fighting for survival.  ""Why should the Supreme Court look into this?"" asked the bench, composed of Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Mishra, according to the Bar and Bench report. However, according to the order, India's top court gave Wig the ""liberty to move the appropriate court for the grant of regular bail"" because the relief concerned is more in a ""nature of a legislative direction.""  ""Courts in India have no authority to direct the legislature to frame a law,"" according to legislative research body PRS, even though there are rare cases when the Supreme Court has challenged this ""separation of powers."" Yet, India's government has previously told the Supreme Court that only the Parliament can frame or enact a law.  India's position on crypto came under increased scrutiny after Sept. 2023, when it pushed the G20 during its presidency to accept global guidelines for crypto without having its own legislation in place. India has kept a crypto bill in cold storage since 2021 but did indicate it will decide its position in the coming months.  India has seen a spate of crypto scams in the past few months leading to increased action from authorities.

Chainlink Has Registered Some Drawdown In The Past 24 Hours Just during the weekend, Chainlink had been floating above the $16 mark, but winds seem to have shifted for the coin in the past couple of days, as it has registered some drawdown. During the last 24 hours alone, LINK has dropped around 6%, leading to its price slipping below the $14 level. The chart below shows how the cryptocurrency has performed in the past month. LINK appears to have gone down in the last two days | Source: LINKUSD on TradingView As displayed above, Chainlink had been riding some sharp bullish momentum in this period before this latest plunge, as the asset had more than doubled in value. Despite the decline, LINK is still up over 90% in the past month, which is an impressive return. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Plunge To $30,200 If This Level Is Lost: Analyst Naturally, the investors may be wondering now if the asset has already hit its peak for this rally or if there is more to come shortly. It’s hard to say anything about that, but perhaps on-chain data could provide some hints. LINK Activity Has Been Relatively High Recently In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shared the data of some Chainlink on-chain indicators. First, when the firm made the post, about 56% of the asset’s investors were sitting on some profit. Looks like 39% of the holders had been underwater | Source: IntoTheBlock on X The cryptocurrency had then been floating at higher levels than currently (although not too high), so more LINK addresses would have entered a state of loss by now. Generally, investors in profit are more likely to sell at any point, so a large amount of them being in the green could raise the probability of a selloff. Some Chainlink investors are currently harvesting their profits, but the profitability ratio is still not skewed that much towards profits. Next, IntoTheBlock has talked about the number of transactions on the network. The value of the metric seems to have been going up recently | Source: IntoTheBlock on X “The Chainlink network is showing many positive signs in terms of transaction data,” says the intelligence platform. “Notably, we see a healthy increase in the number of transactions.” The number of transactions is up 436% from the monthly lows, and as is usually the case, the volume has also spiked alongside this rise. LINK volume hit $515 million last week | Source: IntoTheBlock on X The transaction activity being high suggests there is interest behind the asset, and so, the price action shouldn’t go stale just yet. However, the volatility due to this activity can go either way, as the asset is already witnessing. Related Reading: Chainlink Forms Sell Signal, Analyst Predicts Pullback To This Level A metric that could more solidly point at a direction for the cryptocurrency is the large holder netflow, which keeps track of the net accumulation/distribution behavior over the last month for LINK holders carrying more than 1% of the supply. The metric's value has been positive recently | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As is visible in the chart, the large Chainlink holders have been buying recently, which could potentially be a positive sign for the asset. This doesn’t have to mean that the rally would restart shortly, of course, but it does provide some support for the idea.

If all goes as planned, this new version will be available to all node operators by November 13, 2023,” Krippenreiter stated. The community member described the new API version, APIV2, which offers more functionalities than traditional APIs. The launch of API V2 on XRPL will include the introduction of a DeliverMax feature, added error messages, and removed API methods. Krippenreiter also described the XRP ledger’s Transaction Per Second (TPS) performance and stability. He stated that the new upgrades on this functionality were originally proposed by MarkTravis15 on X, and incorporated three changes that may improve the performance of the ledger. These changes focus on enhancing the consensus stability, implementing asynchronous writing of batches to NuDB, and introducing periodic intervals when applying transaction batches. Another noteworthy upgrade to the XRP Ledger is the introduction of a new RPC method which allows software apps to effectively connect to a specific network in the XRPL ecosystem by asking information from the node. Other changes in the XRP Ledger include bug fixes and refactoring or rewriting of codes to ensure better readability and efficiency. Voting Opens For Ledger Amendments While providing details on updates in the newest version of the XRP Ledger, Krippenreiter highlighted a series of proposed amendments. These amendments, if approved by the community and subsequently implemented, may have a significant positive impact on the XRPL ecosystem. The first amendment, originally titled federated side chains, involves bidirectional connectivity to XRPL assets. This proposal aims to open new routes for interoperability in the XRP ecosystem using witness servers like Xahau, CBDCL, and others. Related Reading: Renowned Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Crash Before Spot ETF Approvals Krippenreiter also described the second amendment which implements a sovereign identity solution on XRPL called decentralized identifiers (DID). A third amendment seeks to address the unexpected behavior of the XRPL payment engine, providing solutions that appropriately fix the problem. Finally, the last amendment will help clarify how authorized trust lines should be established and permitted. This proposal specifically focuses on situations where the issuer and user enable certain settings on their accounts.
