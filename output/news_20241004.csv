According to CoinGecko, RENDER fell by nearly 13% since last week, putting into perspective the bearishness that overcame the market’s bulls in the start of October. Related Reading: Is Crypto Losing Steam? Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024 Although the market fell by a small margin, it caused a massive liquidations of both long and short positions holding the token. For Render, “Uptober” might come later this month as the token recovers lost ground against the bears. However, on-chain developments continue to come for one of the most well-known decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) protocol. Render Displays September Achievements September for Render is incredibly bullish in terms of developments, one of the most notable is their support for Redshift, Mavon’s in-house 3D renderer. The tool itself has features that would heavily leverage Render’s decentralized compute niche that artists use in their workflow. With the coin already supporting the platform’s C4D file support of Mavon’s Cinema 4D, users of Redshift should not expect a hitch in using the integration. https://t.co/cSZk9wpIaK — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) October 1, 2024 Annabele Siconolfi, a 3D artist that tried Redshift integration on the platform, estimates the time saved in a recent render job by over 70-80 hours. The Render Network’s X account has also grown by 100%; from 100k to 200k. Render’s X account is one of the ways the platform can engage with the community, further enhancing its connection with the users of Render. https://t.co/SLedMsVO7X — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) September 30, 2024 Community engagement is important for decentralized networks as it helps with including the community in the decision making process. With this huge jump in community following, trust and belief on Render’s worth might have improved over the past month. RENDER Breaks $5.3 – Can It Continue Its Trajectory? At its current pace, RENDER bulls have broken through the $5.3 resistance– flipping it to support– after a brief breakthrough by the bears in the short term. As RENDER tries to settle above its current support level, the token might have enough momentum to continue its current trajectory. Related Reading: What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number However, the relative strength index (RSI) of the token is entering a possible bearish reversal zone that might support bearish movement in the medium term. If this occurs, RENDER’s position will be compromised with a possible return to $4.9 in the short term. If the bulls continue to wrestle for control of RENDER’s momentum, the token will stabilize on $5.3 in the short to medium term before the bulls can move upward, possibly targeting $6.3 in the long-term.

Basing his analysis on similarities between past price movements, the analyst has outlined a master plan for Floki, predicting that the popular meme coin and Shiba Inu competitor is set for a 2,000% surge. Analyst Reveals The Floki Master Plan In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst, ‘Master Kenobi’ discussed Floki’s past price movements, identifying a unique recurring chart pattern that could indicate a future price spike for the cryptocurrency. The analyst predicted that if Floki can continue this recurring pattern, a massive price pump could happen around October 22. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? According to the analyst, the Viking-themed meme coin experienced a sharp rise of about 92X over 112 days starting from July 5, 2021, followed by a long decline spanning 224 days, where its price crashed by a whopping 98.5%, reaching its bottom. Notably, the analyst asserted that after hitting that strategic low point, Floki had entered a more structured growth phase. On the Floki chart, Kenobi also identified three periods of price consolidation represented by distinctive purple triangles with similar heights but varying lengths. The analyst disclosed that inside these triangles, the price behavior of Floki becomes relatively predictable, marked by a red triangle. The lower half of this red triangle is seen as the best accumulation zone for investors, reflecting the most optimal entry point for Floki’s next upward move. Kenobi identified a recurring pattern where Floki typically exited this triangle around October 22 each year, representing the beginning of a new phase of consolidation followed by a massive price pump. He noted that this price pump is often signaled 35 days before the formation of the aforementioned red triangle. Continuing on this trend, the Shiba Inu competitor experienced another 11X increase 112 days after exiting the purple triangle on October 24, 2024. Similarly, after the meme coin moved out of the purple triangle on October 24 2023, it jumped 22X in 133 days. Based on this recurring pattern, Kenobi has suggested that Floki’s “magical date” for a potential bullish surge is likely around October 22. The analyst has forecasted that if the pattern holds, investors should expect a price rise followed by 3 months of strong consolidation. A 2,000% Price Pump To $0.002 Based on Kenobi’s observations highlighted above, he predicts that Floki could either witness a 1,000% surge to new highs or a 2,100% increase. The analyst disclosed that if the first scenario in 2021 repeats, after 112 days of consolidation, Floki could see its price skyrocketing by 11X to reach $0.0011.

Artificial intelligence-focused protocol Bittensor's {{TAO}}, Render's {{RNDR}} tokens rallied 14% and 8% over the past 24 hours, while the CoinDesk Computing Index, which tracks several AI-related tokens, was the biggest gainer among crypto sectors.  Notably, asset manager Grayscale upsized the weight of TAO in its decentralized AI-focused crypto fund to 27% from 3% in July, while adding the Graph {{GRT}}, replacing Livepeer (LPT).  Bitcoin steadily climbed during the U.S. trading hours to $62,300, up 2.2% during the day. The broad-market crypto benchmark Coindesk 20 Index rose 4.2% during the same period, underscoring that altcoins outperformed BTC.  Perhaps helping the move was a much stronger-than-anticipated U.S. labor market report, which added 251,000 jobs in September, blowing past estimates for 140,000. The unemployment rate decreased to 4.1%, quieting concerns of an imminent recession.  The positive sentiment rippled through the stock market as well, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closing the day 0.9% and 1.2% higher, respecitvely. The U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield jumped 13 basis points to just shy of 4%, while the U.S. dollar index rose to its strongest level since mid-August. Following the report, investors now overwhelmingly expect a smaller 25 basis point interest cut from the Federal Reserve in November.  ""Bitcoin and the longer tail of crypto assets are sensitive to labor market data because it influences the Fed’s decision on rate cuts, which in turn have a positive impact on BTC as borrowing costs fall,"" Leena ElDeeb, said research analyst at digital asset manager 21Shares. ""We expect flows to start recovering following the escalation of geopolitical tensions that shook the market over the past week.”  Bitcoin bottom likely in  Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said that the early October sell-off is likely over, with prices likely to grind higher in the coming weeks. Derivatives markets data suggest that investors aren't looking for hedges against further downside, added, Thielen, while large liquidations cascades as happened earlier this week often marked local price bottoms.  ""As long as the U.S. economy stays strong, stocks and crypto should have room to rise,"" Thielen said.  Will Clemente, founder of Reflexivity Research, said that the Fed easing monetary policy into a strong economy bodes well for bitcoin after this week's leverage flush.  ""People puked their positions because they were over-leveraged or fell for the Iran bottle rockets for a second time,"" Clemente said in an X post.

34314228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646237,1728072059,FET At Risk Of Further Decline? RSI Signals Sustained Bearish Pressure,"Recent price action is painting a bearish picture for FET, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signaling the potential for further declines. As the RSI hovers in bearish territory, the momentum seems to be favoring sellers, raising concerns of a deeper downturn. In the midst of the intensifying downside pressure, attention is shifting to the critical $0.9 support level. Holding this level is crucial for avoiding additional losses, as a breakdown could lead to more significant declines. With current market sentiment suggesting more losses may be in store, this article aims to analyze the ongoing bearish extension in FET, focusing on how the RSI signals increased bearish pressure. By examining key technical indicators and market trends, this piece will explore whether FET is likely to experience more declines or if any potential support levels could trigger a rebound. RSI Signals Growing Downside Momentum For FET FET has recently shifted into bearish territory on the 4-hour chart, slipping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and heading toward the critical $0.9 support level. This decline below the 100-day SMA signals weakening momentum, with sellers gaining control over the market. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index reveals that the signal line has decreased below 50%, and it is currently at 37%, reflecting increased selling pressure and diminishing buying interest. With the RSI in this territory, this points to the possibility of further downside movement for FET, highlighting a lack of bullish conviction in the market. Related Reading: FET: 30% Breakthrough Draws Investor Attention As New Developments Roll Out Furthermore, FET on the daily chart is displaying negative momentum after struggling to surpass the $1.8 resistance level. This struggle is highlighted by the formation of multiple bearish candlesticks, signaling persistent selling pressure in the market. Although the price remains above the 100-day SMA, which typically indicates a bullish trend, the inability to break through the $1.8 resistance suggests that upbeat strength is weakening, and FET could be poised for extended losses. A closer examination of the RSI formation on the 1-day chart indicates that the RSI signal line has dropped to 44%, recently falling below the important 50% threshold. Typically, an RSI reading below 50 suggests a bearish sentiment, indicating that the asset is losing steam. Such a decline could signal potential deeper corrections for FET unless a reversal is observed. Key Support Levels To Watch Amid Bearish Sentiment With bearish sentiment prevailing in the market, the $0.9 support level has become particularly crucial for FET. A breach below this level could ignite heightened selling pressure, possibly driving the price down toward the $0.4 support mark and beyond. Related Reading: FET Price Targets $3.4 After Breakout, Here Are The Key Levels To Watch If FET can maintain its strength and stay above the $0.9 support level, it may pave the way for a rebound, allowing the price to drift back toward the $1.8 resistance zone. A successful breakout above this key resistance level could spark a surge in buying activity, resulting in further gains as bullish momentum builds. Observing how FET reacts to these levels will be crucial, as they will indicate whether a recovery is on the horizon or if bearish pressure will reassert itself.

34313752,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646349,1728071027,"Bitcoin In Flux: Bearish Trends Can’t Deter $100,000 Price Predictions, CNBC","Following a volatile week, Bitcoin (BTC) has once again captured the attention of investors as it fluctuates between bearish and bullish sentiments. Earlier this week, the leading cryptocurrency retracted to the $59,800 mark after reaching a two-month high of $66,500 at the end of the previous week. Despite these fluctuations, analysts express confidence that Bitcoin could reach new records by year’s end. Could Bitcoin Prices Rise As Year-End Approaches? As noted in a recent CNBC report, a recent resurgence in demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offers a glimmer of hope for the cryptocurrency’s price in the medium term. Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst However, demand for BTC remains stagnant and needs a significant boost to facilitate any upward movement in its price. John Todaro, a crypto analyst at Needham, emphasized that a significant weekly buying demand is essential for a significant price increase. He told CNBC: Bitcoin’s overall market cap is very large now, at $1.2 trillion, and there is considerable liquidity. While there is a lot of buying volume, there are also a lot of sellers. Recent data from CryptoQuant also reveals a shift in Bitcoin ETF activity. After net selling 5,000 BTC on September 2, Bitcoin ETFs net purchased 7,000 BTC by the end of September, marking the highest daily purchase since July 21. Analysts believe that if this upward trend continues, it could help drive Bitcoin prices higher as the year progresses. Moreover, the fourth quarters of previous Halving cycles have historically been promising for BTC, with surges of 9%, 59% and 171% in 2012, 2016 and 2020 respectively. Interest Rate Cuts And Global Tensions Several factors have contributed to the current volatile price action, and there is hope for a further recovery for the leading digital asset. As highlighted by CNBC, the stock market has hit new highs, and both US presidential candidates have commented positively about cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut interest rates on September 18 and a series of rate cuts announced by China’s central bank have created an environment that could be favorable for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash While Bitcoin appears poised for a bullish fourth quarter, it still faces challenges, including a supply overhang stemming from US and German government actions and impending repayments to creditors from the Mt. Gox exchange. In addition, CNBC claims that many traders are taking a wait-and-see approach to the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election, which will take place in less than two months, and there are rising tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. At the time of writing, BTC has climbed above the $62,380 mark, gaining 2.6% in the last 24 hours.

The world's largest digital currency pared some of its gains at the very start of the week, coinciding with a modest decline across U.S. equity index futures. “Bitcoin's price started the week around $64k, and dropped to $60-61k on the news of rising geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel. Other financial assets such as U.S. stocks also sold off on these headlines, as it is common for geopolitical events to affect financial asset prices,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin financial services firm. BTC then continued to largely fall, and even dropped below the $60K threshold on October 2 and 3, amid rising geopolitical tensions. ""Although the week started strong with crypto assets gaining momentum from the news of U.S. rate cuts and China stimulus, the growing conflict in the Middle East prompted significant outflows from BTC ETFs and a decline in the prices of most crypto assets by Friday,"" said Nick Ruck, Independent Market Analyst. BTC ETFs have been seeing outflows for three consecutive days ending October 3. From the period between October 1 to October 3, the net outflows amounted to $361.2M, according to Farside Investors . However, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou , strategist at J.P. Morgan, said rising geopolitical tensions and the U.S. election are reinforcing a “debasement trade” and favoring both gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Recent geopolitical conflict has shifted attention to alternative asset classes or hedges, such as gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Panigirtzoglou added. Notable News TeraWulf ( WULF ) sold its 25% stake in the Nautilus Cryptomine joint venture to its partner, Talen Energy, in a transaction valued at ~$92M. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) produced 412 Bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) in the month of September, up 28% from 322 in August and 14% higher from last year. Bitcoin miner CleanSpark ( CLSK ) said on Thursday it mined 493 bitcoins in September, compared to 478 in August and 643 in September 2023. The Securities and Exchange Commission has appealed a court ruling in its case against Ripple Labs, under which the cryptocurrency company was fined $125M for improperly selling its XRP ( XRP-USD ) token. Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ) launched crypto transfers for its European customers, one of the most requested features in the region, the company said.

42390242,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu3Gd,1728068887,"U.S. Election Betting: Regulated Presidential Markets Are Live, and Tiny Compared to Polymarket's","Two U.S.-regulated, dollar-denominated prediction markets began taking bets on the presidential race this week, with a month to go before Election Day.  Kalshi, which fought a long legal battle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to offer election contracts in the U.S., launched its presidential markets on Friday, following Wall Street powerhouse Interactive Brokers' (IAB's) ForecastEx, which did so the day before.  So far volumes are modest at both CFTC-supervised exchanges, with $344,101 worth of contracts traded on Kalshi and $346,000 on ForecastEx. By comparison, more than $1.2 billion has been staked on the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump at Polymarket, the crypto-powered prediction market platform, which, despite prohibiting U.S. users under a CFTC settlement, has reaped record volumes this year while Kalshi and IAB sat on the sidelines awaiting legal clarity.  ""It will be hard for the two sites to catch up, but that is not entirely impossible,"" said Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. For one thing, ""some traders may switch from Polymarket to the other sites,"" he told CoinDesk. (Despite geofencing, American traders have reportedly been using VPNs to access Polymarket.)  Moreover, ""more than half of all trades will happen between now and election day if history is any guide (and there is more volume for close races which this looks to be),"" said Strumpf, who has studied the history of election markets.  However, Aaron Brogan, a managing attorney at Brogan Law, said that Polymarket has two advantages beyond being the first mover.  ""Polymarket is theoretically accessible to people all over the world. In contrast, Kalshi's products aren't available to 'foreign nationals' and certain other excluded groups,"" he said. ""Second, Polymarket doesn't have explicit position limits, but Kalshi's rules do. In this case, the limit is quite high, but it's conceivable that this could be a limiting factor on total market size.""  Price differences  Early afternoon Friday in New York, prices of ""yes"" shares for Harris were trading at 51 cents, signaling traders give her a 51% chance of winning. Trump's odds on Kalshi were at 50%.  Harris was also leading Trump on ForecastEx, but by a wider margin, 53-47. Meanwhile, on Polymarket, the two candidates were neck and neck, at 49% each.  Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said these differences were not very meaningful. ""We're used to using polls in election forecasting, and with polls, there's a well-understood margin of error, three percentage points usually, depending on sample size,"" he said.  Similarly, in markets there is sometimes a ""margin of inefficiency"" where any profits to be made from arbitraging price differences are not worth the effort. ""There's no sufficient incentive for anyone to scoop up the penny that the difference might present.""  But prediction markets ""don't need to be identical to be useful for forecasting,"" Crane said. Over time, observers can collect data on these markets, determine which ones had stronger predictive track records, and come up with a consensus forecast that might put more weight on one market than another, he said.  Unfinished business  Kalshi sued the CFTC last year after the agency denied its application to list contracts on which party would control each house of Congress. The company won the case (which the CFTC is appealing) and listed the congressional contracts on Sept. 13.  They traded for only a few hours before the appeals court granted the CFTC an administrative stay freezing the contracts, which it lifted Wednesday. Emboldened, the company not only revived the congressional contracts but self-certified the presidential one. Self-certification is the process whereby CFTC-regulated entities list products without the agency's prior approval. IAB, which started ForecastEx over the summer, quickly followed suit.  The CFTC, which is also considering a proposal to ban political event contracts at the exchanges on its watch, has asked the appeals court to expedite the case. Among other reasons, the agency said its proposed regulation ""may be substantially impacted by this Court's decision on the merits.""  But it's apparently given up on stopping these contracts from trading before the election. Its proposed timetable would have briefs filed by Nov. 22 (more than two weeks after Americans cast their votes) and oral arguments heard on Dec. 2.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/04/us-election-betting-regulated-presidential-markets-are-live-and-tiny-compared-to-polymarkets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44e2cac605317feb8a27242bbbf0a200d0bce27d-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390241,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu2gj,1728067282,HBO Is Joining Search for Bitcoin's Satoshi. Past Attempts Haven’t Turned Out Great.,"HBO says it knows who Satoshi is.  The television network is releasing a documentary, ""Money Electric: the Bitcoin Mystery,"" on Tuesday, with the claim that it will unveil the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.  The documentary is directed by investigative filmmaker Cullen Hoback, who made a name for himself unmasking the leader of the QAnon conspiracy theory as 8kun site administrator Ron Watkins in a 2021 documentary series for HBO. (Watkins has denied being Q, but two separate linguistic studies found that he was, after taking the mantle from South African computer programmer Paul Furber.) If Hoback really has the investigative chops to sniff out Satoshi’s true identity, too, it would put an end to a mystery as old as Bitcoin itself.  But past efforts by investigative journalists to find the true identity of Satoshi have failed.  In 2014, Newsweek journalist Leah McGrath Goodman published a story called “The Face Behind Bitcoin,” identifying a California-based Japanese-American man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the creator of Bitcoin. But Dorian Nakamoto denied that he’d ever heard of Bitcoin, and categorically denied being its creator. Goodman’s story was then thoroughly debunked by other journalists.  The following year, tech publication WIRED published a (now heavily-updated) article suggesting that Australian computer scientist Craig Wright could be the inventor of Bitcoin. After the article came out, Wright went on a media blitz, telling publications like the BBC, the Economist and GQ that he was Satoshi. But it didn’t take long for Wright’s story to begin unraveling – and it became clear that Wright, who has a history of questionable business dealings and behavior – was making the whole thing up, likely as a cover for his still-ongoing issues with the Australian Tax Office, as well as to make money (and a name for himself) by copyrighting the Bitcoin white paper.  Wright also went on a lawsuit spree, suing bitcoin developers and the family of a former collaborator in an effort to gain court-ordered access to Satoshi’s trove of untouched 1.1 million bitcoin (which he claimed to have lost access to by stomping on the hard drive that contained his private keys). He also sued – and threatened to sue – anyone who suggested that he was a fraud, including podcaster Peter McCormack and former public school teacher Magnus Granath (aka Hodlnaut).  But Wright was, in fact, a fraud, according to a U.K. court that definitively ruled earlier this year that Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto, and ordered Wright to publicly post admissions he was not the creator of Bitcoin on both his website and social media accounts. Wright has pledged (to his ever-dwindling number of supporters) to appeal the decision.  Wary of another public failure, the media has – until now – been reticent to publicly name another Satoshi candidate. And, in the meantime, the crypto industry itself has largely come to a consensus that the identity of Satoshi is better left a mystery. American crypto exchange Coinbase even cited the unmasking of Satoshi as a potential business risk in its S-1 prospectus filed ahead of going public.  But that doesn’t mean that the public’s curiosity over the true identity of Satoshi has abated. There have been convincing arguments made that any one of a number of early cypherpunks could be the creator of Bitcoin.  Some of the most commonly suggested Satoshi potentials are computer programmer Hal Finney (who died in 2014, and lived near Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto), Bit Gold creator Nick Szabo, Hash Cash developer Adam Back, and b-money creator Wei Dai. All of them have denied being Satoshi. Less common theories point to former programmer and criminal cartel boss Paul Le Roux (who is currently in prison) or the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Still others believe Satoshi was not an individual, but a group of coders working together.  Among Polymarket bettors, 46% have put their money on another candidate: computer programmer and cypherpunk Len Sassaman, who killed himself in 2011, shortly after Satoshi stopped posting on BTCTalk, an early forum for crypto discussions.  Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn posted on X that if Sassaman was indeed identified as Satoshi in the HBO documentary, it would be “neutral to positive” for BTC given that Sassaman has since died. (If Satoshi is still alive and has access to the 1.1 million BTC tied to him/her/them, if that stockpile were ever sold, that could in theory crater the asset's price.)  Like Finney, Szabo, Back and the others, there have been convincing arguments made that Sassaman could be Satoshi. A convincing argument, however, is not the same thing as proof. Though the new HBO documentary teases “never before seen clues,” the real smoking gun would be the movement of Satoshi’s coins – something that no claimant has been able to do.  If Satoshi is dead, or unwilling to go public – even to access the treasure trove of bitcoins worth roughly $68 billion at today’s value – that proof may never come.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/04/hbo-is-joining-search-for-bitcoins-satoshi-past-attempts-havent-turned-out-great,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dbaaf4ee09d542d601779598bea948f38611ee01-1184x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34311779,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646238,1728066628,XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst,"In a technical analysis shared with his followers on X, crypto analyst Bobby A (@Bobby_1111888) provides a bullish prediction for XRP despite the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to appeal the ruling in its case against Ripple Labs. Amid the regulatory turmoil, Bobby’s interpretation of the macro charts suggests a bullish outlook for XRP, contradicting the potential bearish sentiment stirred by the SEC’s latest legal maneuver. Bobby contrasts the immediate market reactions typically triggered by high-profile legal news with the actual long-term trends observed in asset prices. “Many forget that, even amid news of the SEC lawsuit in 2020, the asset appreciated from $0.11 to $1.95,” he points out. XRP Monthly Charts Still Look Bullish The analyst highlights that XRP has been trading for the past nearly seven years in a consistent sideways consolidation which he describes as a “macro base.” According to Bobby, this extended period of consolidation is crucial for understanding the potential for upward movement. Related Reading: Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF Registration Statement Unveiled, Price Falls 7% “The monthly timeframe shows that post the Bitcoin Halving, during every cyclical rotation of the momentum oscillators, the asset [XRP] experiences rapid price appreciation, which could initiate at any moment. This happened in 2017 and 2020,” Bobby further explains. An argument of Bobby’s analysis focuses on the monthly Bollinger Bands of the XRP/USD chart, an indicator used to measure market volatility and identify potential price targets based on previous market behavior. “Much like during 2016, the price is tightly wound around all essential higher timeframe moving averages, including the median line of the monthly Bollinger Bands,” the analyst writes. He adds, “While we are on the topic of the Bollinger Bands, they are the tightest they have ever been in the coin’s history,” he notes. This tightness suggests that XRP is at a pivotal point where any increase in volatility could lead to a substantial price movement. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Maintains $7.50 XRP Target Despite SEC Appeal Against Ripple Notably, Bobby’s take profit zone lies between the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $5.31 and 4.236 Fibonacci extension level at $13.72. Thus, Bobby’s expected return for this bull run is between a whopping 950% to 2,600%. Bobby theorizes that the initial movements when volatility returns might be deceptive, potentially designed to mislead market participants about the true direction of the price. He draws parallels to Bitcoin’s unexpected rally in March 2020, suggesting that XRP could experience a similar deceptive yet ultimately bullish breakout. “The XRPETH and XRPBTC charts do not look like this is the start of a long, drawn-out bear market but, instead, possible capitulation at deep value areas. Remember that the worst news comes at the bottom and the best news at the top,” Bobby added. The upcoming US presidential election could also play a critical role in shaping the regulatory landscape affecting cryptocurrencies like XRP. Bobby speculates about the possible outcomes: “Should Donald Trump be re-elected as president, I cannot see any situation where Gary Gensler remains chair of the SEC.” He argues that a change in the SEC’s leadership could relax the regulatory scrutiny over Ripple and, by extension, XRP, fostering a more favorable market environment. In his closing remarks, Bobby reiterates his strong conviction in the bullish thesis for XRP. “No one ever said this would be easy, and investing never is,” he reflects, encouraging his audience to adopt a strategic, long-term view of their investment in XRP. At press time, XRP price stood at $0.52.

42390251,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu3lP,1728065454,The Case for Congressional Focus on Decentralized AI,"As Congress conducts hearings with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and pushes to better regulate and stimulate the evolving digital economy, it must recognize the unique needs of decentralized AI – a critical yet often overlooked sector at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence.  Despite this crossover, decentralized AI cannot be legislated through a financial lens, nor can it be forced into AI regulations. Given its overlap in distinct sectors, however, there’s a real chance lawmakers will try to fold it into AI and crypto bills – or overlook it altogether – which would be a missed opportunity for innovation in this country.  Powerful framework  Simply put, decentralized AI allows for the distribution of data, computation, and decision-making processes across multiple devices or nodes, enabling them to work together without relying on a centralized authority, often utilizing open source software and models. This gives developers the tools to share their data collaboratively to build AI models, and to access compute from a diverse range of sources. It’s a powerful framework that empowers these developers to contribute to the AI ecosystem without the need to manage the entire process themselves, enabling researchers and startups to participate in a field where rising costs and difficulty of access threaten to push them out.  That’s why it’s imperative lawmakers not overlook decentralized AI as they begin to regulate AI. It’s probably human nature to ignore, considering the broader AI industry is exploding and dominated by some of the world’s biggest corporations. They’re acquiring startups, pushing advancements, and launching new products at a breakneck pace. While there’s nothing wrong with Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and others investing heavily in the industry, lawmakers need to create space for researchers, entrepreneurs, and developers to thrive as well; that entails among other things remaining vigilant on antitrust, and ensuring that government-backed R&D funds don’t benefit the giants alone.  And while Congress is making welcome progress to advance comprehensive legislation that would clarify the rules of the road for crypto, the bills are one-dimensional – financial in nature – and don’t address the obvious difference between an underlying digital asset of a protocol versus the decentralized AI applications running on the same protocol. Financial regulators shouldn’t end up overseeing decentralized AI just because projects issue tokens; that would be like the SEC regulating toothpaste because Johnson & Johnson issues common stock.  The next wave  It’s important we get this right, because decentralized AI is a critical field that can salvage the organizations that gave birth to the AI revolution – and possibly bring us the next wave. The universities that created the concept of machine learning and neural networks are under threat, as they cannot compete with Big Tech as it snaps up the world’s GPUs and top talent. In a similar vein, the kinds of startups that brought AI to market are facing similar constraints and oftentimes must defer projects. Without those engines of U.S. innovation working properly, progress will rest in the hands of a few large corporations. It’s a lesson that lawmakers will want to heed, as these universities and small businesses help form the fabric of the American economy, and create jobs and opportunities for constituents.  Decentralized AI can counter this trend of market concentration. The field allows organizations with limited funds to share data and compute across nodes, with developers stitching together a network of multiple databases to feed their models and dispersed GPUs to power them. It’s a more affordable solution that allows smaller players to participate and contribute. It also addresses many of the concerns about data privacy: developers can process data locally, which minimizes the need to transfer sensitive information to centralized servers. This reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.  Congress's turn  All this goes to show the importance of establishing rules and regulations that allow decentralized AI to flourish. Congress must establish clear regulations for data privacy and security to protect individuals’ information when processed locally, and promote transparency and accountability in AI algorithms that can protect ethical standards and prevent bias in decentralized systems.  Lawmakers should consider a unique regulatory framework for decentralized AI, separate from traditional AI regulations in the Algorithmic Accountability Act and from financial guidelines covered in the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. The new legislation would need to address the particular challenges of decentralized AI, ensuring transparency in algorithmic decisions, and providing guidelines on accountability in decentralized networks. Further, Congress should look at expanding funding opportunities under the National AI Initiative Act to ensure decentralized AI projects – especially those from universities and small businesses – receive government R&D funds and tax incentives, preventing Big Tech from monopolizing AI innovation. Along those lines, Congress would be wise to consider bolstering antitrust enforcement to stop major corporations from controlling critical AI infrastructure.  And the responsibility doesn’t rest solely on Congress’ shoulders. With lawmakers paying renewed attention to crypto and AI, now is the time for proponents of decentralized AI to speak up and advocate for the industry. And let’s face it, the industry hasn’t always done a stellar job of communicating what it does and what it needs to thrive. Yes, the technology is complex, but that doesn’t mean advocates can’t go beyond the technical language and articulate it in a way staffers and legislators without engineering degrees can understand. And most importantly, it’s critical to underscore the importance of getting this right, as a way to preserve innovation, jobs and opportunity; that’s the kind of language that resonates with members of Congress, and will advance this field to the next level.

Spot bitcoin ETFs, especially those with low fees and high liquidity, offer retail investors easy access to bitcoin's price movements. VanEck Bitcoin ETF is the top pick until March 2025 due to its waived fees, but post-March, BTC, IBIT, and FBTC become more attractive. Investors should monitor VanEck and Gemini's performance and be prepared for bitcoin's volatility, switching ETFs if necessary after fee waivers end. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been by far the most successful asset class since its inception in 2009. If I am ever tempted to sell part of my position, I like to look at charts like this one, comparing bitcoin's performance to that of the S&P 500 ( SPY ): Data by YCharts Fundamentally, my long-term case for bitcoin remains the unstable nature of modern monetary policy. The US dollar emerged from the post-WWII Bretton Woods agreement as the sole global reserve currency, and has retained its status more recently through the tenuous petrodollar system. This dependence on the dollar has artificially strengthened its value, leading to ever-expanding trade and budget deficits that cannot continue indefinitely (known as Triffin's Dilemma ). The modern fiat system has only been around for about 50 years (post the demise of the Gold Standard ), and the dollar has lost almost 90% of its value since then. It is reasonable to assume that as the world changes, so will its monetary policy, and that bitcoin will be a larger part of the future than it has been in the past. Whatever is bad for fiat systems, like deficits, inflation, and capital controls, is good for bitcoin. To go along with this kind of hedging characteristic, Bitcoin's ever-important hash rate has continued to climb steadily: Data by YCharts That is another chart I would like to buy into! Institutional adoption continues to increase, and I believe that we are still in the early innings of bitcoin's acceptance into more mainstream financial outlets. Buying Into Bitcoin Getting exposure to bitcoin's performance, however, has not always easy. Investors could buy bitcoin and store it themselves, which many think is the safest route, leaving you 100% in control. But this could lead to costly mistakes, like the famous man who mistakenly threw away a hard drive with about half a billion dollars worth of bitcoin on it (and who is still looking for it to this day). For the last decade, you could buy bitcoin on an exchange, such as Coinbase ( COIN ), and just leave it there, trusting Coinbase to take care of it for you. This was a decent option, but it required a separate account, had fairly high trading fees, and could not be held in a tax-advantaged retirement account. Soon, other products arose to make it easier to get exposure to bitcoin. For instance, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) tracked bitcoin futures, and Gracyscale's Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) held bitcoin directly and was structured as a closed end fund. These did not track very well with bitcoin's price, however, making them poor options. Then, on January 10th of this year, the SEC approved the first spot bitcoin ETFs. This was a momentous occasion, finally allowing millions of investors easy access to bitcoin's price movements, in brokerage accounts they already had. Expenses are now low and liquidity high, and there is no barrier to entry for new investors. The next step on the journey occurred on September 20th of this year, when the SEC approved options to be traded on Blackrock's ( BLK ) iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). Options trading on bitcoin is a massive step forward, opening up new strategies and ways to capitalize on bitcoin's large price swings. In light of this new approval, I decided to take a few minutes to analyze the current bitcoin ETFs. Current ETFs Since all bitcoin spot ETFs hold bitcoin and track bitcoin's price movements, they all offer virtually identical exposure: Data by YCharts So what differentiates them? The two biggest factors to consider are price and AUM. A lower expense ratio is always better, and more AUM means better liquidity and security. Among bitcoin ETFs, one further differentiator is the custodian. The ETF sponsor itself does not hold the actual bitcoins (with one exception noted below), but rather hires a custodian to keep the bitcoins safe. Of the 12 total current bitcoin spot ETFs, 9 of them use Coinbase as their custodian. There are only three exceptions. Fidelity holds their bitcoins for their Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ). VanEck uses Gemini for their VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ). The Hashdex Bitcoin ETF ( DEFI ) uses BitGo. Coinbase is the most trusted custodian in the space, so it is with good reason that they are trusted with so much bitcoin. However, they are a massive target, as anyone who was able to successfully hack them would have access to an unrivaled treasure hoard. This is very unlikely to occur, but there is something to be said about diversifying custodians. Fidelity should be credited for keeping their bitcoin in house, and they are definitely worth considering diversifying away from Coinbase. DEFI has less under $7m in AUM and a huge 0.9% expense ratio, so they are not worth considering. Gemini is perceived as less trustworthy than Coinbase, as they are well known for a massive data breach in 2022 and more recently for locking up customers' funds for almost two years in the fallout of the collapse of FTX. However, they have never lost customers' money and are still considered safe, if not quite as safe as Coinbase. The fact that HODL uses Gemini, then, is a bit of a wash, since it does diversify away from Coinbase, but is diversifying away from the safest custodian. For diversification, then, I see FBTC as worth holding, but exposure to Gemini alone is not worth holding HODL. Fees Among the ETFs that use Coinbase as their custodian, IBIT is by far the largest and most liquid, with over $22b in AUM and a trusted sponsor in BlackRock. They are also currently the only spot bitcoin ETF to have options approval from the SEC. They should eventually have the most liquid options. IBIT charges a 0.25% expense ratio, so that is the baseline. FBTC also charges 0.25%. GBTC is the second-largest spot bitcoin ETF, and it charges an extremely high 1.5% expense ratio. That kind of fee should be avoided. Grayscale does have a large amount of experience with digital assets, however, and are worth considering as a sponsor. They offer a cheaper version of GBTC named the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ) that only charges 0.15%. For exposure to Grayscale, then, BTC is the play, and it is cheaper than the larger IBIT and FBTC funds. Every other spot bitcoin ETF has an expense ratio above 0.15%. Hence, FBTC and IBIT are the top contenders, but if minimizing fees is the goal then BTC is best. The one exception is HODL, which actually does not charge any fees until 3/31/25 (or until they reach $1.5b in AUM, which seems unlikely as they have only half of that now). This is intriguing, as it represents essentially free money, which should never be ignored. So, is it worth hodling? HODL VanEck sponsors several well-known sector ETFs, such as the VanEck Gold Miners ETF ( GDX ), the VanEck Semiconductor ETF ( SMH ), and the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF ( MOAT ). They also have significant experience with digital assets, releasing the VanEck Vectors Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) in early 2021. DAPP and HODL are both terms that are common in the crypto world, making it seem like VanEck wishes to be perceived as an insider to the community. Indeed, reinforcing this sentiment is VanEck's commitment to donate 5% of their profits to Bitcoin developers. At $750m AUM, HODL is large enough to provide needed liquidity. More importantly, they are waiving the expense ratio on their fund through 3/31/25. Seeing as their exposure to bitcoin is identical to the other products, this advantage in fees makes HODL my top pick for spot bitcoin ETF until March of next year. This is as free as money gets. Until 3/31/25, HODL is a no-brainer. After 3/31/25, HODL's 0.20% expense ratio is not convincing enough to me, when compared with Grayscales BTC at 0.15%, or the larger players IBIT and FBTC's 0.25% with greater liquidity and option potential. Diversifying custodians away from Coinbase is one potential point in favor of HODL, but seeing as Coinbase has a better record than Gemini, I see this advantage as providing little value. Risks As with any bitcoin ETF, HODL is exposed to the price of bitcoin, which has experienced a 75%+ drawdown on four separate occasions since 2010. Investors should be prepared to stomach these “cypto winters” and have a plan to weather the next inevitable large drawdown. Since the waived fees are the primary investment case for HODL at this point, it is worth monitoring the position in case VanEck decides to change its mind or change the terms of its free offer. VanEck as the sponsor also has a duty to manage the fund properly and maintain the needed exposure to real bitcoin. Any issues at VanEck could affect the investment. Given VanEck's expertise in digital assets and experience running sector ETFs, I trust their decision to choose Gemini as the custodian for HODL. However, Gemini's reputation is not untarnished, and further issues at Gemini could also jeopardize the performance of HODL. So it is worth keeping an eye on Gemini's health as a custodian. All in all, I find it unlikely that anything serious will be uncovered at VanEck or Gemini before March. Investors looking to enter a long position in a bitcoin ETF may want to take advantage of the lack of fees on HODL until then, and consider switching to BTC, IBIT, or FBTC afterward.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4725062-hodl-best-current-spot-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34309664.jpeg

34309467,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646216,1728061223,Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash,"The PEPE price could be in trouble from here after failing to maintain its upward momentum. This has led to a restart of the bearish momentum, and this could continue if bulls fail to pull up the price. In the event that bears do win out in this situation and maintain control, the PEPE price could continue to fall. According to crypto analyst Alan Santana, such a development could drive the PEPE price back towards levels not seen since early 2024. PEPE At Risk Of Further Decline Crypto analyst Alan Santana took tot he TradingView website to warn investors of a possible decline that could be coming for the PEPE price. This is taken from the fact that the meme coin retraced from its gains from earlier in the week, and has started to flash some bearish signals. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally One of the first bearish signals the crypto analyst points out is the volume. According to him, the PEPE chart shows a rising bearish volume coupled with a break below the MA200. This comes with the correction that the meme coin has suffered, pushing it back below $0.000009. Santana explains that the price drop for the PEPE price so far has only happened at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This leaves the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, but not without risk. Apparently, there is the possibility that the PEPE price could still drop to reach this level. However, the crypto analyst believes that this will not disturb its long-term bullish structure. If this level breaks, though, then it could be very bad for the meme coin. As the crypto analyst explains, it would be “crazy” If this happens. Such a move could trigger a large crash, that could send it toward new monthly lows. Furthermore, this is coupled with the strong possibility of a bearish move. Targets For The Crash In the case of the PEPE price testing the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, and breaking below it, the crypto analyst sees a large crash coming for the price. There are two support levels outlined, depending on how strong the bulls hold up. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? On the first support, the crypto analyst expects it somewhere around $0.00007, which is more than a 25% crash from here. If this level doesn’t hold, then the analyst expects the PEPE price to move toward the next available support just above $0.000004. If the second scenario does play out, then the PEPE price could be looking at an over 50% price drop from its current level. However, if the price does hold up from here, then it could be moving above $0.00001 once again.

This recent dip has left analysts and investors on edge, awaiting confirmation of the next price direction. Just last week, sentiment was strongly bullish, but the current market atmosphere is filled with fear and uncertainty. One notable analyst, Carl Runefelt, has shared a chart highlighting the risk of Solana losing its key support level, which could lead to further downside. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The entire crypto market is grappling with high volatility, amplifying uncertainty. This has led to growing fear among investors, many concerned about the potential for deeper corrections. While Solana showed strong momentum recently, the present market conditions have dampened optimism, leaving traders anxious for a clear signal that could reignite confidence. As Solana continues to hover near this critical support level, the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether it can regain its bullish momentum or if further declines are on the horizon. Solana Testing Crucial Demand Levels Solana is at a critical juncture, as its price action has shifted from bullish to bearish in just a few days. Bulls are now proceeding with caution, especially below the $140 mark, which represents a key structural level. The $137 support level is crucial, as it could be Solana’s last defense against a further drop. Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the precarious situation Solana finds itself in. According to Runefelt, Solana could see a sharp drop to $128 if this support level breaks, extending the current consolidation phase. In addition to the risk of a breakdown, Runefelt also pointed to key resistance levels that bulls need to target if Solana is to regain its upward momentum. The most important levels to watch are the $150 and $160 supply zones. A break above these zones would be necessary to confirm a reversal into a bullish trend. Until then, the price action remains uncertain, and investors are closely monitoring these critical support and resistance levels. Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk Of Further Decline: Top Investor Sets $2,150 Target If Support Breaks The current market volatility and the threat of further declines are causing hesitation among traders. Solana’s ability to hold its support or break through resistance will determine its next move. SOL Technical Analysis: Prices To Watch Solana (SOL) is trading at $139 after a correction from local highs that haven’t been broken since July. The price faces significant resistance as it struggles to reclaim the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $139.9, a critical strength indicator. For bulls to regain momentum, holding above this level is essential. Additionally, the price must reclaim the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $144.3 to confirm a bullish reversal and signal a potential recovery. However, the market may see further downside pressure if Solana fails to surpass these crucial technical levels. A deeper correction could lower the price to $120, a key demand zone that could serve as a new level of support. This would extend the current consolidation phase and put more downward pressure on Solana’s price.

42390237,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu31F,1728053948,Spot Crypto ETFs Prompted Bitwise to Rethink Its Fund Lineup,"Bitwise is converting three of its futures-based exchange-traded products into a single fund.  The fund, called the Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF, will rotate between 100% exposure to crypto futures contracts and 100% exposure to U.S. Treasuries.  The conversion will take place on Dec. 3, the asset manager said.  Bitwise was one of the money managers who joined the spot bitcoin ETF revolution earlier this year, introducing a fund that now holds $2 billion of the cryptocurrency.  But that plus the subsequent introduction of exchange-traded funds for Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} diminished interest in three older Bitwise products that gave investors bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether exposure in a way now deemed less appealing. This prompted the company to merge that trio of funds, which held futures contracts tied to the cryptocurrencies, into a single product that takes a slightly different tack involving U.S. Treasures.  Bitwise announced the Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF (BITC) on Friday, a fund that combines the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optm Roll ETF (BITC), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and Bitwise Bitcoin and Eth Eq Wgh Str ETF (BTOP).  In a statement, Bitwise said that the launch of the spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs earlier this year has made futures-based crypto funds less compelling for investors looking for long-term capital appreciation.  With the new fund, the asset manager can better manage the volatility of the crypto market by rotating between 100% exposure to crypto futures contracts and 100% exposure to U.S. Treasuries based on market trends.  ""Bitwise is likely just catering to things they're hearing from clients and potential clients,"" said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""They have an actively managed division within Bitwise, so it makes sense to give it a try. We know there are investors looking to invest in bitcoin but who want to limit the volatility and particularly the downside volatility/drawdowns. I think that's what this will aim to do. Whether or not it will be successful is something we will learn in the coming years, but timing the market is extremely hard.""

34305773,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24260,1728052356,How can I Start a Bitcoin Fundraiser?,"Crypto-based crowdfunding has the potential to be a powerful force for directing capital to different causes as it allows people worldwide to raise and contribute funds without relying on centralised institutions. By leveraging decentralised P2P technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, such platforms enable individuals in underserved regions, to access global funding and support. This empowers creators, activists, and innovators to pursue their projects freely, promoting greater financial inclusion and autonomy. We look at three different crowdfunding tools below. What is Geyser Fund? Geyser Fund is a crowdfunding platform built on the Bitcoin Lightning Network, allowing creators worldwide to raise funds for projects directly from their global audience without the barriers of traditional financial systems. Launched in 2022, Geyser has quickly grown, supporting over 1,800 projects across 190 countries, and raising more than 34 bitcoins. The platform leverages the power of Bitcoin to enable direct peer-to-peer payments, ensuring that funds are transferred instantly to creators without the delays and restrictions seen in conventional crowdfunding platforms. One of Geyser’s most significant features is its censorship-resistant nature. Unlike traditional crowdfunding sites that are sometimes subject to governmental restrictions, financial regulations, and third-party controls, Geyser allows users to fund projects anonymously, bypassing many of the limitations imposed by centralised platforms. This is particularly powerful because it enables individuals from all over the world, including the unbanked and those in sanctioned regions, to participate in the global economy. Bitcoin’s decentralisation and censorship-resistant properties make it a natural fit for crowdfunding. Geyser’s reliance on the Lightning Network ensures that donations can be made quickly and at a low cost, with minimal friction. This is especially important in regions where access to traditional financial systems is limited or where creators may be unable to raise funds through traditional channels due to political or financial exclusion. By using Bitcoin, Geyser allows individuals to bypass these obstacles and receive funding directly, empowering creators globally. Geyser aims to expand its platform by integrating additional features such as Nostr profiles, subscription-based funding, and access to Bitcoin-backed lending and equity tools. These developments could further enhance Geyser’s role in democratising crowdfunding, offering creators even more ways to sustain and grow their projects without relying on centralised financial systems. As Geyser continues to evolve, it positions itself as a powerful tool for individuals and communities to access funding without the limitations and censorship inherent in traditional finance. What is BTCPay Server? The BTCPay Server Crowdfunding App is a powerful tool for creators looking to raise funds for various projects while receiving donations directly in Bitcoin or via the Lightning Network. Unlike some traditional crowdfunding platforms, BTCPay Server allows project creators to retain full control over their campaigns, ensuring that all funds raised go directly to their wallets without any third-party fees. This self-hosted approach offers a decentralised alternative for creators, making it ideal for projects that might otherwise face barriers or restrictions on traditional platforms. One of the key strengths of crowdfunding with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network lies in its ability to bypass traditional financial intermediaries. This ensures that projects can be funded by a global audience, regardless of their location or financial infrastructure. For individuals in regions with limited access to banking services or for those facing financial hurdles, Bitcoin provides a pathway to secure funding that is fast, efficient, and free from the constraints of centralised institutions. This decentralised structure aligns with the broader ethos of Bitcoin, promoting financial freedom and access for all. Censorship resistance is another significant advantage of Bitcoin-based crowdfunding. In traditional platforms, creators may face restrictions on the types of projects they can launch or limitations based on government regulations or platform policies. With BTCPay, these concerns are eliminated, as the platform empowers creators to fundraise without the risk of their campaigns being blocked or funds being frozen. This ensures that projects rooted in activism, controversial ideas, or underrepresented causes can find financial backing without external interference. By integrating Bitcoin and the Lightning Network into the crowdfunding space, BTCPay Server also enhances the speed and efficiency of transactions. Donations are processed instantly, allowing creators to access their funds in real-time without delays. This is especially beneficial for time-sensitive projects or for creators who need immediate access to resources to bring their ideas to life. Ultimately, BTCPay Server offers a transparent, secure, and censorship-resistant crowdfunding solution that maximises the potential of Bitcoin to empower creators and fund groundbreaking ideas across the globe. What is Kuno? The Kuno crowdfunding platform enables users to raise money for various causes using Monero, an anonymous and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency. Kuno allows individuals, charities, and projects to fundraise globally without the need for bank accounts or government IDs, ensuring complete financial privacy. Donations are sent directly to the recipient’s Monero wallet, bypassing intermediaries and eliminating the risk of funds being frozen. Kuno’s commitment to anonymity and decentralisation makes it an appealing alternative to traditional crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe and Kickstarter, particularly for those seeking privacy or facing financial censorship. Monero’s role in crowdfunding is particularly powerful as transactions are private by default, ensuring that both the donor and recipient can maintain their anonymity. This is especially crucial in regions with oppressive governments or strict financial regulations, where individuals and causes might otherwise be blocked from receiving funds. The peer-to-peer nature of Monero transactions also eliminates the risk of deplatforming, a common issue on traditional crowdfunding sites that are subject to regulatory or platform-based restrictions. Crowdfunding with Monero also highlights the potential of truly decentralised and borderless finance. Without the need for banks or centralised platforms, Kuno allows fundraisers to operate globally, giving individuals access to funds regardless of their location or financial standing. This can be particularly beneficial for communities in economically marginalised areas where access to traditional banking services may be limited. Furthermore, the absence of fees on the platform means that fundraisers can receive 100% of the donations, making it a highly efficient way to gather financial support. In a world where financial censorship and surveillance are becoming more prevalent, Monero-based crowdfunding through platforms like Kuno offers a unique alternative for individuals seeking financial freedom. The privacy and security provided by Monero ensure that fundraisers can operate without fear of interference, while donors can contribute to causes they believe in without sacrificing their anonymity. This combination of censorship resistance, privacy, and global accessibility underscores the power of Monero as a tool for decentralised crowdfunding and financial empowerment.

42390250,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu3b9,1728052294,Coinbase to Delist Unauthorized Stablecoins in EU by December,"Crypto exchange Coinbase plans to de-list any unauthorized stablecoins in the European Union by December 30.  Crypto companies are racing to comply with the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules, which require firms to be authorized in at least one EU country.  Tether said MiCA introduces some complexities for stablecoins operating in the region and will introduce ""a technology-based solution"" to counter those challenges.  Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) plans to de-list any unauthorized stablecoins in the European Union by December to comply with the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets rules (MiCA).  ""Given our commitment to compliance, we intend to restrict the provision of services to EEA [European Economic Area] users in connection with stablecoins that do not meet the MiCA requirements by December 30, 2024,"" Coinbase said in a statement shared with CoinDesk on Friday.  Coinbase, the second biggest exchange, after Bybit, according to CoinGecko data, has been racing alongside other companies to become compliant with the European Union's MiCA rules which require firms to be authorized in at least one EU country. Rules for stablecoins came into force on June 30, which require stablecoin issuers to have an e-money license in an EU member state to be able to operate in the bloc of 27 nations.  Not all stablecoins have managed to get the necessary licenses in the EU. In July Circle became the first global stablecoin issuer to secure an Electronic Money Institution license in the region and is the second-largest issuer of stablecoins. Tether, which is the largest issuer of stablecoins, doesn't have an e-money license in the EU.  Tether said that it commends EU for their efforts with creating MiCA but noted that it introduces some complexities for stablecoins operating in the region. ""Tether commends EU regulators for their efforts in establishing a structured framework, as it plays a key role in fostering growth within the sector. However, as we have consistently expressed, some aspects of MiCA make the operation of EU-licensed stablecoins more complex and potentially introduce new risks to both local banking infrastructure and stablecoins themselves,"" a spokesperson for the stablecoin issuer told CoinDesk in a statement.  ""To address these challenges to support users in the region, Tether is developing a technology-based solution, which we will unveil in due course and will be tailor made to serve the necessities of the European market,"" the spokesperson added.  Coinbase plans to share further details of its plan in November, and will provide options for affected European Economic areas customers to switch to stablecoins issued by appropriately authorized issuers, such as Circles' USDC and EURC, it said in the statement.  Bloomberg was first to report the news about Coinbase's move.

34304821,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646228,1728050449,RIP Altcoin Seasons? Crypto Analyst Debates Whether They’ll Ever Return,"In an analysis shared on X, crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) delves into the question that’s been looming over the crypto community in recents months: “Will we never have a proper altcoin season again?” As Bitcoin’s dominance (BTC.D) continues to surge and altcoins struggle to keep pace, Astronomer provides a data-driven perspective challenging the prevailing narratives that suggest the era of altcoin seasons may be over. Astronomer begins by acknowledging the difficulties faced by altcoin holders in the current market environment. “Alts are still at low prices and BTC.D is raging up, and yes, ETH (and altcoin) holders are having a tough time,” he notes. He observes a growing sentiment of disbelief among investors that Bitcoin dominance could decline again, casting doubt on the potential for another altcoin season. “You hear things like ‘BTC ETF changed everything,’ ‘Boomers will not buy altcoins which is why they won’t go up,’ ‘BTC is at ATH and alts have done nothing.’ Which are all things that are easy to say and grasp because they fit the current chart perfectly,” Astronomer explains. However, he cautions against accepting these narratives at face value. “They give you a sense of comfort and a reason to not hold any alts, which is typically rough during accumulation stages, especially if the BTC chart ‘looks’ a lot better,” he adds. Related Reading: Crypto Market’s “Shallow Sell-Off” Indicative Of Strong Bid For Risk Assets: Trading Firm To provide clarity, Astronomer offers his own definition of an altcoin season: “A true altcoin season is one where liquidity from the most dominant asset (BTC) flows to the other assets (ETH and altcoins). As a consequence, BTC.D drops and nearly all altcoins go up.” The Case For An Impending Altcoin Season Astronomer lays out a series of facts to support his argument that an altcoin season is still on the horizon: #1 Historical Precedence “First fact: we had the big altcoin season every single cycle (4-year rotation) like clockwork,” he asserts. This pattern is not only evident in historical charts but also in the collective memory of those active during previous cycles. Astronomer cautions against adopting a “this time is different” mindset, which inherently positions investors at a disadvantage. “History rhymes/repeats,” he reminds readers. #2 Bitcoin Dominance Chart Aligns With 4-Year Cycle “The BTC.D chart is on track with its 4-year cycle,” Astronomer notes. He previously predicted that a top in Bitcoin dominance would occur around months 34 to 38 of the cycle. “We are now month 33 in the 4-year cycle, which means the tides are about to shift in just a few months,” he points out. Believing that Bitcoin dominance will continue to rise unchecked is essentially betting against established cyclical patterns, according to the analyst. #3 The Grand Crypto Rotation “The ‘first Grand Altcoin rotation’ generally happens once per cycle: around Q4 in year 3 of the cycle and is again playing out like clockwork so far,” Astronomer states. He explains that in previous cycles, certain altcoins (a minority) perform strongly early on, driven by specific narratives, while the majority experience significant gains later, fueled by liquidity flowing from Bitcoin. He cites the 2018–2022 cycle as a prime example. “In this cycle, in the first 3 years, LINK is a great example as it was one of the strongest top 100 altcoins and has put in a 100x, while ETH (and all the other BTC liquidity-driven altcoins) have put in a measly 3x,” he explains. In the last year of that cycle, the dynamics shifted: “ETH has put in a 10x, and LINK has only gained another 3x or so.” Related Reading: Crypto Guru Warns: Only 6 Years Left To ‘Make As Much Money As Possible’ #4 Overrated Impact Of Bitcoin ETF Addressing the notion that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF has fundamentally altered market dynamics, Astronomer is skeptical. “The BTC ETF narrative to cancel alt season is way overrated,” he argues. He points out that since their launch, ETF total flows have accumulated up to $40 billion, while Bitcoin’s centralized exchange (CEX) volumes average $20 billion daily. “ETF flows are negligible, which is why you never heard me talk about them as I like to filter noise,” he asserts. #5 Favorable Monetary Policy Looms Astronomer also highlights macroeconomic factors that could benefit altcoins. “Interest rates are on the decline, the US money supply is increasing drastically (where now also China is following suit). The only thing we are waiting for is QE, which is typically a natural consequence of M2 increasing (with a delay),” he explains. Historically, such monetary conditions have been conducive to altcoin appreciation. “The monetary policy shifting in our favor typically also means altcoins do well,” he notes. #6 Bitcoin’s All-Time High Is An Arbitrary Indicator He challenges the idea that Bitcoin reaching an all-time high (ATH) without a concurrent altcoin season signals a permanent decoupling. “BTC being at ATH is an arbitrary gauge to when alt season begins and the fact that it reached ATH but altcoin season hasn’t begun yet is, in my opinion, not valid to call it canceled,” Astronomer argues. He emphasizes that time and cyclical patterns are more significant factors than price milestones. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $61,129.

""Given our commitment to compliance, we intend to restrict the provision of services to EEA users in connection with stablecoins that do not meet the MiCA requirements by December 30, 2024,"" the firm said. The move could be a potential blow to tokens like Tether Holdings Ltd.’s USDT, the report added. Europe has established tailored regulations for the crypto space, referred to as the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules. Under so-called MiCa rules, crypto exchanges in the European Union may be compelled to remove stablecoins issued by firms like Tether that do not possess the required licenses. Robinhood ( HOOD ) was also reportedly weighing a launch of its own stablecoin, a move that may position the company to take some market share from Tether's USDT ( USDT-USD ), which represents over two-thirds of the stablecoin universe.

The chances for a 50 basis point rate cut in November all but vanished.  Already down on the week, the price of bitcoin is holding up following the data, with one analyst suggesting the risk of a sharp economic downturn has been removed from the market.  The employment picture in the U.S. heated up in September, with the government reporting the addition of 254,000 jobs last month, flying past economist estimates for just 140,000. In addition, August's previously reported 142,000 job gain was revised higher to 159,000.  The unemployment rate slid to 4.1% from 4.2% in August and versus forecasts for 4.2%.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} was changing hands at $61,500 in volatile action shortly following the release of the report, up nearly 1.5% over the past 24 hours.

On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 4.0% versus estimates for 3.8% and August's 3.9%.  Recent economic data – including yesterday's ISM Services report and Wednesday's ADP jobs data, both of which came in far stronger than expected – along with comments earlier this week from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have led traders to pare back expectations for a second consecutive Fed 50 basis point rate cut at the bank's next policy meeting just after the November elections.  Prior to this morning's numbers, short-term rate markets had priced only a 30% chance of a 50 basis point move and a 70% chance of just a 25 basis point cut, according to CME FedWatch. In the minutes after the data, those 50 basis point odds had tumbled to just 11%.  Looking at traditional markets following the strong report, U.S. stock index futures have added to gains, with the Nasdaq 100 now higher by 0.8%. The U.S. 10-year yield has shot higher by eight basis points to 3.94% and the dollar index has jumped by a sizable 0.5%.

34302594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646217,1728045022,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Crash Might Not Be Over, Why $60,365 Is Important","Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has suggested that the Bitcoin crash might not be over despite the relief rally to $61,000. The analyst highlighted the $60,365 price level as being important to avoid a potential crash to as low as $57,000. Bitcoin Needs To Hold Above This Price Level To Avoid Crash Martinez stated in an X post that $60,365 is a key price level to watch for Bitcoin. He claimed a break below this could cause the flagship crypto to fall to $57,420. However, if it holds above this level, the analyst remarked that a rebound to $63,300 is on the table. Therefore, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on the crucial support at $60,000. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? In another analysis, Martinez suggested that Bitcoin was likely to suffer more downward pressure in the short term rather than a rebound. He revealed that since May, every correction of the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio from its 90-day average has led to a significant Bitcoin correction. In line with this, the analyst noted that the latest rejection has already triggered a 10% drop, suggesting that Bitcoin could suffer more price decline. Analyst Justin Bennett also believes that Bitcoin will likely drop lower and predicts that it could fall to as low as $57,000. He added that a relief to take out the $63,200 short positions would be nice. Meanwhile, he alluded to the US Job report, which is set to be released on October 4. The analyst expects significant volatility amid this inflation data. A weak job report could lead to a Bitcoin crash, similar to what happened in August, with the flagship crypto dropping to $54,000. The inflation data is also significant as it would provide insights into whether the market can expect further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also looks to be bearish on Bitcoin at the moment. He highlighted a ‘Three Blind Mice’ pattern that was forming on the BTC chart, indicating that the crypto is set to witness a bearish reversal following its uptrend in October. Why A Price Crash Could Be Good The on-chain analytics platform Santiment suggested that a Bitcoin price crash might be much needed for the flagship crypto to go higher. The platform noted that the crowd has considerably cooled off its excitement toward crypto since BTC retraced over 9% from its local high of $66,400 recorded on September 27. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally Santiment claimed that this is encouraging, considering that markets typically move in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectation. As such, the Bitcoin price could enjoy a surprise rally, seeing as market participants are more bearish on its trajectory. Ali Martinez noted that Bitcoin was currently in the complacency stage and just needed to cool off before it began its next rally.

42390253,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu40n,1728043301,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Bounces From $60K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,8691.17 +1.14% Bitcoin (BTC): $61,425.69 +0.92% Ether (ETH): $2,381.70 +0.9% S&P 500: 5,699.94 -0.17% Gold: $2,659.14 +0.13% Nikkei 225: 38,635.62 +0.22%  Top Stories  Bitcoin's slow start to its historically most bullish month continued late Thursday with a brief dip below $60,000 only to show signs of a rally ahead of the weekend. The cryptocurrency traded at around $61,300 during the European morning, an increase of just under 1% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market has risen by about 1.15%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. BTC is down around 6% since the start of October and bitcoin ETFs have registered net outflows on all three days of the month so far. This is despite its reputation as being BTC's most bullish month, with average gains of 22% since 2013.  Despite October's reputation for being a fertile month for BTC surges, data shows that most gains don't arrive until the second half of the month. The second and third days of October have ended in green just six times since 2013 before recovering in the second week, and large movements are generally in the third week, CoinGlass data show. Price jumps of as high as 16% generally appear after Oct. 15. However, this year bitcoin bulls must also consider the macroeconomic factors weighing on risk assets. Escalating tensions in the Middle East have seen investor sentiment shift toward oil and gold.  Geopolitical tension and the upcoming U.S. presidential election will likely underpin the 'debasement trade,' and this favors both bitcoin and gold, JPMorgan said in a research report on Wednesday. ""A Trump win in particular, apart from being supportive of bitcoin from a regulatory point of view, would likely reinforce the 'debasement trade' both via tariffs (geopolitical tensions) and via an expansionary fiscal policy ('debt debasement'),"" analysts wrote. If the ""Trump trade"" plays out in a similar way to 2016, there should be higher U.S. Treasury yields, a stronger dollar, U.S. stock market outperformance, in particular banks, and tighter credit spreads, JPMorgan said. This shift has not happened yet, with only a small move higher seen in these markets.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows monthly changes in bitcoin's yen-denominated prices.  The long tails attached to the previous two candles suggest seller exhaustion near the previous record high of 7.79 million JPY reached in November 2021.  The rebound from the previous peak suggests renewed bullish price action ahead.

42390254,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu4B3,1728041228,"Attention Bitcoin Bulls, China Stimulus May Have Lost Its Mojo","China's latest stimulus appears sanguine compared to the 2015 cycle, according to BCA Research.  The housing market bust limits China's ability to generate bullish ""credit impulses.""  The credit impulse is in a structural downtrend, since peaking at 25% in 2008.  China has recently unveiled a raft of stimulus measures, the biggest since 2008, torching a rally in Chinese stocks and risk assets worldwide, including bitcoin. Most crypto analysts expect the Chinese stimulus and the Fed rate cuts to power bitcoin {{BTC}} to $100,000 in the coming months.  However, BCA Research argues the risk-on rally may not have legs as China's latest stimulus falls short of generating significant bullish ""credit impulses"" as it did in the past two decades, including in 2015.  Credit impulse refers to the flow of new credit issued through loans and other debt instruments as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Since the 2008 crash, analysts have closely tracked China's credit impulse as a leading indicator of economic growth and risk-on rally worldwide. Renewed upswings in the indicator have historically coincided with bitcoin bear market bottoms.  The credit impulse peaked at 15.5 trillion yuan during the last major bullish easing cycle dated 2015, equating to 15% of the GDP. Back then, the Chinese stocks, represented by the CSI 300, more than doubled in six months and BTC found a bottom near $100, turning higher for a two-year bull run that peaked near $20,000 in December 2017.  Since then, China's economy has doubled in terms of nominal GDP, which means the credit impulse during the current cycle needs to peak at 27 trillion yuan to have a similar bullish impact on the economy and markets.  However, the most recent peak in the credit impulse was less than 5 trillion yuan. So, to match the 2015 episode, the latest measures would ""need an amplitude five times greater than the most recent peak,"" BCA Research said in a note to clients on Oct. 2.  Reversing the downtrend in the credit impulse might be easier said than done because factors that drove it higher initially, such as the housing market boom, are no longer present.  ""Through 2000-2020, when China's housing boom was in full swing, it was possible to channel the exponential credit curve into the housing and construction boom, But now, absent an alternative destination for the productive use of credit of the same magnitude, it will be difficult to generate those same monster credit impulses,"" BCA's analysts said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/04/attention-bitcoin-bulls-china-stimulus-may-have-lost-its-mojo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01c008ad513db058009640c4d349cf07971ed8da-4667x2625.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XRP Has Witnessed A Sharp Drop Over The Last 24 Hours The cryptocurrency sector has been observing bearish winds recently, with the drawdown deepening across the market during the past day. Most of the top coins, though, have managed to limit their losses, except for XRP, which has notably underperformed. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crossover That Led To 90% & 180% Rallies Could Soon Form Again The below chart shows how the coin’s recent trajectory has looked like. Following the 14% drop in the last 24 hours, XRP has come down to the $0.52 level. This plunge has also put the asset more than 21% down compared to the $0.66 top that it had seen a few days back. As for why the cryptocurrency has performed this poorly during the past day, perhaps on-chain data can provide some hints. Whales Have Been Active On The Network Recently According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, several large transactions have been spotted on the XRP network in the last 24 hours. All of these transactions happen to be of a scale that’s generally associated with the whales, who are large entities that can carry a degree of influence in the market. Naturally, one whale can’t move the market on their own, but some number of them together can, which may be exactly what has happened today. Generally, it can be hard to say for certain what the whales’ intentions are when they make moves, but address details can sometimes carry a hint or two. Here are the details of the first of the whale transfers from the past day: As is visible above, the whale moved 17,940,000 XRP, worth around $10.3 million at the time the transfer was executed, from an unknown wallet to an address connected to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. An “unknown wallet” is one that’s not affiliated to any known centralized platform and is likely to be an investor’s personal address. Thus, it would appear that the whale moved coins from their self-custodial wallet to an exchange with this transaction. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads Whale Frenzy: Large SHIB Transfers See Massive 360% Spike Transfers of this type are called exchange inflows. Since one of the main reasons why investors deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, large exchange inflows can lead to a bearish outcome. The three other XRP whale transactions from the past day were also of the same type, with whales shifting a combined $37.9 million to different platforms. It’s possible that these transfers weren’t for selling at all, but for using a different service that exchanges typically provide. Given the corresponding price trend, though, it’s indeed likely that these moves provided a net selling pressure to the cryptocurrency.

The token is leading the market after becoming the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Related Reading: Bonk ‘In Prime Position For Turbo Green Week’ As Price Recovers Key Level Aptos To Expand Its Presence In Asia On Thursday, Aptos Labs, the developer of the Aptos network, announced it had agreed to acquire the Japanese Blockchain developer HashPallete, the company behind Japan’s Palette Chain and a subsidiary of HashPort Inc. The agreement aims to become a “game changer for Japan and the Aptos ecosystem” as the integration with the Japanese blockchain is set to strengthen its presence in the Asian market: Japan has long been a hub of technological innovation, and it’s no different when it comes to blockchain. The country’s unique blend of advanced tech and widespread blockchain adoption makes it a model for Web3 initiatives globally. Today, we’re making one of our boldest strategic moves into this market with our agreement to acquire HashPalette Inc. As part of the acquisition, HashPort Inc. will migrate the Pallete Chain and its subsidiary’s applications to the Aptos Network. The Japanese chain will also have access to the Aptos ecosystem’s security, scalability, and developer tools. The migration is expected to be completed by early 2025, in time for the EXPO2025 DIGITAL WALLET. Moreover, Aptos Labs partnered with HashPort to support local developers, NFT creators, and enterprises by “continuing to build blockchain solutions (…) using Aptos Network’s infrastructure.” APT Leads The Crypto Market Following the announcement, APT’s price saw a daily 11% surge, jumping to the $8.66 resistance level before retracing to the $8.51 mark. This performance crowned the token as the leading crypto amid the market retrace. APT is among the few cryptocurrencies recording green numbers in most timeframes among the top 100 tokens by market cap. The altcoin registers a 7.5% and a 41% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Additionally, its daily market volume soared 41.7%, reaching a $769.6 million trading volume in the last 24 hours. The token’s performance was highlighted by several crypto analysts, who considered that APT has the “most interesting chart” at the moment. According to Yuriy from BikoTrading, the cryptocurrency looks strong as the rising trading volume and the price performance “signs for continued growth.” The trader noted that APT’s price held above the key resistance zone amid the market retrace, which sent the token above Q3’s range highs. Similarly, crypto trader Osbrah stated that APT has been “secretly climbing its way to the most interesting alts charts.” He pointed out that, after October 1’s market sweep, the token had a “clean bullish retest” above the $8 mark. To the trader, the next big resistance is at the $9 mark, which could send APT’s price to the $7.95 support zone if it fails to reclaim it. Meanwhile, another market watcher suggested that the altcoin’s performance could be close to a breakout. Related Reading: Analysts Unfazed By Bitcoin (BTC) Drop, But Should We Fear October 5? Per the post, SUI and APT moved in a “catch-up trade” path for the past year, moving closely together until SUI decoupled in early 2024. This led to a 44-day lagging period for APT before it followed SUI’s movements. After that, APT rose 98% to its yearly high of $18.8 in mid-March. Now, APT has seen a 32-day lagging period after SUI decoupled again in September, showing “incredible amounts of strength.” Based on this, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could follow SUI’s trajectory and kickstart a massive rally in the next two weeks if history repeats.

The U.S.-listed bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {ETH}} spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are doing their part in contributing to the downward price pressures of crypto this week, with bitcoin down 6% and ether down 10%.  Investors drained $54.2 million from bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 3, the third consecutive day of net outflows, taking the three-day tally to $361.2 million, according to Farside Investors.  The main contributions on Thursday were Ark's ARKB, at $58.0 million, and Fidelity's FBTC, at $37.2 million. BlackRock's IBIT saw an inflow of $36.0 million. Grayscale's GBTC remains relatively muted, with just $5.9 million in outflows this week.  That said, the 11 ETFs have amassed a total of $18.5 billion in investor money since inception. Besides, investors are up on average on their investment around 3-10% with an average deposit cost basis between $54,911 and $59,120, according to Glassnode data.  The methodology used by Glassnode uses price stamping of bitcoin deposits to ETFs for the top three ETF issuers, which provides a rough break-even point for ETF investors. The data suggests, investors in Fidelity's FBTC has a cost basis of $54,911, Grayscale at $55,943, and BlackRock $59,120.  In 2024, these cost basis have provided excellent price support for bitcoin, testing the lower bound multiple times during bull market corrections.  At the same time, ether ETFs experienced a net outflow of $3.2 million Thursday. Outflows came from Grayscale's ETHE of $14.7 million, which has now seen a total of $2.9 billion in withdrawals. BlackRock ETHA saw a $12.1 million inflow. Ether ETFs now have a total outflow of $555.4 million, according to Farside Investors data.

Bettors on Polymarket are putting their money behind Len Sassaman being who the doc names.  A new HBO documentary from Emmy-nominated Cullen Hoback, director of Q: Into the Storm, which unveiled who was behind the QAnon Conspiracy Theory that dominated 4chan during the 2016 election, promises to name who Satoshi is.  Polymarket bettors think that Len Sassaman will be the person the documentary names.  Sassaman, who took is own life in 2011 after a battle with depression, is thought to be Satoshi because of his long history of published academic works regarding cryptography which often showed his strong ideological commitment to privacy and decentralization.  Read more: HBO Is Joining Search for Bitcoin's Satoshi. Past Attempts Haven’t Turned Out Great.  Adding to the speculation that Sassaman is Satoshi is the date of their respective disappearances. Sassaman took his life shortly after Satoshi stopped posting on BTCTalk, once the go-to destination for crypto discussions.  This isn't the first attempt to unmask the pseudonymous creator of the world's largest digital asset. In 2014, Newsweek claimed to have found Satoshi by scouring a database of naturalized U.S. citizens.  The publication tracked down Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, who uses the preferred name Dorian S. Nakamoto.  Nakamoto lives in California and is a naturalized U.S. citizen of Japanese ancestry who matches most of the criteria of a potential Satoshi: a background in math as well as engineering, a reclusive nature, and an initial refusal to discuss the topic.  ""I am no longer involved in that, and I cannot discuss it,"" is how Nakamoto answered the Newsweek's reporter's initial questions, which garnered suspicion, followed by ""It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now.""  Eventually, through lawyers, Nakamoto provided a flat denial that he was Satoshi.  ""I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report,"" his counsel wrote.  Bettors are also giving thought to the big reveal possibly being someone else who's not known in the crypto industry, putting a 32% chance on it being someone else or multiple people.  But another contract on the prediction market site is giving an 89% chance to Satoshi's identity not being definitely proven in 2024.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/04/polymarket-bettors-say-hbo-documentary-will-name-len-sassaman-as-satoshi-nakamoto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dbaaf4ee09d542d601779598bea948f38611ee01-1184x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Geopolitical tension and the upcoming U.S. presidential election will likely underpin the 'debasement trade,' and this favors both bitcoin {{BTC}} and gold, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  ""A Trump win in particular, apart from being supportive of bitcoin from a regulatory point of view, would likely reinforce the 'debasement trade' both via tariffs (geopolitical tensions) and via an expansionary fiscal policy ('debt debasement'),"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Markets aren't pricing in a victory for the former president just yet. The chances of a Trump election win are currently priced in with a low probability looking at other asset classes other than gold and bitcoin, the report said, adding that this is because investors have been preoccupied with the recession trade in recent months.  If the ""Trump trade"" plays out in a similar way to 2016, there should be higher U.S. Treasury yields, a stronger dollar, U.S. stock market outperformance, in particular banks, and tighter credit spreads, JPMorgan said. This shift has not happened yet, with only a small move higher seen in these markets.  JPMorgan noted that in the six month window around the 2016 American election, 5-year Treasury yields rose 1%, the Dollar Index (DXY) surged 8%, U.S. equities outperformed to the tune of 6%, banks beat the rest of of S&P 500 stock index by 15% and high grade corporate credit spreads tightened significantly.

According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, the NVT Golden Cross—a key metric used to determine market valuation relative to transaction volume—has reached a major level. Related Reading: Is This Bitcoin’s Last Big Drop? Expert Points To Key Indicator Local Top Spotted, What Next? The CryptoQuant analyst revealed that Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross has recently reached the 2.9 level, suggesting that the market cap, or price, of Bitcoin, may be outpacing its transaction volume. Particularly, Darkfost explained that a value above 2.2 indicates the possibility of reversing the mean, suggesting that the current valuation could be overextended. On the other hand, a value below -1.6 would indicate that the market is potentially undervalued. For context, the NVT Golden Cross compares the market cap of Bitcoin to the volume of transactions on its network, providing a measure of whether Bitcoin is being traded at a fair value. The signals become stronger when the metric moves deeper into its upper or lower zones. At a current value of 2.9, the indication is that Bitcoin may face short-term price resistance, possibly pointing to a local top at around $65,800, Darkforst revealed. The analyst adds that such levels can gauge potential long and short positions, especially when viewed alongside global chart trends and broader market behaviour. Bitcoin On The Verge Of Major Correction? While the NVT Golden Cross presents a perspective of potential market overvaluation, another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoOnchain, offers additional insights by analyzing Bitcoin’s movement between exchanges. The recent data shows a significant outflow of Bitcoin from centralized exchanges. This trend of Bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges is seen across all three key moving averages: 30-day, 50-day, and 100-day. The analyst revealed that such an outflow hasn’t been observed at this scale since November 2022. Notably, a decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges can be interpreted in multiple ways. Firstly, it often suggests that investors move their assets to more secure storage, such as cold wallets, to hold rather than trade. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Reversal? Here’s What This Key Indicator Suggests This behavior can signal confidence in the asset, as holders may expect its value to increase over time. With fewer BTC available on exchanges for immediate sale, the potential for downward price pressure may decrease, which could set the stage for a bullish momentum in the longer term. However, it can also indicate that traders prepare to exit their positions, anticipating a correction if they foresee market instability or overvaluation.

Bitcoin Miner Exchange Inflow Has Been Declining Recently As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, miners have gradually been reducing their exchange inflows recently. “Exchange inflows” here naturally refer to transactions heading to wallets attached to centralized exchanges from self-custodial addresses. In the context of the current topic, the exchange inflows made by miner-related wallets specifically are of interest. Generally, the main reason why miners transfer to these platforms is for selling, so large exchange inflows from them can be a sign that these chain validators are participating in a selloff. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crossover That Led To 90% & 180% Rallies Could Soon Form Again Miners have constant running costs in the form of electricity bills, so selling from them is a regular occurrence, as without it, they can’t keep their operations going. This regular selling is usually of a scale readily absorbed by the market, so there may be no visible negative effect on the asset’s price. Large and sustained exchange inflows, though, can be something to note, as they may imply unusual selling pressure from this group. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin miner exchange inflows over the history of the cryptocurrency: As the above graph shows, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin miner exchange inflows had plunged to pretty low in the first few months of the year but then underwent a sharp reversal. The reason for this increase could be that the fourth Halving occurred in April. Halvings are periodic events about every four years that permanently cut the BTC block subsidy in half. In the chart, the analyst has also attached the data for the coin issuance on the network (colored in blue). From this metric, the effect of the Halving is apparent, as miners can suddenly only mint about half as many coins after each of these events as before them. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads Whale Frenzy: Large SHIB Transfers See Massive 360% Spike Miners make their income through two main sources, the transaction fees and the block subsidy, but most of the contribution generally comes from the latter. Thus, the miners depend on the block subsidy to make their income. After the latest Halving, the miners naturally came under immense pressure because their revenue took a drastic hit. The exchange inflow trend would suggest that these chain validators had decided to sell off their reserves in response to this income squeeze. The high inflows from the Bitcoin miners had continued for a while, but the 30-day MA of their exchange inflow has recently reversed, a potential sign that this cohort is finally pulling back on their selling. If this starts a sustained trend, then the cryptocurrency’s price might benefit from it. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced much of its recent recovery during the last few days, as its price is now down to $60,300.

42390249,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu3qX,1728024935,"Bitcoin Set for Unusually Busy Weekend After Friday's Payrolls Data, Volatility Kink Indicates","BTC's options expiring on Oct 5 trade at higher implied volatility (IV) compared to Oct. 25 options.  The so-called IV kink points to a unusually volatile weekend.  Traders seem to bracing for price turbulence post Friday's NFP and potential retaliatory strikes by Israel.  The bitcoin {{BTC}} bull run since October last year has seen mostly quiet weekends, but that's about to change, according to a key metric.  At press time, bitcoin's ""implied volatility term structure"" indicates bigger price swings on Saturday (Oct. 5) than on days leading up to Oct. 25, according to Deribit options data tracked by Arbelos Markets.  The term structure is a graphical representation of options-determined implied or expected volatilities (IV) at different expiration dates. It is usually upward sloping, with longer duration options trading pricer in terms of implied volatility relative to short duration ones.  However, as of writing, the curve exhibited a kink, with options expiring on Oct. 5 trading at an annualized IV of 51.44%, notably higher than options expiring on Oct. 6, Oct. 11, Oct. 18, and Oct. 25.  In other words, traders are pricing more significant price swings for Saturday, possibly anticipating increased volatility following Friday's nonfarm payrolls (NFP) release and amid geopolitical tensions, according to Joshua Lim, co-founder of Arbelos Markets.  ""There's a very noticeable kink in the vol curve – Friday (Oct. 4) is trading around 39 vol and Saturday (Oct. 5) is trading 51 vol. The market is pricing in a risk premium from nonfarm payrolls data, but more importantly, some probability of an Israeli retaliation post-Rosh Hashanah,"" Lim told CoinDesk.  Focus on payrolls  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the NFP on Friday at 12:30 UTC. Per FXStreet, the data is expected to show that the economy added 140,000 jobs in September, following August's weaker-than-expected increase of 142,000. The jobless rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.2%, with the year-on-year growth rate of average hourly earnings matching August's pace of 3.8%.  According to ING, risks are skewed in favor of hawkish repricing of 25 basis points Fed rate cuts in November and December and dollar strength unless the data misses expectations big margin.  The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) last month, torching a rally in risk assets, including BTC. Currently, markets expect at least another 50 bps cut by the year-end.  ""The pricing for year-end Fed funds continues to largely embed a 50 bps cut in either November or December, meaning room for further re-alignment with the Fed’s less dovish rhetoric and consequently upside risks for the dollar. We sense that the bar for a dollar-negative reaction to U.S. data today and tomorrow is probably higher after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent pushback against 50 bps reductions,"" ING said in a note to clients.  A stronger dollar often weighs over risk assets, including BTC and traditional safe havens like gold.  Volatile middle east situation  On Oct 1, Iran fired at least 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, ratcheting up tensions and risk of a full-blown war and leading to a broad-based risk aversion. BTC dropped over 4% on the same, eventually testing the $60,000 support.  Per ING, investors are now on high alert, awaiting Israel's retaliation against Iran, leading to a rally in crude prices and a stronger dollar index.  A potential action over the weekend, when traditional markets are closed, could see both traditional and crypto traders express their views in the digital assets market, leading to an unusually volatile weekend.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/04/bitcoin-set-for-unusually-volatile-weekend-after-fridays-payrolls-data-volatility-kink-indicates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0dce666c7f0cdbec909106973ab71d0b0cb6444-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407483,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZI8BX,1728023708,"Bitcoin’s Poor Start to Bullish October Continues, but There May Be Cheer Ahead for Bulls","Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 briefly, leading to $144 million in bullish position liquidations, despite historical data suggesting October as its strongest month with gains averaging 22% since 2013.  Social sentiment on platforms like X reflects bearish views on Bitcoin's price recovery.  Rising oil prices due to Middle East tensions shift investor focus towards commodities like oil and gold, impacting risk asset sentiment, including Bitcoin. Polymarket bettors show mixed feelings on Bitcoin's price direction but lean towards a range-bound movement for October.  Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} poor start to its historically most bullish month since 2013 continued as the asset briefly slid under $60,000 late Thursday, before recovering, causing over $144 million in bullish crypto bets liquidated.  BTC traded just over $61,300 to remain flat over the past 24 hours despite a volatile U.S. trading session. Ether {{ETH}}, BNB Chain’s BNB and XRP {{XRP}} showed losses up to 2%, while memecoin dogecoin {{DOGE}} was up 2% on no immediate catalyst.  The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, which measures the largest tokens by market capitalization, was down 1%.  Bitcoin is down over 6% since the start of October, data shows, a month that has only twice ended in the red since 2013 - chalking gains of as high as 60% and an average of 22% to make it the most best for investor returns. That has dented social sentiment on X, with some users being bearish about price recovery.  Polymarket bettors have mixed opinions on where BTC’s price will move in October. While they have ruled out an attempt at $70,000, bettors are more confident that bitcoin will be range bound between $57.5K and $65K.  However, CoinGlass data shows that most gains appear in the latter part of the month, while the first week is generally bearish - meaning current price action still remains in line with historical movements.  The second and third days of October have ended in green just six times since 2013, before recovering in the second week and large movements generally in the third week. Price jumps of as high as 16% generally appear after October 15.  That’s just the data, though. Fundamental and macroeconomic factors ultimately weigh on trading sentiment for risk assets, such as bitcoin – and tensions in the Middle East have shifted investor interest to oil and gold.  Global benchmark Brent oil had its most significant one-day jump in almost a year and is on track for an 8% weekly gain since early 2023.  Looking at macroeconomics for a moment, markets were shook earlier this month by geopolitical tension in the middle east. Bettors on Polymarket are giving a 63% chance that Israel will strike Iranian oil facilities in October, but only a 35% chance that they will hit Iran’s nuclear facilities.  The U.S. presidential election is looking as close as ever on Polymarket, with the two candidates either briefly tying the race or fighting over a 1 percentage point lead.  Donald Trump-themed TREMP, a Solana meme coin named after the Republican candidate, is up 14%, while the original MAGA Trump token is flat, according to CoinGecko data. The Kamala Harris-themed KAMA token is down 7.5%.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/04/bitcoins-poor-start-to-bullish-october-continues-but-there-may-be-cheer-ahead-for-bulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c58fc7f56689a9fb13c417b5b99c732750052c6-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34293831,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646166,1728023413,"Bitcoin Price Dip Explained: Key Causes And Where To Expect A Bounce Back To $70,000","Bitcoin (BTC) recently appeared poised for significant upside momentum and has experienced a notable price correction. Following a two-month high of $66,500 last Friday, the cryptocurrency retraced approximately 6% in the past week to around $60,000 by Thursday. Key Buy Zones For Bitcoin The anticipated bullish trend for Bitcoin was initially fueled by easing economic conditions, particularly following the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates on September 18. However, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have shifted investor sentiment, prompting many to seek refuge in traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Additionally, concerns regarding the macroeconomic landscape have intensified, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the possibility of further rate cuts of 0.50% in the months ahead. This confluence of factors has led to a broader market sell-off, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and the top cryptocurrencies on the market experiencing substantial liquidity outflows estimated at nearly $300 million, as reflected in the total crypto market capitalization. Despite the recent decline, crypto analyst VirtualBacon provided a more optimistic outlook on social media, noting that Bitcoin has returned to the “Bull Market Support Band.” The analyst highlights that this support band has historically provided a cushion during corrections between the current market prices and the $62,500 mark on the weekly timeframe. VirtualBacon emphasized that a weekly close above $58,000 could indicate a healthy correction, setting the stage for a resurgence. Conversely, a break below this threshold would necessitate reevaluating bullish strategies. The analyst pointed to two key buy zones: $62,500 and a lower range between $58,800 and $60,000. These zones coincide with previous highs and align with the 200-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a significant long-term support level for any bull market. The 200-Day EMA, currently around the $60,000 mark, has been pivotal over the past six months. It has acted as support and resistance during various phases of Bitcoin’s price movements in March, May and July of this year. September Jobs Report Looms Large In his analysis, VirtualBacon explained that if Bitcoin bounces back from $60,000, it would signal strength in the market. However, a daily close below $58,000 – or a weekly close below that level – could signal a potential bearish trend reversal. VirtualBacon outlined a strategy for capitalizing on the current dip, indicating a willingness to accumulate BTC in the $58,000 to $60,000 range, which he views as a high-risk, high-reward zone. Nonetheless, he cautioned that a close below $57,000 would be a significant red flag. Related Reading: Dogecoin On-Chain Spike Triggers 180% Price Rally Prediction—What’s Next? For the analyst, as long as Bitcoin holds above $58,000, there is potential for a higher low, setting the stage for a new price peak above $66,000. However, macroeconomic factors will remain crucial in shaping market sentiment. This week’s release of the September jobs report will be particularly significant, as it will provide insights into the current unemployment rate, which could influence future Bitcoin price movements, according to the analyst: 4.2%: Very bullish for the market. 4.3%: Neutral outlook. 4.4%: Caution advised. 4.5% and above: Bearish implications. At the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Jerome Powell identified 4.4% as a critical threshold. Should the unemployment rate rise above this level, VirtualBacon believes it could signal trouble for the broader economic landscape.

42407469,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZI7Xr,1728021600,Crypto Payments Firm BCB Group Was the Subject of an FCA Investigation: Sources,"BCB Group was the subject of a now-closed investigation by the FCA, according to sources.  The company's chief compliance officer recently resigned from the business and will join crypto exchange Kraken in November.  BCB Group, a payments processor that links cryptocurrency firms to the banking system, was the subject of a now-closed investigation by the U.K. financial services regulator, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, gave BCB a so-called s166 notice late last year, the people said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter is private. The investigation has since been concluded in a way a source close to BCB deemed positive for the company. BCB is in constructive talks with the regulator about expanding its licence, a third person added.  ""BCB Group has at all times operated a compliance first approach in its business activities and continues to do so,"" said Oliver Tonkin, CEO of BCB, in emailed comments. ""We have regular open and transparent dialogue with all our regulators across our licenced businesses and from our perspective we are in good standing with them all. Our engagement with the FCA continues to be positive and we have recently been given the green light to expand our regulatory footprint in the UK should we wish to do so,"" he added.  The FCA declined to comment.  Payments companies like BCB are important intermediaries in the digital assets ecosystem, moreso following the collapse of a number of crypto-friendly banks in the U.S. last year. They provide banking rails to some of the biggest institutions in the digital-asset sector, including exchanges such as Bitstamp, Crypto.com, Gemini and Kraken.  It's not clear what sort of inquiry BCB faced. A s166 review can be triggered by the FCA for a number of reasons. There may be concerns about a company's regulatory requirements, and whether it is complying with specific rules. The regulator could be worried about potential misconduct issues. The supervisory body may also have concerns about a firm's risk management processes and its financial stability. If the FCA suspects market abuse or misconduct, it can also launch an investigation.  BCB is not a unique case, as the FCA issues about 50 of these notices to companies in the U.K. every year.  Natasha Powell, the former chief compliance officer at BCB, recently resigned from the business, as reported by CoinDesk. She will be joining crypto exchange Kraken as head of U.K. compliance in November.  Powell will still retain links with BCB, and will continue to support the group as a non-executive director of BCB Payments Ltd., its U.K.-regulated payments business.

34291618,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646141,1728018015,Ethereum Solo Staking Made Easier? Vitalik Buterin Supports Lower Entry Requirements,"Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin advocates reducing the ETH solo staking requirement to lower the entry barrier and promote greater network decentralization. Buterin Sees 32 ETH Requirement As A Barrier Responding to Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano on X regarding solo staking, Buterin expressed concern that the current 32 ETH requirement presents a bigger obstacle than bandwidth limitations. Related Reading: Vitalik Buterin Proposes A Privacy Fix for Ethereum For those unfamiliar, solo staking on Ethereum requires an individual validator to stake at least 32 ETH – approximately $75,200 at the current market price of $2,352. Solo staking allows crypto investors to earn passive income while directly contributing to the security of the Ethereum network. Buterin views this high entry threshold as a barrier that prevents smaller ETH holders from participating. He suggested temporarily increasing bandwidth requirements to reduce the minimum staking deposit to 16 or 24 ETH. Buterin elaborated: It’s net-good for both staking accessibility and scale. Then once we figure out peerdas, bandwidth reqs go back down, and once we figure out orbit SSF, the deposit minimum can drop to 1 ETH. It’s important to note that ETH holders can still stake with as little as 1 ETH by using third-party staking services, centralized platforms, or staking pools. However, these options don’t offer the same level of control over one’s ETH as solo staking, where the node operator retains full custody of their holdings. During the Ethereum Singapore 2024 event in September, Buterin emphasized the significance of solo stakers in bolstering Ethereum’s security and decentralization to tackle potential 51% attacks. At the event, Buterin said that even a small increase in the proportion of solo stakers on the Ethereum network could work as an “extra layer of defense” for both security and privacy. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Continue To Thrive While the 32 ETH barrier may discourage small-scale ETH enthusiasts from solo staking, they can still benefit from the growing popularity of Ethereum layer-2 solutions, which have made transactions more affordable. For instance, in June 2024, layer-2 scaling platform Optimism announced the launch of open-source and permissionless fault proofs, enabling users to verify off-chain transactions’ validity securely. Similarly, in August 2024, asset manager Franklin Templeton approved another layer-2 solution when it launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on the Arbitrum network. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record Similarly, crypto exchange Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 rollup Base has witnessed rapid adoption as its total value locked (TVL) currently stands at slightly over $2.12 billion, according to data from DeFiLlama. As layer-2 solutions continue to succeed, their positive impact may extend to the Ethereum network. Crypto analysts, such as CryptoBullet, predict that ETH could rally in Q4 2024. ETH is trading at $2,352 at press time, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

While it could appear that the sharp dump of the better part of this week is discouraging participation, some traders are accumulating at around spot rates. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price IntoTheBlock data on October 3 shows that 1.89 million Ethereum addresses bought 52 million ETH at around the $2,311 and $2,383 range. That a large amount of buyers choose to buy, on average, at $2,350 means this is a support level that traders should closely watch. Considering the number of ETH accumulated, sellers would need to exert more effort to break below this level, forcing the coin towards $2,100 and August lows. Comparing traders’ action and the September range, the $2,350 level falls at around 61.8% and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels. What’s Next For ETH? Technically, crypto prices, including ETH, tend to find support around this Fibonacci retracement zone. Accordingly, how prices react between the $2,100 and $2,350 zone will likely shape the medium to long-term trend. Related Reading: What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number A refreshing bounce around this emerging support and Fibonacci retracement zone would be a massive boost. In this case, ETH could rally, even above $2,800, as bulls target $3,500. Conversely, any sharp dump below August and September lows may easily trigger panic selling. Out of this, ETH can slump below $2,100 and $2,000 and may fall to as low as $1,800, confirming losses of early August. Considering the state of price action, sellers have the upper hand. Over the past few trading sessions, centralized exchanges have had massive outflows. Earlier today, The Data Nerd revealed that Wintermute, a crypto market maker, moved 14,221 ETH to Binance, indicating that they might sell. In August, Wintermute and other leading market makers, including Jump Capital, sold over 130,000 ETH, forcing prices lower.

He explained that these addresses represent significant support, and if the price remains below $0.11, holders might become increasingly inclined to sell their assets to mitigate potential losses. This selling pressure could accelerate DOGE’s downward trend. 60,210 addresses bought 36.40 billion $DOGE at $0.11! #Dogecoin must reclaim this level soon to sustain a bullish outlook.

The decline has continued into the past 24 hours, with the asset shedding 4.2% of its value, currently trading at around $0.1019. This price drop has directly impacted DOGE’s market capitalization, falling from over $17 billion last Thursday to around $14.9 billion today. Alongside this, the 24-hour trading volume for DOGE has also seen a noticeable decrease, from $1.4 billion last Thursday to just above $1 billion.

34286491,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646195,1728005415,Binance Market Dominance Plunges: A Deep Dive Into The 36% Share Drop,"According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is facing significant challenges as its market share continues to decline. In September, Binance’s share of trading volume in the roughly $2 trillion digital asset market fell to 36.6%, down sharply from 42.7% at the start of the year and the lowest level in four years, according to data from CCData. Binance Spot And Derivatives Trading Hits Four-Year Lows The drop in market share is particularly pronounced in both the spot and derivatives trading arenas. Binance’s 27% share of the spot market represents its lowest level since January 2021, while its derivatives trading share stands at 40.7%, also the lowest in four years. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Maintains $7.50 XRP Target Despite SEC Appeal Against Ripple Per the report, this decline can be attributed to the legal saga that the exchange has been experiencing globally since last year, but particularly in the US, which has not only had a notable impact on the exchange’s financial metrics, but has also led to changes in its leadership. The company has been under increased scrutiny globally, following a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) last year over serious charges, including sanctions violations, which resulted in a hefty $4 billion fine. The fallout from these regulatory actions included the resignation of co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who served four months in prison as part of the proceedings. However, the former CEO was released by US authorities last Friday after serving his sentence. In an effort to rebuild trust and navigate the regulatory landscape, Binance appointed Richard Teng, a former regulator, as its new CEO. Teng has been actively engaged with regulators investigating Binance in various jurisdictions, while also appointing a new board of directors and the intentions of establishing a new headquarter. Centralized Crypto Exchanges Face 17% Volume Drop The report further highlights that the broader market for centralized crypto exchanges is also facing challenges, with combined spot and derivatives trading volumes dropping 17% in September. However, this decline is typical for the month, which is often seasonally weak, but it has resulted in the lowest monthly trading activity since June. Notably, Binance has seen the most severe market-share decline among top exchanges, as competitors such as Bybit, Bitget, and Crypto.com have begun to capture a larger share of the market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally Jacob Joseph, a senior research analyst at CCData, noted that this trend may indicate a growing confidence among crypto participants in alternative platforms that “offer similar user experiences,” including low trading fees, minimal slippage, and high market liquidity. Despite the challenges, Binance recently achieved a significant milestone, becoming the first centralized crypto exchange to surpass $100 trillion in lifetime trading volume, according to CCData. At the time of writing, the exchange’s native token, BNB, currently the fourth largest cryptocurrency on the market, is trading at $545, up just 1% in the last 24 hours amid the broader market decline.

Many expected the bullish trend to continue, but Ethereum has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Concerns are mounting as some market observers predict a deeper decline, possibly falling to yearly lows around $2,150 if the current support level fails to hold. This has reignited fear and uncertainty across the market as Ethereum’s price sends mixed signals. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The recent decline has shaken confidence, and market participants anxiously await a clear direction. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s next move and whether it can reclaim support levels to resume an upward trajectory. The coming days are expected to be crucial for Ethereum’s price action, with investors bracing for heightened volatility in response to these shifting market conditions. Ethereum Testing Crucial Support Line Ethereum is now trading at a critical juncture that could define its direction in the coming week. Price action over the next few days is expected to be pivotal for Ethereum and the entire altcoin market. Analysts closely monitor whether ETH can maintain its strength as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Failing to hold above key support levels could signal a broader market decline. Analysts and investors eagerly await an Ethereum recovery as it hovers above a crucial support line that could be the launchpad for a rally to new highs. One top analyst, Carl Runefelt, recently shared his insights on X, highlighting the current trendline supporting ETH price. In his technical analysis, Runefelt warns that the price could drop significantly if Ethereum fails to hold this trendline. If the price breaches this support, he identifies $2,150 as the next potential target. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum A fall to these levels would likely shake out many investors expecting a bullish continuation in the weeks ahead. If ETH loses this key support, it may lead to uncertainty and heightened volatility. This fall would keep market participants on edge while waiting for the next move. ETH Price Action Details Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,350 after failing to establish a higher high above $2,820. This recent price action has disappointed bulls, as ETH has lost crucial support levels, including the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,542 and the simple moving average (MA) at $2,466. These indicators are key in determining short-term trends, and their loss as support has raised concerns about further downside risk. For the bulls to regain momentum, ETH must break above the 4-hour 200 EMA and the 4-hour MA and successfully hold these levels as support. Reclaiming these indicators would signal renewed strength and pave the way for another attempt to increase prices. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Risk Of 30% Drop – On-Chain Metrics Confirm A Slow Demand However, a deeper correction is likely if Ethereum fails to recover these levels. Key support around $2,100 becomes the next target, with the potential for even lower prices.
