Therefore, to diversify your hedging strategy for uncertain times, Bitcoin futures through Valkyrie's BTF becomes an option. Also, Bitcoin got some support as it was not a catalyst for bank runs. Starting with a comparison with different asset classes is useful to put things into perspective. On the caution side, you have to get used to volatility when putting money to work into digital currency, and do note that most of the upside may be behind us. In times of uncertainty when the stock market is volatile, it is important to hedge, especially if you are not all into cash. Now, the rhetoric most commonly heard is to invest in gold, but, going against the trend, the aim of this thesis is to assess whether it is not Bitcoin (BTC-USD) that you should opt for. For this purpose, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BTF ) provides exposure to Bitcoin futures as I will detail later, but, a look at the price action shows that it has produced above 60% upside since the beginning of 2023. BTF's Key Metrics (www.seekingalpha.com) This double-digit price performance exceeding the 50% mark may seem something of an anachronism during current market conditions where volatility reigns, while at the same time, a comparison with other asset classes including gold helps to put things into perspective. Bitcoin beating all, including Gold The chart below shows that Bitcoin has beaten all the other asset classes whether it is bonds, gold, the Nasdaq Composite, as well as the S&P 500. Data by YCharts Looking closer, while Bitcoin started to outperform the S&P 500 earlier, it was only at the beginning of March that the degree of outperformance widened, which coincided with the start of the banking turmoil. It even outperformed the Nasdaq Composite index, skewed towards mega-cap tech growth stocks by about 40% as shown above. Thus, the digital currency which, by the way, is the product of blockchain technology and was more correlated with tech back in 2022 now outperforms the technology sector by a hefty margin. The reason for Bitcoin's strength could be that with the banking turmoil, some investors have started to see crypto as the perfect asset class, not correlated to others, even U.S. government bonds. Noteworthily, it is these bonds, especially the long-dated treasuries which are considered risk-free but are to be partly blamed for banks' woes as they suffered from devaluation caused by rising interest rates. Now, since the troubled regional banks held a lot of these, the value of their assets fell, in turn creating liquidity problems, and, tellingly, few had predicted that interest rate risks would cause cracks to appear in the liquidity front through U.S. treasuries. Consequently, Bitcoin was not a cause of the bank runs. Along with bank troubles, the high debt-to-GDP ratio has come into focus as a result of the need to raise the debt ceiling, causing some to have doubts about the financial system itself, which brings us to crypto's original role which was precisely to revolutionize the financial system. Thus, some investors found solace in the digital currency, as in parallel gold failed to rise parabolically as had been predicted by some since 2021. On the contrary, it was the digital currency that prevailed delivering gains of above 232% over a five-year period, despite being much more volatile as pictured below. Data by YCharts Noteworthily, gold still underperformed the digital currency despite a major loss of confidence from November last year with the advent of the FTX collapse , which was a crypto exchange platform headed by Sam Bankman-Fried. This prompted many investors to sell as Bitcoin's price took a monumental hit and touched the $15.4K level , not seen since May 2020 and the market cap plunged to about $305 billion. Thus, crypto is not without risks. Volatility Risks Here, some will remember the systemic risks or risks pertaining to the crypto ecosystem as a whole with the demise of Genesis , and others triggered by the implosion of FTX which caused the cryptocurrency loan and brokerage company to suspend lenders' ability to withdraw their cryptocurrencies. Consequently, there could also be a domino effect impacting stakeholders as companies involved in crypto-related transactions face a more challenging regulatory environment as the FTX crash and the banking turmoil gave the Security and Exchange Commission the perfect excuse to pounce, resulting in market makers like Jane Street and Jump planning to shift their activities offshore to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. In addition, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance (BNB-USD), the crypto exchange, for offering certain derivatives products. In addition to regulatory actions, liquidity conditions have also deteriorated especially for smaller exchanges in the wake of the banking turmoil, especially with the demise of Silvergate Capital ( SICP ) and the closure of its SEN (Silvergate Exchange Network) and others which enable the exchange of dollars for Bitcoin. The Case for Investing in BTF Despite all these pains, more people have been attracted to BTF as shown by the chart below which spans from November to May, a period that includes the FTX episode plus its contagion effects and banks' problems. During this time, the Bitcoin ETF has been highly volatile and, at times, even underperformed the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ( GLD) , but ultimately it got the upper hand, by delivering gains of 31.6% (blue chart below) for those who were brave enough to hold on to it. Comparison of price performances: BTF and GLD (seekingalpha.com) Now, this is all based on historical performances and no one knows exactly what the future will look like, but the facts certainly call for a rethink in hedging strategy. This does not mean that investors have to get rid of gold which has proven itself as a valuable store of value throughout the centuries but more to diversify into Bitcoin, which, it must be mentioned, also got some support from the Fed's actions during the banking crisis. In this respect, the tools put into place by the U.S. central bank to alleviate monetary conditions show that even if the Fed holds rates at current levels, it will inject liquidity into the system to avoid further cracks. Moreover, there are various ways to get exposure to crypto, including buying miners' stocks or the companies which use blockchain technology to produce Bitcoins. For this purpose, there is Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) with a lower expense ratio of 0.75% . However, the problem is that it is more volatile, as seen by the variation between its year-to-date and one-year price performances. Moreover, its assets under management are less than $10 million, with about $807K traded in average daily volume. This may lead to poor liquidity and wider spreads (difference between the bid and ask price) especially in case the market is highly volatile, and you have to exit your position rapidly. Comparing BTF and WGMI (seekingalpha.com) Others may own shares of companies that are in Bitcoin trading or crypto exchanges, but these are not immune from further regulatory risks, as I mentioned earlier. Pursuing further, there are Bitcoin futures, just like oil futures contracts, which allow traders to place bets on future prices without actually owning barrels of crude. For this purpose, Valkyrie's BTF holds CME Bitcoin futures for May 2023 as shown below, and comes with an expense ratio of 0.95%. BTF Holdings (valkyrie-funds.com) Assessing the risks of owning BTF, Bitcoin futures just like those for any type of commodity is closely regulated by the CFTC, and as such does not entail the same type of liquidity risks that impacted exchanges where investors' dollars have to be converted to Bitcoins and vice versa. Instead, the ETF's stock fluctuations depend on the price of the commodity itself, in this case, Bitcoin. Hedging For Uncertainty Looking at the price action, both GLD and BTF were up on Friday, May 19 as the tussle between Democrats and Republicans continue over the extension of the debt limit, while both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down as pictured below. The Price Action (www.seekingalpha.com) Here, in addition to the risks of a United States default fueling the appetite for hedging, a high debt-to-GDP ratio entails paying more as interest payments and is therefore inflationary by nature, and supports both Bitcoin and Gold. However, with both sides of the aisle showing a willingness to come up with a consensus, the price action has evolved in favor of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday, May 22. However, with the June 1 deadline looming and bearing in mind that the negotiations normally last till the last minute, there can be further uncertainty favoring both gold and Bitcoin. As for a price target, BTF could climb to the $11.3 (10.4 x 1.084) level based on its one-year decline of 8.4% and current share price of $10.4. I support my bullish stance by the RSI of 45 which does not indicate an overbought condition. Moreover, this is a moderate target given that most of the upside which occurred during the banking turmoil may be behind us, but, with the possibility of a Fed pause in June or the second half of this year, monetary conditions should ease further. This is good for equities in general, including Bitcoin miners and traders, implying more demand for the digital currency. In conclusion, through a comparison with other asset classes including gold, this thesis has shown that despite all its pains, Bitcoin has delivered better gains, something which cannot be ignored during these highly uncertain times even if you are no crypto enthusiast. Ending with some words of caution, do bear in mind that I have NOT talked about Bitcoin achieving a safe haven status and replacing gold, as it is a relatively recent development that still has to withstand the test of time.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4606596-btf-etf-bitcoin-challenging-gold-as-hedge?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12857841.jpeg

In a new video, a Bitcoin indicator designed for finding precise market turning points is used to turn $5 into $34,000. The results are a shocking 88% success rate and more than 679,000% ROI. Let’s take a closer look. About The Bitcoin Indicator Used: Fisher Transform The Fisher TransformFisher Transform was created by John Elhers and first mentioned in the November 2002 Issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities Magazine. The tool attempts to make sense of unpredictable price movements by using statistics. The indicator takes price data and transforms it into a Gaussian normal distribution. All this means is that the tool tries to make the price data look like a more organized pattern that can be easier to understand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally In addition to using the tool’s turning points for buy and sell signals, passing through the zero line is also a sign that a trend is strengthening. While the tool is highly effective, combining its signals with Japanese candlesticks, chart patterns, and Elliott Wave Principle can improve results. The monthly Fisher Transform | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Turning $5 Of Bitcoin Into $34,000 In the video, the monthly Fisher Transform is used to generate buy and sell signals when the trigger line crosses above the fisher line from below or above, respectively. The tool makes several bad trades. It notably loses some money it has earned on the way up at the second Bitcoin top in 2021. Despite a couple slip ups, the Fisher Transform turns $5 into $34,000 in the end. Over $30,000 is added during the best trade. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin May Have Completed The “Perfect” Pullback This translates to roughly a 679,000% ROI over the lifetime of BTCUSD price history. The shocking return is a reminder for investors and traders to find a technical system that works and then let it do its thing.

The 23-day moving average is a strong trading system for Bitcoin. We evaluate the Halving and determine that it does provide a pattern that beats buy-and-hold for the asset. Expect volatility for Bitcoin to continue into 2024. We share a roadmap for avoiding the potential drawdown and managing risk. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is still the world's most popular cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $550 billion dollars. Since its inception in 2009, it has gone through several significant events that have shaped its price and value. It is fair to say that Institutional investors have been increasingly interested in Bitcoin in recent years and have expressed their views publicly. Whatever your views, I intend to build on my previous work and address the following question: how can I develop a sustainable momentum trading strategy for Bitcoin that beats buy-and-hold? Following my last piece that covered how using a 23-day moving average strategy can beat the returns of buy-and-hold investors for Bitcoin, I had several requests to extend the analysis. One of the most important of these events is the halving, which occurs approximately every four years. In this article, we'll explain what the halving is and why it's important for investors to consider. An eagle-eyed reader suggested that we should be bullish because we are approximately one year away from the halving, and so I sought to do a bit of research and test that strategy. We're going to focus on understanding what it is, why it is relevant, and then test to see whether we can improve on the 23-day moving average strategy by taking into account the halving. Bitcoin Halving - April 2024 According to Binance , ""the halving is a pre-programmed event that occurs in the Bitcoin network every 210,000 blocks, which is roughly every four years. It's called the halving because it cuts in half the rate at which new Bitcoins are produced. Specifically, the reward for Bitcoin miners who successfully add a new block to the blockchain was reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC in May 2020."" When the next halving happens in Bitcoin in April 2024, the mining rate will decrease from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. The halving is a significant event because it reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. This reduction in supply is expected to increase the price of Bitcoin over time, assuming demand remains constant or increases. The halving is important for several reasons. First, it reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are produced, which helps to control inflation and introduces scarcity of supply. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and the halving ensures that this supply is released into circulation at a steady and predictable rate. By reducing the supply of new coins, the halving can help to increase the scarcity and value of Bitcoin over time. Second, the halving is an important event for Bitcoin miners. Bitcoin mining is a process where powerful computers compete to solve complex mathematical problems and add new blocks to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins for their efforts, and the halving reduces this reward by half. This means that miners will need to work twice as hard to earn the same amount of Bitcoins as before the halving. The Halving & The Impact on BTC-USD Price The key to answering this question lies in taking a good hard look at the nominal and logarithmic returns of Bitcoin since inception. Look at this chart: (David Huston) There is a lot to take in here. This is the log-10 return of Bitcoin between 2010-2023 YTD. Logarithmic scales help us to fit the price onto one clear chart. Imagine this as the helicopter version of price that allows you to take in the long-term trend since 2009. The orange line is the 23-day moving average. The previous Halvings are marked on the chart in 2012, 2016 and 2020. I have also taken the liberty of adding what I call 'Midterms.' This is the point halfway between Halvings, and it is relevant for reasons you will see shortly. Following the Halvings Bitcoin has historically experienced significant price increases in the months and years that follow. For example, the first halving in 2012 was followed by a price increase from $12 to highs of $1,038 over the next 18-24 months. The second Halving in 2016 was followed by a price increase from $650 to $19,221 over the next 18 months. While past performance is not a guarantee of future results, the Halving is a significant event that has historically impacted the price of Bitcoin. The returns on the chart above under-play the scale of the moves, which is considerable. It turns out that the opposite to the original theory is true: Bitcoin falls or trades sideways from half-way between Halvings until the Halving date. The lack of supply and perhaps emotional response from buyers, then propels the asset higher, until halfway towards the next Halving. 23-Day Moving Average System with Halving Feature Remember, our system from the previous article rests on the ability to trade the 23-day moving average. The system uses the following rules: Sell when BTC-USD crosses below its 23-day moving average of its price. Buy when BTC-USD crosses above its 23-day moving average of its price. This has proven to be an effective strategy for reducing drawdowns and improving risk-adjusted returns against buy-and-hold for Bitcoin. How does it perform? Have a look at the following chart: David Huston The moving average strategy absolutely trounces buy-and-hold. Between 2010 and 2023 YTD you'd end up with a $64,341,549.24 return versus $28,392.40 for BTC-USD as of the weekend that this was written. Already, this system significantly improves the return versus the standard asset being held since 2009. What if we added a rule that was long only for the 18 months following the Halving , to try to capture more of the upside? Here is what that looks like: David Huston That doesn't appear to add much to risk-adjusted returns. If you look at the grey line, it's significantly underperforming the 23-day moving average system, which is represented by the orange line. What about if we try another strategy: let's say that we sell BTC-USD and hold cash for the year or so leading up to the Halving and see if we can avoid part of the downside: David Huston That works better than trying to be long only after the Halving. The system - represented by the grey line - performs better than buy and hold but worse than the 23-day moving average system. However, it still fails to outperform. Weekend Effect Not everybody can trade on weekends, and so somebody asked me what if Bitcoin makes a major move during the weekend, and you're not able to act on the 23-day moving average until the markets open on the following Monday? If you were using the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ) or the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) to trade this strategy, then that would certainly be the case. The back-tests suggest that you can capture 85% of the returns of this strategy even if you account for weekends and 'realistic trading fills' which shave off performance. Current Situation Since this was written, Bitcoin has dropped below the 23-day moving average and those who shorted BTC-USD or entered a Bitcoin short ETF have profited off of the move. Take a look at the chart below: Stock Charts Bitcoin dropped below the 23-DMA on April 19th and again on April 30th. The short trade on the 19th of April would have been exited pretty much flat (no profit). The most recent trade - which is short from the 30th of April - is currently up 8.1%. It pays to be methodical, and patient. If you look at this and think to yourself, ""Well I'll jump straight in and short Bitcoin"", you'd be mistaken. Wait until the next signal, which is when Bitcoin goes back to the 23-day moving average. The only exception to that would be occasions like the 3rd of May when it bounced off of the average and remained lower - one can add to their trade there. If this seems too simplistic, one has to imagine, what's the catch? The catch is you need the patience and discipline to follow a system regardless of the outcome, and the psychology behind that is difficult to develop. Conclusions and Final Analysis The nature of investing is such that we try to be clever and outsmart other investors, but this can lead to following theories that don't work. In this case the simple - yet powerful - 23-day moving average for Bitcoin, it is difficult to beat. If you look closely at the daily returns for Bitcoin, they represent a very clear momentum-based pattern. That means that when Bitcoin is going up, it tends to keep going up for extended periods of time. And when it is going down, although it has peaks and troughs, it tends to carry on in that trajectory for extended periods. A moving average strategy allows you to capture those trends and ride the majority of them, while ensuring that you have the discipline to cut your losses when the trend changes. We may have an opinion that the Halving has a strong impact on price, and therefore, one should stay Long Bitcoin. However, our analysis suggests that it is hard to find a strategy that beats a more dyed-in-the-wool Momentum trading strategy like the 23-day moving average. Investors should consider being long Bitcoin after the next Halving in April 2024, and somewhat cautious between now and the next year, as we would expect Bitcoin to be volatile in the run-up to the next Halving date.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4606594-bitcoins-wild-ride-a-look-at-price-volatility-and-two-key-factors-you-need-to-know?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12857554.jpeg

42410681,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgAf4,1684796106,"Core Scientific Hopes to Emerge from Bankruptcy by September, Lawyers Say","Core Scientific should “trim” its restructuring timeline by “at least [one] month,” the federal judge overseeing its bankruptcy said during a Monday hearing as creditors called for the insolvent crypto miner to fast-track its plans to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Core Scientific’s counsel said the miner could reach a reorganization plan by Sept. 25. That target date accounts for a 90-day exclusivity extension the company recently received to formulate a plan to pay down its debt. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David R. Jones, of the Southern District of Texas, said the company could still “expedite” the process to appease its creditors.  “To the extent that people are wanting... [a] faster, sooner have-it-done-yesterday type of approach, you can certainly expedite the process,” he said.  The firm’s creditors have quibbled for months over Core Scientific’s bankruptcy proceedings. The proceedings, which began in December 2022, were slated to last just six months but appear poised to drag on for the better part of a year – a fact that has ruffled some feathers among the firm’s long list of creditors.  Thomas Bean, who represents creditor MassMutual, objected to Core Scientific’s request for an extension, arguing it would “incentivize [Core Scientific] to slow walk the case.”  “The debtor has been using our collateral for the last several months,” Bean said. “[It] has not paid the equipment lenders a dime.”  Core Scientific’s counsel, however, argued it required more time to sketch out a business plan to adapt to the shifting realities of a volatile crypto mining landscape that has seen bitcoin prices and hash rates rise as electricity prices fall.  That confluence of factors has made mining more profitable, allowing Core Scientific to generate more revenue to pay down $6 million of its debt, said Ronit Berkovich, an attorney for the debtors.  Given those conditions and the length of its tenure in the crypto industry, Core Scientific has a duty to respond more quickly to the shifting sands of the crypto industry, said Jared Roche, a lawyer for 36th Street Capital and several other creditors.  “The debtor says they need time to address evolving business conditions in the industry, but this is the nature of the crypto industry right now,” Roche said. “It is an immature industry that is always evolving.”  Once the crypto industry’s largest mining company, Core Scientific suffered an astounding, and swift, fall from grace last November, when bitcoin prices cratered amid cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s mid-November implosion. The company went public with a $4.3 billion valuation in 2021, but its market capitalization had fallen to $78 million by the time it filed for bankruptcy last December.

Bitcoin’s accelerated rise to prominence in the NFT space is fueled by the Ordinals Protocol, a mechanism for inscribing satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin, with data such as a JPEG. While they’ve been met with criticism in the Bitcoin community, NFT giant Yuga Labs released their own Ordinals-based collection in February, fueling hype and capital into their adoption.  CryptoSlam reports Bitcoin Frogs as the current top Bitcoin-based NFT collection, which has earned $6.3 million in sales over the past seven days. The collection got a pump last week, raking in $2.3 million in sales on May 17.

12856311,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534509,1684792846,"Bitcoin Bubble About To Burst? Analyst Warns Prices Could Dip To $7,000","Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg, has highlighted Bitcoin’s (BTC) historical patterns of boom and bust, which are closely tied to liquidity. According to McGlone, Bitcoin’s current price level of around $27,000 may be at risk of reversion, considering that it was only $7,000 at the end of 2019 before the massive liquidity pump in 2020. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Records Surge In New Active Addresses, But Onchain Activity Takes A Dive Bitcoin Faces Unprecedented Risk? McGlone’s analysis also indicates that Bitcoin’s downward trajectory, as demonstrated by its 52-week moving average, contrasts with the upward trend it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. This suggests that the cryptocurrency is susceptible to booms when liquidity is abundant but vulnerable to busts when liquidity is removed. As such, McGlone recommends respecting the down-sloping 52-week mean in assessing Bitcoin’s direction bias. Despite the recent bank run, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has tightened twice, which may indicate the central bank’s tenacity, McGlone points out that slumping copper and cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are paying heed to the warning, which contrasts notably with the resilient stock market. Furthermore, in a recent interview, McGlone warned that Bitcoin could potentially experience a significant decline and return to its 2019 rally starting point of around $7,000. McGlone cites the drying up of liquidity and rising interest rates as key factors that could lead to a mean reversion for Bitcoin. While acknowledging the potential for Bitcoin to rebound, McGlone notes that the cryptocurrency has yet to exhibit strong divergence from other assets and suggests that investors should wait for a significant drop in the S&P 500 and copper before considering a long position in Bitcoin. Looking at the facts of Bitcoin, McGlone notes that before the massive liquidity pump in 2020, the cryptocurrency’s average price in 2019 was around $7,000. It subsequently surged to $60,000 before settling at its current level of $27,000. While Bitcoin is still trading at four times its 2019 average price, McGlone cautions that the risk of mean reversion remains and suggests that investors should exercise caution in the current market environment. BTC’s ABC Pattern Could Signal Consolidation And Potential For Upside Crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe has assessed Bitcoin’s recent price action and suggests that the ABC pattern could technically be complete for BTC. The C wave went lower than the initial A wave, and they are approximately the same length from a price drop perspective. The lowest wick was only $500 off the base case, and the price seems to have entered consolidation just as expected, albeit higher. Van de Poppe notes that C waves having approximately the same length as the A wave is uncommon, and sometimes the C wave can go much deeper than the A wave. However, at this point, it is worth considering that the bottom of the C wave may be in. If another drop is lower, it should happen in the first half of this week. If the price breaks above $27,700 or even flips the descending trendline, that could be early signs that consolidation is ending, and Bitcoin’s price is ready for continuation upwards. The ultimate level to flip for higher conviction is $29,000, and RSI is above 50. Related Reading: How Does Current Bitcoin Rally Compare With Historical Ones? On the other hand, if there is a daily candle close below $16,700, another leg down becomes more likely, and Van de Poppe’s target for that would still be $24,000 – $25,3000. Van de Poppe emphasizes that both scenarios are bullish over the medium timeframe (months) as long as Bitcoin’s price does not drop and stays under $22,000 in a sustained manner.

42410679,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgAiN,1684791683,Crypto Hacks Are Down and Hackers Tend to Return Stolen Money: TRM Labs Report,"Hacker stole around $400 million from crypto projects during 40 attacks in the first three months of 2023, blockchain intel firm TRM Labs said in a new report.  This is a 70% decline from the Q1 of 2022.  The average hack size also got smaller, according to TRM, from $30 million in 2022 to $10.5 million for the same period in 2023.  Hackers also increasingly return the money they steal, settling for a “white hat” reward from the exploited projects. Hack victims got almost half of the stollen funds back in 2023, TRM Labs estimates.  For example, an attacker who exploited the TenderFi protocol returned half of the $1.6 million he got out of the attack (TenderFi paid $850,000 bounty in return). Similarly, the hacker behind the Euler lending protocol exploit also agreed to return all the $200 million worth of crypto he ran away with. Both hacks happened in March. In April, the hacker who drained the Safemoon protocol returned $7.1 million of crypto, keeping the rest of his $9 million loot.  A possible explanation might be increasing regulatory attention to the crypto hacks and a number of high-profile enforcement cases, TRM Labs suggests. First of all, crypto exchanges are ramping up their KYC/AML policies, making it harder to cash out stolen coins. At the same time, the ETH mixing protocol Tornado Cash, which has been one the most popular money laundering tool for Ethereum so far, has been under the U.S. sanctions since August 2022, which automatically backlisted all Tornado-related funds for any regulated exchange.  Also, the case of Avraham Eisenberg, who became the first person known to be arrested for a DeFi exploit, might be serving as a warning sign. Eisenberg exploited the Mango Markets protocol and publicly admitted it, revealing the protocol’s vulnerability. He was arrested in Puerto Rico in December.  “The ability to trace and track stolen funds has just gotten better and better – not just by investigators using blockchain intelligence like TRM, but by sleuths on Twitter using open source tools – and has created an environment where hacked funds are being tracked publicly in real time,” TRM Labs’ head of legal and government affairs Ari Redbord.  “Malicious hackers are increasingly having difficulty off-ramping funds and are therefore settling for bug bounties. We are also seeing so-called ‘white hat’ hackers become more and more a part of the ecosystem and could be a helpful way for DeFi services to harden cyber controls,"" Redbord added.  DeFi hackers returned stolen funds before, examples include the Defrost Finance and Nomad Bridge hackers in 2022, Poly Network in 2021 and dForce in 2020.  In March, Crystal Blockchain estimated the overall hacks and scams toll at $119 million. DeFi protocols remain attackers’ favorite target, as complex smart contracts often turn prone to manipulation. According to Chainalysis, DeFi exploits account for 82% of all crypto stollen in 2022.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/22/crypto-hacks-are-down-and-hackers-tend-to-return-stolen-money-trm-labs-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9c587f950776673320ba29ef3bf8f7ad4781393-4024x2688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410683,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgAsI,1684789928,The Making of the Doge Documentary,"I’m drawn to crypto because I’m drawn to stories. The space is packed with characters who are doing weird and surprising things -- sometimes brilliant, sometimes cringe, sometimes sketchy, sometimes inspiring.  And then there’s the world of Doge. This is a different neighborhood of Web3: The goofy corner. A world of jokes and memes and random acts of silliness. It’s also a world of sneaky generosity. As I covered in my 2021 profile of Dogecoin, the early Shibas gave to charity and they gave to each other -- flinging Dogecoin to strangers, sending pizzas to the homeless, and even funding the Jamaican Winter Olympics bobsled team.  Doge is one of my favorite stories in crypto, so perhaps it’s no surprise that there’s now a “Doge Documentary” in the works, courtesy of a DAO called “Own the Doge.”  Details on the doc are still fuzzy. Release date? Distribution? Still TBD. But the cameras are rolling and the creators are on a mission to share the full Doge story as widely as possible. “We think that the Doge is the Mona Lisa of the internet,” says “Tridog,” a member of the Own the Doge DAO and the film’s de facto producer. He now sees it as time to give the Mona Lisa her due.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - CoinDesk Turns 10 – 2020: The Rise of the Meme Economy  Tridog spoke to me from Japan. It was early morning his time, evening my time, and he was about to go on a pilgrimage to meet “Kabosu,” the actual 17-year-old Shiba Inu whose photo inspired the original Doge meme, years before crypto even existed.  He speaks of Kabosu with reverence. And he senses something even philosophical at play. “Maybe there’s something deeper with dogs and cats and our love for pets,” says Tridog, “and that could come out as this deeper meaning within the film.”  Just hours before meeting the Doge herself, Tridog opens up about how a Web3 documentary could be different than a traditional movie, his plans to involve Elon Musk (the self-proclaimed “CEO of Dogecoin”), and how he hopes the film can “inspire people to reconsider the point of our lives on earth, and how powerful it could be if we just think about random acts of kindness.”  (Bonus? They’re sending the Doge to space.)  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What appeals to you about the Doge story?  Tridog: Like a lot of people I thought, “Okay, Doge is funny. It's more of the light-hearted side of crypto."" It’s a really fun community. It spans every age of the internet. And lots of interesting things have happened, going back to funding the literal ""Cool Runnings"" Jamaican bobsled team.  But then a really powerful moment, for me, was coming here [to Japan] six months ago, and then doing this Doge pilgrimage to visit Kabosu. This might be a once in a lifetime opportunity. The Doge is over 17 years old. And I met Atsuko Sato, who’s really a star in this, and her story hasn’t ever really been told.  What can you tell us about her?  Atsuko Sato is the woman who saved Doge. Kabosu, aka, Doge, was at a kill shelter. And so if no one adopted her, she was going to be put down. Atsuko adopted her, and she’s always been an animal lover. She's always been this person who gives and supports animal shelters.  Now she's a 60-something-year-old kindergarten teacher. She still loves to teach. And she's given so much, not just in her time, but also from the proceeds from the NFT sale. She gave to children. And that's always been kind of a piece of our [Doge’s] story, is that we gave the largest crypto gift -- one million dollars to Save the Children. We've continued to work with Save the Children as well as other dog charities since.  Read more: Dogecoin Surges Amid Elon Musk’s Starship Launch Attempt  I’m glad you mentioned that. It seems like the work of the Doge community has kind of gotten overshadowed by all the price frenzy of Dogecoin. Can you summarize what you’ve been up to?  The first project was “Own the Doge.” [PleasrDAO purchased the NFT of the original Doge photo, sold by Atsuko Sato, for 1,696.9 ETH, worth $4.8 million at the time.] And then Pleasr took the NFT and fractionalized it into DOG Token. Now it lives at Own the Doge, which is the DAO spun out of Pleasr.  So now the NFT is owned by this collective of people who hold the DOG token. Or you can hold it in an NFT form called Doge Pixels. That all laid the foundation for the blockchain angle of this. The Doge DAO, or Own the Doge, is our treasury.  How many people are in that community? What’s the size of your treasury?  We have about 15,000 cross-chain holders of DOG. And I think we have about a $3 million treasury at the moment.  Crypto is a very strong part of the story of Doge, but it wasn't the beginning and may not be the end  So the DOG token holders, then, they suggest and brainstorm projects for the DAO? And they’ve green-lit a few projects, such as the documentary and the pilgrimage?  Yeah, exactly. We think that the Doge is the Mona Lisa of the internet. So how do we continue to make that story true, and continue to make it so that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely outcome?  What’s another example of a Doge project from the DAO?  There’s “Bronze the Doge,” which is the statue initiative. [They’re designing and creating a bronze statue of Kabosu, to be placed in her hometown of Sakura, Japan.] We’re trying to get a statue up by the end of the year, ideally by Kabosu's birthday on November 2nd. I went and visited with the mayor, and the mayor is super hyped.  For the mayor, as someone running the city, he sees this as a path for more people making pilgrimages to Sakura, of people coming to show their respect to this dog that has tens of millions of fans around the world.  As for the Doge documentary, is that fully-funded by the DAO, or do you have more traditional movie financing elements?  Yeah, I think we wanna do a hybrid model for that. On the one hand, it's so cool what we can empower through blockchain, and through the [shared] ownership of the Doge image. Maybe everyone who wants to opt-in as DOG holders, or Doge Pixel holders, gets into the credits of the film. Things like that, right? Or maybe there’s a meme competition where people submit animation to the film.  But we also want to reach a mainstream audience. We want the world to understand the story, which is spreading this magic, spreading the joyfulness. I think we could really do something incredibly impactful, not just for Doge but to inspire people to reconsider the point of our lives on earth, and how powerful it could be if we just think about random acts of kindness.  I know that DAOs aren’t big on titles, but what’s your role on the doc, exactly? Producer?  Yeah I guess, traditionally, you’d call me a producer. But I'm kind of doing it on behalf of the project. We're a culture DAO/social club. We try to spread the culture in novel and interesting ways, and bring Doge where Doge hasn't been before. That's kind of my role.  We recently brought on Jon Lynn, who has done documentary work and work for Pleasr House. He created the most comprehensive history of Doge on the second Pleasr House episode. So we brought him on to lead the documentary, as the director.  Do you intend for the doc to have traditional distribution?  We’re in conversations with some folks in Hollywood, and we wanna take it to that level. We want to see this on Netflix. That would be the most powerful place for it, right? We can tell an accessible, mainstream story about Doge. And you do it in a very fun, unique way that spreads a bit more of that joy.  What else do you want for the doc?  Obviously one of the important interviews we want to get is Elon.  Obviously.  We're still trying to make sure he's aware of the film. That’s one reason we’re doing more of a public approach to the documentary -- so that people can see this is a legit thing. A lot of our friends in Hollywood are like, “Yeah, you don't usually announce it like this.” I'm like, ""Well, this is very different than a traditional film.""  What are other ways that this Web3 doc is different from a traditional one?  Building in public, obviously, is the big one. And how do we plug the community into this? Maybe if we need to raise money, we could list the top 11 donors as producers in the front of the film. We definitely want to put anyone who’s part of owning the Doge -- the DOG holders -- in the credits. And I think that's very feasible. We also could vote on-chain.  Again, we have to mesh with the traditional world a bit, but I think we could vote on-chain or at least suggest on-chain, like do a snapshot [vote] with the Doge DAO about what we want the name of the film to be.  And there could be a kind of provenance of it being on-chain and having this track record of how the film came together. The timeline can be really cool. We have a bunch of ideas.  What else can you tell us about the content in the doc itself?  One of the themes we're exploring is, what’s the bigger thing that has happened here, with Doge? Crypto is a very strong part of the story of Doge, but it wasn't the beginning and may not be the end.  The stronger meaning to me is that maybe there's something greater about the connection of humans to dogs, and how that's happened throughout history. To a point where that’s why this photo tickled us so much. More than anything else, more than any other meme, animation, or drawing. Maybe there’s something deeper with dog and cats and our love for pets, and that could come out as this deeper meaning within the film.  Give us one final tease of something else the Doge DAO is doing?  We’re sending the Doge, or the photo of the Doge, to space. Into lunar orbit at some point. That's kind of a wacky wild one.  Courtesy of SpaceX?  We’re kind of waiting on those last details, but yeah, it's tied into SpaceX.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | ETH | SHIB,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/22/the-making-of-the-doge-documentary,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e11bae7aa7905f57f620bd264b64ed035c4377f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410676,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgAV9,1684789629,U.S. Lawmakers Can Get Crypto Regulations Right if They Act Now,"The digital asset industry is at a major crossroads. Regulators around the globe are moving to enact rules for the 15-year-old industry. The EU Parliament in April approved a slate of regulations called Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), the most comprehensive multi-jurisdictional framework for digital assets ever. Hong Kong (with the tacit approval of China) plans to deliver a licensing regime this spring, putting it in a two horse race with Singapore to join Japan as a digital asset hub in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. The G-20 group of nations is pushing for global regulation, with the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Meanwhile, in the U.S. we have fragmentation, frustration and fighting. This is a global economy now. Blocking digital assets in the U.S. doesn’t stop the industry from moving forward. It simply puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage.  Mike Belshe is the chief executive officer of BitGo.  U.S. capital markets are the strongest and most liquid in the world largely because of our regulatory regime. But when it comes to digital assets, we’re on a path to becoming one of the worst regulatory jurisdictions in the world. If we want a piece of this growing global industry, legislators and regulators need to get their act together – and fast.  What we have right now is a situation where we’re making rules piecemeal. We have per-state handling of digital assets such as New York’s BitLicense, and inconsistent money-transmission rules from state to state. States are granting charters for crypto banks while the Federal Reserve is blocking access to its systems.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is denying all charters. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is implementing accounting rules which effectively block traditional financial institutions from participating in digital assets, while again stalling on defining digital assets. Instead, it is leaning heavily into enforcement, which isn’t a problem in and of itself. It’s that the SEC isn't making it clear what firms are doing wrong. Groundbreaking firms, with few avenues of recourse available, are suing regulators just to get their questions answered.  At the legislative level, the bills in play have become bogged down in partisan politics and it’s looking less and less likely that any federal legislation will pass this year.  Overall, U.S. regulators and legislators starting to participate is more positive than not. They are critical players in the financial ecosystem. Industry can’t safely build businesses without them, but regulators must act quickly. If they don’t, bad actors will continue to flourish, and firms that want to play by the rules will move to jurisdictions where growth and innovation are possible.  See also: SEC Is Alleging Legal Violations 'On the Fly,' Coinbase Says  The best approach right now would be to extend the basic investor protections of our traditional financial markets to include digital assets, while thoughtfully crafting new rules that fit the technology and exempting firms from other rules that do not.  The SEC has made some moves in the right direction. The agency's February 2023 draft amendment to bring digital assets under the ""custody rule"" is a great example of applying a rule that already works. In traditional financial markets, trading and custody are separate functions. Crypto has no such market structure, and the lack of regulation requiring it left the door open for fraudsters to make off with billions.  That could have been avoided if it had acted faster. When BitGo decided to pursue a trust company charter back in 2017, we approached the OCC for federal oversight. At the time, the banking regulator would not charter us, so we instead became a state-chartered trust company. But we didn’t know whether we would be considered a “qualified custodian” per the SEC.  We proactively and voluntarily approached the SEC with that question in 2018, submitting a formal no-action letter. It declined to opine on that letter for over four years. If it takes that long to address such a basic question, how can we avoid falling behind competing markets?  The SEC in April put out a statement considering a proposal to update the definition of exchanges to include decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Here is a case where some of the rules apply, but others not so much. DEXs should be regulated and investors protected. But decentralized finance (DeFi) actually has the potential to do some of regulators’ work for them by enshrining their written rules in automated, auditable code.  DeFi’s real-time auditability and immutable public ledger is proving to be very useful for helping investigators recover funds. Spreading the same rules over DEXs like a schemer of peanut butter would be unnecessarily cumbersome and could potentially inhibit the usefulness of the technology.  [The SEC] declined to opine on that letter for over four years. If it takes that long to address such a basic question, how can we avoid falling behind competing markets?  The SEC has also taken a number of actions against staking programs offered by exchanges. This is a case where new rules are needed. Staking is a brand new way of validating transactions, and there are many variations on staking that don’t fall neatly into the existing rules.  What if instead of just shutting programs down and levying fines, the SEC said, ""OK, we get it, this is new and in a gray area. Stop doing these three things. Do these other three things, and you have six months to get this done and keep going. No need for a fine – we just want to see you move forward and build safe products.""  See also: Wyoming Defends 'Legitimacy' of Its Crypto Charter  That’s the kind of collaborative attitude we need to move forward – not more actions against token issuers for selling unregistered securities, and against exchanges for facilitating the trading of them. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly said that all that issuers and exchanges need to do is register and make the same disclosures about digital assets as companies are required to do when they offer securities.  Yes, disclosures are in order. However, there are some disclosures that don’t apply, as well as things you might want to know about a digital asset that wouldn’t be included in current disclosure requirements. For example, MiCA requires that projects disclose the type of blockchain consensus mechanism they use, and its environmental impacts. But for now, they can do that in a public white paper, rather than a prospectus. Providing new definitions and rules like these seems like a better course than regulation by enforcement.  The digital asset sector is a trillion dollar industry, requiring proportional banking support. By refusing to provide clear guidance for traditional banks to participate (and nearly every bank in America has wanted to participate in digital assets for at least four years), regulators inadvertently created significant concentration risk in a handful of relatively small banks, including Silvergate Bank, which grew its business by offering innovative products to the digital asset industry.  If instead of having one small bank shouldering 85% of the banking needs of the industry, we had had hundreds of banks each holding 1% of the industry on their shoulders, it would have been better for both industries. Regulators could have helped that happen.  The underlying cause of all the digital asset and bank implosions and consequent loss of investor funds is not due to the inclusion of digital assets in our markets; the problems are caused by excluding them. Legislative and regulatory failures to keep pace with innovation and create paths to invest in digital assets under the safety of capital markets supervision is directly responsible for harming the very investors these rules are supposed to protect.  There is no doubt that our established, regulated trading markets mitigate risk better than crypto markets. The best thing we could do to mitigate risk in crypto markets would be to help the established trading markets, banks, and custodians – our stewards of risk mitigation – participate. It's not a two-month effort. It's a multi-year ever-evolving effort, because the difficulty of keeping up with innovation is constant.  Once software enters an industry, it propels change, and the financial services industry is one that is particularly slow to change. The digital asset firms that are building for the long term are not seeking to avoid regulatory oversight or to build speculative assets and markets. We’re in it to build better financial markets and we want to work with regulators to get clear guidance on how to take digital asset products and services to market.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Mike Belshe,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/22/us-lawmakers-can-get-crypto-regulations-right-if-they-act-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/427f939ef8fc800b3c4e0fa2b3398d48f5ecf159-1053x1062.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12855378,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534482,1684789230,"Litecoin Surpasses $90, But This Level Remains Crucial For The Altcoin","Despite the prevailing selling pressure in the cryptocurrency market, Litecoin has emerged as a standout performer. While the past 24 hours have not witnessed significant movement in the LTC price, the weekly chart reveals an appreciation of nearly 4%. A significant breakthrough occurred as Litecoin surpassed the crucial $90 price level, signaling a positive shift in its price. Technical analysis suggests that the bulls hold sway over the price action, with demand and accumulation indicators displaying positive signals on the daily chart. Related Reading: Role Reversal: Ethereum Defies Expectations With Lower Volatility Than Bitcoin Most altcoins, including Litecoin, have exhibited similar price patterns influenced by the fluctuations of Bitcoin. Therefore, sustaining the LTC price above the $90 mark will depend on the overall strength of the broader market. Should Bitcoin reclaim the $27,000 zone, it could pave the way for Litecoin to overcome its significant overhead resistance in subsequent trading sessions. While buyers of LTC currently maintain a favorable position, it is important to note that a slight push from the bears could potentially drive the price below $90, prompting bearish activity. However, the increased market capitalization of Litecoin in the recent session suggests that buyers are currently in control. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Litecoin (LTC) was valued at $91.02. The altcoin’s successful move above the $90 threshold has strengthened the bulls, who are now pushing prices even higher. However, a formidable barrier stands at $92.8. Surmounting this resistance level could potentially propel LTC toward the $97 mark. Conversely, declining the current price level would push the altcoin below $90. Should this occur, support might be found at around $86. The recent session’s trading volume of LTC was positive (green), indicating a growing demand for the coin. Technical Analysis Buyers have displayed consistent confidence in Litecoin (LTC) as the asset’s price has improved. This positive sentiment is reflected in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), positioned above the half-line and just below the 60 mark. This indicates more buyers than sellers, reinforcing the optimistic outlook. Moreover, LTC’s price remains above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers are driving the market’s momentum. Additionally, LTC has managed to stay above the 50-SMA (yellow) and the 200-SMA (green) lines, pointing towards increased demand for the asset. Litecoin (LTC) demonstrated buy signals alongside other technical indicators, suggesting favorable market conditions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) revealed the formation of green signal bars, indicating positive momentum and a bullish trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Shrinks To Historical Levels, Violent Move Incoming? Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands, a volatility indicator, displayed wide bands, indicating increased price volatility and fluctuation. This implies that LTC is unlikely to trade within a narrow price range, as there is potential for significant price swings.

12854427,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534483,1684785613,Ethereum (ETH) Beacon Chain Shatters Records With $7.7 Billion Inflows,"Ethereum’s (ETH) Beacon Chain has seen significant inflows since staking withdrawals were enabled on April 12th, with over $7.7 billion worth of Ethereum deposited into the contract. This is despite some initial predictions of a flood of outflows following the Shanghai Upgrade. The Beacon Chain is a core component of Ethereum 2.0, the next generation of the Ethereum blockchain. It is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain responsible for coordinating validators, validating transactions, and proposing and finalizing blocks in the Ethereum network. Related Reading: Dogecoin Transaction Count Rises 60X, But Why Are Prices Down? Ethereum Beacon Chain Defies Critics According to the research firm Arkham Intel, The total amount of deposited Ether now exceeds the April 12th balance by around 1.25 million ETH, with daily deposits varying widely, sometimes reaching up to 225,000 ETH (over $400 million in a single day). The inflows chart shows a noticeable spike following the Shapella upgrade, which coincided with the full enablement of withdrawals from the Beacon Chain. At the forefront of these deposits is Lido’s stETH address “0xae7”, which has consistently been the top depositor with a lifetime deposit amount of well over $15 billion, accounting for over a third of the ETH locked in the deposit contract, according to Arkham. Following the enabling of stETH Unstaking, Lido’s deposit address has now been transferred to a new address, “0xfdd”, which has already become the 4th deposit address since April, with a total deposit amount of over 214,000 ETH, or over $386 million, despite only being active for the past three days. Furthermore, the growth of Ethereum 2.0 and the Beacon Chain has been accompanied by a surge in staking services and Liquid Staking Tokens with Frax. This stablecoin project aims to provide a more stable and reliable alternative to traditional fiat currencies, being one of the notable players in this space. Frax offers a product called frxETH, which allows users to stake their ETH and receive liquid-staked ETH tokens (sfrxETH) in return. Although Frax ranks 14th on the leaderboard of depositors, their total stake of 72,400 ETH since April 1st represents a significant portion of their total Frax ETH supply, accounting for 33.6% of the total frxETH supply of 215,000. The growth of staking services and liquid staking tokens is a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem, as it provides users with more options for earning rewards on their ETH holdings. This growth is also a testament to the popularity of Ethereum 2.0 and the Beacon Chain, which offer a more efficient and sustainable network for decentralized applications. ETH’s Price Action Suggests A Bearish Future According to Michael Van de Poppe, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, ETH’s price resembles more of a bear flag than a consolidation pattern. He believes that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is higher on ETH, and when combined with the chart pattern, it is likely that ETH will experience another leg down, making it more probable than Bitcoin (BTC). Van de Poppe points out that for him to change his mind about ETH, the resistance level that needs to be broken is $1,867. However, if the candle closes below $1,735, there is a high likelihood of continuation toward the range of $1,675 to $1,712, with the lower $1600 as the next potential support level. Related Reading: How Does Current Bitcoin Rally Compare With Historical Ones? Despite the current short-term uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, the long-term outlook for Ethereum and the broader digital asset industry remains positive. However, while it can be challenging to predict short-term price movements, Michael Van de Poppe’s analysis suggests that the short-term outlook for Ethereum may be bearish.

42410693,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgBM3,1684782505,"Tether Trading Volume Falls to Multi-Year Lows, Market Cap Rise Is ‘Questionable:’ Kaiko","Trading with Tether’s USDT stablecoin has fallen to multi-year lows, making the token’s rise to near all-time highs in market capitalization “questionable,” crypto market research firm Kaiko said in a Monday report.  As stablecoins’ primary use is for trading, USDT’s recent increased supply to $83 billion while the token’s use falls, “seems inordinate,” according to Kaiko.  Dollar-pegged stablecoins, with a combined market capitalization of $129 billion, have become the backbone of the digital asset ecosystem, bridging traditional currencies with crypto and facilitating cryptocurrency trading. USDT, issued by Tether, is the most widely used stablecoin measured by market cap and trading volume.  USDT has climbed this year to near its all-time high market cap in May 2022 of $83.4 billion. The rise has mainly stemmed from bank failures and a U.S. regulatory crackdown hitting rival stablecoins, including Circle’s USDC and Paxos’ BUSD.  Read more: USDC Outflows Surpass $10B as Tether’s Stablecoin Dominance Reaches 22-Month High  The token’s trading volume, however, has sharply declined recently due to a combination of lackluster crypto trading during a crypto bear market and Binance, the world’s largest exchange, reintroducing trading fees for USDT asset pairs. This weekend, USDT’s daily trading volume fell below $10 billion for the first time since March 2019, according to data by analytics firm CoinGecko.  “When looking at actual usage of the stablecoin on both centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges, the increase seems inordinate,” Kaiko said.  Curious case of USDT growth  The crypto industry has been scrutinizing Tether for years about what assets back the value of USDT and the lack of audits. At the end of March, Tether held roughly $82 billion of assets including U.S. treasury bonds, gold and bitcoin for $79 billion of stablecoins, according to the reserves report signed by BDO Italy.  As trading volumes are falling, and assuming that trading is the dominant use case for stablecoins, a respective decline in market capitalization would be anticipated, according to Clara Medalie, Kaiko’s research director. USDC and BUSD stablecoins’ market caps have shrunk in tandem with trading volumes. “But we are not seeing this trend for Tether,” Medalie said.  One possible explanation for USDT’s trend-defying growth is the rotation to off-shore exchanges from regulated ones as U.S. regulators are increasingly separating crypto from the traditional financial system. “Traders that normally used U.S. dollars no longer have this as an option, thus are turning to Tether,” Medalie said.  Another explanation might involve the Tron blockchain and its lower fees compared to Ethereum. The majority of USDT tokens are issued on the crypto billionaire Justin Sun-founded network, with Binance owning the largest USDT addresses on Tron. “There could be a relationship between Tron, Tether, and Binance, perhaps with market makers opting to use the network due to its low fees, and supplying liquidity to Binance with USDT,” Medalie added.

Despite an impressive surge in new addresses, SOL’s on-chain activity experienced a decline during May. Meanwhile, the asset’s price has also mirrored its on-chain activity as SOL has been in a downtrend in the past week, down by nearly 10%. On-Chain Activity Defies New Address Metrics As of this month (May), Solana demonstrated growth in its user base, with 5.4 million new addresses joining the blockchain. This surge represents the highest number of new addresses added since October 2022, hinting at a surge in interest in the Solana blockchain. Typically, a surge in new addresses suggests strong fundamentals for a blockchain, reflecting growing adoption and community engagement. Related Reading: Billions Of Dollars Tokenized Bitcoin Moved To Ethereum, BSC, And Solana However, while Solana experienced a surge in new addresses, its on-chain activity declined during the same period. Data from The Block, a prominent blockchain analytics tool, reveals that the on-chain activity on the Solana network dropped in May, contrasting the influx of new participants. On-chain activity refers to the transactions, smart contract interactions, and other operations occurring on the blockchain. The decrease in on-chain activity raises questions about the factors influencing Solana’s blockchain’s overall engagement and usage and why growth in activity has failed to impact its price positively. Unique Circumstances For SOL Solana’s situation is unique due to the divergence between the increasing number of addresses and the decline in SOL’s price. While new addresses often correlate with positive growth indicators for cryptocurrencies, SOL’s price experienced a more than 10% drop since the beginning of May. Starting the month at $21.71, SOL’s price currently trades at $19.68. Over the past week, the asset has plummeted by 8.2%. SOL has dropped from a high of $21.38 seen last Monday to trade below $20 at the time of writing. Solana’s market capitalization has also plunged in the past seven days. SOL’s market cap has fallen nearly 10% from a cap high of $217 billion to a high of $8.4 billion last Monday. Meanwhile, its daily trading volume has surged in the past few days. From $100 million and $150 million a few days ago to nearly $300 million in the last 24 hours. The unique decoupling between Solana’s new address growth and price performance caught the crypto community’s attention. Related Reading: Solana Co-Founder Pitches New Way Of Meme Coin Distribution Notably, Several factors could contribute to Solana’s contrasting trends. Market dynamics, investor sentiment, and external market factors may have influenced SOL’s price decline. Additionally, while the surge in new addresses indicates growing interest, it is crucial to consider the nature of these addresses. Analyzing the activity associated with the new addresses, such as trading or long-term holding, could provide further insights into the situation.

Outflows for the week ended May 19 mostly reflected poor sentiment toward bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) funds, with outflows of $33M. Still, short-bitcoin products saw minor outflows of $1.3M, so sentiment didn't appear completely negative. ""It is unclear why there is such coordinated negative sentiment for both long and short investment products,"" the report said. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), currently changing hands at $26.88K, slipped 1.1% for the week and 1.7% from a month ago, in the wake of the U.S. debt-ceiling impasse as well as uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest-rate path.

42410696,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgBVy,1684776982,Why the Biggest Emerging Markets Are Turning to Crypto,"With the U.S. mired in political stasis while other regions build crypto frameworks, it’s worth looking at the evolution of, and outlook for, on-the-ground demand for crypto assets. This is getting more and more relevant as many large countries struggle with skyrocketing inflation, shaky currencies and autocratic control over financial access, and as populations become increasingly crypto-aware and a lack of trust in centralized institutions grows.  Last week, the government of Pakistan (the fifth largest country in the world in terms of population, with over 239 million inhabitants) was reported to have said that cryptocurrencies “will never be legalized” in Pakistan, in order to avoid FATF penalties.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  This may sound on the surface like an overreaction to FATF’s crypto stance – last Thursday, the organization’s president published a letter titled “An end to the lawless crypto space” which urges crypto regulation rather than a total ban.  Then again, Pakistan has a somewhat tense relationship with the FATF, and just last October was taken off its “grey list” (which labels certain countries as having “deficiencies” in their AML controls, which in turn can lead to limited participation in global finance).  It’s also not hard to see the hand of the International Monetary Fund. Pakistan is currently in talks with the organization regarding a bailout package, although negotiations seem stalled and concern about the country’s political and economic issues is starting to affect neighboring nations. The IMF has not been shy about its unease with crypto markets, and a few months ago, reports surfaced that it had applied crypto-suppression conditions to negotiations with Argentina.  Yet crypto use in Pakistan is nevertheless active, as people are reportedly converting their salaries into stablecoins to prevent currency erosion. The rupee has dropped more than 20% against the U.S. dollar year-to-date, more than 30% over the past year. Meanwhile, BTC in rupee terms is up 103% so far in 2023 (vs 63% in U.S. dollar terms). It’s probably not a coincidence that a 2022 report from forensics company Chainalysis placed Pakistan 6th in terms of global crypto adoption.  There’s also Nigeria (the sixth largest country in the world, with over 218 million people), which is likely to devalue its currency once the new president is sworn in, in a bid to alleviate trade imbalances and dollar shortages. The sub-Saharan nation ranked 11th in Chainalysis’ global crypto adoption ranking, and according to Google Trends, looking back over the past 90 days, Nigeria is the top-ranking country in terms of searches for the term “crypto” and second in terms of searches for the term “bitcoin.”  Turkey is the 18th largest country in the world in terms of population, with more than 85 million inhabitants. Last week its currency hit a new record low as markets brace for Erdogan’s likely re-election in the runoffs on May 28. A recent chart by crypto market data firm Kaiko shows the spike in crypto activity based in lira, now notably higher than euro-based activity. Turkey was 12th in Chainalysis’ 2022 crypto adoption ranking – currency woes and the pressing need to hedge and diversify are likely to push it up the list.  An unexpected entry into my “watch the adoption” list is Japan – the 11th largest country with over 124 million people, and the third richest in terms of nominal GDP. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, shared a chart last week that plotted growth in spot volumes on crypto exchanges. The leader? Japan, with the second highest average daily volume (after the U.S.) and easily the highest percentage growth (approximately 55% year-to-date).  This could be largely for speculation, since Japan has low inflation and its currency is relatively stable. Or, it could be a sign of investors bracing for higher inflation and currency instability. Higher inflation would most likely trigger rate hikes, however, which should strengthen the yen, so it’s not clear what bitcoin would be a hedge for in Japan.  There are many other examples of citizens around the world turning to crypto to hedge against local currency volatility and debasement – Ukraine, Argentina and Lebanon are just a few that come to mind. Many struggle with the absence of reliable onramps and with the difficulty of custody. But few are even remotely concerned about the U.S. regulatory hostility.  All this serves as a reminder that the U.S. may have the largest financial market in the world, but crypto’s purpose goes well beyond the speculation that financial markets serve. What’s more, many developing economies are accustomed to regulators overstepping their bounds in terms of limiting financial freedom, and thus their citizens find the decentralized nature of many crypto assets easier to understand and appreciate than do individuals used to more open regimes.  Throw in the increasing probability of significant currency turmoil ahead in emerging countries’ economies, inflationary pressures and a strong dollar, and, in turn, the likelihood of political turmoil, and you can see how the “insurance” and “hedge” qualities of crypto assets such as BTC and stablecoins become even more compelling. Monetary liquidity headwinds may be significant, but they are not the whole crypto market story.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/22/why-the-biggest-emerging-markets-are-turning-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f04820bec8a1d33578caa022c848cb9bdcf1523-1280x599.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410685,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgB2D,1684776961,"Dash Blockchain Halts, Binance Pool Suspends Mining Rewards","Dash, a blockchain powering the namesake privacy-focused coin, stopped processing transactions and producing new blocks for about 16 hours on Monday, according to Samuel Westrich, CTO of Dash Core Group.  “There was a problem during v19 activation of Dash Core,"" Westrich tweeted around 5 a.m. UTC (1 a.m. EST). ""The chain is stalled and currently not producing blocks,"" he added. ""We have everyone investigating the issue.""  Several hours later, Dash Core developer Pasta tweeted that the devs had identified issues and were working on a fix. “There are two options we are investigating, and everyone is focused on promptly resolving this issue,” Pasta wrote, adding that the planned release of the latest Dash Core client update, v19, might be delayed to resolve the issues first.  According to Pasta blocks and transactions on the Dash blockchain will not be considered final until an update is deployed. Exceptions will be made for two sorts of transactions specific for Dash: ChainLocked and InstantSend locked transactions.  Following the news, crypto exchange Binance announced that its own mining pool for DASH will suspend the distribution of mining rewards until the blockchain resumes block production.  A user on the DashPay Reddit page suggested that the planned v19 update did not go smoothly. The developers launched a hard fork, which introduced a new type of nodes, and these new nodes created a mess, so the blockchain split into two chains running in parallel.  “The chain appears to have bifurcated now with some nodes running forward past the fork block 1874880 and others still stuck on 1874879,” user xkcdmpx wrote. “It seems about 10-20% of the network is able to move forward, however, we do not have confirmation if this is the 'correct' chain.""  Some later posts in the thread had been since deleted and users complained about excessive subreddit moderation on the official Dash forum.  Late Monday night, the Dash Core developers issued a fix for the issue, according to the CTO Samuel Westrich. “Blocks have been being produced for about 7 hours now. We advise to upgrade to this version asap. Currently around 40%+ of the network has upgraded and the figure is rising quickly,” Westrich tweeted at 3:41 a.m. UTC on Tuesday. Around 4 p.m. he wrote that 80% of the network had adopted the hot fix and were running the blockchain again. The v19 update has been moved to June 14, according to the Dash Discord channel.  Update in the air  The update for Dash network clients was announced on April 14 and included significant modifications on how the nodes and wallets function. The update requires a hard fork – an irreversible change in the protocol rules that needs to be adapted by the absolute majority of nodes – otherwise the blockchain will split into two parallel versions of transaction history.  After the v19 activation, a new version of Dash masternodes will be introduced, with higher collateral requirements and more authority on the blockchain, according to the Dash Core official website. Masternodes host full copies of the blockchain and support some complex functions of Dash. They need to post a collateral to operate, receive rewards for supporting the network and also can vote to support new projects for Dash.  The update will bring a number of other changes for nodes, wallets, Dash anonymity features and other aspects of the blockchain’s operation, including copying some of the features of the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the new features will be that transactions that appear “stuck” in the queue to be processed will be re-sent sooner that they are now, after one hour, instead of the current more than 24-hour delay.  At the same time, Dash Core has been working on the Dash Platform v0.24 update on testnet to bring some high-level updates to how the blockchain works.  Dash was launched in 2014, more than a year later than Ethereum, but hasn’t been enjoying massive popularity, currently with a market cap of $493 million, 85th in size on CoinMarketCap.

12851932,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534413,1684776618,How Does Current Bitcoin Rally Compare With Historical Ones?,"Here’s how the current Bitcoin rally stacks up against the previous ones in terms of the drawdowns it has experienced so far. The Current Bitcoin Rally Has Seen A Peak Drawdown Of -18.6% So Far In a recent tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode compared the latest Bitcoin rally with the ones seen throughout the entire history of the cryptocurrency. Generally, rallies are compared using metrics like the percentage price uplifts recorded during them or the amount of time that they lasted (which may be measured in terms of the blocks produced, as is done when looking at cycles in terms of halvings). Here, however, Glassnode has taken a different approach that provides a new perspective on these rallies. The comparison basis between the price surges here is the drawdowns that each of them experienced across their spans. Note that these drawdowns aren’t to be confused with the cyclical drawdowns that are used to measure how the price has declined since the bull run top. The drawdowns in question are the obstacles that the cryptocurrency encountered while the rallies were still ongoing, and are hence, those that the coin eventually managed to overcome. Related Reading: Prices Limit And Slow Down The Number Of BTC ‘Wholecoiners?’ Here is a chart that shows the degree of drawdowns that each of the historical bull markets experienced, and also where the current rally stands in comparison to them: Looks like the value of the metric hasn't been too high for the latest rally so far | Source: Glassnode on Twitter The five bull rallies here are as follows: genesis to 2011 (the very first rally), 2011-2013, 2015-2017, 2018-2021 (the last rally), and 2022 cycle+ (the ongoing one). The analytics firm here has taken the bottom of each of the bear markets as the start of the next bull rallies. This means that parts of the cycle that some may not consider as part of the proper bull run are also included. The main example of this would be the April 2019 rally, which is often considered its own thing but is clubbed with the last Bitcoin bull market in the above chart. From the graph, it’s visible that the deepest drawdown that occurred during the first bull market measured around -49.4%. The next run, the 2011 to 2013 bull, experienced an even larger obstacle of a -71.2% plunge midway through it. The next one (2015-2017) then only saw a drawdown of -36%, but the drawdown was again up at -62.6% for the run that followed it (that is, the latest bull market). Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Shrinks To Historical Levels, Violent Move Incoming? So far in the 2022+ Bitcoin bull market (which would only be considered a bull market at all if the November 2022 low was truly the cyclical bottom), the deepest drawdown observed so far is the March 2023 plunge of -18.6%. Clearly, the drawdown seen in the current rally so far is significantly lesser than what the historical bull markets face. If the pattern of the past runs holds any weight at all, then this would mean that the current bull market should still have more potential to grow.

The 24-week course will hold workshops about tokenomics, governance structures and compliance concepts that will help crypto-curious individuals in building autonomous online communities.  My First DAO will use a “learn and earn” model, meaning that it will reward students for participating in the program. To enroll, students must mint a “DAOphin,” a dolphin-themed non-fungible token (NFT) by Process Grey, the artist behind the popular Goblintown collection.  At the end of the 24 weeks, students will be able to burn their DAOphin NFT for a generative art equivalent with rarity traits built in. Students can increase their chances of getting an NFT with rarer traits by participating in the classes.  Alex Taub, co-founder of Upstream, told CoinDesk that many Web3 builders don’t have the proper educational materials to learn how to build a successful DAO.  “There are a lot of concepts around starting online communities that people don't understand, such as tokenomics, governance and voting,” said Taub. “That's also one of the reasons why it's harder on adoption … I think putting together an amazing course about how to do it and why to do it will just unlock so many people's brains.”  The DAOphin open-edition mint is open from now until May 29, and each NFT is available for 0.015 ETH, or about $30. The course begins on June 1 and concludes in December with a wrap party at Miami’s Art Basel.  At last year’s Art Basel, Upstream hosted its first DAO-A-THON, a shark-tank-style competition for DAO builders to pitch their early Web3 community ideas and earn funding to execute those visions.  At the end of this year’s program, students will be able to take over the NFT collection’s intellectual property (IP) and its funded DAO treasury, allowing them to put into practice the skills learned in the course.  “As we spend more time online, DAOs don't make sense for a lot of things right now,” added Taub. “But if you want to buy a digital asset with people, a DAO makes a lot of sense.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MINING | REGULATION,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/22/web3-educational-company-upstream-launches-learn-and-earn-dao-course,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b1d35236702ce166468b7af0e29edb8d5cc5da1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410687,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgB5W,1684773336,"Celebrating Bitcoin Pizza Day: the Time a Bitcoin User Bought 2 Pizzas for 10,000 BTC","Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day.  On May 22, 2010 Laszlo Hanyecz paid Jeremy Sturdivant 10,000 bitcoins (BTC) for two Papa John’s pizzas which were delivered to Hanyecz’s home. This exchange is widely celebrated because it is viewed as the first use of bitcoin in a commercial transaction with bitcoin as the medium of exchange.  Of course, Bitcoin Pizza Day also invites one of the silliest and most disingenuous takes on bitcoin ever with: “Wow, that guy is dumb, if he held that bitcoin he’d have over $270 million! Instead he just got two pizzas.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Well, would he?  Obviously 10,000 BTC is a lot of money now, but it wasn’t in 2010. In fact, 10,000 bitcoins in 2010 bought you about two pizzas. Bitcoin would have no value if no one ever used it for anything, hence why Bitcoin Pizza Day is so important.  This applies for a lot of things, but bitcoin’s parabolic rise happened in plain sight so it’s an easy thing to latch onto. Here’s another hypothetical example to outline how disingenuous the “this guy is dumb” take is.  Suppose a technology company with four co-founders hires its first employee. That employee is paid a $50,000 cash salary and is granted a 1% stake in the (worthless) company after their first year of service. That employee then decides to take a sabbatical to hike the Appalachian Trail and while there decides they don’t want to work for the company any more.  Suppose the hypothetical company is a technology company – perhaps a hot social media website – and after eight years of hyperbolic growth the company goes public at a $100 billion valuation. Employee #1 is suddenly immensely wealthy, but did this hypothetical social media company pay their first employee $1 billion for a year of work?  See also: U.S. Debt Deal Could Weigh On Bitcoin Price, Some Say  No, of course not. They paid them $50,000 cash and 1% of a company that was worthless at the time. In that same way, Hanyecz didn’t pay $270 million for two pizzas, he paid 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas in 2010 because that’s how much two pizzas cost in 2010.  Bitcoin could have failed spectacularly. So could have that hot technology company – like many other failed companies. Without Bitcoin Pizza Day, perhaps no one would have stepped up to use what Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto called peer-to-peer digital cash as a medium of exchange and bitcoin would still be floating around as valueless, magic internet money for nerds (in concept alone).  So thank you to these pizza pioneers, Laszlo Hanyecz and Jeremy Sturdivant, for kicking off the bitcoin economy.

Namada co-founder Christopher Goes told CoinDesk the planned grants program would support a range of privacy-centric research and development projects that benefit Cosmos-based Osmosis and Namada, which hasn’t launched yet. Namada would bankroll the effort but Goes said he’s “hopeful” Osmosis will pitch in too.  Namada also seeks to roll out its method for protecting asset privacy on Osmosis.

Namada’s Swiss-based nonprofit the Anoma Foundation would earmark some of Namada’s staking token NAM for airdrops to OSMO holders. The snapshot hasn’t yet happened and distribution could come after Namada goes live.  Exact timelines and amounts are not yet in stone in part because Osmosis’ community has not yet weighed in.

12850892,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534427,1684772428,"Dogecoin Transaction Count Rises 60X, But Why Are Prices Down?","Dogecoin’s on-chain transaction count is up more than 60X from roughly 20,000 transactions as of May 1 to over 1.20 million on May 20, BitInfoCharts data shows. 60X Spike In Transaction Count The present spike represents a 60X expansion in the Dogecoin transaction count, a noteworthy development primarily due to the launch of Ordinals on the proof-of-work blockchain. The spike in Dogecoin’s transactions coincided with the launch of Ordinals on May 10. With Ordinals now on Dogecoin, another proof-of-work blockchain using the same consensus style as Bitcoin, users can create a new token based on the DRC-20 system. These tokens represent unique assets like texts, images, or videos. Crucially, users don’t have to use smart contracts to mint them. However, despite the exponential increase in transaction count, DOGE prices are stable, moving horizontally, and relatively unchanged in the last three weeks. The coin is also down 31% from April 2023 peaks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Multiple Attempts At $0.10: Will The Barrier Finally Be Broken? Dogecoin is the first meme coin created as a joke and launched in 2013. But over the years, it has gained a significant following and endorsement, including from Elon Musk, the billionaire technology investor. DOGE, the native currency of Dogecoin, is one of the largest cryptocurrency networks whose market capitalization places it among the top 10 coins. As of May 22, DOGE had a market capitalization of $10.1 billion and is more valuable than Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain, and Solana, a smart contracting platform, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ordinals On Dogecoin The DRC-20 standard is inspired by the more popular ERC-20 standard in Ethereum. Tokens complying with the DRC-20 on the Dogecoin platform are fungible and can be transferred. With these tokens, users can “inscribe” files, attaching them to the smallest unit of Dogecoin called “shibes.” These unique files represent various assets, including texts, images, videos, applications, and much more. Inscribed files, confirmed by Dogecoin miners and added to the blockchain, are unique and comparable to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The rise of DRC-20 tokens on Dogecoin explains why there has been a sharp spike in the number of on-chain transactions over the last 12 days, as trackers show. To illustrate, BitInfoCharts data shows that the number of on-chain transactions on May 10 stood at 48,500. However, the number has steadily risen in the last 12 days, peaking at 1.2 million on May 20. Dogecoin Transaction Count | Source: BitInfoCharts Considering the popularity of NFTs on proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, transaction counts on each network will only continue rising. Related Reading: Bugs Discovered On Ordinals Protocol As Bitcoin Rips Above $30,000 Ordinals, the team behind the BRC-20 standard that’s now being replicated on Dogecoin, aims to expand the use case of Bitcoin.

42410682,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgAlg,1684770327,Sen. Warren’s Bill Signals Crypto Is Headed for a Clash With National Security Interests,"The anti-money-laundering bill sponsored by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) purports to close loopholes in the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for illicit activity that even the Biden administration agrees is small. But the ill-conceived bill is a useful harbinger for the crypto community of a coming conflict between the community’s desire for blockchain privacy and law enforcement’s responsibility for national security.  Warren recently said she was leading an “anti-crypto army,” and her misguided Digital Asset Money Laundering Act tars and feathers cryptocurrencies by unfairly tying them to illegal activities. The reality is that even the Biden administration agrees that illicit crypto use is small – see the recent U.S. Treasury report on “Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Decentralized Finance,” which found that “illicit activity is a subset of overall activity within the DeFi space.”  Chris Grieco is general counsel at Rain Cards, and a national security fellow at the National Security Institute at George Mason University. He previously worked in the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel’s Office and for the House Judiciary Committee.  The unspoken secret among law enforcement and national security personnel is that they love crypto in its current form. Instead of trying to trace piles of cash, or requesting documents from a traditional financial institution, the blockchain is open for all to follow. Move money from one crypto wallet to the next and it's all traceable and “on-chain.” This is especially true with advanced tracing tools that law enforcement and others are increasingly using such as those at TRM Labs or Chainalysis.  Law enforcement’s posture is likely to change in the near future as private blockchains make tracking and tracing near impossible. Blockchain technologies are evolving and as more use cases emerge the need for financial privacy on the blockchain continues to grow. Americans expect a degree of financial privacy unknown in other parts of the world, with law enforcement requiring various degrees of due process in order to access financial information. This is true even with the generous loopholes of the third-party doctrine, and the modicum of privacy for transactions under $10,000 afforded by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). As recent outcries against a potential Federal Reserve-led central bank digital currency have shown, Americans expect to be able to conduct their financial affairs outside the oversight or permission of the government.  As the blockchain becomes a more widely used technology, people are demanding a greater degree of privacy for their transactions. You wouldn’t put your credit card purchases on your Instagram page, and the same logic goes for digital assets. You wouldn’t let the world know what you bought with your crypto wallet if given the option between an open blockchain and a private blockchain. Promising startups companies such as Zcash and Aleo blockchain are building privacy-enhancing features into their offerings – allowing anonymity for blockchain transactions.  But in a world where the blockchain transactions are truly untraceable, the significant anti-money laundering (AML) rules and regulations built up since the 1970s, and the expanded anti-terrorist financing (CFT, or countering the financing of terrorism) processes put in place since the 2000s, may become toothless. The status quo among crypto, law-enforcement and national-security communities will turn into open conflict.  There are inklings that law enforcement is worried about this, but the true reckoning has not yet come. Late last year, the Biden administration sanctioned Tornado Cash, a blockchain mixer which at the most pessimistic view, allowed users to “wash” their crypto with others and withdraw “clean” near-untraceable crypto. The legality of the Treasury Department sanctioning a permissionless computer program is a question left for another day. Astute observers have noted that the Tornado Cash sanctions were much more about fighting the Lazarus Group, the notorious North Korean hacking group who were reportedly frequent users of Tornado Cash, rather than a concerted attack on crypto protocols or the average user. That’s little consolation to Tornado Cash users who can no longer access their money because the Treasury Department has deemed it “tainted” by having gone through the Tornado mixer and require an OFAC license to continue to use the asset. And there are plenty of Web3 developers who saw the Tornado cash enforcement as a direct attack on their work, especially as one of the Tornado Cash developers spent nine months in a Dutch jail and is currently in home detention awaiting trial.  Future privacy-focused blockchain technologies will make privacy the starting point rather than the exception. If everyday purchases are locked behind a cryptographically protected, unbreakable privacy barrier, so too will illicit purchases, terrorist funding and the myriad of dark money supported actors that crypto pessimists like Senator Warren have claimed from the start are the only real use cases for crypto. While this might terrify enforcers who have grown accustomed to having access to traceable blockchain transactions, and have already gone to war with tech companies over warrant-proof encryption, blockchain advocates rightly point out that cash and fiat transactions still have a much higher percentage of illicit transactions than crypto does. Even if this was not the case, Americans still have financial privacy rights that supersede any financial surveillance regime.  The Treasury Department’s actions against Tornado Cash show the coming clash between everyday crypto users and the financial-sanctions apparatus, a problem highlighted but not fully comprehended in the report on ”Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Decentralized Finance.” In it, the agency notes that “[s]everal virtual-asset industry participants are exploring measures to increase privacy for virtual-asset transactions … [w]hile the U.S. government supports privacy-enhancing technologies that simultaneously allow for or even promote compliance with AML/CFT obligations, the use of non-public blockchains by entities that do not comply with AML/CFT obligations or services that may fall outside current regulations will heighten AML/CFT risks.” But the Treasury Department fails to comprehend that many privacy focused blockchains may fall outside of existing legal authorities for AML/CFT, and extending those rules to privacy-focused blockchains may be technologically difficult, and legally problematic given various constitutional protections.  This coming conflict between on-chain privacy and financial surveillance won’t be easy to solve. Most of the rules and regulations for AML/CFT are built on obligations of centralized intermediaries such as banks and financial institutions. But crypto reduces or completely obviates the need for most financial intermediaries, and requiring a borderless, permissionless and immutable computer program such as a blockchain to follow country-specific laws will present a difficult challenge for global financial enforcers, not just American bureaucrats.  AML and CFT enforcers have become significantly better at international coordination and cooperation in recent years, with the U.S.largely leading the way. But expanded enforcement against privacy focused blockchain technologies is likely to run headfirst into U.S. constitutional objections and further strain the existing legal underpinnings to various parts of the Bank Secrecy Act and the existing AML/CFT regime. As many have already pointed out, it is difficult if not impossible for decentralized finance protocols to abide by the BSA, a point largely glossed over by the recent Treasury report on the topic.  It may take time, but U.S. constitutional protections are a stronger bulwark against financial surveillance than the guarantees offered in most other countries. Perversely, while the Biden administration continues to push blockchain developers overseas with their muddled enforcement and policy decisions, U.S. constitutional law paired with the lead role of the U.S. in the global banking system and AML enforcement may mean that U.S. enforcers, reined in by constitutional protections, offer the best option for privacy focused blockchain technologies over the long run.  While this fight is still a few years away, should policy such as Warren’s proposed legislation get enacted into law, it may very well be the proverbial straw that breaks the BSA camel’s back by accelerating this clash. Enforcing constitutional guarantees against expanded financial surveillance such as Warren’s, either by existing crypto protocols or future privacy focused blockchains, may ultimately require strategic litigation on the part of industry.  The good news is that Warren’s legislation is unlikely to go anywhere, especially in an increasingly politicized crypto environment. But that does not mean that serious national security thinkers and crypto advocates can ignore this growing issue. Industry must wrestle with the idea that bad actors can and will exploit untraceable blockchains in the future, and must continue to offer solutions that protect privacy and national security interests.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Chris Grieco,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/22/sen-warrens-bill-signals-crypto-is-headed-for-a-clash-with-national-security-interests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca32cfa8033c6e44d6d2a6a98ee9969c68144b59-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Contrary to the customary pattern, these indicators are suggesting that Ether may experience relatively smaller near-term price fluctuations compared to Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. This unexpected reversal has injected a fresh element of anticipation and curiosity among investors, who are now closely monitoring the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.

Narrowing Gap Between Ethereum And Bitcoin Volatility The T3 Ether Volatility Index, an innovative tool, lies at the core of this phenomenon. It has emerged as an indispensable barometer for assessing and foreseeing price volatility in the Ether market. The data compiled by Bloomberg reveals that the difference in volatility between Ether and Bitcoin, as measured by the 180-day realized or historical volatility, is currently at its smallest since 2020. Furthermore, this difference is only marginally positive, indicating a remarkably close alignment between the volatility of Ether and Bitcoin. The Ether Volatility Index. Source: T3 Index. Caroline Mauron, co-founder of crypto derivatives platform OrBit Markets, told the publication: “Lower volatility typically helps institutional investors to allocate more capital to crypto, as it becomes cheaper to buy protection and manage exposures… the volatility spread compression may drive more exposure to Ether from long-term investors.” Implications Of Ethereum Price Fluctuation The changing flux of Ether’s volatility behavior have significant implications. Notably, the Bitcoin and Ether implied volatility indexes, which rely on options pricing, have experienced declines after reaching recent highs in March. However, Ether’s implied volatility has decreased at a faster pace. Additionally, a broader measurement of cross-asset fluctuations in global markets has also witnessed a decline. The implications of Ether’s changing volatility behavior are multifaceted. The faster decline in Ether’s implied volatility suggests that market participants have become less uncertain or less anxious about the future price movements of Ether compared to Bitcoin. This could be influenced by various factors such as regulatory developments, market maturity, or growing investor confidence in Ether’s long-term potential. ETHUSD trading at $1,812.

This could impact investment decisions and trading strategies, as market participants may adjust their risk management approaches and allocation of resources based on the evolving volatility landscape.

The startup is looking to use the proceeds from the funding towards expanding its product offerings. “The funding will go towards expanding the Sort team, advancing the platform’s product suite, and expediting the launch of ‘Sort applications’, the full-stack for writing a UI for a blockchain contract.” according to a press release.  Despite a harsh crypto winter, Web3 applications developers remained resilient and continued to build in the ecosystem. Most recent study done by Web3 developer back end company Alchemy showed that during the first quarter of this year, developers installed an average of 1.9 million Ethereum software development kits (SDK) per week, a 47% increase year over year. Meanwhile, 788% more wallet SDKs were deployed since the first quarter of 2022, an all-time high for installing wallet infrastructure.  Sort currently has over 150 free users and a small handful of paying customers ahead of their official launch. The Chillennials NFT project, for example, uses Sort to power their leaderboard. “Sort makes it simple to create websites/front-ends for blockchain applications,” said co-founder Jason Zucchetto via email.  Developers would start with a contract address and will get access to a complete developer toolkit from Sort, Zucchetto said, noting that it also has a component on the platform to help React developers to start building web applications.  React is an open-source JavaScript library and developers use it to design and create JavaScript-based apps.  “Once the contract is paid for on Sort (and it is sponsored), it is available for anyone to use for free,” Zucchetto said.  “The developer of the contract gets two large benefits: Sort is the backend (no need to manage any infrastructure/servers) and they can go to their community/discord/twitter and say build applications on Sort for free when using contract,” he noted.  The seed funding round also included participation from Alliance DAO, Punk DAO, Orange DAO, Blizzard Fund, Parasol, Red Rooster Ventures, and a number of angels from Coinbase, Gemini, and Snyk.

12849146,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534417,1684765840,Chainlink (LINK) Price Defies Bearish Pressure With Strong Recovery,"The bearish pressure in Chainlink (LINK) since April 19, 2023, seems to have ended recently. Notably, the asset dropped from $8.57 to a low of $6.37, representing a dip of 25.67% between April and May 11. However, a strong recovery in the LINK market started on May 12 till date. On May 21, 2023, the coin rose to a local high of $6.782, changing the trend to favor the bulls. As the bulls take back control of the market, the price of LINK has increased significantly, giving the investors/traders hope and creating positive sentiment. Bulls Build Strong Momentum Chainlink (LINK) is a leading cryptocurrency that connects smart contracts with real-world data. LINK has demonstrated exceptional performance in the crypto industry, boosting its market capitalization significantly. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH The price of Chainlink is $6.48 today, May 22, 2023, with an estimated market cap of $3.35 Billion. LINK’s 24-hour trading volume is up within the last 24 hours by 80.93%, indicating high trading activity in the market. Currently, Chainlink’s Fear & Greed Index is 76% at Extreme Greed, suggesting that the market sentiment is leaning toward more buying sentiment. This means that investors and traders may be more optimistic about the market’s future and are more inclined to take risks. One of the key factors contributing to the bullish sentiment around LINK is the general market sentiment toward cryptocurrency. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates the market still favors the bears. Also, LINK is currently trading below both its 200-Day and 50-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which shows a bearish trend in the market. This also indicates that both long and short-term trends are bearish. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) confirms a strong bullish momentum as its trades above the signal line. Moreover, the histogram validates the bullish sentiment with a positive trading value and bars above zero. LINK oscillates between its direct support and resistance levels of $6.212 and $6.773, respectively. The next significant support level is $5.404, while its next resistance level is $7.5. With added momentum from either side, bulls or bears, LINK may hit these levels soon. Chainlink Whales Are On Accumulating Spree According to the on-chain data, whales are strongly bagging LINK into their purse, despite the last dip in the asset. Data from Santiment shows that the 10,000-10,000,000 key whales are accumulating more coins. This development is encouraging, considering the state of the asset. It might drive up the demand for LINK as investors will be more optimistic. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Juicy Capital Inflows – An Imminent Rebound in Sight? Generally, the number of whales on the LINK network has been on the rise since 2020. Despite the bear market, the number of whales who stayed with LINK never dropped a bit.

42410691,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgBFR,1684764000,SuperRare's Latest NYC Gallery Pop-Up Will Bring Human Connection Back to NFT Art,"Curated NFT marketplace SuperRare is taking over the 0x.17 gallery in New York for a two-month exhibition, punctuating the importance of bringing non-fungible token (NFT) artwork into immersive, physical spaces.  The pop-up at 0x.17, a community-focused NFT gallery in the historic South Street Seaport neighborhood, will feature a curated program of works from over 20 SuperRare artists. The gallery will open on June 1 with a solo show from AI artist Claire Silver titled ""Artifacts.""  ""The exhibition showcases seven artworks based on different philosophies and questions about our future with AI taking the form of seven different mediums: video, generative, still, poetry, music, 3D and an avatar with an AI voice,"" SuperRare said in a press release.  Silver told CoinDesk that AI art is carving out its own space in the evolving world of NFT art.  ""There are entire movements happening in this space and within crypto art,"" she explained. ""They've got their own formative artists and they live in the digital world. And we're only going to spend more time in the digital worlds, in our lives and in the next generations to come, and AI will accelerate that.""  Restoring human connection  SuperRare debuted its first pop-up gallery in May 2022 in New York's SoHo neighborhood. Founder John Crain told CoinDesk that bringing NFT art into shared physical spaces helps to ""humanize"" the experience.  ""As exciting as digital art is – and NFTs have facilitated this kind of this revolution and resurgence in art – art is really about human connection and storytelling at the end of the day,"" he said. ""You just can't replicate that yet in a digital environment.""  The upcoming exhibition will be an evolution of last year's more traditional, minimalist gallery event, and will be designed to encourage conversation and interaction between attendees.  ""This time we thought more about 'where are we going to facilitate conversation?' and 'what are people going to be doing?' and just making it a bit more of a comfortable place to hang out,"" he said. ""A gallery or museum can feel a bit academic and sterile, and that's not necessarily where you're having a deep conversation.""  Crain stressed the importance of bringing digital art out from the confines of a computer and into physical spaces, where people from across the traditional and crypto spaces can come together.  ""We're still educating people as to why this is interesting and a legitimate medium for art,"" he said. ""These are humans in real life, and the context for art is super important.""  Since Silver began working with AI, she has often combined physical art with digital mediums. Some of her earlier work involved creating acrylic abstract paintings and collecting the ""skins,"" or dried paint not on a canvas, and collaging it onto AI portraits. A piece titled ""a feeling i can't put my finger on,"" minted upon request for pseudonymous art collector Cozomo de' Medici, was created in this way and was recently donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).  ""Art is an emotional experience, but it's also a sensory one, right? And so a lot of people struggle with the concept of digital art without a physical counterpart,"" she said.  Silver's work, along with the work of many other NFT artists, has been brought to life through museum exhibitions, gallery showings and live multimedia experiences. And as NFT art continues to make its way into more traditional spaces, Silver hopes that dismissive attitudes toward crypto art will continue to shift.  ""I hope that the traditional collectors in the traditional art world who maybe don't see the value proposition in digital art and NFTs – I hope that they think of them as artifacts, or like cave paintings of a digital age that we're going to come into,"" she said. ""And they can think of themselves as collectors of history as well as art history.""

As market participants remain wary of their investment options, the likes of PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE have continued to decline, signaling an end to the short meme coin bull run experienced in April. Meme Coin Momentum Slows Significantly Meme coins have been one of the hardest hit presently as both large and small meme coins have been on a decline. For example, PEPE, a meme coin that rose into prominence in April, has lost over 60% of its early May all-time high value and is still recording losses of 7.5% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Decentraland (MANA) Leads Crypto Market Gains, Here’s Why Likewise, Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin in the space has not had it easy as well. The digital asset is still holding on to its support above the $0.07 but bears continue to threaten its ability to recover. Just like PEPE, DOGE is seeing a decline in the last day, albeit to a lesser degree, with 1.8% losses during this time period. Next on this list is SHIB which is currently the only one of the top meme coins that are recording some semblance of gains. But even its gains so far have been meager and losses are the order of the day on the larger 7-day scale. SHIB is still below its critical $0.000009 resistance but has risen 1.7% in the last day. Others such as Baby Doge Coin and Floki are seeing losses in the 24-hour and 7-day charts as well.

Crypto Betting A How-To-Guide Betting with crypto has gained popularity due to its simplicity and many other advantages. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to get started with crypto at betting sites: Start by selecting a recommended crypto betting site that supports your preferred currency. Look for platforms with positive reviews, strong security measures, and a wide range of sports betting options. Once you’ve chosen crypto betting sites, create an account by providing the necessary information. This usually involves creating a username, password, and entering your email address. Some sports betting sites may require additional steps for verification, such as email verification or providing proof of identity. Follow the instructions provided by the platform to complete the registration process. After creating an account, it’s time to deposit funds into your betting site account. Most crypto sportsbook sites provide a unique wallet address for each supported currency. Copy the provided wallet address and use it to send the desired amount of cryptocurrency from your personal wallet. At this stage, make sure to claim the welcome package or bitcoin casino bonus that the site offers new players. Check the terms and requirements for the bonus and see if any bonus code is needed before accepting the reward. Explore the sports and events offered by the crypto sportsbooks. The best online sports betting sites cover a wide range of sports, including popular options like football, basketball, baseball, soccer, tennis, and more. Take your time to understand the available markets and options. It is also a plus if the chosen crypto betting site offers casino games. Once you’ve chosen a sport and event, explore the available crypto betting options. This can include traditional options like moneyline bets, point spreads, and over/under bets, as well as more specific bets like prop bets and parlays. Assess the odds and consider different strategies before making your selections. After selecting your preferred crypto betting options, determine the amount you wish to wager. The platform will display the potential payout based on the odds. Double-check your selections and confirm your bet. If you win on your bet or wish to withdraw funds for other purposes, you can initiate a withdrawal from your account. Follow the withdrawal process provided by the gambling site, which typically involves entering the desired amount and confirming the transaction. The funds will be transferred to your personal wallet. Remember to practice responsible gambling. Set limits on your sports betting activities, never wager more than you can afford to lose, and take breaks when needed. Gambling should be an enjoyable activity, so always prioritize responsible behavior. Popularity Of Betting With Crypto Betting on sports has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. And the integration of cryptocurrencies has opened up new possibilities and advantages for both sports enthusiasts and online gambling sites. Here are some key factors that have contributed to this growth: Faster Transactions Cryptocurrencies offer faster transaction speeds compared to traditional banking methods. With near-instantaneous transfers, users can deposit and withdraw funds quickly, allowing for a seamless betting experience. Lower Fees Crypto betting sites offer lower fees compared to traditional platforms. This is because cryptocurrencies bypass intermediaries like banks, eliminating additional costs associated with currency conversion or processing fees. Increased Privacy Privacy is a significant concern for many bettors. Cryptocurrencies provide an additional layer of privacy, as transactions can be conducted without revealing personal information. The use of pseudonyms or wallet addresses ensures a certain level of anonymity. Decentralization and Security The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies ensures that betting platforms are not controlled by a single entity, similar to Ethereum casino sites. This reduces the risk of manipulation or unfair practices. Additionally, the implementation of blockchain technology enhances the security and transparency of transactions. Global Accessibility Crypto sportsbook sites offer global accessibility. Bettors from different parts of the world can participate without being hindered by geographical boundaries or currency conversion issues. Growing Popularity of Cryptocurrencies The growing popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies have played a significant role in the expansion of the crypto sports gambling industry. As more individuals embrace cryptocurrencies and seek ways to use them, the demand for crypto, and especially Bitcoin sports betting sites has increased. The combination of these factors has fueled the growth of sports betting sites with crypto. The industry continues to evolve, attracting more users, and integrating advanced features to provide an enhanced experience. With the increasing number of sites launching, the future looks promising for crypto gambling. Advantages Of Crypto Sports Betting There are several distinct advantages of crypto for online sports betting vs. traditional betting methods. Let’s delve deeper into the key differences between the two: Traditional betting often involves cumbersome processes, such as bank transfers or manual payment verifications. In contrast, crypto sports betting sites enables near-instantaneous deposits and withdrawals, allowing for quick and seamless transactions. Traditional betting platforms typically charge higher fees due to various intermediaries involved in the payment process. Cryptocurrencies eliminate many of these intermediaries, resulting in lower fees and better value for bettors. While traditional betting at online casino real money sites may require the disclosure of personal information, a Bitcoin betting site allows for increased privacy. Transactions conducted with cryptocurrencies do not require the disclosure of personal details, ensuring a higher level of anonymity for bettors. Cryptocurrencies utilize advanced encryption techniques and decentralized networks, making them highly secure. Traditional betting platforms often rely on centralized systems that can be susceptible to security breaches. Online betting sites with crypto offer enhanced accessibility, particularly for individuals in regions where traditional betting might be restricted or face legal challenges. With crypto sports betting, anyone with an internet connection can participate, regardless of their geographic location. Traditional betting platforms are subject to strict regulations and licensing requirements. While the cryptocurrency sports betting industry is evolving, it currently operates with varying degrees of regulatory oversight. This can be seen as both an advantage, allowing for more freedom, and a potential concern due to the lack of standardized regulations. It’s important to note that both crypto sports betting and traditional betting have their merits and considerations. Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on individual preferences, the legal landscape in one’s jurisdiction, and the desired features and benefits sought by the bettor.

42410695,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgBSf,1684761840,Bitcoin Pizza Day Turns Sour as Meme Coin Shysters Profit Over $200K in Rug Pulls,"Bitcoin Pizza Day has taken a negative turn, with meme coin issuers profiting over $200,000 from pizza-related rug pulls on the 13th anniversary of what's thought to be the first commercial bitcoin transaction.  According to data from dextool's ""live new pairs"" section, there has been 14 pizza-related meme coins issued in the past 24 hours. Four have been confirmed as rug pulls, or schemes in which money is stolen from investors through any of a number of techniques. And at least five others are suspected of being so-called honey pots, in which an asset can be sold only to the contract creator, and purchasers are left holding tokens they can't get rid of.  Bitcoin Pizza Day is marked on May 22. It dates back to 2010, when computer developer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin.  The first meme coin was pizza coin (PIZZA). It lasted for just eight minutes before developers altered the rate of sell tax so that investors were unable to divest their holdings. A total of 34 traders bought the token with a total loss of 0.9892 ETH ($1,800).  Seemingly unperturbed, investors then flocked to tokens named bitcoin pizza and pizza inu, ending up with losses of more than $12,000 in total.  Ethpizza and bpizza followed, with the former reaching a $40,000 market cap and the latter soaring to more than $100,000. Both tokens became unsellable after the contract owner paused transfer and sales.  There are multiple ways in which developers can ""pull the rug"" on projects, one of which is by adding a modifiable sell tax to the smart contract. That gives the contract owner the ability to raise the tax so high that it makes the tokens unsellable. An alternative – and more common – approach is for a smart contract owner to hold the vast majority of a token, waiting for the price to rise before selling the token into freshly formed liquidity from unsuspecting investors.  The appetite for investors to buy the tokens, all of which have no fundamental value, spawned out of the recent ""meme coin mania"" following pepe's momentous rise to a $1 billion market cap. Investors seem to be hoping to catch the next hype-fueled token in a market that has unlimited downside risk.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/22/bitcoin-pizza-day-turns-sour-as-meme-coin-shysters-profit-over-200k-in-rug-pulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3ad265239e3771842d7ac63fef6e032d3001e2d-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410692,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgBIk,1684761564,"U.S. Debt Deal Could Weigh On Bitcoin Price, Some Say","As the deadlock in negotiations to raise the U.S. government's $31.4 trillion debt limit keeps markets tentative, some analysts have gone against consensus, warning that a potential deal may bring pain to the crypto market.  The U.S. reached its statutory debt limit of $31.4 trillion on Jan. 19., pressing the Treasury to implement extraordinary measures and run down its Treasury General Account (TGA) balance to keep the government functioning. That ensured assets like bitcoin, which are sensitive to swings in the U.S. dollar liquidity, remained bid amid fears of government default and the Federal Reserve's continued rate hikes.  The TGA balance has declined from roughly $500 billion at the start of February to $68 billion last week, according to MacroMicro. Per Goldman Sachs, Treasury's cash balance will likely dip to the minimum required $30 billion in early June, which means a debt deal needs to be reached by around that point to avoid a what some believe would be a catastrophic default.  It also means that once the debt limit is raised, the Treasury will look to build back its cash balance by issuing government bonds. That may suck out liquidity from the system and put upward pressure on bond yields as increased issuance would tend to push prices down and lift yields. Bitcoin (BTC) is known to move in the opposite direction of bond yields.  Thus, while a potential deal might eliminate major economic uncertainty, assets like bitcoin that have no linkages to the real economy and are heavily dependent on fiat liquidity could, in fact, suffer.  ""The issuance of debt to top up coffers will have the opposite effect – money will move out of cash and risk assets into U.S. government bonds, especially as yields on these instruments rise to offset the increase in supply,"" Noelle Acheson, former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading and the author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in the weekend edition of her newsletter.  ""This could be bad for bitcoin and gold, which in theory fall in price when yields are rising (high yield environments tend to not be great for assets that yield nothing),"" she added. ""What's more, the issuance of more U.S. government debt would increase public spending, which would be good for the economy, further delaying the likelihood of rate cuts.""  Market consensus so far has been that a default would lead to panic selling and a global dash for cash, similar to the one seen during the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020 when bitcoin tanked by over 50%. Meanwhile, a debt deal is expected to fuel risk-on action.  Per some observers, bitcoin drew haven bids during the March banking crisis, although other rate-sensitive assets like tech stocks also performed well as traders priced in an early Fed pivot toward rate cuts. In other words, bitcoin remains a largely liquidity-sensitive risk asset.  Taking issue with that outlook is Satyakam Gautam, rates trader at India-based ICICI Bank, who expects the Treasury will likely issue $700 billion of bonds in the next couple of months, leading to massive risk aversion.  ""What it implies is a lack of USD funding in the immediate short term post the successful ceiling negotiation, if any. Corporate bonds markets, as well as private credit, will find it hard to roll over existing maturities and this will lead to a real crash in either commercial real estate assets funding or plain junk bond issuers. This might be the real deal crash which the U.S. rate markets have been elusively looking for,"" Gautam said in a LinkedIn post.  ""There might be then a secular fall in long-end rates as well as massive steepening in U.S. rates. This should augur well for risk haven [forex] like JPY & CHF,"" Gautam added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/22/us-debt-deal-may-weigh-over-bitcoin-observers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9b201767f37c2f9a52435875f1d11e45bb440b5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Shiba Inu community has burnt over 410.6 billion SHIB, with over 574.30 trillion still in circulation. A Twitter user, SHIB INFORMER, notably posted a snapshot of a proposed token burn mechanism on Shibarium. According to SHIB INFORMER, the Shibarium burns will focus on transactions and regulating the excess supply of tokens in the community through a burning mechanism to boost the value of SHIB tokens. The Shibarium upgrade is a layer-2 (L2) solution built on the Ethereum network for Shiba Inu. It seeks to transform Shiba Inu from a meme coin to a functional ecosystem.

SHIB Price Action SHIB is experiencing volatility today as it seeks to recover from the recent price drop in May, leading to a death cross on May 10, 2023. However, the bears are active in the market, keeping its price down. As such, SHIB is still trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA).

Yves La Rose said legal action is one of two possible ways to hold B1 to account for not investing the $1 billion it promised during the network's initial coin offering (ICO) in January 2018. The other option is a hard fork to exclude EOS tokens held by B1 to fully disassociate itself from its former backer.  ""As a result of B1’s broken promises, the EOS Network is under-capitalized and the development of the EOS Network has been significantly stunted,"" La Rose wrote in a letter dated May 20.  EOS token holders purchased their tokens ""relying on representations of ongoing investment in the EOS ecosystem,"" which never came leading one to conclusion that B1 never intended to make the promised investments, according to La Rose.  ""If enough token holders are interested in making a legal claim, a class action lawsuit is a possibility. The EOS Network Foundation is prepared to assist in bringing EOS token holders together for the purpose of advancing a claim against B1,"" he wrote.  The EOS token is currently trading at $0.85 having slumped by 32% since April 14, it dropped by a further 2.5% over the past-24 hours, according to TradingView data.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin and stocks started the week on a hesitant note as uncertainty in markets continued. Bitcoin dropped back below $27,000 on Saturday and is down slightly over the last 24-hours at $26,800. This comes as U.S. President Joe Biden and House Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy will meet to discuss the debt ceiling on Monday. Some altcoins rose on Monday, among them Tron’s TRX, gaining 8% on the day as a rumor circulated on Twitter that Tron will become legal tender in Hong Kong on June 1.  Digital Currency Group (DCG) missed a $630 million payment owed to Gemini last week, according to crypto exchange Gemini. Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss had previously threatened to sue DCG CEO Barry Silbert and DCG over the repayment of a $900 million loanafter Genesis, a DCG entity, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accused both firms of selling unregistered securities through their Earn program. Both Genesis and CoinDesk are owned by DCG. Gemini and other parties are proposing an amended reorganization plan with Genesis that doesn't require DCG's approval, Gemini said in an update on its site.  The Securities Commission Malaysia ordered Huobi Global to stop operations in the country – including disabling its website and mobile applications – because it is operating a digital asset exchange without registration. The regulator told the company to cease circulating, publishing or sending advertisements to Malaysian investors, according to a Monday announcement. Operating a digital asset exchange without obtaining registration from the Securities Commission as a Recognised Market Operator is an offense under the Capital Markets and Services Act.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily changes in bitcoin supply controlled by wallets holding coins for at least a year and the cryptocurrency's price since June 2022.  The balance held by the so-called long-term investors is fast approaching a record high of 13.2 million BTC.  Per blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock, the continued accumulation reflects unwavering conviction in the cryptocurrency's prospects.

12846692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534353,1684756810,"Bitcoin Volatility Shrinks To Historical Levels, Violent Move Incoming?","Data shows that Bitcoin volatility is currently at historically low levels, something that has led to violent price moves in the past. Bitcoin 7-Day Range Has Compressed To Just 3.4% Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnsode, the current 7-day price range is comparable to levels seen back in January of this year. The “7-day price range” of Bitcoin here refers to the percentage difference between the highest and the lowest points that the asset’s value has observed during the last seven days. This metric can provide hints about the recent volatility that the cryptocurrency has experienced. When the indicator has a low value, it means the price action during the last week has been quite stale. Naturally, this suggests that the volatility of the asset is low right now. On the other hand, high values of the 7-day price range imply the coin has seen a high degree of fluctuation within the past seven days, and hence, the volatility has been high. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin 7-day price range (as well as the 7-day high and low) over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been quite low in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin 7-day price range had naturally succumbed to quite low values during the bear market lows that had followed the FTX crash, as the BTC price had been stuck in a sideways movement. These low values of the indicator continued into the new year as the coin refused to show any significant movement. Soon after, however, the metric’s value had seen an explosion as the rally had begun to take place. In the next few months, the 7-day price range of the cryptocurrency had assumed relatively high values, but recently, the indicator has observed another plummet. The reason behind this new plunge has naturally been the narrow consolidation range that the asset has followed in the past week between the $27,400 and $26,500 levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges Below $27,000 As Miners Show Signs Of Selling Because of this low volatility, the 7-day price range of Bitcoin has collapsed to only 3.4%. In the chart, Glassnode has also highlighted the previous instances where the cryptocurrency had seen this metric drop so low. It looks like the indicator dipped to similar levels way back in July 2020, and the aforementioned lows from the start of the year had also observed the indicator attain such values. An interesting thing to note about both these periods of low volatility is that the price had gone on to see rapid price action not too long after they occurred, and the former low was followed by the 2021 bull run, while the ongoing rally succeeded the latter one.

The integration will allow users to connect their credit card to Apple Pay and purchase non-fungible token (NFT) sneakers necessary for gameplay. With Apple Pay as a fiat payment method, users will no longer have to connect a crypto wallet to purchase in-game assets – a step that can hinder new players from joining its ecosystem.  Shiti Manghani, chief operating officer of STEPN told CoinDesk that incorporating a fiat onramp like Apple Pay – a technology native to iOS users – will help onboard the next 100 million users to Web3. STEPN says it is the first blockchain gaming app to secure Apple Pay integration.  “It's very prestigious, and a privilege, to be able to be approved by Apple for this kind of integration…These big platforms give us exposure to bigger audiences,” said Manghani. “Our attempt always has been to diversify and expose both the app as well as Web3, and the benefits that it can bring to an audience that is not limited just to within the Web3 community.”  According to data platform Dune Analytics, while STEPN quickly scaled to over 700,000 monthly active users in May 2022, it has since declined to about 23,000. Jerry Huang, co-founder of Find Satoshi Labs (FSL), the company behind STEPN, said in a press release that using a hybrid of Web2 and Web3 technologies is a helpful avenue for onboarding more users to the ecosystem.  “With this Apple Pay integration we are making the user journey much more seamless, removing barriers to entry for all who want to move-to-earn, and ensuring that the Web3 space reaches a level of maturity it requires in order to go mainstream,” said Huang.  In November, Find Satoshi Labs rolled out its native NFT marketplace MOOAR to allow users to purchase in-game assets natively within the application. In July 2022, STEPN reported $123 million in Q2 profits ahead of the crypto winter onset.

Despite the hopeful anticipation of a bullish reversal, the lack of trading volume acted as a hindrance, dampening the prospects for an upward breakthrough. As SHIB enthusiasts anxiously awaited a potential turnaround, the resistance level posed a formidable challenge, emphasizing the need for increased market participation to fuel a successful climb. Amidst the hurdles of resistance and wavering market conditions, the question arises: Will Shiba Inu defy the odds and make a decent recovery? Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Shiba Inu Struggles To Break Resistance As Bearish Sentiment Prevails Since May 6, SHIB has been locked below the crucial resistance level of $0.00000980, creating a stagnant trading environment. Surprisingly, sellers have been unable to drive prices any lower, while the bulls have failed to mount a significant rally. When compared to the gains made by market leaders in cryptocurrency like Ethereum and Bitcoin during the same time period, Shiba Inu is down by more than 40% from its February high. As of the latest update, the SHIB token is currently valued at a mere $0.00000855 via CoinGecko, highlighting its status as a micro-investment opportunity. Unfortunately, over the past 24 hours, SHIB has experienced a moderate decline of 2.8%, raising concerns about its short-term prospects. This downtrend has persisted for a week, resulting in a 2.2% overall decline. Nevertheless, there are signs that the bearish dominance may be losing its grip as the price approaches a crucial support level at $0.00000807. This presents a potential opportunity for the bulls to stage a comeback and regain control over the market sentiment. Investors and traders eagerly watch this key support level to gauge the next potential move for the Shiba Inu token. Lack Of Volume: A Major Hurdle For SHIB’s Bullish Reversal The potential for a bullish reversal in the Shiba Inu token hinges on one crucial factor: increased trading volume. Without a significant surge in trading activity, SHIB struggles to gain the momentum necessary for a bullish turnaround. Traders and investors keenly await a boost in volume as it could potentially signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially propelling SHIB towards its near-term target of $0.00000980. SHIB market cap at $5.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Juicy Capital Inflows – An Imminent Rebound in Sight? Competing Meme Coins Stealing The Spotlight Adding to the challenges faced by SHIB’s bullish reversal aspirations is the growing trend of market speculators gravitating toward newer meme-based tokens. Memes have become a prominent theme within the cryptocurrency space, with tokens like Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) gaining considerable attention and attracting a significant portion of market participants. The allure of these alternative meme tokens diverts attention and investment away from SHIB, making it more difficult for the token to gather the necessary support and volume to initiate a bullish upswing. While the current market conditions present challenges, SHIB enthusiasts remain hopeful for a surge in volume and renewed investor interest that could ignite a much-awaited rally. -Featured image from Shibainu.berry Instagram/BuzzFeed",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-struggles-to-initiate-a-breakout/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Bug On Aave v2 On Polygon The bug affecting withdrawals from Aave v2 deployed on Polygon, an Ethereum side-chain, has been pinned to the recent implementation of “proposal 224”. Proposal 224 sought to make parameter changes “for the benefit of the protocol” in light of “shifts in the crypto market .” The adjustment received majority support and was implemented. However, after the execution, the DeFi protocol was notified of several issues affecting the interest rate strategy contracts applied to the wrapped versions of Bitcoin, Ethereum, MATIC—the native currency of Polygon, and USDT—the world’s most liquid stablecoin. Related Reading: Gas Crisis Averted: NFT Marketplaces Witness Dramatic Reduction in Ethereum Fees The development team has said the root cause was because the updated version, especially relating to the “LendingPool to call the rate strategy of an asset” applied on Polygon, was slightly different from that integrated with Ethereum. While users can’t withdraw assets, the DeFi protocol emphasizes that all funds are safe. Beyond the explainer released by Aave, analysts pin the specific problem on the incompatibility issue between the ReserveInterestRateStrategy contract and the underlying Polygon network. Since the contract was designed to work specifically on Ethereum, as Aave mentioned, it couldn’t work on Polygon, causing it to fail. Subsequently, users couldn’t withdraw their tokens. Compatibility Problems The ReserveInterestRateStrategy contract is a core contract in Aave that helps calculate and apply interest rates to borrowed loans. To correctly function, the autonomous contract factors in several things, including prevailing market forces, the risk of user defaulting, and the collateralization ratio. In Aave, all loans are overcollateralized, meaning a borrower must commit more collateral than the amount they wish to borrow. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Remains Range Bound As Bulls Await The Next Major Move The Aave team plans to fix the bug, subject to the result of the ongoing vote. Though the community wants the problem to be fixed, affected users will only begin withdrawing assets from Aave v2 later this week. Considering governance times, if approved, the fix will be applied in approximately seven days from now: 1 day of delay to start voting, three days of voting, one day of time lock on Ethereum, and two extra days of time lock on Polygon. Despite the flaw, AAVE prices are stable. However, since the problem was first brought to light on May 19, the token has been lower but inside the bull bar of May 17. It is yet to be seen how prices will react in the course of the week. Presently, the token is down 25% from April 2023 and remains in a bearish formation.

This prolonged period of stagnation has prompted Michael J. Kramer, a renowned market strategist, to voice his apprehensions about an impending market breakdown for Bitcoin. Taking to Twitter, Kramer shared his concerns, highlighting the potential risks and uncertainties surrounding the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory. As the cryptocurrency’s value remains inert, it is crucial to examine the factors contributing to this situation and delve into its implications for investors and the broader crypto landscape. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Bitcoin Price: Concerns Arise Over Potential Slide Below $20K As the cryptocurrency market faces another bout of turbulence, Bitcoin’s price has faltered, with the current value pegged at $26,863, according to CoinGecko. The crypto has lost 2.1% of its value in the last seven days. In his analysis, Kramer not only highlights the potential for Bitcoin to reach the critical psychological level of $20,000 but also draws attention to the implications such a downturn may have on the broader stock market. Source: Coingecko Bitcoin serves as a barometer for other risk assets, providing valuable insights into market sentiment. Should Bitcoin experience a substantial slide below the $20,000 threshold, it could signal increased risk aversion among investors, potentially dampening confidence in the stock market and other asset classes. Regulatory Uncertainty Casts Dark Clouds For Bitcoin Just as analysts eagerly anticipated a potential breakout in Bitcoin’s price, the cryptocurrency market took an unexpected turn, descending into a period of decline fueled by heightened regulatory uncertainty. Despite initial optimism, the prevailing macroeconomic climate and regulatory challenges have conspired to dampen the prospects of a significant price surge in the near term. Analysts had speculated that Bitcoin could experience an influx of investment if the United States were to default on its debt obligations. However, this potential scenario carries substantial risk, as there is a real possibility that the US Treasury may face a shortage of funds. The implications of such a liquidity crunch could be felt across the crypto space, impacting the overall demand and sentiment for digital assets. BTCUSD still stuck in the $26K territory.

The Bank of England and the U.K. Treasury are seeking public feedback on their plans for the design of a digital pound – something officials say is likely to be needed in the future.  Although the government is unlikely to make a decision on issuing one for at least the next couple of years, should the country decide to have a central bank digital currency (CBDC), new legislation will be needed to lay out the characteristics of a digital pound and current data, privacy and anti-money laundering rules should be amended to accommodate such a currency, two lawyers told CoinDesk.  “There's no such thing in this country as a central bank digital currency, so they would need to create new legislation around what that would look like and that's part of the consultation process,” Louise Abbott, partner at U.K.-based Keystone Law, told CoinDesk in an interview. George Morris, partner at Simmons & Simmons echoed Abbott’s comments.  The U.K.’s neighbor, the European Union, is looking to publish a bill setting out what a digital euro will look like this year. This will tackle the finer points of digital euro applications and the technology that will support one.  While the EU has chosen to create new regulatory regimes to address crypto assets or even a digital euro, the U.K. has so far tried to accomplish similar goals by extending existing frameworks to cover digital assets, so will likely take a similar approach with the digital pound.  Read more: UK Crypto Rules Set a Modest Post-Brexit Divergence From the European Union  The Treasury and Bank of England are moving to phase two of their digital pound work, where they will develop the model of the digital pound in both policy and technology terms, the consultation said.  The legal framework for a digital pound would also need to cover ownership issues and security Abbott said.  “There is also the question of the property law status of token-based CBDC – for example it will be extremely important to determine whether such CBDC can be lent by its owner to a commercial bank … can a CBDC token be deposited into a bank account, and who owns that?” Abbott said.  Read more: How Crypto Might Shake Up England’s Ancient Property Laws  Not all legislation for a digital pound would need to be completely brand new, but some issues just have no analog in existing law, Abbott said.  “All financial laws will need amending to reflect whether it applies to the CBDC,” Abbott said.  The consultation set out that basic access to the digital pound wallet with limited verification checks can be consistent with existing U.K. anti-money laundering rules and payments regulations, which include protections for customers that can prevent financial losses from companies failing to make payments.  The U.K. has privacy and data laws which may need to be amended for a digital pound, Morris said. How the Treasury plans to ensure privacy and liberty if it issues a digital pound was questioned at the digital pound debate on Feb. 7.  “It is right that we debate the balance between freedoms and our duty to protect citizens from fraud and other things, that this house, from time to time, will decide to justify the piercing of that veil of privacy,” Economic Secretary Andrew Griffith said at the debate in response to questions on the matter.  The U.K. government is planning to rely on private firms to be the digital pound’s wallet providers. The consultation sets out that firms that will offer services via the digital pound will have to comply with data protection laws, which encourages firms to use people's data fairly.  The Data Protection Act 2018 sets out that, for existing commercial bank accounts, law enforcement agencies could access people's personal data on a lawful basis. This is something the consultation said would apply to digital pound wallet providers too, but this could be an issue because with the digital pound it would be easier to track people's financial activities, unlike with physical money, Morris said.  There's going to have to be a lot of thought put into how people's concerns will be satisfied, because it's not enough to just say law enforcement agencies will have access to data when needed, Morris said.  “So the digital Data Protection Act is probably going to become more important,” Morris said. “There might need to be specific amendments made in relation to what the government can or can't do with respect to data relating to the digital pound because only when you start seeing those kinds of specific changes, will you get people comfortable with using it.”",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/22/uk-will-need-new-laws-to-accommodate-future-digital-pound-lawyers-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2b60e5541903b85b0fbe8853f9ad753c871066f-5500x3298.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The range, or the difference between the high and the low reached in the seven days to May 21, was 3.4%. That's one of the narrowest in the past three years and comparable to lackluster trading seen at the start of the year, for a brief moment last month and in July 2020, according to data tracked by analytics firm Glassnode.  ""It is comparable to Jan. 2023, and July 2020, both of which preceded large market moves. This suggests high volatility is likely on the horizon,"" Glassnode tweeted early Monday.  Recently, options-based volatility measures for bitcoin and ether (ETH) also hit record lows.  Narrow trading ranges indicate that neither bullish nor bearish perspectives dominate the price action. That typically happens when markets face competing influences and narratives. While lingering U.S. banking sector issues favor the upside in perceived haven assets like bitcoin, the unresolved deadlock in debt ceiling negotiations and the recovery in the dollar index suggest otherwise.  Eventually, some influences take a back seat, leading to a sharp widening of the trading range or a strong move in either direction. Traders typically set up price-agnostic strategies like straddle and strangles when anticipating an exit from tighter trading ranges.

Paris-based Mangrove has raised about $10 million so far, and is backed by trading and market making powerhouses like Wintermute and Cumberland. A mainnet launch will follow around the start of next month, the company said.  2020’s so-called “summer of DeFi” delivered the realization that anyone could be included in providing liquidity to financial markets, not just big named firms and institutions. However, these original DeFi tools were rather blunt and developers have since been sharpening the infrastructure needed to evolve the space.  Mangrove’s “advanced limit order” innovation means an intention to trade can take the form of a piece of code and function like an IOU, so an offer to sell some ETH at a certain price, for example, can exist on-chain without the need to lock up funds. That allows traders to use those assets elsewhere without canceling the offer and recovering the funds, explained Mangrove co-founder Vincent Danos in an interview with CoinDesk.  “If you declare your trading intention on Mangrove, a market engine will call that piece of code and ascertain whether the liquidity as promised is actually available and deliver it,” Danos said. “If it’s not, then you have to pay a little compensation or penalty, related to the amount of gas the taker incurred triggering a promised trade that you’re not going to fulfill.”  This more flexible version of a limit order allows traders on Mangrove to propose selling some digital assets at a given price, while also depositing those assets as collateral on a lending platform and generating passive yield, for example. “So at the same time, you have a savings account, and can sell at a certain exit price,” Danos said.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/22/dex-mangrove-goes-live-on-polygon-testnet-mainnet-launch-planned-for-june,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f7e0af2f8a3c319ffb09e14440f4a8447453117-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss has threatened to sue DCG CEO Barry Silbert and DCG over the repayment of a $900 million loan after Genesis, a DCG entity, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, amid allegations of mixed funds and ongoing disputes about loan repayments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused both firms of selling unregistered securities through their Earn program.  Both Genesis and CoinDesk are owned by DCG.  While Gemini and DCG are in discussions, if no deal is reached, Gemini and other parties are proposing an amended reorganization plan with Genesis that doesn't require DCG's approval, Gemini said in an update on its site.  “Consideration will be based in part on whether the parties believe DCG will engage in good faith negotiations on a consensual deal,” Gemini wrote.  “DCG continues to be engaged with the various stakeholders in the Genesis Capital restructuring process pursuant to the 30-day mediation period entered into by all parties on May 1,” a DCG spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss has publicly accused DCG CEO Barry Silbert of engaging in “bad faith stall tactics.”  Meanwhile, Gemini is preparing to file a claim seeking the return of over $1.1 billion in digital assets from Genesis for its over 200,000 Earn users.  Late last week, lawyers for Genesis filed a request to the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York for an extension of their time allowed to file a Chapter 11 plan and solicit acceptances.  If the court approves this, they will have until August 27 to file a plan and until Oct. 26 for Gemini to accept it.  According to a January court filing, Genesis owes over $3.5 billion to its top 50 creditors including Gemini, Cumberland, Mirana, MoonAlpha Finance and VanEck’s New Finance Income Fund.  CORRECTION: (May 22, 06:01 UTC): Corrects that payment was owed to Genesis in first paragraph. An earlier version of this story named the creditor as Gemini.

The price is trading below $1,810 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,805 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

Tornadosaurus-Hex said that the attacker is reverting the TORN tokens they gave themself – which gave them a controlling share of the governance votes – back to zero.  Given the attacker's holdings of TORN governance tokens, the proposal looks as though it will pass when voting closes on May 26, though it's unclear when the action will be executed. When the proposal passes, the malicious code that the attacker integrated into the protocol, which allowed them to steal voting power from others, will be removed, and the governance of Tornado Cash's DAO will go back to token holders.  As a result, TORN was up as much as 10%, according to CoinGecko data, before settling back down.  0xdeadf4ce, an active member of the TORN community, pointed out that this might all be a “gigatroll” to depress the price of the token to increase their holdings at a discount.  “We don’t even have a choice in regards to this proposal, but it is still important nonetheless,” Tornadosaurus-Hex added.

Is The Number Of Bitcoin Wholecoiners Peaking? Her question is when the number of wholecoiners, or individuals holding at least 1 BTC, soared above the 1 million mark last week. While the rising number of wholecoiners points to possible adoption and rising BTC demand over time, market forces could end up capping their numbers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges Below $27,000 As Miners Show Signs Of Selling She reckons that as Bitcoin prices increase, it would be more expensive for a would-be wholecoiner to purchase the asset. Therefore, based on these factors, it may be unlikely that there will be 10 million in the coming years. ARE WE AT PEAK WHOLE-COINERS in #bitcoin asks @adam3us? 1M whole-coiners today. Probably couldn’t reach 10M whole-coiners ever tho, bc bitcoin’s price would be bid up too high to reach that given the 21M supply cap… pic.twitter.com/vzRvv2vyAW — Caitlin Long 🔑⚡️🟠 (@CaitlinLong_) May 20, 2023 On May 13, Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, revealed that the number of addresses managing at least 1 BTC had broken above the 1 million mark and continues to steadily grow. This upward trend has remained consistent, weathering the impact of the crypto winter which saw BTC prices crumble from over $69,000 registered in November 2021 to less than $16,000 in Q4 2022. Despite this impressive trend, Long and Adam’s observations may cast doubt on whether this could continue in the long haul, pushing the number of wholecoiners to double digits. By design, Bitcoin is deflationary and there will be 21 million BTC to ever circulate. As inflation also reduces due to BTC halving roughly every four years, coin holders expect BTC prices to gradually increase over the years. Based on historical performance and increasing crypto adoption, market forces could drive BTC prices higher, making it challenging for more users to own 1 BTC currently trading at over $26,900 as on May 21. Less Than 2.5% Of BTC Addresses Are Wholecoiners While the number of wholecoiners has been steadily rising, there is a division between long-term investors and short-term speculators. Long-term Bitcoin holders have demonstrated resilience during market fluctuations, retaining their positions rather than selling. On the other hand, speculators are known more for exiting for USDT and cash during times of heightened volatility. For their actions, short-term holders or speculators have been labeled as “weak hands”. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Supply Drops To Record Lows Unseen Since 2015 And 2017 So far, BitInfoCharts data shows that less than 2.5% of all Bitcoin addresses hold at least 1 BTC.

Bitcoin is opening the Asia trading week down 1.3% to $26,779, while ether is down 0.8% to $1,806.  During the last month, bitcoin has primarily been in consolidation mode. Drifting downward ever so slowly, but still maintaining its value, down just 2% over the last 30 days – a much-needed break for investors from the roller-coaster of last year.  “Bitcoin has corrected to levels between $27k and $25k. This is where we’d like to see some consolidation before a retest of $30k in the coming days,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, said to CoinDesk in a note. “While the market may not rally in the near term, the price action is following expectations as we witness consolidation during bearish sentiment.”  Meanwhile, Tornado Cash’s TORN token has begun to recover after the protocol’s DAO was the victim of vote fraud over the weekend. This attack – which was not an exploit or hack – involved an attacker putting forward a proposal that looked benign on the surface but allowed the attacker access to all governance votes via some hidden malicious code.  In the aftermath, the protocol’s TORN token dropped 40% to $3.59 from $5.76, but is now recovering and up to $4.66.  The Tornado Cash community is proposing solutions to revert the unauthorized code changes and considering creating a new contract with airdropped tokens for existing holders.  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA −6.0% Entertainment Terra LUNA −4.5% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −4.3% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  The Crypto Industry's Lobbying Deficit  A recent report from Washington, D.C.-based political watchdog Open Secrets shows that first-quarter federal lobbying has topped $1 billion for the second consecutive year.  Some expected industries lead the rankings in lobbying spend: healthcare, finance, real estate and energy.  Overall in 2022, industries and activist groups of all shapes and sizes spent $4.1 billion on federal lobbying efforts.  As for crypto? Despite increasing regulatory hostility from D.C, crypto’s actual lobbying spend came in at $21.6 million for the year, according to Open Secrets data. Certainly, this is an increase from years prior, but as an industry with a market cap of just over $1 trillion, it wouldn’t even crack the top-20 list for lobbying spend.  In comparison, big pharma spent $375.2 million in 2022. The automotive industry spent $82 million, and commercial banks paid $64.6 million to lobbyists that year.  The industry's political contributions to election campaigns grew tenfold from 2020 to 2022, totaling $2.3 million in the latter, Open Secrets recently reported. Major contributors included Coinbase, which alone spent $3.4 million on lobbying.  Open Secrets’ data shows that lobbying by crypto majors is up during the first quarter of the year.  Tether has spent $270,000 lobbying in the first quarter of 2023, which doesn’t sound like much, but is a huge jump over its first quarter 2022 spend of $100,000.  The Blockchain Association is up as well, to $490,000 spent this quarter compared to $460,000 for the same time last year. Stablecoin issuer Paxos also saw a huge jump, with its lobbying spend rising from $50,000 in Q1 2022 to $80,000 this past quarter.  Of course, this is all dwarfed by TradFi lobbying spending.
