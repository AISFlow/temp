42396742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT54vu,1634167800,Ethereum’s Latest Progress Toward Proof-of-Stake,"This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  An under-the-radar rendezvous of core Ethereum developers took place in Greece last week, with major progress being made toward the Merge.  According to ConsenSys’ Ben Edgington, a Beacon Chain developer, the teams accomplished the transition of a multi-client devnet from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Eth1 execution clients and Eth2 consensus clients successfully merged to create a network capable of processing transactions.  This news comes shortly after the announcement of Altair’s coming upgrade on Oct. 27. The Altair upgrade is a significant step in the transition to proof-of-stake, giving developers a “low stakes warm-up” and further functionality on the Beacon Chain. While the puzzle that is the Merge seemingly moved slowly at first, it is beginning to fall into place all at once.  As we approach the eventual transition to proof-of-stake, it is important to note what the upgrade will change and what will stay the same.  Immediate impacts on users and the overall network:  Energy efficiency  Proof-of-stake allows validators to propose and validate blocks without using the energy currently required to mine these blocks. Proof-of-work miners are required to “compete” for blocks, incentivizing them to invest in advanced hardware and more energy usage than their mining peers. Proof-of-stake consensus randomly distributes block proposal opportunities to validators on the network, alleviating some of the competition that is so prominent in proof-of-work.  Transition away from economy of scale  Going hand in hand with energy efficiency, the need for expensive mining equipment and access to energy allows mining pools and large miners to dominate the network. While economies of scale will almost always arise, proof-of-stake allows users with arguably smaller initial investments to become validators on the network. In theory, this counters centralization and adds increased security to Ethereum as validators become diverse and widespread.  Ether emissions fall  The economics of Ethereum under proof-of-stake will differ from its current status. Ether rewards will depend on a variety of factors throughout the network, but the emission rate is expected to fall below the 2 ether block reward currently issued under proof-of-work.  What won’t change immediately with the merge:  Transaction cost/speed  The transition to proof-of-stake consensus will not have an immediate impact on gas fees or transaction speed. However, the upgrade will lay the groundwork for sharding, which “spreads the network’s load across 64 new chains” and is a key part of Ethereum’s roadmap to scalability.  User experience  Network users and blockspace consumers should have a similar experience when they are interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. The execution layer will remain the same post-merge and using Metamask or other software wallets should feel the same to end users.  Maximal extractable value (MEV)  Unfortunately, getting rid of miners does not get rid of MEV, and users of the proof-of-stake network will still be subject to the whims of transaction ordering by those looking to extract value from liquidations, frontrunning and arbitrage. Eth1 clients will still be responsible for the creation of blocks, much like they are today. Therefore, the transaction ordering process will take place the same way, before the blocks are passed to Eth2 clients to finalize the bundled transactions.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Divergence Ventures was caught exploiting airdrops from Ribbon Finance and other portfolio companies. BACKGROUND: The venture firm had made a minimum of at least 705 ETH by gaming future airdrops on multiple addresses, potentially using insider information. While the tactic is often used by DeFi investors, the community is questioning the ethics of using confidential information and immediately dumping the governance token.  OpenSea delisted DAO Turtles, presumably because of concerns around securitization. BACKGROUND: As creators experiment with the possibilities of non-fungible tokens, marketplaces are wary of the financialization of art and NFTs. FTX also announced that it would be avoiding NFTs with royalty mechanisms for regulatory reasons, potentially creating demand for a fully decentralized NFT market.  U.S. regulators continued digging into stablecoins and their issuers, a week after Gary Gensler referred to the tokens as “poker chips.” BACKGROUND: The exponential growth and lack of transparency throughout the stablecoin industry has worried investors and regulators alike. The Treasury is considering launching a FSOC examination on whether or not stablecoins are a threat to economic stability.  ConsenSys, an Ethereum-focused software company, held funding round talks with a valuation around $3 billion. BACKGROUND: ConsenSys has played an extremely important role in the development of the Ethereum ecosystem since 2014 and is looking to raise $250 million. Metamask, a ConsenSys-backed software wallet, currently generates annualized revenues of around $160 million.

This has been one of the pulls towards the network and users have taken full advantage of this capability to trade their NFTs on the blockchain. However, compared to leading NFTs blockchain Ethereum, Cardano NFT sales have been minute. Where the Ethereum network has seen NFTs sold for as high as $69.3 million in the case of Beeple, Cardano had yet to see its first million-dollar sale.

42396735,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT54ry,1634161212,"With $8.5M in Funding, Can Strips Finance Make DeFi Derivatives Click?","A new derivatives platform announced raising $8.5 million on Wednesday, part of an effort to overcome the ecosystem-wide reluctance in decentralized finance (DeFi) to embrace more complex financial instruments.  Strips Finance, a fixed-income platform, raised the funds via a token sale with participation from Multicoin Capital, Sequoia Capital India, Fabric Ventures and Morningstar Capital.  Strips is planning to launch in November with initial functionality that will enable interest rate swaps (IRSs) via automated market makers (AMMs), the decentralized exchanges over which much of DeFi is transacted.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Strips founder Ming Wu referred to IRSs as a “great instrument for both speculators and hedgers,” allowing users to switch between more volatile floating rates and safer, but lower-upside fixed rates on deposits on protocols such as Nerve.Finance.  “This is something we haven’t found available in DeFi so far, however, it is a huge market in traditional finance – we’re talking about over $6.5 trillion being traded in interest rate markets in a single day,” said Wu of IRSs.  The product will be launching natively on Arbitrum, per a press release provided to CoinDesk. Wu said that an Arbitrum-native release made more sense than the Ethereum base layer after the team studied various scaling solutions, coming to the conclusion that optimistic rollups would be the long-term solution to scalability.  The team is also planning a deployment to Binance Smart Chain, which is effectively serving as a “backup” in case Arbitrum runs into technical snags during their rollout.  Apes can’t do math  Regardless of the platform, however, it’s unclear how much traffic Strips will attract.  One of the strangest puzzles in all of DeFi is why native traders – often referred to as “apes” and known for their love of volatility – have so far eschewed the dozens of decentralized derivatives platforms that are available.  Competing products to Strips already exist, such as BarnBridge and Pendle, but both float around 50th place in terms of total value locked (TVL) at roughly $31 million.  Wu said that the derivatives space still has promise, however.  “I would say the counterpoint is dYdX, that’s a decentralized derivatives exchange that has done tremendously well,” he said. “Perpetual Protocol and MCDex are also growing.”  Wu also hopes that Strips architecture, which uses an AMM model, will also help make the products easier to enter, exit and trade on secondary markets.  “There hasn’t been a good alternative or a good derivative instrument for users to trade interest rates as an asset class in and of itself,” he said.  The team is also planning a broader suite of products based on the initial interest rate swap exchange, including a fixed-income product called a perpetual bond – a fixed yield bond that will pay a set interest rate to the holder in perpetuity.  Other products in the works include one-week, one-month and one-year term bonds, as well as interest rate options and leveraged yield farming.

He is looking to hire at least four staffers to help plot Stripe’s crypto strategy.  Those engineers “will design and build the core components that we need to support crypto use cases,” the job posts said. “Crypto is a brand new team at Stripe.”  Stripe’s relatively modest hiring push (it has 4,000 employees) comes amid a surge in crypto payments integrations across online retailers and even social media platforms. Strike, the crypto startup behind Twitter’s new bitcoin tipping feature, is preparing to release its payments API in an aggressive bid for mass crypto adoption.  The team may be new but Stripe’s interest in crypto stretches back years. A payments giant whose API supports millions of digital storefronts, it made headlines in 2014 when it supported bitcoin – an industry first. Stripe abandoned that service four years later.  But a source told CoinDesk that Stripe never left crypto. The company continued to watch the digital assets space develop, weighing if and how to participate again. In recent months it has shown increasing interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the source said.  In response to CoinDesk’s queries, Poncin tweeted out the following:  Multi-coin approach  One thing on the company’s mind is a need to avoid picking favorites, the source said. Stripe already supports an array of more traditional online payment options. It wants to remain tech-neutral when it comes to crypto, the source said.  It was slightly less cautious in early 2018. Ending Stripe’s bitcoin era with a pledge to maybe integrate Stellar, which it seed-funded years earlier, the company’s announcement boosted Stellar’s native currency, XLM, 20% in a day.  Stripe is aware of its influence in online payments. The firm has said it processes hundreds of billions of dollars in e-commerce annually; that 90% of American adults have utilized it; that its API (which still contains code to facilitate bitcoin transactions) is used hundreds of millions of times a day.  “Many businesses and users already rely on and trust in Stripe,” the crypto job post said. “This gives us a massive opportunity to be at the forefront of a new wave of innovation.”  UPDATE (Oct. 12, 15:45 UTC): Adds Poncin tweet.",POSITIVE,XLM,BTC | XLM,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/stripe-is-hiring-a-crypto-team-3-years-after-ending-its-bitcoin-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a007fde3a1c8e455b277b9299f53f7c16f0b7d97-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412176,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIyxf,1634161015,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Recovering Faster Than Equities as Buyers Remain Active,"Bitcoin returned above $56,000 on Wednesday after trading in a tight range over the past few days. The cryptocurrency’s price is up about 3% over the past 24 hours compared to a 1% rise in ether over the same period.  The recovery in cryptocurrencies over the past week has decoupled from equity markets, with bitcoin squarely in the lead with a near 18% price rise for the month to date. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is down about 4% from an all-time high in September, albeit with less or a roller coaster in price volatility than cryptocurrencies.  For now, analysts are monitoring blockchain data, which points to continued upside for bitcoin. “Despite China’s crypto ban, it seems miners, including those who were in China, are holding BTC in mining wallets,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, wrote in a blogpost, referring to the decline in miner outflows, which tends to be a bullish price indicator.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,387, +3.9%  Ether (ETH): $3,528, +1.5%  S&P 500: +0.3%  Gold: $1,791, +1.8%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.544%  Closing in on the high  Bitcoin is currently about 10% away from an all-time price high around $63,000, marking a sharp recovery from a near 50% drawdown (percentage decline from peak to trough) two months ago. The speed of bitcoin’s price recovery is far greater than the S&P 500, which produced negative returns over the past three months compared to a near 70% rise in BTC over the same period.  However, over the long term, the chart below shows bitcoin’s drawdowns tend to be more severe than for equities. This is mainly due to the cryptocurrency’s higher volatility, which can accelerate price moves.  Less crypto price volatility ahead  Days of extreme price volatility during market downturns may be behind us because traders are increasingly using stablecoins or fiat currencies as collateral to trade futures contracts – an obligation to buy or sell the underlying at a later date at an agreed-upon price, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole wrote in the Wednesday edition of the “First Mover” newsletter.  Since May, the percentage of coin-margined futures contracts’ open interest has been on a decline and recently fell below 50%, according to Glassnode data quoted by Delphi Digital. Meanwhile, the percentage of the dollar- or stablecoin-margined open interest is ticking higher, as shown in the chart below. Open interest refers to the number of futures contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position.  On a related note, the 30-day volatility of bitcoin and ether declined over the past few months but remains elevated given the recent price rally across cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 Index also experienced a brief rise in volatility around the end of September.  Altcoin roundup  Polkadot sets date for hotly anticipated parachain auctions: Polkadot’s parachain auction process will kick off next month on Nov. 11, reported CoinDesk’s Ian Allison. The process will decide which project will be allocated slots for building on the Polkadot network. The last technical steps to complete before launching parachains on Polkadot were the finalization of parachain disputes and Polkadot’s full code audit, both of which have now been completed, according to Polkadot founder Robert Habermeier.  Solana’s Phantom adds safety rails after scammers drain wallets: Solana-based digital wallet Phantom has shored up its cyber defenses after weeks of user-reported scams that drained victims’ crypto token balances, reported CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson. The wallet, analogous to Ethereum’s Metamask, exiled its “auto-approve” transaction feature to the back of the app, an Oct. 7 blog post said. It also cleaned up the transaction preview user interface and said an anti-phishing website blocker is slated for future rollout.  Global finance watchdog says $133B stablecoin sector remains niche: A Financial Stability Board (FSB) survey has found that stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to real-world assets, are currently not being used at a significant scale for mainstream payments, reported CoinDesk’s Sandali Handagama. The finding was mentioned Wednesday in an FSB progress report for enhancing cross-border payments. “From a policy perspective, there is value in assessing whether and how the use of well-designed global [stablecoins] could enhance cross-border payments. An action to that extent has been added,” the report said.

The latest CCAF data shows the U.S accounting for 35.4% of the global hashrate – the world’s total computational power used to mine bitcoin – as of the end of August, more than doubling from 16.8% at the end of April.  Kazakhstan and Russia followed the U.S. with shares of 18.1% and 11%, respectively, up from 8.2% and 6.8% in April, according to the CCAF, which is part of the Cambridge Judge Business School.  China’s share has “effectively dropped to zero,” according to the CCAF, following the government-mandated ban on crypto mining in the country.  While the immediate effect of China’s crackdown was a 38% decline in the global hashrate in June, there was a 20% rebound in July and August, suggesting that Chinese bitcoin mining operations had successfully redeployed their equipment overseas.  Where China’s dominance of the bitcoin mining industry peaked at over 75% in September 2019, the immediate trend suggests there will be no one clear winner. The crackdown has driven firms to see the need to spread their operations around rather than centralizing in one location.  Read more: Go West, Bitcoin!

42412172,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIykJ,1634155482,Coinbase Rated Underperform in New Coverage on Lack of ‘Crypto Innovation’,"Coinbase Global (Nasdaq: COIN) was rated at underperform with a $160 price target at Autonomous Research, which cited the exchange’s lack of crypto innovation. Shares of the crypto exchange closed Wednesday trading at $246.78, down 1%.  Coinbase is “rapidly” losing market share and seeing “significant take rate compression” as competition from other exchanges such as Binance, FTX and Robinhood intensifies, Autonomous Research analyst Christian Bolu wrote in a note.  Bolu said what’s most concerning is that Coinbase appears to be “lagging on almost every crypto innovation (including altcoins, derivatives, NFTs).” If that trend continues, he said, the crypto exchange could rapidly lose relevance the way Netscape did in the early internet era.  On Tuesday, Coinbase announced it’s launching a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace that will allow its users to buy and sell Ethereum-based digital collectibles by year’s end. In September, Coinbase added dogecoin rival SHIB to its trading platform after the “meme coin” surged in popularity. Also, last month, the exchange took some steps toward listing crypto futures products, filing to become a member of the National Futures Association and register as a futures commission merchant.  Autonomous Research’s appraisal of Coinbase’s prospects contrasts sharply with some other recent coverage of the exchange, including JMP Securities, which initiated Coinbase with an outperform rating and a $300 price target late last month. And last week, Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, who has a $440 price target, predicted the company would beat Wall Street’s estimates for trading volume and revenue for the third quarter.  Meanwhile, Bolu started coverage of Robinhood (Nasdaq: HOOD) with an outperform rating and $55 price target (38% upside from the current price), citing the trading app’s increased monetization of crypto and lending.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH | BNB,Josh Fineman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/13/coinbase-rated-underperform-in-new-coverage-on-lack-of-crypto-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68f56825966f0f1e066e286a22205c896cf21ad6-7200x5055.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Republic is a crowd-equity platform that offers investments in startups, real estate, gaming and crypto. The company is divided into three arms: the private venture-focused Republic Capital; Republic Crypto; and republic.co, which is the retail, crowdfunding part of the business.  Republic also offers the Note security token, secured on the Algorand blockchain, which provides profit-sharing interests in certain Republic portfolio companies.  Earlier this year, Republic raised $35 million in a Series A funding round that was led by a subsidiary of digital asset firm Galaxy Digital, which Republic said pushed its total fundraising to over $70 million.  New portfolio companies coming in through the crypto fund stand to benefit from the broader Republic ecosystem, according to Republic Capital head Boris Revsin. “There are opportunities for them to do everything from a public sale with the retail platform or to continue to fundraise. We are very hands-on, when needed,” Revsin said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Andrew Durgee, the head of Republic Crypto, said the new fund has already deployed around $11 to $12 million to companies that include video game Star Atlas, TikTok competitor Chingari and a “handful” of other companies. Republic originally expected the fund to deploy over two years but now estimates it’s running six months ahead of schedule.  Asked about future plans for Republic Crypto, Durgee broke his response down into the general business and the fund.  “For Republic Crypto, our focus right now is on treasury management. We’re building out kind of an institutional-grade treasury management solution, and there will be a number of funds that are associated with that as that rolls out,” Durgee told CoinDesk.  “I think on the fund side right now, it’s really about just allocating that into projects that we have kind of a little bit of reach with and more understanding through for the other areas of Republic,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/13/republic-launches-60m-crypto-seed-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36ae4882d61ea8f423c8f12628bd67ca73d1f800-2560x1539.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The wallet, analogous to Ethereum’s Metamask, exiled its “auto-approve” transaction feature to the back of the app, an Oct. 7 blog post said. It also cleaned up the user interface (UI) for transaction previews and said an anti-phishing website blocker is slated for future rollout.  “We need a way to protect users from losing their funds to the ever-growing number of phishing scams out there,” Phantom’s Chief Product Officer Chris Kalani told CoinDesk in an email.  Phantom’s security upgrades highlight the tug-and-pull between developers trying to simplify crypto’s user experience and scammers exploiting their shortcuts.  The auto-approve feature, for example, instantly initiated crypto transactions between wallets and trusted web apps. It cut out seconds by eliminating prompts for Phantom’s 700,000 users. That could be critical in time-sensitive scenarios, like minting a non-fungible token (NFT) or executing a decentralized exchange (DEX) trade.  But it was also a boon for scammers. In one well-documented case, scammers distributed links to a phony version of the Aurory NFT project’s minting website in the lead-up to a highly-anticipated drop.  “When users interacted with the wallet address that was listed on that phishing site, it would automatically sweep the funds out of that user’s wallet,” said Esteban Castaño, CEO of TRM Labs, which tracked the funds.  Phantom’s knee-jerk reaction to the Aurory debacle was a pledge to nuke auto-approve outright. Solana whales pushed back: Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX and a SOL booster, called for Phantom to preserve the “value” of auto-approvals with a middle-ground solution.  “We have a large community we need to accommodate for and this feature is widely used in the Solana ecosystem currently,” Kalani said.  Auto-approve will still be available to “advanced” users who enable it through Phantom’s app settings, he said.  Phantom’s upcoming phishing blocker will also look to protect wallet users. Kalani said the feature will try to block users from accessing suspicious websites with a history of pilfering coins. It will reference a user-generated list of websites.  “Our goal with this isn’t to police what users can and cannot see, it is meant to combat obvious phishing scams that are attempting to trick users,” he said.",NEUTRAL,SOL,ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/13/solanas-phantom-adds-safety-rails-after-scammers-drain-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1ebfb70facf5a65dcdda0bce3ed397ac3e7fb2a-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394412,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvd0KX,1634150497,Why Crypto Mining Needs Nuclear Power,"Opponents of cryptocurrency often cite its energy and pollution footprint as major reasons against adoption. However, the natural synergies between cryptocurrency mining and nuclear power could take that issue off the table altogether.  Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies secured by cryptography. Unlike physical money, like dollars, cryptocurrencies are not minted by national institutions. Instead, they are created through complex algorithms that take place over computer networks. While not all crypto currencies have a specific function, the most valuable ones, such as BTC and ETH, exist primarily to carry financial transactions embedded in the blockchain – the cryptographic transaction record.  Dr. Florent Heidet is a scientific manager for a large public research institution. He has worked on advanced nuclear technologies for over 15 years, contributing to many types of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. Dr. Milos Atz is a nuclear engineer at a large public research institution where he works on a variety of advanced reactor analysis and waste management research projects.  Recently, the values of many cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed, due in part to increased acceptance as well as speculation about future competition between a cryptocurrency-based decentralized financial system and the existing centralized financial system controlled by banks and governments.  The incredible rise in cryptocurrency value, associated with the ease to contribute to the cryptocurrency mining process with common computer hardware, has resulted in an ever-larger number of miners joining cryptocurrency networks. Increasing the number of miners benefits the system by further decentralizing, and therefore securing, the cryptocurrency.  Most of the major cryptocurrencies operate following the proof-of-work (PoW) scheme. In PoW, miners compete to leverage computer resources to perform cryptocurrency transactions and in return receive a reward in the form of the cryptocurrency they are enabling. Although there exist energy-efficient alternatives to the PoW scheme such as the proof-of-stake (PoS) or proof-of-space schemes, those methods haven’t been widely adopted yet by the major cryptocurrencies.  Read more: Greenidge Generation to Expand Bitcoin Mining With South Carolina Plant  Total power consumption used by mining across the major cryptocurrencies is tens of gigawatts electrical, or GWe, based on current network size and average mining equipment power. That is about the same as the power demand of Sweden or Montana. New generations of computing hardware are more efficient and progressively reduce power consumption per hashrate, but the high profitability of mining attracts more participants, yielding a net increase of the overall power used by the network. In fact, as long as the combined costs of electricity and hardware remain lower than the value of the generated cryptocurrency, the networks and their power consumption will continue growing and will soon surpass that of most countries.  Although cryptocurrency mining requires huge amounts of energy, the process itself is not directly polluting. The natural resource requirement is limited to what is needed to manufacture computer hardware and to generate electricity for the mining operations. Cryptocurrency mining is a 24/7 process using constant power with minimal downtime. Additionally, larger mining operations can require in excess of 100 megawatts of power for facilities with the footprint of a medium-size factory. Mining operations need a highly reliable and dense power supply.  The environmental impact of electricity generation depends in large part on the source used. Primary impacts include carbon emissions and air pollution from burning fossil fuels. The mix of available electricity generation sources is highly dependent on the region and when cryptocurrency miners purchase electricity from the grid, and the environmental impact is tied to the local energy mix. The cryptocurrency carbon footprint is the greatest if the grid is supplied primarily by fossil fuels.  Headlines regarding links between cryptocurrencies and the environmental impact associated with mining have become common, and resulting geopolitical decisions have hurt their valuations. That dynamic ought to concern the crypto industry, and industry participants should want to seek cleaner sources of electricity to minimize its impact on the environment.  To guarantee a share of carbon-free electricity, cryptocurrency mining operations may seek agreements with local grid operators or electricity generators. Some larger cryptocurrency mining operations may choose to own and operate their own electricity generation facilities.  Available sources of carbon-free electricity include renewables (primarily wind and solar), hydropower and nuclear power. Hydropower is geographically limited and season dependent, which leaves renewables and nuclear power as the most technically mature options. The intermittency of renewables means that they require large energy storage systems or fossil fuel backups to ensure the constant electricity supply needed for mining. Because of their footprint, large-scale energy generation through renewables in desired locations is much less flexible than other energy sources are. Those attributes make renewable sources a less attractive energy partner for cryptocurrency mining.  The power demands of the cryptocurrency mining industry create a unique opportunity for synergizing with nuclear power. Nuclear reactors harness energy from fissioning elements such as uranium. Because it isn’t burning carbon-based fuels, energy produced from nuclear reactors is carbon free. In 2020, nuclear power accounted for 50% of all carbon-free electricity generation in the U.S.  Lifecycle nuclear power greenhouse gas emissions – including mining uranium, fuel enrichment and fuel fabrication – are comparable with those of other renewable sources of electricity, shown in the chart below. In addition to being carbon free, nuclear power now comes from the kilowatt to the gigawatt levels and exhibits two particular characteristics that make it a prime partner for cryptocurrency mining.  First, nuclear power is immensely reliable. Reliability is measured by the “capacity factor,” the ratio between a plant’s actual electricity generation and the amount of electricity it could produce if it ran at 100% power with no interruptions. Nuclear power in the U.S. has the highest capacity factor of any electricity source. As such, nuclear is often described as “baseload” electricity – always up, always running, reliably meeting the electricity demand. For crypto-mining operations requiring constant power, that is a huge benefit.  Second, nuclear power is incredibly energy dense. A single fission reaction produces over 1 million times more energy than one combustion reaction. As such, the fuel and footprint requirements for nuclear reactors is very small. That pairs well with the compactness of crypto-mining facilities.  Nuclear energy comes with the stigmas of nuclear waste and nuclear accidents. Despite a few high-profile nuclear accidents in the past, nuclear power plants remain one of the safest human-made constructs, and nuclear power is among the safest sources of electricity. While nuclear waste is unavoidably generated through nuclear reactions, high resource utilization leads to extremely compact waste forms that can be safely managed with minimal footprint. Worldwide, benefits from nuclear power have far outweighed its challenges.  Engaging with the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry is advantageous for the nuclear industry, as well. Despite producing carbon-free, reliable electricity, nuclear power plants struggle to compete against the cheap natural gas that dominates electricity markets. By contrast, the cryptocurrency industry specifically demands the unique benefits of nuclear power, making partnerships an ideal opportunity. Annual crypto-mining energy costs represent tens of billions of dollars, based on total power consumption and U.S.-average electricity costs. Cryptocurrency network growth will only further propel energy cost increases. The fact that cryptocurrency valuations are likely to increase further stresses the importance of cryptocurrency clean-energy partnerships.  Read more: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate | Nic Carter  Intentional collaboration with nuclear power could reduce the cost of electricity for crypto-mining operations. The cost to generate the electricity is a small fraction of the total, with various taxes, transmission costs and delivery costs accounting for the rest. Although nuclear power does not offer the lowest electricity generation cost, crypto mining would take full benefit of its reliability, energy density and geographical flexibility. Crypto-mining farms that use nuclear power, either through collocation with existing plants or by ownership of their own plants, would pay less for their carbon-free electricity than they would if they purchased carbon-intensive electricity from the grid.  Partnerships between the crypto-mining and the nuclear industries have already started to blossom. Recent reporting has showcased agreements forged between cryptocurrency mining operations and both nuclear utilities and nuclear reactor vendors. Given the synergies between cryptocurrency energy demands and nuclear power, we hope that these industries continue to engage with each other to explore mutually beneficial opportunities for growth and collaboration.

Bruce Bise, 60, and Samuel Mendez, 65, face up to five years in federal prison in connection with the Bitqyck ICO, which raised $24 million, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas said Wednesday.  Bise pleaded guilty on Sept. 9 and Mendez on Oct. 13, according to the department.  The duo allegedly scammed investors out of their funds, using the ICO’s proceeds on casino trips, cars, art, rent and luxury home remodels.  The pair also promised investors who purchased Bitqy tokens they would receive shares of the company’s common stock, though no such issues were ever made. At the time of the pleas, Bise and Mendez own 100% of Bitqyck’s common stock.  Less than a year after Bitqyck’s 2016 ICO, Bise and Mendez began promoting a new coin, BitqyM, that was said to power bitcoin mining operations in Washington state. Bise and Mendez admitted in plea papers that no such operations ever existed, and they had unsuccessfully tried to contract a third-party overseas company to mine the promised bitcoin.  Bitqyck paid an $8.3 million penalty to resolve claims that it defrauded investors in a civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August of 2019.  From 2016 to 2018, Bise and Mendez profited a combined $9.16 million, but after underreporting their incomes, combined with Bitqy failing to file its tax returns in 2018 despite collecting $3.5 million from investors, the founders are on the hook for over $1.6 million in back taxes combined.

Estonia has been known among crypto entrepreneurs as a friendly jurisdiction, and getting a license there has been easy. Now, that could change.  Talking to journalists, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) chief, appointed in May of this year, said crypto companies have made “tens of billions of euros per year,” and that most of that money ended up in other countries and didn’t help the Estonian economy, according to the translated version of the interview by ERR.  “Their only goal is to get an Estonian license and use it to turn over very large sums, while Estonia gets nothing out of it,” Mäeker said.  Mäeker proposed stricter rules for licensing crypto startups in Estonia and raising the minimum capital requirements from €12,000 (US$13,900) to €350,000 ($405,000). He said a bill proposing regulations for crypto licenses will be introduced in the Estonian parliament.  Meanwhile, existing crypto licenses should be revoked, Mäeker said. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) revoked 1,808 cryptocurrency licenses last year, and now there are 400 current licenses in Estonia, according to ERR.  But in an email to CoinDesk, the communications manager for the FIU said that Estonia is not planning to revoke existing licenses of crypto operators in the country. The manager, Õnne Mets, said that “the aim of the new regulations is “to handle better the risk” that cryptocurrency creates.  Mets said that the Estonian parliament, the Riigikogu, must pass the new regulations, which the FIU supports, and that if they win approval, crypto operators will have a time period to adopt them. He said that the regulations would help ensure that crypto operators are managing risks and also bolster the FIU’s oversight of crypto services. “The changes reinforce a transparent and trustworthy business environment,” Mets said.

42394409,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvd001,1634141530,Biden’s Orwellian Tax Surveillance Policy,"We are witnessing a real-time demonstration of the way a failing political order can lead to the imposition of Orwellian surveillance out of last-gasp desperation. That’s the only honest way to assess the Biden administration’s almost unspeakably bad proposal to require that all U.S. banks report data to the Internal Revenue Service about any account with more than $600 in annual deposits and withdrawals.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The rules do not include individual transaction reporting, but would require reporting total annual inflows and outflows for the vast majority of accounts in the U.S. The only comparable power grab in living memory was the secret surveillance of U.S. citizens’ communications by the National Security Agency. It should be deeply embarrassing to all Americans that our lawmakers are even considering imposing this new financial surveillance apparatus. As another nauseating index of political dysfunction, this rule isn’t even being considered on its own merits. Instead, much like recent half-cocked crypto reporting rules, it’s being crammed through as a pay-for in the big infrastructure bill, practically guaranteeing that it would be drafted hastily and with minimal debate.  It’s utter madness, not just as policy but as politics for Biden’s fellow Democrats. The party already has a reputation as proponents of the nanny state, and here they are lobbying for more surveillance at a moment when Americans are so deeply distrustful of government that they’re going to their literal deathbeds refusing to take a safe, effective vaccine against a deadly virus. The $600 threshold seems particularly suicidal for the Dems, making absolutely explicit that they want to spy on the little guy, too. It’s practically the perfect formula for alienating working people who might otherwise support the kind of helpful policies the infrastructure bill offers.  Republicans, it must be said, are also deeply culpable in this travesty, though they have, as usual, outmaneuvered and outsmarted the blundering, out-of-touch Dems into taking the brunt of the anger. It was the Republicans, remember, who rejected a provision in an earlier version of the bill that would have increased the enforcement budget of the IRS. That would have made it easier for the agency to investigate the high-end tax cheats who really matter. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would have returned roughly $2.50 for every dollar of the increased IRS budget, without sweeping new surveillance powers.  On its face, then, increasing IRS enforcement was the right thing to do for America. It would have given investigators the resources to dig into specific suspicious individuals and activities, as opposed to the mass data gathering being proposed as an alternative now. But the Republicans decided their anti-tax stance meant not just supporting lower tax rates but also making it easier for their richest donors to evade taxes entirely.  And so, thanks to this brew of different flavors of bad faith, we wind up with surveillance instead of enforcement. This rule should, of course, be opposed on principle – but it’s just one index of a much deeper, scarier downward spiral as social distrust and legislative haste grease the skids for the erosion of the privacy guaranteed by the Constitution. It will take a major change to escape that trap.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

42412160,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIxfX,1634140912,Polkadot Sets Date for Hotly Anticipated Parachain Auctions,"The much-anticipated parachain auction process, where projects are allocated slots for building on the Polkadot cryptocurrency network, kicks off next month.  The first of the auctions is slated to begin on Nov. 11, according to the Polkadot Council. A proposal was submitted to the governance forum minutes ago.  Stepping back, the parachain auction process is an important milestone in realizing Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood’s vision for an interconnected blockchain framework. (Parachains have already been running successfully on Polkadot’s already-live “canary” network, Kusama, with 11 parachain slot auctions taking place since the launch of Statemine on June 3.)  “Almost exactly five years after the vision of a heterogeneous multichain framework was first outlined in the Polkadot [white paper], parachains are now officially ready for launch on Polkadot,” Polkadot founder Robert Habermeier said in a blog post shared with CoinDesk.  The last technical steps to complete before launching parachains on Polkadot were the finalization of parachain disputes and Polkadot’s full code audit, both of which have now been completed, according to Habermeier.  DOT race  The ongoing Kusama parachain auctions have seen some 2.4 million KSM, Kasama’s native token, contributed to crowdloans by more than 49,000 unique addresses. DOT, the native asset of the Polkadot network, will be used in the upcoming auctions.  A gaggle of decentralized projects have won parachain slots so far, including decentralized identity protocol Kilt and decentralized finance (DeFi) building blocks such as Acala’s Karura Network, Moonbeam’s Moonriver Network, Astar’s Shiden Network and Phala’s Khala Network.  In terms of which projects are at the front of the queue for a Polkadot slot, Habermeier told CoinDesk via Telegram:  “While I obviously can’t vouch for any particular parachain or try to predict winners, Polkadot’s parachain auction model certainly benefits projects that are able to gather substantial community support through its crowdloan mechanism. We saw this on Kusama and I suspect we will see similar excitement for the early parachains on Polkadot.”  The DOT required to obtain a slot is purely based on an efficient market mechanism, said Habermeier. “That said,” he added, “the economics of Polkadot are designed so that a target of 20% of DOT end up bonded on behalf of parachains over time.”  ‘Boring’ parachain launch expected  As with Kusama, each seven-day auction on Polkadot will consist of a starting period of one day and 21 hours, followed by an ending period of five days. Bidding ends on the seventh day, when the precise moment of the auction’s close is determined retroactively by an on-chain, verifiable random function (VRF).  The auction can end at any point during the ending period, which prevents last-minute “auction sniping” for better price discovery.  The first five projects to win an auction would be onboarded to Polkadot simultaneously on Dec. 15, 2021, rather than being onboarded immediately following each auction (as has occurred on Kusama). Each auction on Polkadot will assign a parachain slot for a total of 96 weeks (divided into eight 12-week lease periods) as opposed to Kusama’s 48 weeks.  According to this proposal, which is now going through a public referendum, the first batch of five auctions will take place with one new auction each week.  A second batch of six auctions will follow with one new auction every two weeks. The second batch of six auctions would be onboarded for lease period seven, which begins March 9, 2022.  The rolling weekly auction process beginning on Nov. 11 will run until the number of parachains on Polkadot equals not more than 75% of those on Kusama, according to Polkadot representatives.  This conservative approach regarding how many parachains can be onboarded during the first three months is necessary, said Habermeier, since the initial production release code is not necessarily fully mature and may still contain uncaught bugs.  The Kusama parachain launch was a dress rehearsal, said Habermeier, and he hoped any chaotic elements will be ironed out for the main event.  “Similar to how the Kusama genesis launch was a bit chaotic – as advertised – we hope the lessons we learned and bugs we squashed in the Kusama parachain launch lead to a comparably ‘boring’ parachain launch on Polkadot,” he said.",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/13/polkadot-sets-date-for-hotly-anticipated-parachain-auctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2060ae311fba4e9139e8a5974fe44105e4a731bb-1280x876.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Beltracchi is the infamous German art forger who recreated and sold the works of famous artists for over 30 years. He was finally caught in 2011 and spent more than three years in prison in Germany. Since his arrest, Beltracchi has been banned by museums, galleries and auction houses from showing and selling his work.  That makes him a great candidate for an NFT collection, Hashmasks said Tuesday.  “There is no better artist to utilize the blockchain to express their art than Beltracchi,” the founder of Hashmasks, who goes by the name of Hansen, told CoinDesk. “He is the most-censored artist. Hence, we can use the Ethereum blockchain as intended to give access to an otherwise barred artist.”  Beltracchi’s “The Greats” collection consists of versions of “Salvator Mundi,” a painting believed to have been created by Leonardo da Vinci that sold for a record $450 million in 2017. Beltracchi has made 4,608 NFTs of the painting in the style of other well-known artists including Vincent van Gogh, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.  Hansen said the time is right for more professional artists to enter the NFT market.  “Most new NFTs are either pixel animals or generative art. Now, don’t get me wrong, I like generative art like Art Blocks, but at some point, we have seen enough of it,” Hansen said. “We believe that after Beltracchi has entered the market it will open a lot of eyes in the traditional art world.”  Hansen declined to discuss any upcoming releases by Hashmasks, a unit of Zurich-based Suum Cuique Labs. “We are not a regular company that mass produces digital art,” he said. “We would only do another project if the idea behind it is intriguing and interesting.”  But he did note that Hashmasks has helped create the MaskDAO to support the Hashmask community, and also recently created a sub-collection of Hashmask NFT avatars that could be used more readily as profile pictures in the same way as the popular Bored Apes and CryptoPunks NFT collections.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/hashmasks-is-behind-new-nfts-by-notorious-art-forger-wolfgang-beltracchi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e967d16ef8926f0282b7808acdfbb9144ee6940e-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412175,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIytD,1634133600,"Proposed Bank Jewel Wants to Become a Global Stablecoin Issuer, With Bermuda’s OK","Jewel, a proposed Bermudian bank and aspiring stablecoin issuer that is looking to provide services to digital asset businesses worldwide, has hired Nick Lepetsos, a veteran of First Western Trust Bank, as CEO.  He is coming on board at a time when the proposed bank is waiting to see whether its application for a banking license in the British island territory of Bermuda will be approved, according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk. If approved, the combined bank and digital asset license will allow Jewel to serve as the custodian for digital assets, facilitate crypto-collateralized lending and issue its own stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to other assets like the U.S. dollar, the statement said.  Lepetsos, who will officially start as CEO on Friday, will bring his expertise in traditional banking to the digital asset world.  “What I really want to do for Jewel going forward is to be the person that can be in that mesh point between the traditional fiat currency commercial banking business and the digital asset business, both of which are important,” Lepetsos said.  Chancellor Barnett, Jewel’s founder and chairman, said Jewel is preparing for an early 2022 launch.  Banks around the world are exploring the prospects of offering crypto and other digital asset custody services. In 2020, U.S. financial regulators began allowing national banks to be the crypto custodian on behalf of customers. In April, Paxos became the third regulated crypto trust charter in the U.S. after Anchorage and Protego.  Earlier this year, CoinDesk reported that Deutsche Bank is working on a digital asset custody platform for institutional clients. In September, Swiss bank SEBA obtained a license from the local financial watchdog to be the custodian of and offer digital assets to Swiss-based clients. Barnett told CoinDesk that his staff worked with Bermudian financial regulators for almost two and a half years to assemble the application before it was submitted in June to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).  “We got to actually go through a collaborative process to create a bank application that was of no surprise to [Bermudian regulators] so that puts us in a really great position … We feel extremely confident about where we’re headed, and the future of the bank,” Barnett said.  A spokesperson for the BMA told CoinDesk that the agency doesn’t comment on pending applications.  “If the BMA is aware of false statements, we will request that the information is corrected, removed or [publish] details regarding the falsehood on its website’s ‘Warning List’,” the spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk.  Despite the BMA’s statement, Bermuda Premier David Burt appeared to have endorsed the proposed bank, saying, “The introduction of Jewel as Bermuda’s first dedicated digital asset bank can provide the critical infrastructure to further drive the growth of Bermuda’s digital asset economy.”  Genesis of Jewel  Before he founded Jewel, Barnett was the founding CEO of equity crowdfunding platform crowdfunder.com (which Barnett is no longer associated with). According to his LinkedIn profile, he also co-founded cryptocurrency wallet CoinCircle and worked as an adviser to software company Orchid Labs.  About four years ago, Barnett met Lepetsos, who has around three decades of experience in traditional banking. The two became interested in exploring use cases for stablecoins and were approached by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) Office of Innovation to discuss ideas.  “We realized that the U.S. wasn’t ready to move with clarity in any aspect, and that sent me offshore looking for other progressive jurisdictions to do something similar,” Barnett said, explaining what led him to Bermuda.  In 2018, Bermuda established the Digital Asset Business Act (DABA), a legal framework for governing digital assets. The territory became one of the first jurisdictions in the world to test a COVID-19 stimulus token designed to help deliver pandemic aid swiftly through smartphones. Earlier this year, Bermuda tested a digital dollar for retail payments.  “But one of the pieces of missing infrastructure was really a dedicated digital asset bank in Bermuda to provide services where companies can really come and grow. And that was the genesis of Jewel,” Barnett said.  Bermuda’s Banks and Deposit Companies Act of 1999 (which lays out licensing requirements for local banks) was amended in 2018 to include a restricted banking license that would allow banks to provide banking services to Bermuda-based digital asset and fintech firms.  Barnett says Jewel initially went for the restricted license for digital asset banking but felt it was too limiting. Instead, Barnett chose to pursue the existing Bermudian bank license, which will allow Jewel to offer fiat or crypto-collateralized lending and serve global clients in non-sanctioned jurisdictions – not just Bermuda based clients.  According to Barnett, Jewel raised capital from Bermudan family offices (investment management firms for the ultrawealthy), former bank owners and investors in the digital asset market. Jewel’s first outside funding round was led by Sir John Swan, a former premier of Bermuda, and his family office, Barnett said.  But Barnett said finding investors to get Jewel off the ground wasn’t easy.  “Early on, it was a different equation for people to try and wrap their heads around. We didn’t go to just the traditional private equity, traditional bank funding round, and there’s a few reasons for that, but the largest one is, we’re doing something that combines a bank into a scalable technology company. So it’s not a traditional bank trajectory,” Barnett said.  Stablecoins  Stablecoins will be a core service for Jewel, as Barnett said the Bermuda digital asset license under DABA will allow the bank to issue its own stablecoins.  In DABA, “digital asset business” is defined as any business “issuing, selling or redeeming virtual coins, tokens or any other form of digital asset.” The act doesn’t mention stablecoins by name.  Stablecoins are drawing attention from regulators in the U.S. and Europe because of concerns about their potential impact on financial stability and the integrity of their reserves.  Barnett says not all stablecoins are “bad,” explaining that private banks are in the best position to function as stablecoin issuers.  “The big challenge that happens, let’s say there was a run, let’s say there was a bankruptcy or some major issue. The holder of the stablecoin has no contractual claim on the funds in custody. The only one who does, who has any say, and can control the whole thing is the underlying issuer, which is not the custodian,” Barnett said. He said that such a crisis can be avoided if a private bank is both the issuer and the custodian.  Barnett and Lepetsos confirmed that Jewel’s proposed product set includes issuing USD and other single fiat currency stablecoins. That will enable Jewel clients to settle and manage liquidity with trading partners within the bank in real time, according to the press statement.  Barnett later said in an email that Bermuda’s combined bank license and digital asset license application will help move stablecoin issuance from today’s non-bank-issued model, to a bank issued stablecoin model.  Jewel also plans to offer custody and banking services to crypto businesses from around the world.  “We’re talking not just large exchanges, but even hedge funds … The need is, in many ways, very basic, like finding a bank that can service digital assets companies with core banking and treasury needs,” said David Riker, Jewel’s chief development officer.  According to Riker, these core services include providing crypto exchanges with fiat currency on-and-off ramps, offering real-time transaction settlement and providing access to systems that are compatible with distributed ledger technology.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/13/jewel-welcomes-new-ceo-after-submitting-bank-license-in-bermuda,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10865f0ce450245e7683ff618a5657a2a25f9970-4000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The comedy collectibles startup has raised $3.5 million to build a comedian-focused NFT marketplace on the Flow blockchain, the company announced Wednesday.  The raise was led by Arrington Capital and Animoca Brands and included investment from Flow developer Dapper Labs, ParaFi Capital, LD Capital, Signum Capital, NextView Ventures, Ascensive Assets and Waterdrip Capital.  Jambb’s marketplace will host collectibles of jokes, sets and memorabilia from various comedians. The Boston-based startup says its marketplace will resemble Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot in offering packs of video-based collectibles of varying lengths, a representative told CoinDesk in an interview.  The company hosted the first NFT comedy show back in July – “Non-Fungible Jokin’” – that featured content from comedians Pete Holmes, Maria Bamford, Zainab Johnson and Beth Stelling.  Its next headliner will be Hannibal Buress, whose Oct. 13 set will be repurposed into various digital collectibles.  Like many musician-focused NFT marketplaces that have popped up in recent months, Jambb believes it can help comedians recover from financial difficulties caused by the pandemic, in addition to creating new ways for comedians to connect more personally with their fans.  “Several comedians referenced being on stage 200 times the year before and zero times last year,” Jambb CEO Alex DiNunzio told CoinDesk in an interview. “When we produced Non-Fungible Jokin’ in July, the majority of performers said that was their first time in front of a live audience in over a year.

A16z defines Web 3 as “a group of technologies that encompasses blockchain, cryptographic protocols, digital assets, decentralized finance and social platforms.”  The firm’s executives will encourage policymakers to create a national strategy for these technologies, developing appropriate regulations for the full range of products and services beyond just those that would be regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  A16z recently outlined what it sees as the key issues in decentralized finance (DeFi), suggesting the areas in which the U.S government could govern crypto and blockchain.

It is the response to the challenges that have emerged out of Web 2,” he said, referring to the current internet paradigm of user-generated content hosted by social media networks. “And for that reason, it is absolutely critical that policymakers start to undertake the steps required to get this right.”  A16z did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

42396745,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT59GV,1634119776,Declining Interest in Bitcoin-Margined Futures Promises Less Price Volatility,"Days of extreme price volatility during market downturns may be behind us because traders are increasingly using stablecoins or fiat currencies as collateral to trade futures contracts.  These contracts are an obligation to buy or sell the underlying at a later date at an agreed-upon price.  Since May, the percentage of coin-margined futures contracts open interest has been on the decline and recently fell below 50%, according to Glassnode data quoted by Delphi Digital in its daily analysis on Monday. Meanwhile, the percentage of the dollar or stablecoin-margined open interest is ticking higher. Open interest refers to number of futures contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position.  “The largest implication of that is likely to be less volatility around sell-offs,” Web Begole, chief technology officer at Exante Data, told CoinDesk in an email. “That’s because in coin-margined futures, losses are compounded during market downturns, which leads to exaggerated price declines.  The frenetic pace of crypto market downturns often draws the ire of skeptics and could keep risk-averse traditional market investors from venturing into the digital assets market. However, with volatility likely to subside, more mainstream money may flow into the market.  Suppose a trader uses bitcoin or ether to collateralize long futures position and the market drops. In that case, the collateral’s value declines along with the price of the futures contract.  A trader essentially takes a loss on both the collateral and the futures contract. Thus, margin requirements increase at a faster rate with price declines, and longs get liquidated relatively quickly. That, in turn, puts further downward pressure on the market, leading to a deeper slide, also known as leverage washouts, like the one seen in May. Long liquidation refers to forced closure (forced selling) of bullish positions due to margin shortage.  “The ‘crypto coin margined futures’ tend to be automated in their liquidation procedures. If the price drops below your level for margin, your position is immediately liquidated,” Begole said. “This is one factor in the large sell-offs crypto is known for as many over-leveraged long positions are forced to sell immediately as price declines, increasing the decline.”  Stack Funds’ COO and co-founder Matthew Dibb said the declining trend in the percentage of futures contracts open interest margined in cryptocurrencies signifies the market is far from being overheated.  “Coin-margined futures which carry an excessive degree of compounded leverage are usually in high demand during extreme runs and an overheating of the trend,” Dibb said. “Right now, [U.S.-dollar]-margined futures are also gaining a significant share, sparked by a rise in market share from exchanges such as FTX that allow advanced cross-collateralization.”  Stablecoin or fiat-margined futures offer linear payoff as the value of the collateral remains steady irrespective of market gyrations, and it frees traders from having to worry about constantly hedging their bitcoin collateral.  “More traditional CME-type futures contracts (as opposed to CFDs and even leveraged forex) tend to have a ‘margin call’ mechanism allowing the holder to add funds or close their position within a given time frame – or then the position is liquidated,” Exante’s Begole said. “This buffer allows for a bit more order to sell-offs and allows time for position holders to either weather a flash crash or at least step back and think for a moment.”  Bitcoin’s recent price move higher is accompanied by a sharp rise in open interest in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)-based futures.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with a value pegged to a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar. Tether Ltd.’s stablecoin tether, or USDT, is pegged to the dollar on a 1:1 basis. The market capitalization of all stablecoins has increased tenfold to nearly $130 billion this year, according to data provided by Messari.

Authorities in Zunyi, a city in China’s Guizhou province, were on the case for two months, following a directive from the State Council, China’s minister cabinet, according to a report from a local news site.  The police arrested 100 suspects and solved 332 cases of telecom fraud nationwide, according to the report.  China’s top regulators banned all crypto-related transactions on Sept. 24.  The accused pretended to be recruiting personnel for a company.  They opened trading accounts on crypto exchanges Binance, Huobi and OKEx using the information collected, “peddled” crypto by buying low and selling high, and laundered stolen funds through telecom fraud and other criminal acts, the article said.  The gang was able to conceal its actions for a while by using up to 500 bank cards and only transacting in small amounts.  Starting today, China’s ubiquitous messaging app WeChat appears to be blocking searches for “Binance” and “Huobi,” joining an earlier round of censoring on search engine Baidu and Twitter-like Weibo.  Zunyi is a city of 6 million people and is known for its important role in Chinese Communist Party history; it was at a meeting in Zunyi that Mao Zedong rose to the leadership of the party.

42396748,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT59HU,1634112000,Global Finance Watchdog Says $133B Stablecoin Sector Remains Niche,"A Financial Stability Board (FSB) survey has found that stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to real-world assets, are currently not being used at a significant scale for mainstream payments.  The finding was mentioned Wednesday in an FSB progress report for enhancing cross-border payments. The FSB published its first targets for improving cross-border payments in October of last year. Wednesday’s progress report acknowledged the market capitalization of existing stablecoins has continued to grow in the last two years, and that stablecoins could contribute to facilitating better cross-border payments.  The FSB is a Bank for International Settlements-funded entity that provides input into the global financial system. It is currently chaired by Federal Reserve Vice Chair Randal Quarles.  Overall, stablecoin issuers have minted more than $133 billion worth of tokens, according to CoinGecko.  “From a policy perspective, there is value in assessing whether and how the use of well-designed global [stablecoins] could enhance cross-border payments. An action to that extent has been added,” the report said.  Large players in cross-border payments, like MoneyGram, are already looking to use private stablecoins such as USDC in speeding up cross-border transactions, and regulators are getting nervous.  The FSB roadmap is only the latest institutional document to consider the role of private stablecoins in cross-border transactions, and how they should be regulated. Last week, the BIS published guidance on how international payments laws could be applied to stablecoins.  Meanwhile, global financial institutions are encouraging central banks to explore CBDCs. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) said central banks must consider the cross-border implications of CBDCs. Last month, Benoit Cœuré, the head of the BIS Innovation Hub, signaled central banks should speed up work on CBDCs in light of stablecoins.  “CBDCs will take years to be rolled out, while stablecoins and crypto assets are already here. This makes it even more urgent to start,” said Cœuré.  The FSB roadmap also said the implementation of stablecoin regulations across its member jurisdictions is still at a very early stage, and that countries are considering varied approaches. Authorities in jurisdictions have identified several issues that might be getting in the way of making “concrete recommendations,” including redemption rights, wallet providers and the management of stablecoin reserve assets, according to the report.  “As a next step, the FSB will review, in consultation with other relevant [standard-setting bodies] and international organizations, the FSB high-level recommendations and how any gaps identified could be addressed by existing frameworks, and update recommendations if needed, by July 2023,” the report said.  The roadmap also refers to the latest research and studies in CBDCs, and how they might contribute to improving cross-border payments. A recent BIS study concluded that CBDCs could potentially slash costs and processing time for cross-border settlements.  The FSB roadmap says the IMF and WB should be prepared to provide technical assistance on how to facilitate cross border use of CBDCs if requested as early as July 2022.",NEUTRAL,USDC,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | USDC,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/13/global-finance-watchdog-says-133b-stablecoin-sector-remains-niche,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/148a876a492181b4dd723a9a5dba0a7841c62429-3008x2005.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange will also run “inventory” on its users to ensure none are located in mainland China. Chinese users will have their accounts switched to “withdrawal only” so they can close their positions. These users will be notified by email seven days before their accounts are closed.  A Sept. 24 announcement from China’s top financial and tech regulators declared all crypto-related transactions illegal, and kick-started a renewed crackdown on crypto in the country.  As a result, dozens of exchanges, wallets and other crypto firms have shut down or will be retiring China-based user accounts. Notably, Huobi announced it will be gradually expelling all Chinese users.  The day after the Sept. 24 policy update, Binance stopped accepting Chinese phone numbers for registration, Bloomberg reported.

In its “Global Financial Stability Report,” released Tuesday, the global financial institution said “cryptoization,” or the use of digital currency by a country, carries “significant risks and is an inadvisable shortcut” for developing countries trying to boost their economies.  The IMF report warned that countries adopting bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as legal tender could hamper their central banks’ efforts to set monetary policy, cause liquidity risks and destabilize economies.  Although the report doesn’t name El Salvador, the IMF has said repeatedly the Central American country’s Bitcoin Law poses “macroeconomic, financial and legal issues.”  Read More:The IMF’s Self-Serving Case Against Bitcoin  The report highlighted three “challenging transitions” for the global economy: the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and cryptocurrencies. In recent months, the IMF has expressed deep reservations about the impact of cryptocurrency, even as it tries to encourage innovation that can help the developing world.  To avoid the risks of cryptoization, the report suggested countries enact policies that could help curtail growing crypto demand, including strengthening monetary policy, safeguarding the independence of central banks and implementing “effective legal and regulatory measures to disincentivize foreign currency use.”  Additionally, the report suggested governments in developing countries consider central bank digital currencies (CBDC) that could reduce the need for crypto by satisfying domestic demand for improved payment technologies.  Stablecoins  The report also identified stablecoins such as tether and USDC as potential threats to the global financial system, and suggested that “substantial upgrades” to disclosure standards for stablecoin issuers, on par with those for commercial banks and money market funds, be used to ensure the stability of the stablecoin market. The booming $120 billion stablecoin industry is largely unregulated – something that has become a sore spot for regulators in the U.S. and globally.  The report also highlighted the risk of runs on stablecoin issuers, citing the panic selling in June that took Iron Finance’s titan token down to near zero. Runs could, according to the report, have larger systemic risks, including “trigger[ing] a fire sale of commercial paper.”",NEGATIVE,USDC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/13/imf-report-views-cryptoization-as-threat-to-global-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9aa38068c3b0892912e8059926bcdd96e77ae24a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
