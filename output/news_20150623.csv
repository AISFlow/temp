42398459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWLW,1435086639,FBI: Recent Bitcoin Ransomware Losses Top $18 Million,"The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has received reports of more than $18m in losses in the past year stemming from the spread of the bitcoin ransomware Cryptowall and its related variants.  A 23rd June advisory from the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center stated that the agency received 992 complaints related to Cryptowall between April 2014 and June 2015.  Cyberattacks involving Cryptowall and other types of ransomware encrypt data on the target’s computer, holding that information hostage unless a ransom – generally in bitcoin – is paid. Targets in the past have ranged from law enforcement offices to public schools.  In many cases, the losses incurred by victims have stemmed largely from post-attack costs, according to the advisory.  The notice read:  “The financial impact to victims goes beyond the ransom fee itself, which is typically between $200 and $10,000. Many victims incur additional costs associated with network mitigation, network countermeasures, loss of productivity, legal fees, IT services and/or the purchase of credit monitoring services for employees or customers.”  The advisory stated that the majority of the attacks involve ransoms paid in bitcoin, adding that the digital currency provides a number of useful advantages.  “Criminals prefer bitcoin because it's easy to use, fast, publicly available, decentralized and provides a sense of heightened security/anonymity,"" the notice read.

42398451,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWGb,1435082457,Bitreserve Names New CEO in Leadership Shift,"Bitreserve has announced a change of leadership, one that sees its chief operating officer and president Anthony Watson taking on the role of CEO.  Watson, who previous served as CIO for Nike, follows founder Halsey Minor in the CEO role. Minor will stay on as a board member and ""chief visionary"" with a focus on long-term product planning.  In the announcement post, Minor wrote that Tim Parsa – who previously served as the company's CEO – has been named the company's chief compliance officer and head of regulatory affairs.  Watson said that his promotion to the CEO role had been planned since he first joined Bitreserve earlier this year, framing the move ""a logical extension"" of his relationship with the company.  Watson told CoinDesk:  ""In terms of the leadership change, this was always something in the pipeline. It was something we discussed when I came in, myself and Halsey. I can call him one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. Literally brilliant.""  The leadership change comes amid of a service push by the company.  Earlier this month, Bitreserve announced free currency conversions for verified users, and recently launched Bitreserve Connect, a developer platform that Watson said has exceeded expectations in terms of developer interest.  The company is planning further roll-outs over the course of the summer and beyond. Declining to offer specifics, Watson said Bitreserve is planning ""game-changing"" announcements and characterized them as a mixture of hires, partnerships and product releases.

42398462,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWNU,1435068033,Tango Card Adds Bitcoin as Latest Reward Option,"Venture-backed rewards-as-a-service startup Tango Card will now offer bitcoin as a reward option alongside gift cards for popular brands such as Amazon, Fandango, Starbucks and Zappos.  The reward option is the result of Tango Card's decision to integrate a new API from bitcoin merchant processing service provider Snapcard. Called the MassPay API, the platform will allow Tango Card users to select bitcoin as a desired reward on its e-reward platform, thereby sending the funds to their Snapcard wallet.  According to Snapcard co-founder Ioannis Giannaros, the partnership is just one demonstration of the API, which the company described as a back-end payments management system to complement its front-end tools for accepting bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Giannaros told CoinDesk:  ""We helped Tango Card integrate and then, after building the API, we recognized that this had better implications and use cases for large enterprises.""  The MassPay API, according to the company, allows merchants to hold funds in US dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and euros, before converting those funds into bitcoin and sending payments to SMS phones and email addresses via an API call.  Fund recipients will then be able to cash out bitcoin in 15 local currencies through instant and next-day transfers from the Snapcard wallet for a 0.25% fee.  For now, however, Tango Card VP of partnerships Nat Salvione suggested his company will focus on bitcoin as a means to improve its rewards platform.  “Bitcoin is a fantastic addition to our rewards catalog,” Salvione said. “It is truly frictionless, global and, most importantly, desired by the participants in our customers rewards programs.""  Tango Card has so far raised $10.3m in three rounds, with its most recent $3.3 Series B taking place in early 2014.

42398450,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWHa,1435066862,Bitcoin Network Survives Surprise Stress Test,"A planned 'ultimate stress test' for the bitcoin network has passed without major incident, though the company organizing the event said it was only able to send 15% of the transaction volume it had intended.  Bitcoin brokerage CoinWallet.eu had planned the stress test starting 22 June at 13:00 GMT, to last for 100 blocks. It had sought to spend 20 BTC (around $5,000) on transactions totaling about 200MB in data.  The original intention was to flood the bitcoin network with transactions to see if the current 1MB block size was adequate at such volume, and if the network could recover quickly from a surge.  CoinWallet's stated aim was to demonstrate that the 1MB block size is inadequate if bitcoin is to become ""anything more than a costly science project"".  Ten bitcoin servers would send transactions at two per second, each approximately 3KB in size and each sending to 10–20 addresses. Outputs from those transactions (totalling larger transactions of around 15-30KB) would then be combined and sent back to the original servers.  This followed a series of shorter tests CoinWallet performed over the past few days.  Testing issues  However, CoinWallet's servers failed and the test could not be completed at the volumes planned.  The company posted on Reddit:  ""At 17:00 GMT our BitcoinD servers crashed. The servers were restarted but failed to meet our planned transaction volume. The max pending backlog was 15MB. Far short of the 200MB goal. By late evening the test was considered complete. Approximately 15% of our planned transaction volume occurred.""  CoinWallet said it will launch another test in seven days.  Reactions  CoinWallet had faced criticism for launching the test live on an unsuspecting bitcoin network, with some calling it an 'attack'.  Others though, like bitcoin developer Peter Todd, were curious to see its effects and posted instructions on how users could ensure their transactions still went though.  For most, the test period appears to have passed without incident.  There were some anecdotal reports of transaction delays posted online, though it has not been ascertained that they were a result of the test or other circumstances.  Higher transaction fees  CoinWallet attached a range of different fees to its test transactions to see whether everyday more bitcoin transactions would be delayed. Some of the test fees exceeded 10,000 satoshi (0.0001 BTC) per KB of transaction data.  Wallet software maker MultiBit posted on its website that transactions with only 1,000 satoshi (0.00001 BTC) fee per KB were delayed during the test, some of them taking as much as 87 blocks to confirm.  The MultiBit HD wallet has a default setting of 3,000 satoshi (0.00003 BTC) per KB, which is user-adjustable between 1,000 and 10,000 satoshi.  Transactions set at the default 3,000 satoshi took from 11–80 blocks to confirm, and those set at the maximum 10,000 satoshi took an average of nine.  The team concluded:  ""When the Bitcoin network is flooded with transactions at a particular fee level, transactions with lower fees do not get confirmed in a timely manner.""  While most in bitcoin have argued recently for the size of a single 10-minute transaction block to increase to either 8MB or 20MB to handle larger volumes, others prefer the status quo.  BitTorrent protocol creator Bram Cohen wrote in a blog post titled Bitcoin's Ironic Crisis yesterday that 1MB block sizes are preferable, as this would lead to more competition in transaction fees and in turn benefit the miners who keep the network secure.

42398435,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTUvx,1435064439,Blockchain Capital Raises $7 Million for Startup Fund,"Blockchain Capital has raised $7m toward a second investment fund for bitcoin and blockchain technology ventures.  The firm  , formerly known as Crypto Currency Partners, is helmed by Bitcoin Foundation board chairman Brock Pierce. It has invested more than $1.2m in 29 bitcoin and blockchain industry startups including Blockstream, Coinbase, Ripple Labs and Xapo to date.  Notably, the rebranding comes at a time when many of the more mainstream companies associating with the technology, including Nasdaq and USAA, are voicing their interest in the blockchain, bitcoin's underlying decentralized ledger.  Managing partner Bart Stephens, however, sees Blockchain Capital's rebranding as a choice that is less on trend and more accurate in representing his firm's current understanding of the sector.  Stephens told CoinDesk:  ""We've realized that the currency aspect of bitcoin is too narrow to define the industry. We see blockchain as the foundational technology layer, the software that enables you to exchange value, all different types of assets, whether it's the keys to your car or the key to your house.""  In line with this broader mission, Blockchain Capital will also seek to open up its investments to a sister syndicate on AngelList that it said is expected to invest in its portfolio companies.  The company also formally announced the addition of Royal Bank of Scotland and Fiserv director Alison Davis to its advisory board, a position she has held since February 2015. Davis has previously served as a board member for Barclays Global Investments, First Data and Xoom, among others.  Blockchain Capital said it will aim to add an additional $3m to the round as it seeks to advance toward a second closing of the fund.  Bitcoin first  Rebranding aside, Blockchain Capital and its partners remain convinced that bitcoin will grow to be the largest and most important shared database that enables this new wave of exchange.  While startups including Eris Industries, Hyperledger and OneName are working on permissioned ledgers or alternative blockchains, Stephens indicated his firm will continue to focus on bitcoin and its blockchain.  ""We get a lot of questions on other blockchains and altcoins in particular. With the exception of Ripple, we haven't seen a lot of competitive blockchains,"" Stephens continued. ""We see the bitcoin blockchain being the winner.""  On this point, Stephens cited the common argument that bitcoin will have a continued network effect as the largest blockchain.  ""We believe that even though bitcoin has a PR problem, it's the winner and the most robust ecosystem. The high-quality entrepreneurs, they're starting bitcoin companies, not dogecoin companies.""  Stephens also indicated that Blockchain Capital would seek to invest in bitcoin startups focused on the use of bitcoin as a currency. Across both bitcoin and blockchain startups, he suggested the firm would invest at both seed and later-stage rounds.  Non-financial use cases  According to Stephens, the next two to five years will be categorized by a new wave of industry startups focused on the blockchain's use beyond financial services.  ""More than $700m has been invested in the blockchain and bitcoin ecosystem, almost all of those companies have been bitcoin related,"" he said.  ""The term blockchain to us means that the blockchain is the infrastructure layer that enables the exchange of value, just like TCP/IP enabled the exchange of data on the Internet. For us, value can be all sort of things.""  Stephens described such investments as those that would take blockchain technology beyond its current small user base to reach 100 million or even 1 billion users.  ""The first round of bitcoin enthusiasts were fundamental anti-bank or against central authorities. All of those people have already discovered bitcoin, the question is how do you get past that first wave of early adopters,"" he said, concluding:  ""The only question to focus on is, 'How do we get mass adoption?'""

42398426,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTUzt,1435053750,DEA Agent Makes Plea Deal in Silk Road Corruption Case,"Carl Mark Force IV, the DEA agent accused of stealing nearly $1m-worth of bitcoin during an investigation into the Silk Road, has reportedly struck a plea deal with prosecutors.  This follows last week's guilty plea by a US Secret Service agent involved with the case, Shaun Bridges, to money laundering and wire fraud.  As reported by Bloomberg, a Monday court filing at the US District Court in San Francisco, California, revealed Force will plead guilty to charges including money laundering and extortion. He will face a hearing on 1st July to enter the pleas.  Force's crimes  As well as stealing bitcoins from Silk Road's wallets and transferring over $200,000 in fiat to a personal account in Panama, Force is accused of committing several questionable acts against other companies and bitcoin users unrelated to the Silk Road case.  According to the filings  , the 46-year-old DEA agent of 15 years went rogue with a string of authorized and unauthorized undercover identities, at times offering his services as an insider to companies like Mt Gox.  When payments startup Venmo froze his accounts for suspicious transactions, Force allegedly sent the company a fake subpoena, embarking on a personal campaign to have the company investigated and its accounts seized.  He is also accused of 'flashing his badge' at popular exchange Bitstamp when that company flagged his account for suspicious activity. It was said that this pattern of behavior eventually became Force's undoing, as the companies reported it to his superiors.  Force, also licensed as a CPA in Maryland, also marketed his services as a bitcoin tax expert after Silk Road had been shut down.  He also managed to get a de facto compliance officer position with bitcoin trading platform CoinMKT, where he allegedly froze a customer's acccount and stole from it.  Government kept allegations secret  That fact that two federal agents involved with the Silk Road case had been arrested and charged with crimes resulting from their investigation was not revealed until after the trial of Ross Ulbricht, who was found guilty of masterminding the project.  Ulbricht's defense lawyer Joshua Dratel described the non-disclosure during the trial as a ""monumental scandal"".  The agents' corruption also did not have any mitigating effect on Ulbricht's sentencing, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment on 29th May.  Ulbricht's team filed an appeal against both the sentence and conviction on 5th June. He also faces a murder-for-hire charge separate to the main case, which was part of Bridges' and Force's Baltimore investigation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/23/dea-agent-makes-plea-deal-in-silk-road-corruption-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/364cb1e4853890219e3b74c11946b17fccd24a89-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
