42397634,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDatA,1400349723,Bitcoin2014 Day Two Roundup: Tackling Bitcoin's Tough Issues,"At day two of the Bitcoin2014 conference, attendees learned about the regulatory issues being faced by bitcoiners in China, upcoming technological challenges and bitcoin investment opportunities.      Later in the day, BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi shared plans for his company's expansion, the topic of the mining arms race was addressed and the Startup Challenge awards were won by CoinPrism and Reality Keys.    Troubles in China    Bobby Lee opened day two of Bitcoin2014 with a presentation about the rollercoaster ride bitcoin has experienced in China.      Lee is the CEO of bitcoin exchange BTC China and was recently elected to the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.      He explained the troubles the currency has faced in the country over the past five months, talking the audience through the suppressive actions taken by the People's Bank of China.      Lee outlined the current situation: there have been no written orders from the central bank, but all the major Chinese banks have stopped dealing with bitcoin exchanges, with some closing their customers' corporate and personal accounts. He said:      ""It's had a very chilling effect. Due to the verbal guidance over the past few months, people are spooked.""              Lee suggested it hadn’t helped that the state-controlled media has switched its stance on bitcoin, now only reporting negative stories about digital currency.      He explained laws in China are purposely ambiguous, enabling the government to adapt or update the rules as and when it pleases. Unfortunately, this means there is no way of telling what the government's next move will be.      Lee doesn't think bitcoin has run its course in China, but he later revealed in a conversation with CoinDesk that he was exploring the potential of moving his business overseas.    Technical challenges    Next up was a panel discussion looking at the technical challenges bitcoin is set to face in the near future.      The session was moderated by Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, an angel investor group for digital currencies, which has invested at least $7 million into digital currency startups.      Bitcoin 2.0 was the first topic on the agenda, with the panellists discussing the potential merits and pitfalls of adding services other than digital currency onto the block chain.      Maidsafe CEO David Irvine, who has embarked on an ambitious project to ‘decentralize all Internet services, including enterprise data centers’, told the audience that the digital currency community shouldn't ""pray to the block chain"".      He elaborated by explaining that a number of decentralised systems with different purposes can exist side-by-side, they don't have to all stem from the bitcoin block chain.      The discussion turned to the technological advances that need to be made this year. Irvine said the main priority should be the development of a user-friendly bitcoin wallet.      John Light, founder of Buttonwood SF and PawnCoin, thinks multisig will really take off in 2014, labelling it ""two-factor-authentication that is backed up by the block chain"".      BitPay's Ryan Charles, on the other hand, said he thinks it is inevitable that hardware bitcoin wallets will increase in popularity.      Alternative cryptocurrencies were praised by panellist number four, Sean Neville, Circle’s co-founder and CTO, whose company finally unveiled its plan to bring bitcoin to the masses this week.      ""Experimentation is fantastic,"" he concluded.    BitPay's expansion plans    “Amsterdam has more per-capita penetration for bitcoin than any other country,” enthused BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi as he kicked off his presentation on driving business adoption, adding that the ability to eat, sleep, pay bills and even medicate yourself with the currency is what makes the conference's host city so unique.      His presentation tackled a wide-range of issues faced by consumers today, including credit card fraud, “It claims 12 million victims each year,” and outdated payments technology:      “Credit cards were never designed for the Internet. They’ve changed [very little] in 55 years.”              By contrast, Gallippi was bullish on bitcoin's future, revealing impressive growth statistics – over 30,000 merchants worldwide and an expanding team spanning three continents – and an appetite for technological innovation.      The CEO emphasised BitPay’s continued commitment to open-source development, citing the hire of Jeff Garzik, as well as the company's Bitcore, Copay and Insight initiatives.      Hailing 2014 as the year of multisig, Gallippi revealed how few users actually use it:      ""On [bitcoin's] top 100 rich list of addresses, not one is secured with multisig.""              However, he predicted that 10% of bitcoin assets would be stored using multiple signatures by the end of 2014.      Following BitPay's record-breaking funding round earlier this week, Gallippi finished with equally ambitious expansion plans to open an Amsterdam bitcoin centre. “We’ll call it ABC until it has a real name,” he quipped.      The high-tech space will play host to everyone from central bankers to investors, startups and developers. In Gallippi's words: “We all accelerate faster as a group.”      Co-authored by Emily Spaven and Grace Caffyn      Images by Grace Caffyn",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/05/17/bitcoin2014-day-two-roundup-tackling-bitcoins-tough-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffcdae8955ad77a77ef84dfc9f04599d3f64beaa-1024x658.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397629,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDapE,1400333769,Roger Ver Joins Investor Panel to Talk Bitcoin's Next Step,"A panel of seasoned bitcoin investors joined the New York Times' Nathaniel Popper today at Bitcoin2014 to discuss the current and future opportunities in the digital currency space.  Angel investor Roger Ver told Popper he's not actively looking to make any new investments, choosing, instead, to focus his attention on the investments he's already made. The Memory Dealers CEO went on to extoll the virtues of one of the companies he has invested in – Blockchain.info.  He suggested the future of bitcoin is in this company and others that enable users to fully control their finances.  Nick Shalek of Ribbit Capital and Cross Pacific Capital's Marc van der Chijs somewhat disagreed, claiming that centralised services would appeal more to the mass market.  ""I put most of my coins into Blockchain, but I don't think most people are ready for that yet,"" explained van der Chijs.  He went on to suggest that most people want something that is easy to use, resembles their online banking platform and offers centrally administered security.  Core infrastructure  Popper asked the panel whether they thought investing directly into development of the bitcoin core should be encouraged and whether there is enough of an incentive to do so.  The overall sentiment was that it's more important to fund the development of the layers being built on top of the protocol than spending money on the improvement of the base protocol itself.  Van der Chijs said he doesn't believe in investing in core developers, as doing so doesn't provide an obvious direct return. He conceded that, in the long-term, the investment could prove worthwhile, but it would be difficult to get many investors to pay up on that basis.  The next price jump  Popper asked the panel members what they thought would cause the next increase in the bitcoin price.  Shalek believes the community shouldn't be constantly sitting in wait for a big event and that since bitcoin – as a store of value and an investment vehicle – has brought the price from nothing to where it is now, it has the potential to see the value rise even further.  Van der Chijs, however, said we would witness an ""explosion in prices"" once the Winklevoss twins' bitcoin ETF comes online, but said a bigger increase will come with the development of a ""killer app"" that will bring digital currency to the mainstream.  Bitcoin and messaging  Steve Waterhouse of Pantera Capital, which has invested in the bitcoin companies Circle and Bitstamp, said more companies need to look into the possibility of combining bitcoin transaction functionality to messaging apps.  ""I think if you look at different Internet-based systems we've being building over the past 20 years, the best ones involve messaging,"" he explained.  Ver agreed, suggesting that the next ""logical step"" for apps such as WhatsApp is to enable the sending and receipt of bitcoins.  Future investments  When asked where in the world the panel members are looking to focus their investment in the near future, Waterhouse said he believes there are some great opportunities outside the US.  He revealed Pantera is actively looking for opportunities in Asia and Europe and is trying to predict which of these regions will experience a bitcoin boom first.  Van der Chijs believes investment opportunities could soon arise in Argentina or some other nation suffering under high rates of inflation, as he predicts one of these countries will be the next to witness a surge in bitcoin adoption.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/17/roger-ver-joins-investor-panel-to-talk-bitcoins-next-step,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/716f1abcc34d81a6787b1975477ebbc3bc6d3a11-1024x629.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDaw7,1400333063,What Block Chain Analysis Tells Us About Bitcoin,"In this piece, CoinDesk contributor Tim Swanson takes a look at the latest block chain data in an attempt to draw new conclusions about how bitcoins are being spent, why they're being held and what this may mean for the burgeoning market.  John Ratcliff is a principal engineer at NVIDIA who has a unique hobby, using 3-D tools to visualize block chain analytics. Over the past several months he has created visual aids for the community, in part to help show trends and highlight uncertainty.  For instance, below is a pie chart of UTXO (unspent transaction outputs), better known as bitcoins and their distribution by age. That is to say the amount of bitcoins based on their last use.  Here's his original chart from January:  The following chart is an updated version based on the bitcoin block chain as of 30th April.  As you can see, the oldest coins have still not budged or moved in the subsequent months for reasons described in a recent paper (pdf).  Investor impact  The most surprising area of growth is the three-to-six month section.  While there could be a variety of reasons for why this is now the largest segment (e.g., lost, stolen tokens, Goxcoins), the timing coincides with the November price bubble that peaked at $1100 per bitcoin - it has since fallen to roughly $450.  That is to say, these holders could and likely did buy during the peak and are simply underwater. If that is the case, rather than cashing out and realizing a loss, they are holding them and waiting (with the hope) that there will be a rally in prices once more.  Some readers may be thinking that two data points are not enough to draw a conclusion. For instance, what does the block chain distribution look like over the past year?  After exchanging some thoughts and theories with Ratcliff, he put together a very interesting animation of the daily changes in distribution based on age starting from the genesis block on 3rd January 2009 to 14th May (here is the raw data). Spoiler alert: not much happens the first year.  At the beginning of January 2014, the three-to-six months segment represented only 6.8% of all tokens.  Now it represents more than 3 million UTXOs in part because people probably do not want to unload because of the ongoing bear market.  However, the activity that is generally associated to commerce happens solely on the left side of the bar graph, in the period of a week or less, representing roughly 10% of all mined bitcoins. Yet as far as how much is related to day traders, gambling sites (e.g., Satoshi Dice, Prime Dice), remittances or other activity that cannot be determined by this method.  In Ratcliff’s view, ""we know what and where the liquid bitcoins are. And what is interesting about the graph is that it shows the difference in liquidity at different time periods"".  He is currently working on releasing a number of other ways to visualize this type of data beginning with the genesis block (i.e., showing every token on every address in 3-D). In addition, he has another shorter clip from 9th March 2013 through 12th May 2014.  Cautious conclusions  Yet, he says that you cannot definitively jump to conclusions from it.  For instance, if Bob moves 100,000 bitcoins, outside observers do not know what Bob was doing (moving a wallet like Bitstamp did in November, conducting real commerce, betting, etc.).  In Ratcliff’s view, his approach has one key distinction, if Bob has a bitcoin address and he spends one bitcoin (UTXO), observers will view that event as if Bob moved just one bitcoin – Ratcliff is marking age as age of last spend transaction.  This then proves that Bob still controls this address (an address which represents inputs and outputs) - this address is not dead which is a subtle distinction.  To him, what you can see is X% of bitcoins that are liquid (moving on a weekly basis), X% that are being ""saved"" and X% (or in this case, 30%) that may be gone forever. It is unclear if someone such as Satoshi Nakamoto (who is alleged to control approximately 1 million bitcoins) still controls the keys or how much market uncertainty this will create.  For additional analysis, I contacted Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Coinometrics for his insights on this tool and approach. He explains:    ""The underwater explanation for the three-to-six month period is plausible but the problem with the method is that this measure is highly susceptible to changes in the exchanges and so inferring behaviour of individuals is difficult. If Bitstamp has not done another reshuffle since the one last year that would probably show up in the three-to-six month section.      I am interested in the one month and one week decreases as well. It seems that less bitcoins are being moved around the block chain now rather than in January. We have also seen volumes on the exchanges drop since December levels which may explain some of this drop.""    Alternative approaches to analysis  This picture has also been making the rounds on social media and on CoinDesk:  The original source is a Technology Review infographic.  Yet, the data source mentions Sarah Meiklejohn, author of one of the best papers in this space, ""A Fistful of Bitcoins"" (pdf). I contacted her and she said that the data in question comes from Figure 3 in the same paper.  However, the likely explanation to the infographic is that mining pools and farms typically must sell off their bitcoins to cover their operating costs which makes it difficult to isolate actual commerce from mining activity.  What the graphic probably visualizes is the competitiveness and professionalization of the industry.  Virtually all miners have to spend their tokens within a month of mining them. This is not real economic activity for the ecosystem as nearly all of those funds are converted to a foreign exchange (fiat currency) and then paid to a utility or hardware company, this does not improve the protocol or its usability.  Another depiction of the network activity are these two charts:  The chart above is the on-chain transactional volume over the past year excluding the top 100 popular addresses (such as gambling sites).  The chart above visualizes bitcoin days destroyed (BDD) which basically measures old coins that move.  Basically, the older and larger the amount, the larger the leverage point (as statisticians call it). What these two charts show is that there is very little new movement in the chain.  One of the reasons this is worth mentioning is because at the beginning of 2014 there was an estimated 20,000 – 30,000 merchants that accepted bitcoins for payment. By the end of the first quarter, approximately 60,000 merchants accepted bitcoins. Yet there has been very little corresponding on-chain growth.  Instead, most of the growth is on the edges, in trust-me silos. The occasional spikes are outliers involving exchanges moving wallets from one wallet to another (such as Bitstamp did and Mt. Gox purportedly did).  Regarding BDD, Jonathan Levin said:  ""It seems that aside from the big spikes which are ‘security measures, there are relatively few bitcoins that are being actively traded and moved around the block chain. Estimating this amount of supply comes from pie charts. I would give an estimate for this active supply of bitcoins by taking the six month figure.”  Block chain analytics and forensics is a nascent yet exciting field of study that will bring to light what kind of real activity is taking place on public ledgers. And trailblazers like John Ratcliff, Jonathan Levin and Sarah Meiklejohn are individuals to keep your eye on.

42397639,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDax6,1400329847,The Year of Multisig: How is it Doing So Far?,"2014 has been touted by some as the ‘Year of Multisig’ – including most recently by Gavin Andresen at Bitcoin2014 in Amsterdam – and for one big reason: the number of services which support multi-signature transactions is increasing. In this article, Thomas Kerin charts the story of this emerging technology to date, addressing some key questions using data obtained from the block chain.  If you’re not sure about multisig, here’s a brief primer. Multi-signature addresses allow multiple parties to partially seed an address with a public key. When someone wants to spend some of the bitcoins, they need some of these people to sign their transaction in addition to themselves. The needed number of signatures is agreed at the start when people create the address.  Since multiple signatures are needed before funds can be spent, the additional signatures could come from, say, a business partner, your significant other, or even from a second device which you own, to add a second factor to spending your coins.  Imagine a safe in a bank that needs two keys to unlock the safe at any time – the bank's key and your personal key. Multi-signature addresses capture the essence of this but without needing to be in the same place. And since the keys can be in separate places, it’s unlikely an attacker can compromise both; whereas with regular bitcoin addresses, the attacker knows roughly who to target, and could compromise the server in any number of ways just to steal the wallet file.  Services using multi-signature addresses have a much greater resistance to theft, since instead of just needing access to the servers wallet, funds are protected by the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), a far greater barrier than the security a website could implement in its code.  Are multisignature addresses new or something?  They aren’t really! They were first realised in 2012, once support was added for ‘pay-to-script-hash’ addresses. When funds are sent to this address, the script used to make the address known only to the owner, instead of including it in the funding transaction. This script enforces who can and can’t spend the bitcoins at that address. The addresses also look different, starting with 3 instead of 1.  Pay-to-script-hash is the precursor to multisig, and multisig is just one complicated use-case of P2SH.  Take this transaction for example: 112ae9859731f671ec3593de5790ed026d06d23134ba284aec811bc8f50e96b3 – actually the 6th P2SH transaction ever to occur – reveals a script of ‘5357’, which simply means push the numbers 3 and 7 into memory. This script is hashed, and used to create the actual address: 37paP4uTjmA4Pi85LG6CF9huift3Dw1kFT. Any funds sent to this address can in fact now be stolen, since people know the script doesn’t check who is actually spending the funds. So it’s a bit like the 1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T (correct horse battery staple) of P2SH.  It’s a very simple demonstration of P2SH, which lead to the more complicated, but naturally far more secure use case – multi-signature transactions.  Why haven’t I heard of them yet?  Multi-signature addresses and transactions are still a bit complicated to carry out. Currently only the Bitcoin Core software can handle them fully, even without storing the block chain, but you still need to use the console. Lately we are seeing more and more services popping up which aim to bridge this gap, and expose multi-signature transactions in a user-friendly way.  The Coinbin site allows you to create bitcoin private and public keys, create multi-signature addresses, and sign transactions from them. It’s a very simple site, but currently doesn’t support compressed keys, so is incompatible with Bitcoin Core. Everyone needs to be using uncompressed keys, which Coinbin will generate at least.  Onchain.io  Onchain is a vault for Electrum & BIP0032 master public keys, and is working on a website and an Android app to sign multi-signature transactions for addresses in its wallet. Using deterministic wallets means users can submit their extended public key to a site just once, and public keys will be generated from this. The app will also accept QR codes of multi-signature transactions for signing, making them incredibly easy to use.  How much are they used?  Using data I obtained from QuantaBytes, a blockchain analysis company based in Ireland, I was able to learn about the different types of multi-signature addresses being used to date and how often. All this data is publically available if you scrape the block chain, but I learned the hard way that this takes forever.  In the data used in this report, which spans from block 170,052 up to 297,445 (about 7th March to 24th April this year), 24,591 transaction outputs were identified which paid to a script-hash address. Of these, 14,123 outputs came from eight spam transactions, each paying 1 Satoshi to random addresses. They have been ignored throughout this article. 70% of the remaining valid transactions were redeemed, and hence revealed the script behind the address.  From the transactions which were redeemed, we could learn the script, and hence the type of multi-signature address – i.e., if it was 2 of 2, 3 of 5, etc.  We see that 2 of 3 addresses are the most frequently used type of address, followed by 2 of 2. 2 of 3 allows for escrow between a buyer, seller, and third party, but no one person can ever walk away with the funds without agreement from another. Many services, such as BitGo, Bitalo, GreenWallet, and BitWasp have started using these addresses as one-use addresses for transactions and orders.  2 of 2 addresses have recently been implemented in Mycelium’s built in face-to-face exchange feature. It uses multi-signature addresses and a transaction lock time to protect the funds during the exchange.  The rows in blue in the above graphs are by the current networks' rules non-standard, and technically shouldn’t be in the blockchain, as unmodified clients won’t relay them to other nodes in the network. The Eligius mining pool has removed the standard check, and mine non-standard transactions for a fee, but out of all the transactions analyzed only 0.36% were non standard.  29.7% of all the redeemed outputs were reused addresses. Many of the above services take a unique public key from each party to create the order address, meaning we should expect mostly unique addresses.  The following graphs show the frequency of the most common multi-signature address types: 1 of 2, 2 of 2, 2 of 3, and 3 of 3 over time. The results are split into two halves; the first is from block 170,052 to 227,500, and the second is 230,000 to 297,445.  While the first graph is scattered and inconsistent, the second shows a clear increase in the frequency of 2 of 2 and 2 of 3 addresses, starting around November 2013. I expect this trend to increase, as more and more services adopt this transaction type over others.  It’s not without good reason. Multi-signature addresses can secure your cold storage bitcoins with physically remote keys. You can have greater redundancy by using more keys, to protect against loss.  If services which offer multi-signature addresses to transacting parties ever go offline, the funds can still be recovered if the two parties can still communicate. It makes it much more difficult to scam users, or to be dishonest about how much funds are actually on the website.  By simply using multi-signature transactions in the first place, you can have a prenominated third party step in to arbitrate the dispute, and possibly recover your funds from the address.  The above graph shows the number of redeeming transactions from 2 of 3 addresses, which redeemed only one unspent amount at the address, paying to two separate addresses, where the ratio of one to the other was less than 8%. This was to approximate the average percent fee of an escrow mediator, along with sites commission for the transaction – potentially giving numbers to transactions processed by wallet providers, or marketplaces using multi-signature transactions.  2,410 transactions from the dataset matched the above criteria and were used in the graph. While unclear if the transactions originate from a wallet provider, or a marketplace using multi-signature transactions, the most common percent charged seems to be around 0-0.2%, before almost steadily decreasing as the percentage increases.  So, the Year of Multisig is shaping up nicely. The numbers clearly show their use is surging, and with initiatives like BitPay's BitCore – a javascript library providing core bitcoin functionality and access to the network – this area is sure to see more active development, with people working on the core stack or writing their own services using it.  It’s important to have a lead development of such a framework at this time. Without it, startups must weigh if it’s worth the time and money to research and implement all the required functionality for themselves, and possibly get it wrong. If everyone has to repeat this effort, it doesn’t do much for innovation, so saving a trusted codebase makes it far easier for a service to consider using multisig.  There is no shortage of wallet providers at present. Multi-signature wallet providers have gotten around the lack of client support by using client-side scripts derived from projects like BitCore or BitcoinJS to create the transaction signature, rather than forcing them to use other software. I do anticipate that eventually most sites won’t tout multisig as a feature. It’ll be expected – and if they do a good enough job, their users don’t even have to know they’re using it.  I would like to see more platforms which assist with signing multi-signature transactions, enabling people to make full use the protocol, instead of aiming to be a wallet provider. The possibilities that stem from multi-signature transactions are limitless, but the supporting tools and infrastructure just aren't there. I have high hopes for Onchain.io – whose app should make it as simple as scanning two QR codes, bringing something close to the protocol P2SH at this early stage.  Using a website to look after your bitcoins is very much against the bitcoin ethos. While it’s an acceptable solution for many, the impetus for this shouldn’t be lack of support from software like Electrum, and Armory. Tools which enable two-factor protection for funds across devices, and facilitate signing transactions proposed by marketplaces, exchanges, and wallets are a must.  I think addressing this key issue will really reduce the barrier to using multi-signature transactions in general, allowing more and more people to embrace this amazing technology, and really make it the Year of Multisig.

42397621,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDahM,1400322308,Breaking Down the Butterfly Labs FTC Complaints Data,"Customers in 24 countries have made 283 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against Kansas-based mining equipment maker Butterfly Labs since 2012, as we reported earlier this week.  Since detailed information about notable companies in the bitcoin economy is thin on the ground, CoinDesk wrangled the data on two dimensions – geography and order value – to see what it could tell us.  A commanding 73% of complaints to the FTC came from US customers, most being from California, New York and Florida. Customers from Kansas, the company's home state, were absent from the list.  The complaints range across one and a half years from September 2012 through April 2014. Of the 283 complaints the FTC received, excluding one, 260 of them had an order value. The excluded item had an extraordinarily high order value of $30m and also didn't have a transaction date, so has been left out of the calculations.  The FTC data show that the order value attached to each complaint rose sharply last July and continued climbing rapidly through the autumn months, hitting about $950,000 at the end of November. This coincides with bitcoin's price surge that started in August when 1 BTC was worth about $100 and peaked in December when its value had rocketed to more than $1,000.  The cumulative order value of Butterfly Labs products in the data set is just over $1m.  The pie chart below shows how much is at stake for each disgruntled Butterfly Labs customer. Almost all their orders are valued under $5,000. Of those, the majority are worth less than $2,500.  There are always outliers, though. One Australian customer placed an order for three 'mini rigs', which cost about $30,000 each with an additional $588 in shipping costs. That's $90,873, all in.  ""We were very surprised by the data,"" said Butterfly Labs' vice president of e-commerce and marketing, Jeff Ownby. ""We have never been contacted by the FTC regarding any complaints it has received.""  Ownby said his company analysed the data and concluded that it is an outdated picture of customer satisfaction.  Ownby said this was because the majority of complaints were filed before the bulk of its products were shipped on 1st Oct last year. Some 63% of the FTC complaints were filed before 1st October last year, after which 78% of its product shipped.  ""We believe the issues raised [...] are largely a rehash of stale complaints that are no longer valid,"" he said. ""It is our strong belief that the vast majority of the customers with delivery issues have been supplied with their miners. Other issues, related to pricing or refunds, are likely to be similarly resolved by now.""
