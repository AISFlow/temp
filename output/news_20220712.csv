42374275,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYulL,1657669070,"Celsius is ‘Deeply Insolvent,’ Alleges Vermont Department of Financial Regulation","Celsius Network, the troubled crypto lender, “is deeply insolvent,” alleged the U.S. state of Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation (DFR), noting the lender lacks the assets and liquidity to honor its obligations to account holders and other creditors.  “Celsius deployed customer assets in a variety of risky and illiquid investments, trading, and lending activities,” the DFR said in a statement. “Celsius compounded these risks by using customer assets as collateral for additional borrowing to pursue leveraged investment strategies,” the statement added.  Celsius is one of the crypto lenders facing financial troubles in the latest liquidity crisis in crypto. It suspended withdrawals starting June 12, cut jobs and hired restructuring experts to advise on its financial situation.  Earlier on Tuesday, the lender said that it fully paid off its debt on the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave, freeing up $26 million in tokens as part of its latest debt restructuring maneuver. It also moved $418 million in staked ether or “'stETH” to an unknown wallet.  Last week, CoinDesk reported that Celsius fully paid off and closed its loan on Maker, one of the largest DeFi lending protocols, and freed up $440 million of collateral pledged against the loan, denominated in wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) tokens. Additionally, on Tuesday, the crypto lender reduced its debt by $95 million on Aave and freed up 410,000 stETH tokens, worth $426 million at the time of publishing, also reported by CoinDesk.  Read more: Looking at the Claims Celsius Operated Like a Ponzi  The DFR believes that Celsius has been engaged in “an unregistered securities offering” by offering cryptocurrency interest accounts to retail investors. Celsius also lacks a money transmitter license, DFR alleges, noting that it means Celsius was operating largely without regulatory oversight, until recently.  Furthermore, the lender also failed to register its interest accounts as securities, leading to lack of risk disclosures to depositors and other creditors.  Due to the culmination of the concerns about Celsius, DFR has joined a multistate investigation of the lender, according to the statement.

351,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241171,1657668617,Beginners Guide to Cardano’s Non-Interactive Proof-of-work,"One of the most prominent blockchain technologies of 2021, Cardano is a cryptocurrency with the fifth-largest market cap. It has also created a native coin called ADA, performing well in the crypto markets. As a network, Cardano uses a sidechain system that involves running two blockchains. The first one is called the Cardano settlement layer (CSL), which acts as the central hub for the ADA. It also serves as the payment gateway for the various settlements within the network, which is very secure and easy to implement. The second layer of the Cardano network is called the Cardano computational layer(CCL). It focuses on smart contract technology. However, it also developed a new technology called NIPoPoW to ensure that the sidechain and mainchain are working efficiently. This guide will look into how these technologies work and their contribution to Cardano Settlement Layer and Cardano computation layer. However, let us first dive into how sidechains work to understand Cardano&apos;s non-interactive proof-of-work. What are Sidechains? A sidechain is a system that allows two blockchains to interact seamlessly. Investors can use it to transfer their assets from one blockchain to another. This move will enable them to maintain their value and avoid experiencing volatility. The transaction does not change between one chain and the other. Instead, the token amount is burnt off from the sending chain, and the same amount is created from t...",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/beginners-guide-to-cardanos-non-interactive-proof-of-work/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=beginners-guide-to-cardanos-non-interactive-proof-of-work,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=495499,1657668456,"If Ethereum Falls Below $1,000, Here’s The Next Support","Early in June, Ethereum fell below the $1700 demand zone, and the king of altcoins had no immediate plans to recover. The $1000 band of support has been held for the past month, while the $1300 resistance has not yet been broken. Ethereum Ranging Between $1,000 to $1,200 Although Ethereum seemed to establish a range, it was probably just imitating Bitcoin. The king coin also established a range, and it would need perseverance to traverse the markets without suffering a great deal of loss. ETH/USD hovers around $1k. Source: TradingView Since Ethereum initially began trading on Binance in 2015, there have been two primary ascending lines on the weekly timescale. Prior to the price falling below $1,500, the white line served as support and the yellow line served as resistance. To further emphasize the relevance of the present price in relation to earlier market valuations, the 200-week moving average line (in light blue) is also shown. In a scenario where price moves in favor of the bulls, the price would rise over the MA200, which is located at $1200, and then rebound above the resistance zone between $1300 and $1500 before consolidating above $1700 and breaking the white trendline. However, it appears to be a challenging mission given the uncertainties in the macro picture brought on by the potential for a recession and a lack of liquidity.

Transactions on the blockchain show Celsius's wallet transferred $8.4 million in Circle’s USDC stablecoin Tuesday afternoon to Aave. The move closed Celsius's loan and freed the remainder of tokens pledged on the platform as collateral against the debt – namely some $10 million in stETH, a derivative type of the ether (ETH) token, $13 million in Chainlink's LINK tokens and $3 million in Synthetix's SNX.  And in what appears to be a separate move, Celsius transferred its known stETH holdings – some 416,000 tokens, or $418 million of worth – to another, unlabeled wallet, a transaction history shows.  Last week, as reported by CoinDesk, Celsius fully paid off and closed its loan on Maker, one of the largest DeFi lending protocols, and freed up $440 million of collateral pledged against the loan, denominated in wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) tokens.

42374277,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYup7,1657662814,California Is Investigating ‘Multiple’ Crypto Lending Companies,"The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) is investigating several U.S.-based crypto lenders after a series of prominent lenders indefinitely halted withdrawals and transfers between user accounts, according to a press release issued on Tuesday.  The department didn’t name the companies under investigation, but it did say it is eyeing ""multiple"" companies that “offer customers interest-bearing crypto asset accounts,” or crypto-interest accounts, and service providers that “may not have adequately disclosed risks customers face when they deposit crypto assets onto [lenders’] platforms.”  Over the past few months, several prominent crypto lenders have frozen withdrawals and transfers as they contend with liquidity crises spurred by a dramatic market downturn that has caused crypto prices to plunge to their lowest levels since December 2020, with bitcoin tumbling below $20,000 several times in June.  In mid-June, Celsius announced it would pause all withdrawals and transfers between user accounts, citing “extreme market conditions.” Then, in July, fellow U.S.-based lender Voyager Digital announced it would temporarily pause customer trading, deposits and withdrawals. It then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy just days after the announcement.  The California investigation also comes on the heels of public comments from top regulators and politicians warning consumers about the risks of crypto lending.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) issued an email statement in June warning crypto lending platforms’ claims of double-digit rates were often “too good to be true.”  “Too many crypto firms have been able to scam customers with too-good-to-be-true claims about safe sky-high returns, leaving ordinary investors holding the bag while insiders make off with their money,” Warren wrote.  Previous California DFPI investigations  The California DFPI has pursued investigations and taken actions against several crypto companies, including BlockFi and Voyager Digital, in recent months. The department found that certain crypto interest accounts from those platforms constituted unregistered securities.  Securities registration is essential for ensuring that investors receive adequate information so they can make decisions regarding riskier-than-average investment opportunities such as crypto-interest account arrangements, the department said.

However, since its start, it has expanded to create an exchange, ShibaSwap, and is currently looking to offer added utility with the Shiba Inu metaverse. SHIB holders, in particular, may mint land plots in SHIB: The Metaverse. At first, the project only accepted payments in ether (ETH), but that has changed so that there won&apos;t be a massive sell-off of SHIB on exchanges and trading platforms. People can mint four different types of plots that are worth between 0.2 ETH and 1 ETH. On the Shib.io platform, users can pay the same amount in ETH or SHIB to get access to these land plots.

42394525,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVff,1657661598,Putting Crypto Volatility in Context: What We Can Learn From the History of Bitcoin Crashes,"Recent headlines about cryptocurrency have highlighted significant declines in price over the last year. In November 2021, bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high of more than $68,000, and the current price is hovering around $20,000, a steep drop. The crypto market overall is experiencing significant volatility, and crypto prices have plunged 70% from their all-time highs. Some prominent figures are declaring we're seeing the “death of crypto.” But are we, really? Let's take a look at historical cycles and price movement in order to gain perspective and context and set proper expectations for future price movement.  See Also: Signs Bitcoin May Have Bottomed: Here’s What Experts Told Us  An overview of crypto and market volatility  Volatility is nothing new for cryptocurrencies and, in fact, should be expected. There have been six periods of significant decline in bitcoin (along with other altcoins) since bitcoin’s inception in 2009.  June 2011: The price of bitcoin fell 99% from its high  August 2012: Bitcoin fell 56% from high  April 2013: Bitcoin fell 83% from high  December 2013: Bitcoin fell 50% from its high in a period of 24 hours  December 2018: Bitcoin fell 84% from its high  The early crashes were caused by the market cycles often seen in highly speculative asset classes. The December 2013 crash happened because China banned bitcoin mining, while the 2018 crash came right after the initial coin offering (ICO) craze that ended in many projects failing.  Opinion: Why This Crypto Crash Is Different  When you look at the list above, it does tell the story of a highly volatile, risky asset. But viewed through the wider lens of speculative assets, this volatility is comparable to other growth assets, even some of the largest equities in the world.  Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997, the mega-cap stock Amazon (AMZN) has experienced a double-digit drawdown every single year and the average yearly drawdown of Amazon stock is 31%. Amazon's stock price has had a greater than 50% decline five times since its IPO and a 90% decline twice. But this has us looking at the performance only in short time frames. If you pull back and look at all-time performance, Amazon has experienced a remarkable 114,028% total return since its IPO, while the S&P 500 has experienced a total return of 613% since the Amazon IPO.  In 2022, other speculative growth stocks such as former Facebook now Meta (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Peloton (PTON) are down -52%, -70% and -73%, respectively. Venture Capital firms such as Tiger Global also marked down their holdings by more than 50% in 2022.  Perhaps the decline in speculative assets this year has been caused by global monetary conditions tightening through rate hikes and central bank balance sheet reductions, or has been driven by investors simply taking profits earned over the past two years of bull market rallies. Regardless of the cause, volatility in all of these asset classes should not cause concern for the long-term investor.  When looking at the three-year and five-year returns for bitcoin, the growth rate is significant. A look at the fundamental strength of cryptocurrencies paints an even better fundamental picture than multiyear returns.  Additionally, important blockchain fundamentals such as the bitcoin hashrate (strength of the network) is currently at an all-time high and base-layer blockchain protocol upgrades, such as the Ethereum Merge, are continuing to progress as planned by their communities.  The benefits of bear markets  Bear markets have historically flushed out malinvestment across asset classes. During the dot-com crash of the 2000s, many internet-based companies were forced into bankruptcy. The ICO boom in cryptocurrencies during 2017 led to many tokens being launched and traded on crypto exchanges, many of which had no utility or long-term plans for sustainability. The 2018 price crash led to many of these unprofitable and impossible projects failing, while legitimate projects and businesses were able to survive and grow during the prolonged crypto bear market.  We'll likely see a similar whittling down of projects and protocols during this period, so when choosing investments, make sure to research them thoroughly and understand their objectives: What problems are they trying to solve and how? Evaluate who else is competing in the space, what work has already been done and what you can learn about the people involved. For instance: Have the leaders of a project lived through a previous bear market and survived?  Read More: How to Avoid Crypto Bear Market Mistakes and Be Ready for the Next Bull Run  How to approach speculative asset investing  Many investors are drawn to assets that garner attention from the media and social media platforms. Oftentimes, individuals will invest in assets based on attention or emotion. We saw evidence of this during the 2020 and 2021 markets, when stocks like GameStop (GME) increased by 1,000% in a short period of time, not based on an improvement in fundamental data, but rather by traders propping up the share price and hyping the stock on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. Investments into speculative assets should not be influenced by these manias and, instead, should be determined based on fundamentals and long-term conviction.  See Also: 7 Key Ways to Evaluate a Cryptocurrency Before Buying It  When analyzing the fundamental metrics of equities, many analysts will look at numbers such as the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price to sales (P/S), earnings reports and free cash flow (FCF), among many others. When analyzing the fundamental metrics of a crypto asset, analysts will look at metrics such as tokenomics, white papers, on-chain analytics and development activity on GitHub and others. These fundamental properties of crypto assets give investors valuable insights into a project's security, usage and growth.  The long-term cryptocurrency investor can take advantage of these price declines and use the opportunity to increase holdings. While price is an important metric for traders and speculators, it can prove to be a detrimental factor for long-term believers and investors.  Rather than worrying about the decline in price, those who believe in the underlying technology and real-world use cases of crypto technology must understand that recent volatility is not abnormal in the crypto space – and should certainly continue as the crypto economy grows and matures.

Bitcoin (BTC) slumped for the fifth consecutive day and was changing hands around $19,700, down 4.3% over the past 24 hours.  Some analysts believe bitcoin’s recent dips below $20,000 show the price level is not as critical anymore.  “A move below $17,500-$18,500 support could accelerate the sell-off, while a break of $19,500 may also signal further pain to come,” said Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam.

More Long-term Bitcoin Holder Confidence Needed Before Market Recovery, Glassnode Report Shows  Long-term bitcoin holders are experiencing both actual and unrealized losses and are likely feeling massive selling pressure, the blockchain analysis firm Glassnode wrote in a report.  Actualized losses can be seen by using the Long-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (LTH-SOPR), a metric that compares the price at which a coin investor sold coins to the cost at which the coins were bought. An LTH-SOPR above 1.0 means that long-term holders are netting a profit.  However, the current LTH-SOPR is 0.67, the lowest since January 2019, meaning that the average long-term holder is selling coins at a 33% loss.  Realized losses can be seen through the long-term holders' cost basis. If the market valuation falls below the LTH-Cost Basis, it means that long-term holders are holding coins at a loss.  Right now, LTHs are, on average, underwater, with an aggregate unrealized loss of 14%.  The immediate consequence of this combination of actualized and unrealized losses is that long-term holders are selling coins, which are then bought by price-sensitive short-term holders, who are less likely to hold coins at a loss.  However, in order for the market to recover, these coins should mostly be held by price-resistant long-term holders.  During the depths of previous bear markets, long-term holders held more than 34% of the crypto supply at a loss while short-term holders held just 3% to 4%. However, short-term investors currently hold 16.2% of the supply, suggesting that more tokens have to be redistributed to long-term holders before the market can emerge from a bottom.  “While many bottom formation signals are in place, the market still requires an element of duration and time pain to establish a resilient bottom,” Glassnode wrote. “Bitcoin investors are not out of the woods yet.”  Altcoin roundup  Tokensoft Launches Web3-Enabled Platform: The chain-agnostic token sales platform has successfully deployed Tokensoft version 2 on the Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains.

The Good In my last article on Bitcoin , I talked about how the world's first cryptocurrency had fallen below its realized price. Put simply, the market as a whole had now entered into losses. In the past, the realized price has acted as a strong line of support, with Bitcoin corrections only dropping under this level for a few months or even weeks before an upward trend resumes. I also pointed to the fact that we needed to see a five-wave rally off the lows to begin to think bullishly, and this is indeed what we have seen: BTC reversal (Author's work) We had a very clear impulsive reversal, followed by a corrective move down. Furthermore, we have held the support trend line in blue so far, in every pullback. On top of that, we can also point to bullishness from on-chain data. We have seen a growing trend of BTC, as well as other cryptos, leaving exchanges. And where are these coins going? Most wallets have little history of spending, what Glassnode calls illiquid supply . This means less selling pressure available for Bitcoin, at the same time, we are seeing an all-time high in BTC addresses with a non-zero balance. The Bad So. While we have strong evidence that, at the very least, we are nearing the end of this capitulation, we also have reason to suspect that BTC could head somewhat lower in the coming weeks. One of my biggest concerns is the number of bankruptcies and restructurings we have seen, as well as the capitulation of miners, which are being forced to sell Bitcoin reserves and even shut down operations. The long list of bankruptcies/liquidations includes Three Arrows Capital , Voyager Digital ( VYGVF ) and the Celsius exchange (CEL-USD). Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners like Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) are struggling to keep up mining production and are being forced to sell their reserves . The big problem here is that as long as Bitcoin prices remain around these levels, liquidations will continue, and so will miner capitulation, putting even more pressure on the Bitcoin price. While the BTC price has recovered, it still hasn't broken above the most immediate levels of resistance, these being the 200-week MA and the Realized Price. 200-week MA and realized price (Author's work) The Realized price currently sits around $22,180 while the 22-week MA sits slightly above that. These two key levels which I have talked about before used to act as support for BTC, but now they are the resistance level that must be broken to continue higher. Bitcoin got rejected at the 200-week MA and is now below the realized price too. With this in mind, we might head to the next key level of support. The Delta Price, which is derived from the delta, was developed by David Puell . This is obtained by subtracting the average cap from the realized cap. Or the average price from the realized price. The average cap can be defined as follows: Instead of setting a fixed period for calculating a moving average (e.g., a 200-day MA), this is a life-to-date, cumulative simple moving average that serves as the true mean of the whole history of market cap. Due to its ""laggy"" nature, it is the perfect mechanism to help decay the upward speed of delta caps over time. The Delta Price was last reached in the 2019 sell-off. The current Delta Price is around $14,700 , so this is the next key support level of the recent low. The Ugly Black Swan Last and certainly not least, I'd like to talk about an idea that has surfaced in the last few days regarding a possible ""Black Swan"" for Bitcoin. This story involves Mt. Gox, one of the first crypto exchanges to exist. Mt. Gox suffered numerous security breaches during its existence. Back in 2011, it suffered its first hack, but by 2013 Mt. Gox accounted for 70% of Bitcoin's transactions. In a subsequent breach in 2014, Mt. Gox announced that it had lost close to 750,000 of its users' bitcoins and another 100,000 of its own Bitcoin reserves. Fast-forward to today, and after much litigation, a ""Rehabilitation Plan"" was put into action in 2021 to repay creditors. On July 6th , creditors received an email stating that the ""Rehabilitation Trustee"" was getting ready to make payments. All of this to say that in the next few weeks, we could see around $3 billion worth of Bitcoin released to these creditors, who have the option to redeem this in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) or Tether (USDT-USD). While it's hard to predict what creditors will do with this Bitcoin, dump or hold, this sell-off has the potential to be even bigger than the Terra ( LUNA-USD ) collapse, which saw $2.4 billion worth of BTC sold in an attempt to maintain the Terra peg ( UST-USD ). Takeaway In conclusion, there's still a lot to process regarding Bitcoin. I am still bullish long-term and hold that we are nearing the end of this capitulation. That said, we need to break resistance above soon, or Bitcoin will head lower. The Mt. Gox hack restitution could be the catalyst for this final sell-off.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522971-bitcoin-good-bad-and-ugly-black-swan?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/398.jpeg

Cryptocurrencies are the new hot topic with enthusiasts and investors from all over the world partaking in owning and trading cryptos. In trading these digital assets, technical indicators come in handy and prove to be effective strategies for making profits. Such indicators include the resistance level. When applied and executed effectively, huge profits can be minted in the crypto realm. Moreover, newbies can leverage extensions like the Fibonacci that predict future resistance levels such as reaching 100% or 200% levels and then reacting. The resistance level is an essential indicator that sellers take advantage of and enter the market, and on various occasions, can change the price movement. As such, the resistance level is an indicator that points out where most sellers will enter the market. What is the Resistance Level? In crypto trading, the resistance level acts as the ceiling of the crypto market. It indicates that the price of a crypto asset is overvalued, as such, most traders exit their trades and take a profit. It&apos;s basically a concentration of sell pressure that forces price levels to act as a barrier. In simpler terms, the resistance level is achieved when crypto prices increase in value fostered by seller interests. As a result, a resistance zone is forged where the crypto price halts and begins reacting.

42374291,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYv4D,1657655223,Jobs Growth Is the Savior of Inflation-Wracked US Economy,"A monthly inflation report due Wednesday from the U.S. Labor Department could add pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep tightening monetary policy – even as some forecasters see the economy hurtling toward recession.  The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) is predicted to rise 8.8% in June from 12 months earlier, based on the average estimate of economists surveyed by FactSet. That pace would represent an acceleration from the pace recorded in May, when inflation jumped to a fresh four-decade high of 8.6%.  Economists’ forecasts were way off the mark in advance of May's report when they predicted inflation had declined from the previous month. The numbers released showed that price pressure actually accelerated, sending shock waves through the markets because it meant the Fed would have little choice but to proceed with a swift increase in interest rates. (The following week, the U.S. central bank raised rates by 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point – three times the usual increment.)  If this week's CPI number comes in high, the Fed likely will continue to hike rates aggressively, meaning 50 or 75 basis points.  This is bad news for bitcoin (BTC), which is down nearly 70% since inflation started accelerating post-pandemic in October 2021, showing the effect that macroeconomic circumstances have on the crypto markets.  Not great for the economy, but not dire either  In fact, the U.S. is already in a recession judging by one widely used definition: two consecutive quarters of contraction in gross domestic product. The first-quarter GDP shrank by 1.4%, and it likely declined more in the second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow tool.  However, the organization responsible for declaring and dating recessions, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), sees things a little differently. According to the NBER, a recession involves “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy” and lasts over a few months.  Despite the GDP declines, the labor market is booming, with employers adding roughly 400,000 jobs per month on average in the first three months of the year.  ”The NBER won’t call a first-half recession,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note Friday. “The jobs data support our view that talk of the economy being in recession right now is fanciful.”  A chart by Deutsche Bank shows that median non-farm payrolls in the 12 months before and after the start of a recession were mostly below the 200,000 mark, whereas the last 12 months of non-farm payroll prints currently are significantly higher, with the lowest number at 368,000 in April.  Most experts would agree that while GDP is slowing, the economy is still in good enough shape to withstand rate hikes by the Fed.  That's the basis for expectations that the U.S. central bankers will continue aggressively.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/12/jobs-growth-is-the-savior-of-inflation-wracked-us-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5772a34d4e61edfb96029614b2743ba158d6129-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The findings may counter financial lobbyists hoping to steer the government away from such a currency.  The Office of Financial Research (OFR) – an arm of the U.S. Treasury Department that studies risks to the financial system – looked into how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would affect the inner workings of U.S. finance, and the paper concluded that worries about a future panic driving people to rapidly move assets into digital dollars may be overblown.  The paper’s authors said a CBDC would give the government an early-warning system, acting like a canary in the coal mine that it can study for signs of distress. More flows into digital dollars would tell regulators that trouble could be brewing.  “Observing the flow of funds into a CBDC can allow policymakers to infer when a run by a bank’s depositors is underway more quickly and to place troubled banks into resolution sooner,” according to the paper, written by Todd Keister at Rutgers University and Cyril Monnet from the University of Bern. And knowing that such activity will trigger concern with watchdog agencies may further discourage big depositors from pulling out funds and triggering that process.  The existence of a CBDC during normal times would also set up less incentive for depositors to run from a weak bank when a crisis erupts, they said, because it will have removed some of the benefits of “maturity transformation” in which banks gain from borrowing money on shorter terms than they lend it out at. So banks would be a bit more stable before the crisis happens, the OFR paper said.  Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Group, said the OFR report seems to be pushing back on Wall Street bankers’ objections to the digital dollar. “We see [the report] as a tool that digital dollar advocates can use to justify proceeding with plans to prepare a central bank cryptocurrency for launch,” Seiberg wrote in a Tuesday research note to clients.  Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard, whose agency would ultimately be the one issuing a digital dollar, also made some positive remarks about a potential CBDC last week. “A digital native form of safe central bank money could enhance stability by providing the neutral trusted settlement layer in the future crypto financial system,” Brainard said, though she’s previously warned that the effort to launch a CBDC in the U.S. could take the Fed as long as five years.

42421495,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUqD,1657653265,Watch Out for Illicit Actors Gaming Crypto Games,"Play-to-earn (P2E) crypto games are emerging as a popular blockchain application that is likely to bring a high risk for scams and money laundering, especially once the crypto winter thaws.  Although P2E crypto tokens, like a lot of the crypto ecosystem, have lost much of their value in recent months, they deserve attention from financial regulators because P2E crypto (also sometimes referred to as Game Finance, or GameFi) offers a glimpse into the types of financial crime complexities that will arise as tech companies work to usher in an even more nascent development on the horizon: the metaverse.  Yaya J. Fanusie is a former CIA analyst and now the chief strategist at Cryptocurrency AML Strategies, an advisory firm in the Washington, D.C., area, and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic recently published a great report explaining types of financial crime likely to accompany the growth of metaverse ecosystems. (Disclosure: A few years ago, I collaborated with Elliptic in both my think tank research work and my private consulting practice. Facebook/Meta has been a client as well.) If the metaverse is to become the virtual interactive world that its proponents aspire for it to be, a combination of gaming and crypto will expand the outlets for good and bad actors seeking riches alike.  Virtual money in online games is not new. But P2E crypto gaming adds a real-world financial dimension by offering tokens that can be easily sold outside of gaming environments. In many cases, gamers can sell their crypto funds earned in obscure P2E crypto games for more liquid ERC-20 tokens that run on top of Ethereum, especially stablecoins, on centralized or decentralized exchanges. Gamers then can convert their more popular tokens into the fiat currency of their choice.  Even before the advent of P2E crypto, anti-money laundering experts have flagged the illicit finance risks around online gaming. In 2019, researchers at the Royal United Services Institute, a U.K. think tank focused on international security issues, pointed out that if users can find ways to exchange in-game items (like virtual money, artifacts, tools or clothing) for real-world currency, those items will become attractive for criminals looking to launder illicit funds. But selling game virtual-assets for fiat money used to be difficult. In traditional online games, users had to access unauthorized secondary markets to trade gaming items outside the games’ platforms. These markets are often on the darknet, which requires a special browser like Tor to access. With crypto gaming, the virtual money earnings and the collected items are all created on blockchains and traded relatively freely, often wherever blockchain assets are sold.  P2E platforms vary widely in their gaming models and in how players earn and spend crypto. Many games offer digital collectibles via non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Some pair mobile app activity with geolocation and augmented reality, where gamers must physically go to locations to play the game, similar to Pokémon Go. Some P2E games literally give crypto funds away. For example, Coin Hunt World, which is available as a downloadable mobile app and was co-founded by the CEO of the Bittrex crypto exchange, lets players earn bitcoin and ether by completing various tasks without investing any crypto up front. Apparently, the game’s business model is to lure users into the game and show them paid advertisements in the game environment.  There are more than 1,000 P2E crypto games available, according to DappRadar. While some of these games have hundreds of thousands of users and hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of crypto infused into them, the majority of the games have zero to no users and barely any funds associated with them. This phenomenon is akin to the initial coin offering craze of 2017, when developers created thousands of new cryptocurrencies, yet most of those projects soon lost almost all of the value of their digital tokens. Many were outright scams.  The illicit finance risks are high in the P2E crypto space largely because it is young and quickly developing, with few clear guidelines around governance and consumer protection. Some regulators are taking notice. In December 2021, financial authorities in Thailand warned consumers about the volatility and scam risks associated with P2E crypto/GameFi. In December 2021, the South Korean government ordered Google Play and Apple app stores to prohibit all P2E games from their platforms in the country, citing laws prohibiting gaming prizes exceeding the value of a few dollars. It would not be surprising for other jurisdictions to follow suit. Many P2E games are little more than new iterations of online gambling and are likely to be seen as contravening a nation’s casino and gambling laws.  Axie Infinity, one of the most popular P2E games, can probably be exploited easily by individuals seeking to launder illicitly earned crypto. Users must purchase NFT characters called Axies to play the game and can sell those characters on NFT marketplaces. The rules of Axie Infinity allow players to “rent” teams of other players’ characters inside the game and split profits. Since there’s typically no know your customer (KYC) screening involved in playing these games, a criminal actor could infuse ill-gotten crypto into the game, rent a character from another user, and then split the earnings as a way to pay the user for helping to obfuscate the origin of the dirty funds. Innovations like renting characters can certainly be benign, creative ways to play online games, but through a financial-crime fighter’s lens, they are ready-made for money laundering.  Because so many P2E games use non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it will be important for anti-money-laundering (AML) investigators to track NFT trends globally as an indicator of the P2E space’s trajectory. Interestingly, a recent international survey found the Philippines had the highest percentage of NFT ownership in any country, followed by Thailand, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. Nigeria had the highest percentage of people surveyed who were “planning to buy an NFT,” indicating that there will likely be a growth of NFT (and P2E) activity there.  Although P2E gaming is still pretty nascent, it is probably just a matter of time before a prominent illicit finance case arises through a P2E platform. In January, a colleague of mine who focuses on North Korea illicit finance at the Center for a New American Security wrote that it would be plausible for Pyongyang to exploit P2E software to earn crypto funds. Although North Korea directly using P2E games has not been publicly detected, U.S. authorities recently identified North Korea’s cyber unit known as the Lazarus Group as the culprit behind a theft of $540 million in crypto in March. The operatives stole the funds by hacking a blockchain platform that supports the Axie Infinity game. They gained access to the platform through a phishing campaign that tricked a senior engineer at Axie Infinity to download malware disguised as a fake job offer.  Even if P2E games remain a niche activity in the crypto space while crypto prices are low, regulators, AML compliance teams and financial crime investigators should keep an eye on the sector’s development. The gaming models and rules currently used will likely be adapted to larger projects that emerge in the metaverse ecosystem.  The best way to counter financial crime is to think like the criminals are thinking and to plan as they are planning. The metaverse will not be all fun and games.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Yaya Fanusie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/12/watch-out-for-illicit-actors-gaming-crypto-games,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cec0c1d6342967f2574446b36598e8baf3cc847c-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For a period of time, the LTC/USD pair was following an ascending parallel channel, but it failed to break through and instead dropped severely. The pair is now trading at $48.29 and has resistance at $51.03, but a breakthrough above this level is required for further gains. Litecoin&apos;s support resides at $47.76, and if this barrier is broken, the price of Litecoin may fall to as low as $45.38. The LTC/USD pair is now valued at $48.29 and has dropped by more than 2% in the previous 24 hours, as the cryptocurrency market continues to bleed red.

42374288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYv0R,1657652200,How I Became a Bitcoin Developer Fresh Out of High School,"Daniela Brozzoni is laser-focused on helping developers build better bitcoin (BTC) wallets. Despite graduating from high school just a few years ago, Brozzoni has already worked at prominent Bitcoin application builder Blockstream and contributed to various Bitcoin-related projects like Braiins OS and Revault.  Brozzoni was recently awarded a grant from Spiral to work on the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) project. BDK (formerly Magical Bitcoin) is a suite of tools and libraries designed to improve bitcoin wallet development. The old Magical Bitcoin tagline, “making on-chain bitcoin wallet development 10x easier,” sums up BDK’s purpose.  Spiral (formerly Square Crypto) funds several Bitcoin-focused projects including BDK. Spiral itself is just one of several initiatives by Block (formerly Square) designed to cultivate the Bitcoin ecosystem. According to its website, Spiral’s mission is to “build and fund free, open-source projects aimed at making bitcoin the planet’s preferred currency.” BDK fits that mission statement.  Read more: Payments Giant Square Is Changing Its Name to Block  The Bitcoin rabbit hole moment  Brozzoni spends her time building user-friendly decaying multisigs (a type of multisignature wallet that gradually reduces the number of signers) and improving the BDK Rust Library. One could say her teenage hobbies foreshadowed her career.  “As a kid, I loved playing with computers. So at 14 I chose a high school where I could study computer science. I studied computer science there for five years, until I was 19,” Brozzoni recalled.  During that five-year period, when she was about 17, she heard about Bitcoin from a friend. He explained how Bitcoin uses elliptic curve cryptography to generate keys, and Brozzoni was hooked. She started devouring anything Bitcoin-related and fell into the proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole.  “I found Bitcoin fascinating! I mean it’s complicated, even if you only look at the computer science side of things. You have miners, nodes, wallets – there’s just so much,” Brozzoni said.  From Blockstream to BDK and everything in between  That same friend who introduced Brozzoni to Bitcoin happened to be a Blockstream employee. He knew of Brozzoni’s talent so he encouraged her to apply for a position at the company. It was an ideal scenario for Brozzoni, who while a high-achieving student, wasn’t exactly thrilled about going to university and spending the rest of her life doing traditional computer science or math research.  “I would have liked to study mathematics. But if you study mathematics, what do you do? You can become a teacher, but I kinda don’t like that,” she said.  Brozzoni would go on to successfully land a six-month internship at Blockstream. She worked on Blockstream Green, the company’s bitcoin wallet. After her time at Blockstream, she contributed to Braiins OS, an open-source bitcoin mining software project, then to Revault, a Bitcoin vault architecture project where Brozzoni helped build the wallet portion of the Revault protocol, revaultd.  Finally, that same friend who had told her about Bitcoin and Blockstream suggested another great idea.  “He basically said, ‘There’s this project called BDK and it’s really big. Would you like to work on it?’” Brozzoni was intrigued, and eventually applied for, and was awarded, a Spiral grant to fund her work on BDK. One of her current tasks is improving the BDK Rust Library, so her past experience building bitcoin wallets and working with Rust at Revault seems to be paying off.  Embracing Bitcoin philosophy  Since her first encounter with Bitcoin, Brozzoni has learnt a lot about its multifaceted nature. She has embraced libertarianism and now describes herself as a maximalist.  “With other coins, you have a rich CEO who just wants to get richer. With Bitcoin, there is no CEO, and I really like that,” Brozzoni explained.  Despite the current bear market, Brozzoni remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future. She expresses confidence in Bitcoin’s “antifragility,” a word (ironically) coined by Nassim Taleb, one of Bitcoin’s harshest critics. An antifragile entity is one that not only survives adversity, but thrives on it. In his book, “Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder,” Taleb uses the Hydra, a lake-dwelling Greek mythological creature, to illustrate the concept of antifragility. The Hydra has numerous heads, and each time one is cut off two grow back.  “I want to see governments try to kill Bitcoin. If Bitcoin isn’t antifragile enough to win against governments, we might as well know now. But I think Bitcoin will win in the end,” Brozzoni said (albeit with a slight hint of uncertainty).  Read more: What Happens to Bitcoin if the Lights Go Out?  Advice to other young Bitcoin developers  Bitcoin has become increasingly ubiquitous, and the team at BDK predicts a future where bitcoin wallets are created daily. “With BDK, you can basically create a bitcoin wallet with just 10 lines of code,” Brozzoni said. This also means even more developers, especially junior ones, will enter the Bitcoin ecosystem. Brozzoni has some advice for them.  “First of all, be humble. No one likes a junior dev who thinks they know everything. [Secondly], if you can't figure something out by yourself, don't be scared to ask for help. [Finally], don't get too anxious. It may take months or even years before you really master Bitcoin.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | ZRX,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/12/how-i-became-a-bitcoin-developer-fresh-out-of-high-school,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/420844eebf2ddd364ece9b3b118ad1f5f21fc28d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past Performance of the Secret Network The Secret Network token is up double digits, adding 18 percent in the last trading day alone.

42393807,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLyX,1657648993,"Behind Voyager’s Fall: Crypto Broker Acted Like a Bank, Went Bankrupt","At its height, Voyager Digital boasted 3.5 million users (roughly what Coinbase boasted in 2015) and $5.9 billion in assets, comparable to a small regional bank or respectable wealth management firm.  Ninety-seven percent of Voyager’s clients stored less than $10,000 on the platform, indicating a broad base of individual investors. It was a crypto lending and trading powerhouse – one of the few digital asset brokerages listed on stock markets anywhere in the world (albeit in Canada rather than the U.S., its home country).  Voyager’s future, until recently, looked bright. Leadership seemed barely able to conceive of a bear market, much less its consequences. Speaking in 2021, CEO Steve Ehrlich said that “I think the market looks completely different today from what it looked like in 2017. We all remember 2017.”  As it turns out, 2021 was actually a lot like 2017 – both were quickly followed by a brutal crypto market crash. Ehrlich’s sunny optimism has yielded a rotten harvest.  The Jersey City, N.J.-based company is now known to have made immense unsecured loans to Three Arrows Capital (3AC). That failed hedge fund now appears to have defaulted on all of its obligations, and its founders are reportedly fugitives.  That alone was apparently a mortal wound. On July 1, Voyager froze customer funds. Just days later, it filed for bankruptcy protection in New York.  Voyager is in a bleak situation. “The Debtors are facing a short-term ‘run on the bank,’” according to a statement Ehrlich filed alongside bankruptcy papers. But, also according to Ehrlich (who did not respond to a request for comment for this story), Voyager has a brighter future: “Debtors have a viable business and a plan for the future.” (Under Chapter 11, the company is seeking to reorganize rather than liquidate.)  So how did a once mighty and well-regarded crypto lending outfit get here?  Short version: Voyager was pretty good at attracting deposits. When it came to lending that money out … not so much.  Why did Voyager Digital fail?  In the company’s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, Ehrlich gave a rare public play-by-play of a crypto lender’s mistakes. It’s a story that, at least by Ehrlich’s telling, begins with the collapse of the Terra blockchain ecosystem and the ensuing contagion.  In an industry where counterparties are tightly bound together by a weave of debt and leverage, dominoes can fall fast and hard. Voyager is casting itself as a victim of the cryptopocalypse, undone not by any direct exposure to the likes of Terra’s UST stablecoin and LUNA token, but merely through unlucky business partners.  Voyager said it quickly moved to hedge its risk as crypto winter began in early 2022, in part by reducing loans and mitigating counterparty risk. All the better to protect against Terra’s spectacular May collapse. This effort was successful “in most instances.”  Until it wasn’t.  Things turned sour in June. Three Arrows Capital, a widely respected Singapore-based hedge fund with loans across the industry and bets across the space, “was in jeopardy” of failing to pay up. Its own “massive” bets on LUNA had imploded into a black hole of losses.  Three Arrows was also underwater on positions in Lido staked ether (stETH) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.) Notably, Ehrlich does not mention either of these in his bankruptcy narrative, possibly reflecting a troubling lack of insight into the operations of a company to which he offered a $650 million unsecured loan.  Either way, Three Arrows was down bad across the board. It was also one of Voyager’s single largest lending customers.  What business was Voyager actually in?  To understand Voyager’s collapse, you first have to understand what its business actually was.  To depositors, it looked an awful lot like a bank with a few twists. Up front, users deposited cryptocurrency rather than government fiat. Around the back, while Citibank or the teachers’ credit union might generate revenue by turning deposits into home loans, Voyager was engaged in (it turns out) much riskier lending.  Voyager is one of several retail-facing crypto institutions that generate interest on deposits by loaning crypto assets out to traders and institutions. Investment firms and hedge funds like Three Arrows Capital rely on these loans to make big trades. They take in capital from lenders, long or short a cornucopia of (risky) assets, invest in early-stage companies – and if all goes well, earn massive returns relatively quickly.  Some of these returns funnel back to their lending partners as interest payments. In turn, those partners, lenders like Voyager, pass a slice of the interest to customers. The process creating that chain of events that led to these yield payments is almost irrelevant – and certainly not transparent – to depositors. All they see is a nice payout in their accounts.  Until, that is, something goes wrong.  When asset prices tumble or a counterparty defaults on a massive loan, the lenders are left with gaping holes in their balance sheets. The systemic downturn has blown up not just Voyager but also Celsius and Babel Finance, all of which have frozen withdrawals and most of which now appear insolvent.  That has had real ramifications for real people, many of whom came to Voyager and its ilk with modest savings, in search of higher yield. What they may be realizing too late is that these crypto lenders are not the same as banks, and it’s unclear exactly how or if their deposits will be recovered. Voyager, for its part, is now under regulatory scrutiny for allegedly misrepresenting insurance on customer deposits.  Among crypto lenders, Voyager is also notable because it's the first to take the bankruptcy route. As part of that process, Ehrlich has filed a lengthy statement detailing the company’s challenges. It provides an unvarnished glimpse into the same shaky foundations of all the crypto lenders.  How it ended  One of those details is the rates paid by borrowers. According to Ehrlich’s statement, Alameda Research would pay up to 11.5%, Three Arrows Capital 10% and Genesis 13.5%. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.) Three Arrows was by far the biggest counterparty, with over $650 million borrowed. This “integral part of the business” is how the cash cow mooed.  Note also 3AC’s low interest rate relative to other borrowers. That would seem to reflect above-average faith in the fund, and multiple lenders did make generous loans to Three Arrows co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu on friendly terms. Voyager stands out, though, for extending such a huge loan without requiring collateral from Three Arrows. That gesture of trust, as we’ve since learned, was woefully misplaced.  But the lending business rallied like no other during the pandemic, when speculative mania from retail traders pushed everything from GameStop stock to dogecoin into silly season. From early 2020 to early 2022, the Voyager platform ballooned from 120,000 to 3.5 million users. Voyager benefited from low U.S. dollar interest rates and skyrocketing enthusiasm for the world’s hippest, hottest, most boom-and-bust prone risk-on asset.  But as bubbles do, crypto-mania hit its limit in late 2021, and assets started hemorrhaging value. The war in Ukraine, rising inflation and rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve further shook crypto’s up-only drumbeat. Between November of 2021 and April of 2022, crypto asset prices slumped by roughly 33% across the board.  Then the wild card reared up. Starting in early May, the UST stablecoin began a “death spiral” that wiped billions of dollars in wealth from the global crypto economy. Within days, a blockchain that Ehrlich claims was “widely viewed as a project with significant promise” and had major backing from investors of all stripes, had gone all but kaput.  Meanwhile, two less dramatic but similarly threatening sinkholes were opening. Starting in early 2021, the Greyscale Bitcoin Trust began trading at a significant discount to the underlying bitcoins. And stETH, effectively a promissory note for ETH on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 system, began trading at a discount to ETH. Both of these developments meant investors had to take big losses if they wanted to turn positions in those assets into ready cash.  One big holder of both GBTC and stETH was, you guessed it, Three Arrows Capital. 3AC’s loss of its entire $200 million initial stake in LUNA might not have been fatal if it hadn’t already been underwater on those other positions. But in any event, Three Arrows, for years one of the most respected trading firms in crypto, did the unthinkable: It simply disappeared.  Voyager had previously loaned $350 million in the stablecoin USDC and 15,250 bitcoins to Three Arrows. As the market continued to slide, Voyager made multiple demands for repayment in late June. But Three Arrows did not respond and was also ghosting other partners. $650 million of Voyager funds, effectively including a lot of customer deposits, was simply gone.  The dominoes were falling. Terra’s downfall led to Three Arrows’ default led to Voyager’s reckoning.  This wasn’t some normal crypto winter.  Contagion season had arrived.  To stop the bleeding, Voyager in mid-June brokered a nearly $500 million loan facility with Alameda intended to support the company’s short-term finances. It was at best a Band-Aid, a “partial solution” to contagion-fueled liquidity issues exacerbated by the greater crypto market rout.  Making matters worse, Celsius, another crypto lending giant, was falling apart at the same time. Celsius froze customer withdrawals on June 12, shaking broader confidence in lenders and the markets and prompting Voyager’s own clients to run for safety. Lowering daily withdrawal limits from $25,000 to $10,000 per day on June 23 was meant to stop the race to the exit and buy Voyager time.  But it wasn’t enough in the face of what Ehrlich describes as “an influx of customer withdrawals” that threatened “the Company’s ability to serve customers who remained on its platform.” As the market continued to fall, Voyager’s situation grew ever bleaker. On July 1, it froze all customer withdrawals and trading to “avoid irreparable damage to the Debtors’ business and ensure that its trading platform operated smoothly for all customers.” (Not being able to withdraw, it must be noted, seems in itself like less than smooth operation.)  Voyager went into what might be described as panic mode. By mid-June, it retained legal counsel; a consultancy joined the fray by month’s close. The Canada-listed public company needed “potential strategic solutions” to its looming liquidity crisis – and it needed them fast. That could include selling businesses or raising capital.  Some temporary breathing room came in the form of a June 20 unsecured loan facility worth roughly $500 million from trading powerhouse Alameda Research. Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried (also the CEO of the FTX exchange) has become crypto’s backstopper-in-chief during the market rout. Voyager initially borrowed $75 million, to be (theoretically) paid back by late 2024.  Meanwhile, the investment bankers reached out to “60 potential financial and strategic partners” – that is, potential saviors – according to Ehrlich. They got 22 leads toward a rescue deal, but only one proposal emerged. The offer was too much of a lowball for Voyager to stomach. No other options appeared.  “It became clear that a potential strategic transaction would only emerge after the Company petitioned for chapter 11 relief,” Ehrlich states.  Voyager tells the court it plans to mount a comeback. A Chapter 11 restructuring would allow Voyager to shed debt and restructure itself, rather than having to liquidate its assets. “Voyager will move as swiftly as possible through these cases to maximize the value of its business and allow customers to fully use the Company’s platform,” Ehrlich writes. A “robust marketing process” is already underway to signal Voyager cannot be counted out.  That marketing effort will need to be very robust indeed, since both broader conditions and some of Voyager’s own actions have profoundly undermined whatever public trust it enjoyed. A restructuring plan announced Monday would compensate users for missing crypto with shares of Voyager equity and Voyager tokens (whatever those are).  That’s unlikely to leave users particularly happy, though it might give them a backdoor incentive to continue using the crippled service.

42393974,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwbeR,1657647557,Satoshi Wept: How Crypto Replayed the 2008 Financial Crisis,"“Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” – Satoshi Nakamoto, circa 2009  “They mistook leverage for genius.” – Steve Eisman, FrontPoint Partners, circa 2008 (portrayed by Steve Carrell in “The Big Short”)  “We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out.” – Zhu Su, Three Arrows Capital, June 15, 2022  Over the past eight weeks a series of seemingly robust pillars of the cryptocurrency industry have fallen. They knocked each other over like dominoes, and as they hit the ground they shattered. Our pillars, it turns out, were made of glass.  A misguided bet nukes the balance sheet of a “hedge fund” that forgot to hedge. Tanking markets trigger margin calls for shadow banks masquerading as crypto lenders, which in turn freeze customer balances. Long-dated illiquid bonds leave nearly everybody in the lurch. Counterparties default on massive loans.  And, just like that, hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of notional value is gone.  On July 6, FTX exchange founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried declared that this catastrophic crypto industry unwind was nearly over. Even if that’s true, the work of understanding what actually happened has barely begun. Thanks to crypto infrastructure, the web of relationships and obligations have been somewhat more visible than would have been the case in traditional markets. But there are still a lot of details to be unearthed.  On the other hand, in broad strokes, we know exactly what happened: leverage, debt and other counterparty relationships based on bullish market bets melted down when those bets didn’t pan out. The cryptocurrency market has dropped by roughly two-thirds, but it was leverage that turned that drop into a death sentence for some companies and many of their customers’ balances.  It's all so tiresome. All so familiar. All so much like the 2008 financial crisis that fueled widespread interest in cryptocurrency in the first place.  The irony is rich and getting richer: Some of the failing entities even got “bailouts” of a sort, in the form of private lines of credit and buyouts. It seems that always and everywhere, capital crises and “Star Wars” prequels are like poetry: they rhyme.  Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) were often premised on the elimination or reduction of such leverage from the new financial system. But the Great Crypto Unwind has shown that even a non-counterparty bearer instrument, ideal for preventing such crises, can and will be subverted by financial engineers with warm smiles and treachery in their hearts. However much we think we’ve learned, human frailty still trends towards greed, recklessness and, in the end, chaos.  Read More: Why This Crypto Crash Is Different  There is still much we don’t know about crypto’s Great Unwind. But here’s one attempt at a first draft of history.  Financial Crisis 1.0  First, some context.  The persistent and sometimes frenetic enthusiasm for the Bitcoin project since its creation in 2009 has had a lot to do with timing. Pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto launched the original cryptocurrency in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, in which the declining value of a small set of assets caused cascading failures among a rat’s nest of financial institutions tightly linked by shared debt and similar obligations.  Those intertwined obligations sent the entire financial and banking world into a spiral when they went bad, killing or maiming major institutions like Lehman Brothers and AIG, respectively, and leaving others on death’s door. In turn, the resulting credit squeeze sent the global economy into a years-long Ice Age, effectively leaving all of us holding the bag for the big banks’ irresponsible decisions.  The resulting rage was present almost from the earliest days of the Bitcoin project. The original white paper is dry and mostly technical, but pre-launch discussions among developers were much more pointed. By the time the Bitcoin blockchain went live, criticism of banks had become nearly a doctrine: Bitcoin’s first block contained a reference to U.K. banking bailouts.  Thirteen years later, parts of the industry spawned by Satoshi’s brainchild have come to resemble those hated enemies. A wave of collapses has hit centralized “crypto banks” that used customer funds to make leveraged bets. Investment funds exploited the opacity of their centralized balance sheets to hide their risk profiles and harvest loans that have left creditors in the lurch.  Some of those troubled entities, such as the lending platform BlockFi, have even gotten “bailouts” in the form of giant private loans. Those bailouts are mostly better described as buyouts, and don’t present the same immense moral hazard as the taxpayer-funded 2008 bailouts of degenerate gamblers at Citigroup and Bank of America. The entities getting fresh capital this year are the ones private investors (above all, Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX) see as viable in the long term.  Other entities, including Celsius, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital have been deemed unworthy of new money and are moving towards bankruptcy, collapse or liquidation – and taking a lot of depositor money with them.  Lunatics at the gate  Finance is ultimately a way of turning promises about the future into money. It’s a way to get paid now based on something that might (or might not) happen in two or five or 10 years. This is especially true for crypto, with token and equity values alike often hinging on someone’s huge vision of a far-distant technological revolution.  Few visions of the future have faded as quickly or ignominiously as that of Do Kwon, founder of the Luna ecosystem and its TerraUSD algorithmic “stablecoin.” TerraUSD was ultimately revealed to be, in essence, a Ponzi scheme, propped up by unsustainable interest paid on deposits in a pseudo-bank called Anchor.  In the narrative of the Great Unwind, LUNA is the most dramatic culprit on the asset and technology side. Other assets that weakened crypto institutions caused liquidity problems, but LUNA/terraUSD (UST) were the only crypto assets that simply collapsed to effectively zero thanks to bad tokenomic design. It’s quite impressive – you really have to work to send a crypto token to zero. Even the native token of the largely defunct 2017 ICO-era chain EOS, once worth $4.4 billion, is now worth more than LUNA.  Like most such scams, the LUNA Ponzi only worked as long as markets trended upwards. When those markets began to reverse at the end of 2021, the writing on the wall was clear enough that many early, big-money shills dumped their bags. When LUNA fully unwound in May, it destroyed $68 billion worth of paper value in a matter of days – one of the most dizzying single wealth-destroying events in peacetime history.  That collapse would have been bad enough in isolation. The stories of individual users losing their life savings in Anchor are bleak. But some high-profile and supposedly smart money managers also failed this financial IQ test – and that’s where the real trouble began.  LUNA, GBTC and stETH: The three horsemen of the crypto-pocalypse  If the LUNA collapse was the spark that set off the Great Unwind, Three Arrows Capital was the dynamite factory where the spark landed. And there was a whole lot of dynamite.  With a reported $18 billion in assets under management at its peak, Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, was a mix of venture fund and hedge fund. It has been alleged it was also secretly operating as a prime brokerage service, letting friendly partners trade on its accounts. 3AC co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies were darlings of the crypto world for years, and the fund was generally believed to be working entirely with its own money – a so-called “prop shop.”  But as its various bets went bad, it became increasingly clear that 3AC was engaged in a variety of serious deceptions. Most brazenly, the fund appears to have borrowed large amounts from a variety of counterparties that were each unaware of the fund’s total debt levels. Now, Three Arrows is in liquidation and Zhu and Davies' whereabouts are described as “unknown” in filings by their own legal team – though Zhu did break a lengthy Twitter silence on the morning of July 12.  Read More: US Bankruptcy Court Approves Foreign Administrator for Three Arrows Capital's Debt  Such profligate, opaque borrowing is similar to the moves that led Lehman Brothers to the boneyard in 2008. It also echoes the 1998 collapse of Long Term Capital Management, and the more recent leveraged blowout of Bill Hwang’s Archegos fund. During the 2008 crisis, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke reportedly saw Lehman as the most reckless of the big investment banks exposed to mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps. In accounts of the era, there’s a strong sense that Lehman CEO Dick Fuld was as personally arrogant as he was in his financial dealings.  That’s also a common thread with Three Arrows. Much like Lehman’s real estate position, 3AC’s positions amounted to an immense leveraged long, in this case largely on the price of bitcoin. Zhu Su had articulated a “supercycle” theory that he said would send bitcoin to $100,000 or higher. So when the broader market began to slump in November of 2021, Three Arrows was already a dead man walking. The following flood of margin calls and redemption notices simply exposed its failures.  And 3AC had made even higher-risk bets than leveraged BTC longs: You guessed it, it was waist-deep in LUNA. Three Arrows reportedly invested $200 million in LUNA in February. That stake grew to as much as $600 million on paper as LUNA enjoyed a huge run-up. It is now worth effectively zero.  In a bit of striking poetry, though, LUNA was just one of three mortal wounds that took out 3AC. The other two were not frauds, but illiquid bonds the fund couldn’t sell when it needed cash to cover its loans: stETH (Lido staked ETH) and GBTC, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. (Grayscale and CoinDesk have the same parent company, Digital Currency Group.)  Back in January 2021, 3AC announced a $1.2 billion position in GBTC. GBTC, essentially a kludgy legal workaround for institutions that want BTC exposure, cannot be easily swapped for its underlying bitcoin. This isn’t much of a problem in bullish periods – when 3AC bought in, GBTC was trading at a premium of nearly 20% above bitcoin, arguably because it had few competitors for institutional access.  But almost as soon as Three Arrows bought in, GBTC holders started taking profits off that premium, and competitors arrived in the form of Canadian bitcoin ETFs. By August 2021, the trust had flipped from trading at a premium to trading at a discount of roughly 15%. This meant Three Arrows was deeply underwater on its massive GBTC position.  Read More: FSInsight Accuses Three Arrows Capital of Running a ‘Madoff-Style Ponzi Scheme’  The GBTC discount has now widened to more than 30%, a potentially insane buying opportunity for long-term BTC bulls with cash on hand. But Castle Island’s Matt Walsh has speculated that the GBTC disconnect was the first shoe to drop for Three Arrows, which found itself locked into a degraded GBTC position and took bigger and bigger risks – including in LUNA – as it desperately tried to fill the hole.  Then, following that plague of locusts, came stETH. StETH is a token issued in exchange for ETH staked through the Lido protocol. It will convert to ETH at an uncertain future date when the Ethereum proof-of-stake Merge is complete.  That makes it essentially a tokenized, zero-coupon ETH bond with an unknown maturity. StETH can be bought and sold but it can’t be used on Ethereum, so it’s fairly natural that it trades at a discount against ETH. 3AC’s apparently forced stETH sale came when that discount was ranging at around 10%, a potentially devastating haircut even ignoring ETH’s own swooning price (it has fallen about two-thirds in 2022 so far), compared to returns if 3AC had been liquid enough to wait for the Merge.  Three Arrows to the knee  Between these illiquid bets, its massive screwup on LUNA and the macro-driven decline in bitcoin, 3AC faced an insurmountable wave of margin calls from exchanges where it had traded. It also had large, sometimes unsecured loans.  It now appears that, despite a cryptic tweet from Su Zhu on June 14, 3AC was not in fact “committed to working this out” with its array of creditors. Instead, it has ghosted exchanges and other counterparties. Genesis Trading, another CoinDesk sibling company, was taken for “hundreds of millions of dollars.” Other exchanges were able to liquidate 3AC’s books and made it out more or less intact – BitMEX, for instance, says 3AC still owes it $6 million.  Those victims, it turns out, got off easy.  Lending platform Voyager Digital, in a demonstration of just how trusted Three Arrows was, gave the fund a reported $650 million in unsecured loans – that is, loans without collateral that could be called in if things went south. Voyager declared bankruptcy this week largely because, with Three Arrows now in liquidation, it’s unclear if or when it will get even a portion of those funds back. It seems Voyager’s retail depositors shouldn’t expect all of their money back.  Read More: Three Arrows Paper Trail Leads to Trading Desk Obscured Via Offshore Entities  Lenders and exchanges were far from the only entities that got “rugged” by Three Arrows’ bizarre disappearing act. A spokesperson for a protocol 3AC invested in claimed that the fund had also managed the project’s treasury, which is now just as gone as all the rest of the money. Moreover, according to the same source, 3AC enticed projects to deposit with it by offering 8% interest. That high fixed rate suggests this may have been less a generous service than a way for Zhu and Davies to get more chips with which to gamble.  This and other behaviors have led at least some to conclude Three Arrows was not simply a failed hedge fund but an outright scam. Castle Island’s Walsh, on his firm’s “On the Brink” podcast, vociferously condemned Three Arrows’s alleged actions.  “This is not just some bad investing,” said Walsh. “Based on what we’re starting to learn about Three Arrows, this is a massive fraud. This is a Bernie Madoff-style fraud. These are bad people.”  That’s not what we meant by ""unbanked""  3AC’s shenanigans will have echoing long-term effects as the lenders and startups who lost funds run out of money entirely. But it took another class of dingus to turn the same speculative screwups into immediate, searing pain for individual, crypto-novice retail investors.  Opaque and centralized “lending platforms” including Celsius and Babel Finance were exposed to 3AC, LUNA, stETH, and other risks, largely because they were chasing outsized returns and taking huge risks to deliver them. Voyager’s $650 million unsecured loan to Three Arrows may have also been yield-chasing, and in retrospect looks like the equivalent of jumping out of a plane without a parachute. Amid all this, another lending platform, BlockFi, managed to only wipe out $1 billion in investor funds. So kudos to them, I guess.  These risks were concealed from depositors, for whom Celsius’s sales pitch – “Unbank Yourself” – turned out to be terrifyingly accurate.  Voyager’s huge unsecured loan to Three Arrows may go down as the single stupidest transaction of the 2022 crypto unwind. But the case of the lending platforms is a good bit more nuanced and interesting.  It's helpful to understand the difference between Celsius and its ilk and “decentralized finance,” or DeFi, a category with which the lenders often misleadingly affiliated themselves. At the highest level, DeFi protocols run entirely on the blockchain while Celsius, BlockFi, Babel and the like were traditional centralized financial entities that would put your money in DeFi and other investments and reap profits on your behalf. They sold themselves as an alternative to traditional banks that still had “DeFi” cool, vastly increasing the eventual damage inflicted. This is why they’re sometimes referred to derogatorily as “CeFi” – centralized wolves in decentralized sheep’s clothing.  Because behind the scenes they were closer to being some kind of fixed-return hedge fund, engaging in constant high-risk gambling with depositors’ money. And, yet again, these hedge funds forgot to hedge.  By contrast, decentralized finance trading, stablecoin and lending protocols including MakerDAO, Compound and Curve have been basically unscathed by the big crash. They’ve lost a lot of users and volume, but they haven’t wound up in massive debt because the protocols themselves can’t really take on leverage. Instead, all loans are overcollateralized – that is, you have to post something like $2,000 worth of ETH to borrow $1,000 worth of something else, and you’ll get automatically liquidated if your collateral drops below or near your borrowing.  These rules can’t be bent. It would have been completely impossible, then, for 3AC to take out a huge unsecured loan from Compound, which is why Compound is still running and Voyager Digital is roadkill. In a grim bit of comedy, Celsius just repaid a $183 million loan from Compound to redeem its collateral, even as withdrawals from Celsius remain locked and Voyager prays to every God in heaven to get back pennies on its insane unbacked loan to 3AC.  So as crazy as it might sound to use a bank or asset exchange with no owners, that very lack of a backstop forced the systems to build with extremely conservative financial assumptions. The humans, it turns out, were always the dangerous ones.  And perhaps no human lender was more dangerous than Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, who matched or outdid Do Kwon for bluster, bombast and bad ideas, right up until the day before his operation imploded under his feet.  Read more:Blockchain.com, Deribit Among Creditors That Pushed for 3AC Liquidation: Report  Celsius was founded on the premise that it would accept retail crypto deposits, then loan those tokens to institutional traders at high rates. For a time, there was enough loan demand to make this work. But eventually Celsius started engaging in much riskier behavior as it searched for high yields for all of its reported $12 billion under management.  The shift to higher-risk strategies was likely thanks to increased deposits in response to its high yield offerings, combined with declines in institutional interest as the crypto market started to cool in late 2021. Celsius started out making mostly collateralized loans to institutional traders, though they misrepresented this, even early on. From there, they eventually progressed to engaging in degen-level yield farming by staking customer funds to every DeFi protocol under the sun.  This was a much higher-risk strategy, and in some cases, as with an estimated $50 million lost in the hack of BadgerDAO, it blew up in Celsius’s face. In another case, Mashinsky got ridiculously lucky. Celsius reportedly began depositing on LUNA’s Anchor system in December, where it would have collected something like 20% nominal yield – more than enough to cover its payouts to depositors, with a bit extra off the top. But Celsius just barely managed to pull out $500 million before that system completely melted down in May. That’s nearly the dictionary definition of “picking up nickels in front of a steamroller” – taking immense, opaque risks for modestly above-average returns. And, in this case, doing it with other people’s money.  Celsius managed to dodge that steamroller. But if you play stupid games, you eventually win stupid prizes. If his representations of Celsius as safe and stable are determined to have been deceptive to depositors, Alex Mashinsky could wind up with the same prize already awarded to another former Celsius officer: a pair of handcuffs.  Splash damage  Though we’ve inevitably left out a few details, that’s the basic outline of the Great Crypto Unwind. But its impacts were felt far beyond those who were directly exposed to entities like Three Arrows, Celsius or Voyager Digital. For much the same reason that a deflating real estate market locked up the entire economy in 2008, problems at a few crypto entities have echoed far and wide.  The easiest way to see this is simply in the price of blue chip crypto assets like bitcoin and ether. Granted, those prices began steadily declining starting back in November 2021 because of macroeconomic conditions, and those pressures have continued in parallel with the impact of the credit unwind.  But if you look at specific dates, it’s not hard to pin steep, sudden price declines on C-Suite frauds and jumped-up degens.  The depegging of UST became publicly obvious between May 9 and May 12 of this year, while BTC dropped a staggering 27% between May 5 and May 11. Though the UST depeg likely didn’t involve bitcoin directly, it would have created a lot of granular BTC sell-pressure for those covering LUNA losses. It also, more obviously, created a kind of confidence contagion, since many new crypto entrants didn’t seem to understand the distinction between LUNA and other assets.  Just over a month later, problems at Three Arrows became public as early as June 14. This coincided with another gigantic macro dump, as BTC cratered a further 26% between June 12 and June 17. Again, this involved some vague loss of confidence, but we know that Three Arrows was in the process of various liquidation strategies, so in this case there was likely some direct sell pressure.  In both cases, you’ll notice that the dumps began shortly before bad news made it to public sites like CoinDesk. That points to a difficult truth not so much about crypto as about financial markets overall – whatever the rules say, insiders often know what’s happening first thanks to whisper networks that mere plebs can never hope to access. Sometimes a dump is just a dump, but other times it’s a hint at very bad news around the corner.  The leverage is too damn high  It’s a bit early to look for many lessons in this mess because there may yet be other shoes to drop – other entities that were overleveraged or made reckless loans to the overleveraged, but have managed to hang on for a few weeks or months without revealing their mistake.  One important insight for those trying to dodge falling shoes: Companies that were late entrants to the crypto game were far more likely to be making leveraged bets as they tried to catch up to more established players. One reason Alameda Research is in a position to rescue flailing partners is that it was founded in 2017 and has apparently relied mostly on organic growth.  Longer term, I recommend filing away the names of individual culprits and holding on to the list for future reference. Character and judgment obviously count when people are asking to manage your money, and figures like Do Kwon, Alex Mashinsky, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies clearly came up short on one or both of those measures. They deserve to be banished from the finance industry for the rest of their lives. At least in some cases, that will happen – I’d bet it’s tough to run a shadow bank from prison.  But the more important questions are systemic. Obviously, there was way too much borrowing going on, and widely trusted individuals seem to have lied about their debt. That’s theoretically a regulatory issue. But even if it were universally desired, a global crypto regulatory regime doesn’t seem very plausible right now.  There’s a lot more potential in a social solution that doubles down on crypto’s original vision of self-custody. Remember, depositors in Celsius actually sent their bitcoin to a guy on the internet, and that’s why they don’t have it now. By a similar token (ahem), a percentage of Celsius users got rooked by collecting their “yield” in a corporate s**tcoin, CEL.  Many retail victims of these cons and failures will be turned off crypto for a long time, if not permanently. That’s a harm to the vision we came here to pursue, and it will take principled operators to rebuild trust overall. On the other hand, for many people, there’s no education quite like getting ripped off. We have to hope they’ll spend some time thinking about where exactly they went wrong, and help educate others about what crypto really has to offer.  That’s been a big part of the aftermath of previous crypto cycles. But the truth is, thanks to leverage and a few centralized players, this one likely hurts far worse than even the brutal 2018-2019 Crypto Winter. At least when your garbage 2017 ICO became valueless, you got to keep the tokens and vaguely think, “well, maybe someday!”  But thanks to malign and incompetent figures like Alex Mashinsky and Do Kwon, a lot of potential crypto converts have been left with nothing at all.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | LUNA,BTC | ETH | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

The crypto market hit a rough patch over the last few months. Since the average investor cannot participate in every token sale, however, the mean return is not an accurate measure of a token index’s performance. Introduction A falling stock market is not bad for everyone. Sure, many investors lose out as their portfolios decline in value, but those who are just starting to invest or have underweighted equities can benefit from lower valuations, which tend to deliver higher returns over the long term. Naturally, equity markets do not fall without reason. As the economic environment changes, so do expectations. The positive feedback loop that sends valuations rising eventually reverses course and turns negative. But at some point, economic and business conditions stabilize and valuations come down enough to attract new investors and lure old ones back in. For instance, companies with anticyclical business models can increase their appeal by raising their dividend payments . But not all securities markets exhibit the same dynamic as that of equities. For example, the Italian lira consistently lost value against the Deutsche Mark for decades before both currencies were merged into the euro, and currencies can effectively become worthless when hyperinflation sets in. So, what about cryptocurrency tokens? Critics have long raised concerns about their intrinsic value, or lack thereof, and there doesn't seem to be a relationship between a token's price and the product for which it is supposed to serve as a medium of exchange. But with nearly 10,000 cryptocurrencies available, security selection should matter. So, does it? Can token pickers demonstrate differentiated performance? Probability of Making Money in Cryptocurrencies One of the more profitable approaches to cryptocurrencies is to invest in the private seed round of a start-up seeking token financing. The early price tends to be heavily discounted relative to the public sale price, which is comparable to pre-IPO investing. But more than four out of five tokens trade below their initial trading price, according to an analysis of nearly 10,000 cryptocurrencies by Jackdaw Capital, a London-based asset manager. Crypto Tokens: Current Price vs. Initial Trading Price Jackdaw Capital, FactorResearch Types of Tokens Such odds - less than 20% that a token traded on an exchange will eclipse its initial listing price - make token investing challenging. But there are different kinds of tokens. Some categories might still offer investors the prospect of attractive returns via security selection. To find out, we constructed a universe of the more than 3,500 tokens trading today and divided them into 17 categories. The largest category - non-fungible token (NFT) and collectibles - had 585 constituents, while the smallest - move to earn - had only 19. These token varieties represent different crypto products that ought to be relatively uncorrelated. Token Types: By the Numbers FactorResearch Token Performance Next, we created equal-weighted indices for each of the 17 token categories. The majority of our categories have only a few years of trading history, but NFTs and masternodes go back to 2013 with track records of almost a decade. Most of these indices generated such abnormally high performance that we needed a logarithmic scale to measure them. This explains much of crypto's appeal: The potential for 1,000% annual returns can be tough to resist. Token Performance by Type FactorResearch Cryptocurrency Volatility But the crypto market hit a rough patch over the last few months. Its total market capitalization decreased from nearly $3 trillion to less than $1 trillion, while bitcoin declined from an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021 to $20,000 as of this writing. Still, the log charts hardly register the cryptocurrency crash of 2022 since token indices use the mean return and equal weighting for index calculations. Tokens exhibited such a high positive skew that the average return moved up significantly more than down. For example, Terracoin ( TRC-USD ) skyrocketed from $52 to $2,535 in just a few days in 2013. The maximum a token can lose is 100%, but the upside could be parabolic. Cryptocurrency Volatility: Performance of TRC FactorResearch Token Performance Adjusted for Reality Since the average investor cannot participate in every token sale, however, the mean return is not an accurate measure of a token index's performance. The median return is a better metric. And it tells a much different story. All 17 token types have lost money for their investors since the inception of the indices. The performance between 2013 and 2018 - the peak of the first crypto bull market - was differentiated, although only a few tokens traded. Some token types - governance, for example - did well relative to, say, NFTs. From 2017 into 2018, however, hundreds of initial coin offerings ((ICOs)) took place. Many of these were, at best, speculative; others were outright scams. Since 2018, all token varieties have been in a consistent decline. Despite their different purposes and ostensible business models, all types of tokens followed the same downward trajectory. This implies that security selection does not matter in the crypto space. Furthermore, our universe is composed of tokens that are still trading and thus includes some survivorship bias. So, the returns are slightly overstated, which makes the perspective even more negative. Token Performance by Type: Median Returns FactorResearch Inflationary vs. Deflationary Tokens But maybe these bearish results are not as bad as they look. What happens if we differentiate between cryptocurrencies with a limited supply, like bitcoin, and those, like Ethereum, that have no supply constraints? Bitcoin and other limited-supply tokens could have a deflationary effect, especially when the issuer buys back tokens, while unlimited tokens could be inflationary as more and more tokens put downward pressure on token price. We divided the 550 DeFi tokens in our universe along these lines and found little difference between these two varieties from 2018 to the present. The supposedly deflationary limited-supply tokens actually performed worse. Performance of DeFi Tokens: Limited vs. Unlimited Token Supply FactorResearch Further Thoughts Fund managers have had a hard time creating value through security selection in equities and other traditional markets. Alpha generation has been low to negative over the last few decades. Theoretically, the new and complicated world of cryptocurrencies should offer plenty of information asymmetries that sophisticated investors can exploit. But alas, theory and reality often clash in the investment world. All varieties of tokens exhibit the same negative performance trends, which makes it a challenging environment for security selection. The average cryptocurrency hedge fund manager does not provide anything more than exposure to bitcoin . Investors can replicate such exposure themselves efficiently and at low cost through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The new world very much looks like the old world.

Arbitrum Nova is now live on its mainnet and open for developers to deploy their apps.  Arbitrum is a protocol that implements optimistic rollup technology to create a full Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) environment, providing a user experience that’s faster and cheaper than Ethereum’s mainnet.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same  What is Arbitrum Nova?  Arbitrum is Ethereum’s largest rollup provider, valued at nearly $2.5 billion according to DefiLlama. With the introduction of Arbitrum Nova, there are now two separate Arbitrum chains running live on mainnet that together can support a wide variety of use cases for blockchain.  Nova is intended to be used for social applications and gaming, while Arbitrum One will continue to be available for NFT and decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects.  Arbitrum Nova was built using Arbitrum AnyTrust, a new technology developed by Offchain Labs aimed at lowering fees, speeding up transactions and alleviating security concerns. AnyTrust chains are a more centralized alternative to optimistic rollups.  Next steps for Nova  Developers interested in working on the Nova platform can now apply for access and then start deploying their applications.

Meghji, now a professor at Duke University’s Pratt School of Engineering with a focus on artificial intelligence, Web3 and cybersecurity, told CoinDesk during “First Mover” that because the U.S. does not have a regulatory regime in place for crypto, it is using enforcement action to get a handle on overseeing nonregulated entities.  When asked what crypto investors can rely on today, Meghji said, “Frankly, nothing” in the current regulatory environment.  Sultan’s comments on regulation follow crypto broker Voyager’s recent bankruptcy filing, which included language suggesting user accounts were protected by the FDIC, something the FDIC denies.  Read more: FDIC Probing Voyager Claims It Was Insured by Regulator  The independent agency is responsible for ensuring banking stability in the U.S. and protecting a user’s account for up to $250,000 in the event of a bank collapse. Voyager, however, is not an FDIC-insured bank.  In the past, Meghji said, the FDIC has “come down hard on non-regulated entities” that insisted they were protected in some way by the U.S. government, despite not being insured directly by the agency.  Voyager is among the crypto companies that do not work directly with the FDIC, but through a “banking partner offering banking as a service.” In Voyager’s case, the Canadian-based firm was working with New York-based Metropolitan Commercial Bank.  “There’ll be some degree of protections there,” Meghji said about crypto-based firms that have a U.S. dollar account with a bank as a service provider, citing Voyager as an example.  Meghji added that because there is little to no regulatory support for the vast majority of crypto providers, it is important to find ways for “responsible crypto actors to get inside of the regulatory perimeter.”  When asked about current regulatory proposals – including a crypto-friendly bill by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and an announcement made Monday by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) that it would propose crypto regulations ahead of the G-20 meeting in October – Meghji said they’re interesting but only a subset of key points outlined in each is likely to be implemented.  Meghji underscored the need to remember the regulatory regime in the United States is quite different when compared with other countries, and that “it will take a while for those standards to be adopted into the American system.”  “It wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility that we don't see any actual action on this until after the 2024 presidential inauguration,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/12/crypto-investors-can-rely-on-frankly-nothing-in-current-regulatory-environment-says-former-fdic-official,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5db59ee3900b7bca4cdec15da2628328304d421b-1452x1089.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Nobel Prize winner wrote an opinion piece Monday examining how the industry was able to market itself to respectable institutions and individuals.  The industry ""has been spectacularly successful at marketing itself, creating an image of being both cutting edge and respectable,"" he wrote.  Krugman cited, for example, digital payments app Venmo inviting users to ""begin [their] crypto journey"" on its homepage and famous universities offering programs to learn about crypto.  ""I doubt there was any corruption ... Still, there clearly were and are financial rewards involved. I don’t know how much money Venmo makes from people buying and selling crypto on its platform, but it’s certainly not offering the service out of sheer good will. If you want to take, say, M.I.T.’s online blockchain course, it will cost you $3,500.""  With this degree of mainstream acceptance, according to Krugman, crypto became ""too big to regulate.""  While the recent downturn in the crypto markets has made effective regulation ""politically possible,"" the opportunity must be seized by central banks and other bodies ""before crypto stops being a mere casino and becomes a threat to financial stability,"" Krugman wrote, referencing a recent speech on crypto regulation by Lael Brainard, the Federal Reserve vice chair.  Krugman has expressed skepticism about crypto on several occasions, going back to 2013 when he dubbed bitcoin ""evil.""

42395229,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXkd5,1657642897,Multicoin Capital Announces $430M Venture Fund for Crypto Startups,"Crypto venture capital giant Multicoin Capital isn’t slowing down in the face of the market slump with its latest fund, the $430 million Venture Fund III.  The fund will provide capital for early-stage and later-stage projects focused on data-aggregating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), open finance, Web3 infrastructure and consumer social opportunities, among other initiatives. Early-stage projects can expect to receive between $500,000 and $25 million from a combination of funds originating from Venture Fund III and Multicoin’s evergreen liquid fund, which has assets in the single-digit billions. Later-stage projects are eligible for up to $100 million in capital from a combination of the same two funds.  Multicoin Capital Managing Partner Kyle Samani says those numbers aren’t set in stone, however, and some projects may be eligible to receive greater sums of capital from the firm. “We don't have a strict rule like ‘$25 million max’ for this size deal,” Samani told CoinDesk in an interview last week. “We don't think in those terms.”  Multicoin Capital, which was founded in 2017, has historically funded tech and infrastructure investments. For example, the firm led a $3.5 million seed-funding round in 2019 with Intel Capital for blockchain data startup dfuse’s line of products geared toward demystifying blockchain data.  Now, however, the firm is looking to increase its investments in consumer-facing projects. “We are spending an increasing percentage of our time on things that directly face consumers and that are poised to reshape massive consumer-facing markets,” the press release noted.  Investing in a Bear Market  Although the recent market downturn has kneecapped a wide range of investors, Multicoin’s leadership plans to continue putting its money in a wide range of projects.  “We are continuing to invest at a fairly rapid pace, issuing, on average, probably one term sheet per week or more for a long time like over a year,” said Samani. “That is still true today and I do not see that changing in the foreseeable future. We invest across market cycles, we find assets that we think are very exciting and we buy them and then hold them forever.”  Legal Issues  Multicoin’s Venture Fund III announcement comes just days after the investment firm was named in a class-action lawsuit accusing Multicoin and other key players in the Solana ecosystem of illegally profiting from SOL, which the suit alleges is an unregistered security.

Based on our data, crypto certainly does not act like digital gold. In times of panic, the correlation between crypto and the stock market actually increases. When it comes to hedging equity risk, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are more fool’s gold than digital gold. Crypto enthusiasts often claim that digital coins and tokens are uncorrelated with equities and can provide a safe haven amid stock market crashes. The assumption is that cryptoassets will act like “digital gold,” serving as a hedge against equity risk, and help investors ride out such downturns. Such bold claims beg for examination, especially amid what looks like a bear market for stocks. So, we explored how crypto has performed during previous crashes. In particular, we isolated the major panic events over crypto’s short history and studied the correlation between this new asset class and some of its more traditional peers. Five times over the last five years, the S&P 500 fell 7.5% or more. In each of these instances, we measured how correlations changed between gold and the S&P 500, bitcoin and the S&P 500, and bitcoin and gold. We examined the correlations between other cryptocurrencies and gold and the S&P 500 as well but found the results were qualitatively similar, so we used bitcoin as a proxy for crypto in general. The correlation between gold and the S&P 500 came in as expected. Outside of major downturns, gold and the S&P 500 have just a slight positive correlation of 0.060. Yet, when the S&P 500 plunges, so does its average correlation with gold, which drops to –0.134. The takeaway is clear: Gold does offer some protection in down markets and lives up to its status as a perennial hedge. Crash Correlations: Gold and the S&P 500 Correlation First Crash: 26 Jan. to 7 Feb. 2018 –0.073 Second Crash: 21 Sep. to 28 Dec. 2018 –0.077 Third Crash: 6 May to 6 June 2019 –0.407 Fourth Crash: 20 Feb. to 28 March 2020 0.241 Fifth Crash: 1 Jan. to 11 March 2022 –0.356 Average Correlation during Crashes –0.134 Average Correlation Outside of Crashes –0.060 The same cannot be said for bitcoin — or crypto in general. Outside of equity market downturns, bitcoin and the S&P 500 have had a slight positive correlation of 0.129. Amid the last five stock market contractions, however, the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 jumped to 0.258. Indeed, in only two of the past five downturns did the correlation turn negative. On the other hand, true to its hedge-y reputation, gold exhibited a negative correlation with the benchmark index in four out of the last five crashes. Crash Correlations: Bitcoin and the S&P 500 Correlation First Crash: 26 Jan. to 7 Feb. 2018 0.814 Second Crash: 21 Sep. to 28 Dec. 2018 –0.025 Third Crash: 6 May to 6 June 2019 –0.583 Fourth Crash: 20 Feb. to 28 March 2020 0.588 Fifth Crash: 1 Jan. to 11 March 2022 0.493 Average Correlation during Crashes 0.258 Average Correlation Outside of Crashes 0.129 But what about bitcoin and gold? How has that relationship changed during recent panics and downturns? In rising equity markets, bitcoin and gold have a slight positive correlation of 0.057. Amid stock market crashes, the correlation rises only slightly to 0.064. So, whatever the state of the equity markets, the correlation between gold and bitcoin is pretty close to zero. Crash Correlations: Bitcoin and Gold Correlation First Crash: 26 Jan. to 7 Feb. 2018 –0.194 Second Crash: 21 Sep. to 28 Dec. 2018 0.107 Third Crash: 6 May to 6 June 2019 0.277 Fourth Crash: 20 Feb. to 28 March 2020 0.275 Fifth Crash: 1 Jan. to 11 March 2022 –0.179 Average Correlation during Crashes 0.057 Average Correlation Outside of Crashes 0.064 Based on our data, crypto certainly does not act like digital gold. In times of panic, the correlation between crypto and the stock market actually increases. So, whatever its proponents may say about its utility as a hedge against market downturns, crypto has served as more of an anti-hedge, with its correlation with the S&P 500 rising as stocks plunge. That said, given the lack of correlation between gold and crypto, the latter may add some diversification benefits to a portfolio. Nevertheless, the overall verdict is undeniable: When it comes to hedging equity risk, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are more fool’s gold than digital gold.

Transactions on the blockchain show that a wallet linked to Celsius transferred $81.6 million in Circle’s USDC stablecoin on Tuesday to the automated decentralized lending protocol Aave. The move reduced Celsius's debt to Aave to $8.5 million.  Crucially, the transfer freed up $410 million in stETH, a type of staked ether token that Celsius had pledged as collateral against the loan on Aave. The stETH tokens are a derivative version of the Ethereum blockchain’s native token ether (ETH); each stETH token represents 1 ETH locked up on Ethereum's upcoming proof-of-stake network.  The stETH token has been at the epicenter of the liquidity crunch in crypto markets after its price deviated from the supposed 1-to-1 peg to ether. At press time, stETH trades at about 3% discount compared with ETH.  Celsius is one of the largest single holders of stETH, with at least $426 million of the tokens, according to blockchain data firm Nansen's portfolio tracker. The stake represents almost a tenth of stETH's total market capitalization, at $4.4 billion.  Celsius liquidity  Celsius, which at one point managed over $20 billion of client deposits, is one of the crypto lenders that suspended withdrawals to prevent a run on its deposits. It also laid off 150 employees and hired restructuring advisors, as CoinDesk reported.  The down payment represents another maneuver by Celsius to reclaim collateral by paying down debt to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  Last week, Celsius paid off its $228 million debt to Maker, another DeFi lending platform, and got back $440 million of collateral in the form of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), a BTC derivative, blockchain data shows. After that, Celsius started to make good on its loans from Aave and Compound, paying down $95 million of the debt by Monday.  At press time, Celsius still owed $59 million to DeFi protocols, according to data on crypto data tracker Zapper: $8.5 million to Aave and $50 million to Compound, with $28 million and $199 million locked up on the platforms, respectively, as collateral, denominated in various tokens.

The SSV (Secret Shared Validator) DAO accrued $10 million in assets through strategic partnerships with Coinbase, Digital Currency Group (DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk) and OKEx. SSV DAO will funnel more than $3 million into open and predefined grants for developers building applications and staking pools and other tools needed by the network. In addition, the organization has earmarked $3 million for bug bounties and $4 million for incentivized programs for early adopters and testers. The grants will be distributed in USDC, ETH and SSV tokens.  Since March, SSV DAO has awarded $1 million in grants to companies and builders like RockX, Swell, Forbole and Ankr, but SSV.network protocol lead Alon Muroch hopes the DAO’s commitment to double down on grants will incentivize companies and developers to build on top of the SSV protocol.  ""The Ethereum community has identified DVT [Distributed Validator Technology] as a crucial component in ensuring that the protocol remains decentralized and secure,” said Muroch. “We encourage development teams to join the grant program and unlock distributed staking on Ethereum for the next billion users.""  Although many crypto companies have begun to tighten their belts as industry leaders declare bankruptcy or pursue mass layoffs during the bear market, SSV.network's director of marketing, Eran Efrima, views the recent market downturn as an opportunity to step up the group's mission.  “A lot of brainpower is still in the industry, a lot of companies are still developing [and] Ethereum is definitely not going anywhere, which means the only logical thing to do is to double down now,” Efrima told CoinDesk.  Increasing the number of individuals working on the staking infrastructure needed for decentralized staking applications is especially imperative for Efrima’s team following the completion of the Sepolia testnet merge, the penultimate merger test before Ethereum’s big merger, known as The Merge on Wednesday.

42395230,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXke4,1657637335,"Bitcoin 'Bear Flag,' Crypto Options Market Hint at Downside Risk","Bitcoin's recent trading action has formed a pattern called a ""bear flag."" That looks like a pause in the past months' market downtrend, and it usually leads to a fresh move lower.  What's especially troubling at the moment is just how lopsided the positioning has become in the crypto options market. The dynamic might aggravate any sell-off triggered by a flag breakdown.  The bear flag resembles an upside-down flag on a price chart. First there is a strong move down (the flagpole) and then a minor price bounce (the flag). Under the conventional wisdom of technical analysis (the art of price-chart reading), an asset's price usually drops roughly the length of the pole following the flag breakdown. Hence, the bear flag is considered a bearish continuation pattern.  In the case of bitcoin (BTC), the corrective bounce from the June 18 low of $17,601 to Friday's high of $22,400 represents the flag, and the preceding decline from $32,500 is the flagpole. Trend lines connecting June 18 and July 3 lows – and June 26 and July 8 highs – reveal the flag.  ""It's a bear flag and the breakdown could happen soon,"" said Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset management firm Blofin.  A breakdown – likely if the price finishes below the lower end of the flag at the end of a trading date – would imply that the broader downtrend is resuming, opening the doors for a retest of the recent low of $17,601. Below that, key support is seen at the psychological level of $15,000 and the June 2019 high of $13,880.  Technical analysis is subjective; price patterns often fail, trapping chart-focused traders on the wrong side of the market. Note that while the daily chart flag pattern is signaling downside risk, other price-chart patterns are sending conflicting signals: As previously reported, technical analysis of the long-term moving price average as well as several blockchain data indicators suggest the bitcoin market is close to bottoming or maybe already on the way back up.  Options market trading could add to volatility  That said, should the flag end with a downside move, the resulting fall might be exacerbated by the hedging activity of options market participants, mainly market makers – entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange.  Market makers are always on the opposite side of investors' trades and maintain a neutral portfolio through continuous buying and selling of the underlying asset as the price swings.  According to Ardern, market makers currently hold ""short put"" positions; that essentially means the market makers have taken the opposite side of options traders who are betting on further price declines; so the market makers stand to lose if bitcoin resumes the downtrend.  If the market were to turn lower, it might set off a mad scramble for the market makers to quickly cover their losing positions – exacerbating the price action on the downside.  ""When the price falls in the future, the hedging behavior of derivatives investors will further aggravate the decline,"" Ardern said.  Bitcoin was last seen trading near 1% lower on the day near $19,700, with investors awaiting Wednesday's U.S. inflation data that is likely to cement the case for continued faster withdrawal of liquidity by the Federal Reserve.  ""The inflation print has been a key source of market movement this year, and we expect an uptick in vols [volatility] ahead of the event,"" the Singapore-based options trading giant QCP Capital, said in a market outlook tweeted early Tuesday.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/12/bitcoin-bear-flag-crypto-options-market-hint-at-downside-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d815a04a6f2e7cdb7f68f44556c403214dbfd4b9-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It added that the buyback and burn process “may take a few weeks to complete” in order to avoid causing sudden price volatility.  “In addition to the buyback and burn program, STEPN will allocate capital reserves to improve upon existing features and build out the team,” developers said.  STEPN said the team had identified several areas where the company will deploy its earned capital in order to improve game play. These include security enhancements, anti-cheating mechanisms to prevent bots from earning GMT, building the developer and core team and seeking out partnerships and/or sponsorship opportunities.  GMT prices rose nominally following the earnings release.

42395237,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXkiz,1657636200,Looking at the Claims Celsius Operated Like a Ponzi,"Celsius, which quite frankly is not having a pleasant go of it right now, is getting sued by a former business partner who alleges the company a) didn’t pay him and b) engaged in some frankly very poor practices (if the claims are accurate).  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  ‘Classic Ponzi’  The narrative  KeyFi Inc., an investment manager entity, is suing crypto lender Celsius for not honoring “contractual obligations,” alleging the beleaguered company has failed to pay it “millions of dollars.”  The company and its founder, Jason Stone, are taking no prisoners: Stone alleges that “Celsius is, in fact, balance sheet insolvent.”  And looking through the complaint, all I can say is, “phew.”  Why it matters  Celsius halted withdrawals last month, becoming the first of several companies to do so amid this rapidly escalating bear market cycle. If the allegations as stated are true, it means that Celsius is yet another company that will not be able to make its customers whole without significant assistance. Still, there seems to be more to the story than just these allegations.  Breaking it down  Jason Stone, KeyFi’s proprietor, basically claimed that Celsius cannot meet all of its financial obligations, took out a $1 billion loan from stablecoin issuer Tether and is using new customer funds to pay back old customers.  It’s this last claim that’s particularly damning.  The allegations in short:  KeyFi and Celsius entered into what is described as an informal agreement wherein KeyFi would act as the investment manager for Celsius, using Celsius’ customers’ funds.  Stone alleged he found that Celsius “lack[ed] basic security controls.”  The companies formalized this agreement by the end of 2020. Under the agreement, Stone would receive 50% of the net profits from Celsius’ actions through 2022, the filing said.  And, uh, from the filing: “Stone also learned of multiple incidents where Defendants’ failure to perform basic accounting endangered customer funds. One such example included Celsius improperly accounting for certain payments owed to customers, resulting in a $200 million liability the company did not even understand how or why it owed.”  According to Stone, Celsius also failed to properly hedge against market volatility, so a paper profit in U.S. dollars may not have been an actual profit once converted to the customers’ crypto.  The suit was filed by the Roche Freedman law firm, and again, some pretty explosive allegations. The suit does note Celsius’ halting of withdrawals from last month as one concerning issue.  “On June 12, 2022, these issues – which Plaintiff identified in March 2021 – have now caused harm not only to Plaintiff, but the hundreds of thousands of people who use Defendants’ platform, as Defendants are now refusing to honor requests by its customers to withdraw the assets they deposited and entrusted with Defendants,” the suit claims.  As Celsius lost funding, the company allegedly went to great lengths to continue paying off existing customers, including borrowing $1 billion from Tether.  “Faced with a liquidity crisis, Celsius began to offer double-digit interest rates in order to lure new depositors, whose funds were used to repay earlier depositors and creditors. Thus, while Celsius continued to market itself as a transparent and well capitalized business, in reality, it had become a Ponzi scheme,” the suit alleges.  Even as this suit unfolds, it’s worth noting that Celsius has spent the last few weeks paying off loans to various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, including $140 million to Maker, giving it access to $440 million in collateral; Aave, giving it $950 million; and others.  Other questions remain unanswered. One detail that I didn’t see was why Stone waited until July 2022 to file this lawsuit if he left the company in March 2021. Hopes that he would still be paid?  What’s in an FDIC?  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a regulator in the U.S. tasked with ensuring the soundness and safety of banks and savings associations. If a bank fails, the FDIC is the regulator that will insure customer deposits, up to $250,000.  Note that this is if a bank or savings association fails. If a bank’s client fails, and that client happens to store customer funds on the bank, that does not mean that the customer funds are necessarily protected. In fact, they’re not. Whatever’s in the bank account is it.  So Voyager Digital is probably in trouble, huh. The company, which filed for bankruptcy protection, is facing an FDIC probe of some sort amid allegations it misled would-be customers about just how insured their funds were (spoiler: The funds were not protected.)  On Monday, Voyager published a blog post clarifying that what the FDIC insurance means is “you are covered in the event of Metropolitan Commercial Bank’s failure, up to a maximum of $250,000 per customer.  Needless to say, MCB has so far shown no cause for concern that it’s about to collapse.  Meanwhile, Voyager itself detailed what it has left in terms of funds:  $110 million in cash.  $350 million in cash at Metropolitan Commercial Bank.  $1.3 billion in crypto.  $650 million in Three Arrows Capital (3AC)-owed debt.  3AC is dealing with its own bankruptcy lawsuit, so who knows when that $650 million may be available again.

There will be a hearing on the matter this morning.

Solana Labs, Multicoin Accused of Violating Securities Law by SOL Investor: Another lawsuit – interestingly, also filed by the Roche Freedman law firm – alleges that the Solana Foundation, Solana Labs, Multicoin Capital, FalconX, Anatoly Yakovenko and Kyle Samani sold SOL tokens in a way that violated federal securities law.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Reuters) Boeing, the plane-making giant dogged by, well, lots of things (including, at this point, its own bloat), is considering discontinuing its 737 MAX 10 airplane because its flight deck won’t meet soon-to-be-enacted safety regulations.

(The Washington Post) It’s basically an open secret that, even though freight operators are legally required to give Amtrak trains priority right of passage on railroads owned by the freight operators, the operators will always give their own trains priority. This state of affairs is now being tested in the Gulf region, where Amtrak is hoping to not only bring back long-distance trains it ran prior to Hurricane Katrina, it wants to launch a few new more local services. The freight operators owning those tracks – CSX, mainly – say this would be disruptive to their own regularly-scheduled trains. An independent agency is now looking at the matter.

While a court hearing is set for Tuesday, there has not yet been &apos;any meaningful cooperation&apos; from 3AC founders Kyle Davies and Zhu Su, lawyers said in the filings, as reported by Bloomberg. &apos;Here, that risk is heightened because a substantial portion of the Debtor&apos;s assets are comprised of cash and digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens, that are readily transferable,&apos; the liquidator&apos;s lawyers said in court papers, as quoted by Bloomberg.

Overall, &apos;our good faith to cooperate with the Liquidators was met with baiting,&apos; Zhu wrote in a Twitter post. Three Arrows&apos; meltdown started after it failed to meet margin calls from its lenders after its crypto bets turned sour amid a broad market downturn.

The &apos;dot com&apos; extension has been commonly used since the first website was hosted in the early 1990s. This resulted in the well-known &apos;dot com bubble&apos; a few years ago.

42395240,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXklw,1657634307,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Below $20K and BTC's Inverse Correlation With Inflation-Adjusted Bond Yield Hits Record High,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: BTC dips below $20K, open interest moves upward and more on the unfolding of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  Market Moves: Omkar Godbole looks at how bitcoin's fortunes are more closely tied to the U.S. real or inflation-adjusted bond yield than ever.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading down 5% on the day, dipping below the $20,000 mark as a sell-off in traditional markets saw equity indexes decline.  If BTC holds the $20,000 support, it should soon be back at $25,000 (resistance), according to Matteo Bottacini, trader at Crypto Finance AG.  “Otherwise, the price is likely range-bounded again between $18,500 and $21,000,” wrote Bottacini in a note Tuesday.  The dollar rallied against all major developed market economies and the euro slipped closer to parity against the greenback on recession concerns.  Ether (ETH), fell by 7.8% over the last 24 hours and is back to trading around $1,000. The cryptocurrency reached a high of $1,250 over the weekend.  In the derivatives market, the amount of open bitcoin and ether perpetual futures contracts have recovered slightly this month, after dropping by double digits in June, according to data from Kaiko.  Bitcoin perpetual futures open interest rose 11% to $6 billion since the start of this month. Kaiko research notes that this is partly supported by a 7.6% increase in prices. Ether’s open interest rose at a slower pace of 7% to around $3 billion.  The increase was mainly driven by rising open positions on the two largest derivatives exchanges, FTX and Binance, according to Kaiko.  Meanwhile, BitMEX, crypto futures and spot exchange, announced Tuesday it has delayed listing its Ethereum-based BMEX token because of current market conditions.  “We have made the decision to postpone the listing of the BMEX Token on our spot exchange,” it said. “The reason is quite simple. Although we are ready to list BMEX, the present market conditions are not ideal, and we want to list the token in an environment that gives it the best chance to reward you, its holders.”  In other news, Sam Reynolds reported that Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu broke his Twitter silence Tuesday by posting screenshots of an email sent from his legal counsel to legal representatives of Three Arrows' liquidators, alleging they are ""baiting"" Zhu and co-founder Kyle Davies and ignoring their attempts to work with them in good faith.  According to a report from Reuters, cryptocurrency exchange Binance failed to deliver on money-laundering prevention promises. Binance operated outside the rules that many rival firms follow, while being ambiguous over the jurisdiction in which the main business is located, the news organization said.  And finally, Celsius Network, the troubled crypto lender, paid down $95 million of its debt to the Aave and Compound decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC +1.2% Smart Contract Platform Loopring LRC +1.1% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −9.3% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −9.2% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA −7.1% Entertainment  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin's Inverse Correlation With Inflation-Adjusted Bond Yield Hits Record High  Bitcoin's fortunes are more closely tied to the U.S. real or inflation-adjusted bond yield than ever, with the two increasingly moving in opposite directions.  At press time, the 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the yield on the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security stood just shy of the record -0.95 reached at the end of June.  The record inverse or negative correlation means bitcoin is moving in the opposite direction of the inflation-adjusted yield. A correlation coefficient is a number between +1 and -1, representing the linear interdependence of two variables or sets of data. If the correlation coefficient is -1, it means relationship between the two variables is negative 100% of the time. If the number is at +1, the two securities move in the same direction.  A positive real yield means the bond payout is exceeding the market-based measures of inflation expectations. Therefore, the higher the real yield, the lesser the incentive to chase returns from other assets like cryptocurrencies, stocks and gold.  So, it's no surprise that bitcoin, technology stocks and gold have taken a beating this year alongside an uptick in the real yield. The real yield has surged by more than 172 basis points to 1.72% this year, thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve's resolve to drain liquidity with rapid-fire interest rate hikes and balance sheet run-off to fight rampant inflation. While the leading cryptocurrency by market value has dropped nearly 57%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and gold are nursing a 27% and 5.2% loss, respectively.  The record negative correlation means the possibility of bitcoin plunging below the June low of $17,601 cannot be ruled out should the real yield continue to rise. And to the dismay of bulls cheering the bottom signals on blockchain indicators, the path of least resistance for the real yield appears to be on the higher side. That's because, inflation is showing no signs of slowing down and the Fed is unlikely to apply brakes to policy tightening anytime soon.

It’s that approach to regulations issues that has carried through to the launch of the company’s Web3-enabled platform.  “We work with our customer counsel to understand the regulatory requirements because a lot of times these projects are run by [web developers] and not people with regulatory expertise,” Borda told CoinDesk. “So we sort of are an intermediary there and help these projects comply with their international regulatory requirements.”  Tokensoft v2’s deployment on Ethereum and Avalanche follows a four-week round of testnet deployments with 13,637 users.  Tokensoft’s leadership plans to deploy its v2 platform on 10 chains by the end of this year. The platform has already received preliminary grant approval from blockchains like Avalanche and Polygon, with the latter chain launch expected to bring another 5,000 to 10,000 users to the platform.  Tokensoft’s team also wants to add more users by making the experience of selling and distributing tokens easier and more rewarding.  So far, the platform has worked to eliminate bots that can monopolize sales, ensuring real users can access and participate in popular sale events across the platform. To make sales more streamlined and less expensive, Tokensoft also employs Web3-native technology that queues users into a sale at an expected rate. This prevents users from flooding a sale all at once, which causes transaction fees on the network to spike.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/12/security-token-platform-tokensoft-launches-web-3-enabled-platform-tokensoft-v2-on-ethereum-avalanche,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cb853d053c2020ad5601a89f1ed7ef71ce827dd-889x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tuesday, despite a highly volatile market, the altcoin price reached a new all-time high, rising slowly but steadily. XTZ was a prominent performer to usher in the week, as prices surged to a three-week high. Following Monday&apos;s session low of $1.50, XTZ climbed to an intraday high of $1.60 yesterday. As of the time of writing, XTZ was trading at $1.54, an increase of 6.0 percent over the previous week.

Galhau announced on Tuesday that the bank has kicked off the second phase of experimentation into a wholesale CBDC, which could be used to streamline domestic and cross-border transactions between banks. CBDCs are digital versions of a jurisdiction's sovereign currency which, in France's case, is the euro.  ""We want to get closer to a viable prototype, testing it in practice with more private actors and more foreign central banks in the second half of 2022 and in 2023,"" Galhau said during a speech at the 2022 Paris Europlace International Financial Forum on Tuesday.  ""This work ensures that we stand ready to bring central bank money as a settlement asset as early as 2023,"" Galhau said.  Banque de France, which began experiments on a wholesale CBDC in March 2020, wrapped up its first stage of experimentation in December 2021. Galhau said on Tuesday that the first stage included nine experiments run hand in hand with the private sector and ""other public actors.""  Central banks are increasingly exploring wholesale CBDCs that are built on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and promise to help speed up interbank settlements.  The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an association of central banks from around the world, has a number of ongoing experiments with central banks across Asia and Europe that are testing wholesale CBDCs for a variety of use cases, including cross-border payments. The BIS Innovation Hub's Project Jura explores the direct transfer of euro and Swiss-franc wholesale CBDCs between French and Swiss commercial banks.  Retail CBDCs  Retail CBDCs, issued directly by a central bank to a country's citizens, who can use them to purchase goods and services, can theoretically cut out traditional intermediaries like commercial banks, Galhau said, addressing a more contentious type of CBDC.  Retail CBDCs are the subject of heavy debate among policymakers due to the risks these currencies could pose to financial stability. For one, in times of economic stress, retail CBDCs could give way to bank runs whereby citizens withdraw their deposits from commercial banks in large numbers and convert their holdings to CBDCs.  Galhau believes that retail CBDCs should be issued in partnership with private banks.  ""The eurosystem should entrust banks with the distribution of digital euros to final users, while setting technical, functional and commercial rules – for example, the branding, logo and fee structure,"" Galhau said.  Some functions, Galhau said, should remain under the ""sole responsibility"" of intermediaries.  ""In particular, I believe that the eurosystem should not have the role of managing digital euro holdings: The Banque de France closed its last private customer accounts over 20 years ago, and does not intend to reopen any,"" Galhau said.  The European Central Bank is exploring a retail CBDC.

42395227,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXkc6,1657630800,Dragonfly Capital Leads $7.5M Round for Quadrata’s Identity Passport,"Quadrata, a Web3 identity passport network, has raised $7.5 million in a seed funding round led by Dragonfly Capital that the company will use to expand to additional blockchains and grow the team, Quadrata co-founder and CEO Fabrice Cheng told CoinDesk.  Crypto investment firm Dragonfly had around $3 billion in assets under management as of April when it raised $650 million for its third fund. Other investors in the round included Franklin Templeton, Abra, GSR Ventures, Orange DAO, Fellows Fund, GreatPoint Ventures, August Capital and a number of angel investors.  The Quadrata Passport syncs secure identity, compliance and reputation-based data across multiple blockchains. The passport offers users a unique decentralized identity (DID) and provides decentralized applications with compliance infrastructure, including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Quadrata also partnered with credit score giant TransUnion to create a native on-chain reputation score.  “Today, people interacting with cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) don’t need to be identified,” explained Cheng. “You don’t have multiple accounts. You don’t have to create an email. There’s no need for any information vetting before you interact with anything on-chain. We’re trying to bring the digital identity of the future.”  A potential use case is DeFi lending, Quadrata co-founder Lisa Fridman told CoinDesk. DeFi loans are overcollateralized because the borrower can't leverage their credit reputation. Quadrata's identity and credit verification could open the door to undercollateralized or even unsecured loans.  The near-term Quadrata roadmap includes the launch of the passport product, expansion to more blockchains, decentralization of the network and the addition of more types of identifiers, such as accredited investor status, said Cheng.  “In the current Web3 ecosystem, identity is the holy grail problem that remains unsolved,"" said Dragonfly Capital managing partner Haseeb Qureshi in the press release. “As developers continue bringing utility to Web3, Quadrata’s already robust use cases will play an instrumental role in making participating in the technological revolution safer and easier.”  Read More: Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Bear Market  UPDATE (July 15, 18:30 UTC): Swapped in new lead image.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/12/dragonfly-capital-leads-75m-round-for-quadratas-identity-passport,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05e72f3395464bcf495f70f7d6380baaaa860b25-3830x2665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CoinDesk previously reported on the existence of the fund last month based on regulatory filings.  “Our focus is mostly on emerging blockchains and technologies where we feel that we can add value within those general ecosystems or within those protocols,” angel investor and Protagonist co-founder George Bousis told CoinDesk in an interview.  For its early-stage investments, Miami-based Protagonist is targeting checks between $1 million and $5 million across 20 to 30 portfolio companies. The firm also has an early opportunities strategy targeting potential high-growth companies, which will look to invest $5 million to $15 million for two to three companies, said Bousis.  The fund has deployed capital to an initial group of portfolio companies, including layer 1 blockchain Aptos, Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) protocol Cardinal and mobile banking platform Cogni.  The Macalinao brothers – best known for the stablecoin swapping protocol Saber – co-founded Protagonist alongside Henry Hurst (co-CEO of fintech company Pipe) and Bousis, who founded Raise and Slide, a digital gift card company.  Protagonist arose from a rebrand of the developer collective Ship Capital. In September, Dylan tweeted that Ship Capital was “a group of friends building new [decentralized finance] protocols” and not a VC that was investing in projects. Ship Capital filed for a name change to Protagonist with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 23.  “I don't really see ourselves as a VC in general,"" Bousis explained.

There has been “a dramatic bout of instability and losses in crypto markets,” Cunliffe said, with around $2 trillion wiped out of crypto markets in recent months. The meltdown has been exacerbated by the collapse of multibillion-dollar stablecoin issuer Terra and other participants including crypto lender Celsius and the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund.  Technology does not change the underlying risks in economics and finance, he said.  “Crypto technologies offer the prospect of substantive innovation and improvement in finance. But to be successful, sustainable innovation has to happen within a framework in which risks are managed. People don’t fly for long in unsafe airplanes.”  In light of recent events, international regulators are showing signs they are speeding up global crypto rules. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the global standard setter for banking regulations, is getting ready to issue guidance on the prudential treatment of crypto assets held by banks. Meanwhile, international financial watchdog the Financial Stability Board is looking to propose crypto regulations by October.  The collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) may have also quickened rules for all stablecoins, including those pegged to the value of real assets like the U.S. dollar. In June, policymakers in the European Union agreed on a landmark crypto regulatory framework called the Markets in Crypto Assets package that focuses heavily on stablecoin regulation.  The U.K. government is coordinating its efforts to produce stablecoin regulation that could come out by August. The Treasury, the government's finance arm, has already released a consultation for governing stablecoins that could influence larger financial systems. Regulators in the U.K. – including the Bank of England – hope to issue a consultation document on the regulatory policy framework of stablecoins later this year, Cunliffe said.  He added that crypto regulations should follow the principle of “same risk, same regulatory outcome” meaning regulators should try to extend existing financial rules to mitigate similar risks involving crypto.  But when that fails, regulators may have to take stronger measures.  ""If and when for certain crypto related activities this proves not to be possible, where we can find no way to mitigate and manage the risk to the extent necessary, that is to say to the extent such risk is managed in other parts of the financial system, we should not let activities proceed,"" Cunliffe said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/12/policy-makers-should-get-on-with-regulating-crypto-boes-cunliffe-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7520850641ce2e7aceb77510028c0c9728fbf2c0-3923x2943.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The message claimed to airdrop UNI tokens to liquidity providers (LP) based on the number of fake LP tokens they received. Liquidity providers supply their assets on Uniswap in return for rewards.  Interacting with the phishing message, however, gave the underlying smart contract permission to transfer assets out of and gain full control of a user’s wallet.  One person, who was providing over $8 million worth of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and USD coin (USDC) to a WBTC/USDC liquidity pool, according to blockchain data, unknowingly interacted with the phishing message.  The attacker was able to gain control of the wallet, exit the LP’s positions and transfer the tokens to other wallets. Blockchain data further shows the attacker started to move stolen funds through privacy protocol Tornado Cash in early Asian hours Tuesday.  In the hours following the attack, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao alerted users to be aware of a possible exploit on Uniswap. This was however later corrected, as the exploit was limited to a phishing message and did not affect the Uniswap protocol, as Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams confirmed in separate tweets.",NEGATIVE,BTC | UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | UNI | BNB | AIRDROP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/12/uniswap-user-loses-8m-worth-of-ether-in-phishing-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c041e975bf10d8183451d1f6de43e52ead0df23-1575x1181.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The declines came as Singapore state-owned Temasek Holdings, which manages more than $287 billion of assets, cautioned of more downturns across financial markets, citing the likelihood of a “recession in developed markets.”  Temasek said it forecasts a “mild recession” in the U.S. next year, adding that China faces “challenges” and the global economy “is in a fragile state.” “Rising inflation, surging commodity prices, and severe supply chain bottlenecks have uncovered further fault lines in the global marketplace,” it said in a statement.  The euro dropped to a 20-year low of $1.0002 against the dollar, approaching parity. The weakness arose amid concerns of an energy crisis stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine that would tip the region into a recession, while the U.S. dollar was buoyed by expectations of the Federal Reserve committing to faster rate hikes.  Equity markets also suffered. In Asia, the Hang Seng index fell 1.26% while Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.75%. The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.60%, while Germany’s DAX lost 1%. U.S. futures on the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 fell 0.68%.  Some bitcoin investors see more reasons for a decline than a rebound.  “An additional reason has strengthened our view that the upside will be capped in the near-term: This is the news about Mt. Gox releasing approximately 140,000 BTC in August,” QCP Capital traders said in a Telegram broadcast on Tuesday.  “Our main takeaway is that there is a high chance of BTC supply flooding the market soon,” they wrote. “The possible impact would be additional selling pressure on BTC and perhaps the outperformance of ETH and [altcoins] against BTC.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/12/bitcoin-drops-to-197k-as-recession-concerns-weigh-on-financial-markets-euro-nears-dollar-parity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33f5e86fe8ae494873d3106f69ee98f335fe54e7-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422778,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pb3h,1657614846,Bitcoin's Inverse Correlation With Inflation-Adjusted Bond Yield Hits Record High,"Bitcoin's (BTC) fortunes are more closely tied to the U.S. real or inflation-adjusted bond yield than ever, with the two increasingly moving in opposite directions.  At press time, the 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the yield on the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security stood just shy of the record -0.95 reached at the end of June.  The record inverse or negative correlation means bitcoin is moving in the opposite direction of the inflation-adjusted yield. A correlation coefficient is a number between +1 and -1, representing the linear interdependence of two variables or sets of data. If the correlation coefficient is -1, it means relationship between the two variables is negative 100% of the time. If the number is at +1, the two securities move in the same direction.  A positive real yield means the bond payout is exceeding the market-based measures of inflation expectations. Therefore, the higher the real yield, the lesser the incentive to chase returns from other assets like cryptocurrencies, stocks and gold.  So, it's no surprise that bitcoin, technology stocks and gold have taken a beating this year alongside an uptick in the real yield. The real yield has surged by more than 172 basis points to 1.72% this year, thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve's resolve to drain liquidity with rapid-fire interest rate hikes and balance sheet runoff to fight rampant inflation. While the leading cryptocurrency by market value has dropped nearly 57%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and gold are nursing losses of 27% and 5.2%, respectively.  The record negative correlation means the possibility of bitcoin plunging below the June low of $17,601 cannot be ruled out should the real yield continue to rise. And to the dismay of bulls cheering the bottom signals on blockchain indicators, the path of least resistance for the real yield appears to be on the higher side. That's because inflation is showing no signs of slowing down and the Fed is unlikely to apply brakes to policy tightening anytime soon.  The Fed is likely to raise borrowing costs by 75 basis points later this month, bringing the benchmark interest rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% from 0% to 0.25% at the start of 2022. Further, the Fed funds futures have priced a 50 basis point hike in September and 25 basis points hikes at the November and December meetings.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Labor Department is scheduled to release June's consumer price index figure. The data is likely to show the cost of living rose 1.1% month on month, bringing the annualized figure to a new four-decade high of 8.8%. The CPI stood at 8.6% in May. The core inflation data, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is seen rising 0.6% month on month, amounting to an annualized growth of 5.8%.  On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration expects high inflation mainly due to high food and energy components. Pierre, however, called the data ""backward-looking"" and ""out of date"" in a bid to control the damage, noting the recent decline in energy prices.  Therefore, a weaker-than-expected core CPI figure might pull down the real yield, lifting bitcoin and other risk assets.

BitMEX airdropped 1.5 million BMEX, its first native token, to users earlier this year as it looked to revive retail interest in an increasingly competitive crypto exchange market. The tokens were distributed based on a user’s activity on the exchange, as reported.  The Ethereum-based tokens are locked in a five-year vesting contract and have a maximum supply of 450 million. They will be used to reward new and existing BitMEX users and allow them to get discounts on trading fees.  In Tuesday’s post, BitMEX said it had sent “millions of tokens to hundreds and thousands of users” and that the tokens are already being staked to receive fee discounts, withdrawal refunds and other perks.  BitMEX said it is continuing to airdrop the token to its traders and new users. “More time to accrue; more BMEX for our users to earn,” the exchange said.  Some users, however, expressed their dismay regarding the decision on Twitter.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/12/bitmex-delays-bmex-listing-citing-market-conditions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ab60b07c47dc0d40da2595cddc5d8f380c5866e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  PicPay, a Brazil-based digital payments app, plans to launch a crypto exchange and a Brazilian real-tied stablecoin in 2022, the company announced Monday.  The exchange will provide access to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Paxos’ USDP stablecoin, the company said in a statement, adding that the development of its stablecoin will allow users to pay, transfer and store that cryptocurrency as early as 2022.  “PicPay will enter the crypto market to lead its popularization not only as an investment, but also as a way to decentralize payments and other financial services,” Anderson Chamon, vice president of technology and products at PicPay, said in a statement.  The company was founded in 2012 as a digital wallet, but later mutated into a payments app offering a financial marketplace, among other services. The platform has more than 65 million users, of which 30 million are active.  PicPay has also created a dedicated crypto business unit, Chamon said, adding that it plans to hire new crypto and Web3 talent to join that team.  According to PicPay, the retail crypto market “is already very large in Brazil,” evidenced by the fact that investors double the number of stock investors, the company said based on a survey conducted by local media outlet G1.  The company added that despite the drop in the crypto market, its technological proposition is still the same. “We believe that cryptocurrencies will grow again as new ways of using them appear and become commonplace,” it said.  The entrance of PicPay into the crypto market accompanies that of other major fintech players in Brazil.  In May, Nubank, the largest Brazilian digital bank by market value, added the option for customers to buy and sell bitcoin and ether on its platform, while in December, Mercado Libre, Latin America’s largest e-commerce company by market value, allowed users in Brazil to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies  This article was translated by Andrés Engler and edited by CoinDesk.

For almost a month, bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a range between $17,000 and $23,000, and crypto analysts are wondering if the worst of this year's big sell-off might be over.  The price fell 4.4% on Monday to dip below $20,000, but drops below that crucial psychological price threshold aren't generating the same level of panic as in early June, when bitcoin seemed to be in free fall.  ""I've heard forecasts as low as $8,000 per bitcoin, but we may have seen the bottom already,"" wrote Mati Greenspan, founder of the crypto and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics. ""The outlook only gets better when we realize that the absolute worst-case scenario is probably not extremely likely.""  ""The cleansing is happening,"" Kapil Rathi, CEO of the crypto trading platform CrossTower, told CoinDesk TV on Monday. ""When we come on the other side it should be healthy and a stronger crypto market.""  ""Despite all the pessimism and negative headlines for bitcoin, the fact that it is putting up a fight at the $20,000 level is a promising sign,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.  In traditional markets, the big story on Monday in foreign exchange was the euro's slide toward $1 – the so-called ""parity"" point.

Three Arrows Creditors Get Emergency Hearing as Founders Fail to 'Cooperate' - by Sam Reynolds  Where in the world are Su Zhu and Kyle Davies? Lawyers involved in the liquidation proceedings of Three Arrows Capital’s British Virgin Islands fund would certainly like to know because the hedge fund founders have not been cooperating in the proceedings so far and their current location is unknown.  In documents filed late Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, lawyers acting on behalf of the creditors said the founders of the fund “have not yet begun to cooperate with the [proceeding] in any meaningful manner.”  The lawyers said that persons identifying themselves as “Su Zhu” and “Kyle” were present on an initial Zoom call, but their video and audio was turned off and they would not respond to questions posed directly to them, with only their legal representatives answering questions.  Lawyers for the creditors that visited Three Arrows’s Singapore office found it abandoned, according to court documents.  Read the full story here.
