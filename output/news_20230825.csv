However, now that the euphoria from the ruling has worn off and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has begun to fight back, the coin‚Äôs price is correcting back downward, prompting massive sell-offs of the token. Whale Moves 29.3 Million XRP To Exchange On-chain whale tracker has flagged an XRP transaction that could spell bearish pressure for the price of the cryptocurrency. According to the post made on X (formerly Twitter), a single whale moved a total of 29.3 million tokens to a centralized exchange. The total stash of tokens which were worth a little over $15.13 million at the time were transferred to the Bitstamp exchange. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Ready For Next Leg-Up After Buying 56,000 ETH üö® 29,300,000 #XRP (15,130,884 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Bitstamphttps://t.co/DhcHkKNdzc ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 24, 2023 While large transactions like these are not new on the network, the destination is what has raised concerns among investors. Usually, when investors move tokens to centralized exchanges such as Bitstamp, it is to sell their tokens. This is because centralized exchanges offer lower fees and deeper liquidity, which also help to mitigate the impact of the selling. It is possible the whale has already begun selling the coins as the XRP price saw a quick dip around the time the transaction was made. But with such a large stash, further selling could see the price fall further with such sell pressure leading to as much as a 20% decline. Since the XRP price is already struggling, this bearish scenario becomes more likely, especially with the broader crypto market seeing widespread negative momentum and Bitcoin struggling to recover. Another dip from here would easily see the XRP price fall to the $0.48 territory. Token price struggles amid sell-off | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Is All Hope Lost For XRP Price? Although the large $15 million move by the whale to Bitstamp is concerning, the bulls have not taken it lying down. A couple of hours after the transaction was first seen on the blockchain, a massive buy of $1.5 million worth of XRP was reported on the Bybit exchange. üöÄüî• JUST IN: A whopping 1.5 million $ worth of #XRP was scooped up in an instant 10 minutes ago!

The large buys led to two quick spikes in the XRP price, reaching $0.5311 briefly before going back downward. This signifies that there is a good amount of buy pressure on the digital asset that could help offset the whale selling. Interestingly, the token is still holding above the 200-day moving average which suggests bullish sentiment, at least in the mid-term. So while a 20% can be expected due to the selling, the decline will likely not last before the digital asset picks back up.

As the market approaches the monthly close and witnesses liquidity re-entering, there is a growing possibility that XRP will continue its upward trend. Potential Price Explosion For XRP Following Extended Accumulation Phase In cryptocurrency, few phenomena captivate investors and traders more than anticipating a price explosion fueled by a prolonged accumulation phase. Such is the case for XRP, which shows a setup that mirrors previous patterns that led to significant price surges. Related Reading: Economic Reset Alert: Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Crash Below $10,000 Crypto analyst and trader, known by the pseudonym ‚ÄúCrypto Bull,‚Äù has caught the attention of market participants with its bold prediction that XRP could be on the brink of a major upward rally. According to Crypto Bull, historical data reveals a recurring pattern for XRP, where explosive price movements have consistently followed extended periods of upward accumulation. Crypto Bull‚Äôs analysis suggests that XRP is currently in its longest accumulation phase in history, further strengthening the potential for a significant price surge. Examining the weekly chart provided by Crypto Bull, it becomes evident that XRP has previously undergone notable price explosions in 2020 and 2021, making this its third accumulation phase. XRP‚Äôs Bullish Momentum During the first uptrend in 2020, XRP surged by an impressive 220%, starting below the $0.250 level and reaching a high of $0.774 in November. Following a typical price correction, XRP embarked on another upward trend merely months later, in February 2021, aiming to surpass its previous all-time high. In April 2021, XRP experienced a remarkable bull run, aligning with the overall market trend, and skyrocketed from $0.540 to its current all-time high of $1.946. Subsequently, the token attempted to retest this pinnacle but fell short of reclaiming it. These historical patterns in XRP‚Äôs price action following significant surges are noteworthy; however, whether the cryptocurrency will follow its established trajectory or surpass its all-time high remains uncertain. What is certain is that the ongoing accumulation phase, coupled with potential positive developments in the US courts and growing investor excitement, positions XRP for a possible major breakout.

As the cryptocurrency ecosystem eagerly awaits further developments, XRP‚Äôs future trajectory holds considerable intrigue. Whether it will reiterate its historical patterns or embark on an unprecedented journey remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the current accumulation phase and the optimistic sentiment surrounding XRP set the stage for potential growth and renewed excitement among investors. At the time of writing, XRP is traded at $0.5231, reflecting a 1.3% increase over the past 24 hours.

42392649,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg9huH,1692996521,Visa and Mastercard Distancing Themselves From Binance Unlikely to Hurt the Crypto Exchange: Experts,"Payment giants Visa and Mastercard paring back their ties with Binance isn‚Äôt surprising as the company grapples with recent legal challenges, but it is unlikely to hurt the crypto exchange‚Äôs market share.  Binance, the biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, is facing multiple charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including allegations that the exchange has been operating an unregistered business and misled investors about the company‚Äôs risks. This is in addition to charges brought against the exchange by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in May for what it calls a ‚Äúwillful evasion"" of U.S. law.  The U.S. Department of Justice is also looking into the exchange and is reportedly considering charging Binance for fraud.  Given all the legal challenges Binance is facing, the move by mainstream companies like Visa and Mastercard is not surprising, said Dave Weisberger, CEO and co-founder of CoinRoutes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unsurprising that payment processors want to distance themselves from that,‚Äù he said.  Visa reportedly stopped issuing new co-branded cards with Binance in Europe. A Mastercard spokesperson confirmed the end of its partnerships to CoinDesk with Binance, without providing the details behind the decision. ‚ÄúWe had four pilot programs in the market with them ‚Äì Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bahrain. This decision applies to each of these Binance programs. There is no impact on any other crypto card program,‚Äù the spokesperson said. Visa didn't immediately respond to requests for comments.  Binance said on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) that the Binance Card will no longer be available to users in Latin America and the Middle East.  However, the move is unlikely to hurt the crypto exchange‚Äôs market share, given its extensive global footprint. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to assess the impact of this on Binance, which is still a leading exchange from a liquidity point of view,‚Äù Weisberger said. ‚ÄúUntil that changes, people will continue to trade there,‚Äù he added.  The end of the partnership may also not be a big deal for the industry as a whole, said Leo Mizuhara, CEO of Hashnote, a CFTC-regulated institutional digital asset management platform. ‚ÄúThis development is probably not that big of a deal in terms of the impact on the industry, as people and organizations pulling away from Binance was already pretty much expected given its issues with the CFTC and DOJ,‚Äù Mizuhara said.  He also said that Mastercard‚Äôs decision to distance itself from Binance seems reasonable given the credit card giant‚Äôs recent focus on the blockchain industry. ‚ÄúMastercard has shown an increasing appetite to engage with the blockchain industry, and this move away from Binance is more about institutions being cautious about potential bad actors,‚Äù Mizuhara added.  Both Visa and Mastercard have been active in the blockchain industry recently, even during the prolonged bear market that saw several major bankruptcies. Most recently, both Visa and Mastercard said they intend to continue with their industry partners to bring payment programs into the markets.

42409808,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPfVl,1692994719,When Did Privacy Become a Bad Word?,"The U.S. Department of Justice‚Äôs (DOJ) indictment against the Tornado Cash developers, filed Wednesday, is commensurate with the government‚Äôs seeming disdain for privacy.  Across the government, there seems to be an entrenched assumption that an individual‚Äôs desire to keep the details of their life private means they‚Äôre engaging in wrongdoing. This overly simplistic assumption is not supported by the law or the reality of exactly why privacy is so important to countless law-abiding citizens in their everyday lives.  Nor does it adequately balance the 21st century citizen‚Äôs right to privacy with the need to ensure the government can effectively enforce the law.  Miller Whitehouse-Levine is the CEO of the DeFi Education Fund and Amanda Tuminelli is the chief legal officer of the DeFi Education Fund.     In the last century the world has changed in ways that make almost every one of our daily activities far less private than ever before. In our digital lives, some third party is often involved in almost every conversation we have, every place we go and what we spend our money on ‚Äî tracking and often retaining that information in insecure databases.  See also: Tornado Cash Devs Are Caught in a U.S. Dragnet | Opinion  When people traded gold and later, cash, there was no way for the government to trace the transactions, whether illicit or legitimate, without a warrant or subpoena. When people went about their daily routines, they did not create a permanent digital record.  Question any time there is wholesale disapproval of new technology simply because it affirms an individual‚Äôs well-established right to privacy.  The government, if it suspected a person of committing a crime, was forced to do some good old fashioned police work: following people around and marking bills to follow the money.  More recently, the government has gained much more insight and powers of preemptive surveillance into our financial lives. For example, with the enactment of the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, financial institutions have to engage in record-keeping and reporting in order to assist the government in its efforts to prevent money laundering, and as a result, most of the information we provide to our banks can easily be viewed by the government.  Moreover John Doe subpoenas to financial institutions allow the government to obtain huge swaths of information (including purchase and spending history) without a court-ordered search warrant ‚Äî without needing to reveal what crimes are being investigated or whether the personal information relates to a target, subject or witness.  In other words, the government is provided with the largely unfettered ability to access personal information. And, strikingly, banks and financial institutions are forbidden from telling their clients if their information has been handed over.  ""What do you have to hide if you're not doing anything wrong‚Äù is too often used as a rhetorical cudgel against basic privacy rights. In fact there are perfectly valid reasons a person may want to keep their financial lives and communications private.  A person may want to give to a political cause or religious entity without fear that they will be persecuted for their views. They may want to purchase items without anyone knowing to protect secrets or out of embarrassment or any other reason. They may want to speak freely to their friends without fear their words may be later taken out of context by a government official.  In a country as free as the U.S., it is easy to forget that our beliefs, associations and lifestyles may come in conflict with an ever-changing political landscape. This is why our constitution proscribes the ability of the government to access otherwise private information unless there is a legitimate government interest or compelling need to intrude on Fourth Amendment rights.  The privacy debate is decades old. There will always be an inherent tension in balancing the individual‚Äôs right to privacy with the government‚Äôs legitimate need to cabin privacy rights in certain circumstances to prevent crime or serve an important government interest. What seems to have been lost along the way is a mutual respect and benefit of the doubt between the government and citizens.  See also: Privacy Mixer Tornado Cash Is an Entity, Judge Says  The rule of law and exercise of legitimate government authority demands we continue to grapple with the appropriate balance between liberty and security. New technologies like encrypted electronic communications or apps that enable anonymous payments complicate the matter.  New technologies call for new rules, which in turn requires engagement with as well as curiosity and education about the technology‚Äôs pitfalls and benefits.

Bloomberg reported, citing data from the financial services firm, that the current downtrend phase in the crypto market might just be nearing its conclusion. Notably, the deceleration in the market momentum, primarily attributed to a series of positive legal and regulatory developments that eventually lost steam, is in its last stretch, according to the banking institution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond Market Dynamics And Future Predictions JPMorgan‚Äôs analyst, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, analyzed the situation and highlighted the diminishing open interest in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures contracts. In the financial realm, when open interest, which reflects the cumulative unsettled and active futures contracts on exchanges, plunges, it often signals a weakening price trend.¬†Consequently, the report suggests, ‚ÄúWe see limited downside for crypto markets over the near term.‚Äù The crypto domain witnessed an uplift in recent months. This surge can be attributed to multiple applications, led predominantly by BlackRock Inc., aiming to roll out the first US spot BTC exchange-traded funds. A favorable courtroom verdict for Ripple Labs in its legal confrontation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also contributed to the further uplift in the market sentiment. However,¬†the initial exuberance has been waning, according to the report. Market participants are now in anticipation mode, awaiting resolve on spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) impending appeal against the Ripple decision, which is yet to be disclosed, amplifies a ‚Äúnew round of legal uncertainty,‚Äù heightening the market‚Äôs responsiveness to subsequent legal developments, according to the report. Bitcoin (BTC) Latest Price Action So far, Bitcoin is still struggling to break above a notable resistance. The asset has ranged between the $25,000 and $26,000 zone in the past 7 days and currently trades for $25,890, at the time of writing. Bitcoin has seen a decline of more than 10% in the past two weeks, and it is currently in red, down by nearly 1% over the past 24 hours. Alongside its price, Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume has also plunged in the past week, indicating less trading activity. The asset‚Äôs daily trading volume has fallen from a high of over $30 billion recorded last Friday to $12.1 billion in the previous 24 hours.

A sell-off ahead of the halving is in line with previous cycles, and altcoins may outperform. Bitcoin's technical outlook and historical evidence suggest a potential sell-off/distribution phase before the halving. Altcoins may have already bottomed or be close to it. Thesis Summary After trading in a range for the last few months, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has finally broken down. From a technical perspective, this erases my more immediate bullish case, and I believe we could now re-test the $20K area. A sell-off here ahead of the halving would be very much in line with how Bitcoin has behaved in previous halving cycles. If, indeed, history is repeating itself, we might actually see the altcoins outperform now, so this might be a good time to start dipping our feet in. The Bitcoin Chart With the latest sell-off, which took us below $20K, I now expect Bitcoin to retest lower levels: BTC 1D chart (Author's work) From an EWT perspective, we can make the case that BTC has formed a 5-wave impulse to the upside. This is not the best structure, in my opinion, with such a short wave 5, but it is, for the moment, the most bullish case I can make. While I originally thought that BTC could be setting up for a breakout higher, the latest sell-off has changed this dramatically. Firstly, if we zoom into the more recent action, we can see that we have retraced over 78.6% of the last rally (wave 5). BTC 4h chart (Author's work) Though a set-up for higher isn‚Äôt technically invalidated until we break below the low set in June, odds have now strongly increased that we are heading down first. Looking back at the daily chart, we can also appreciate that BTC has broken below the 50 and 200-day MAs and also below the trendline support. Momentum has clearly shifted, and bears are in control. So, where can we expect to find support? The 61.8% retracement of the whole rally from the October lows takes us all the way down to $20,400. We can also see, as marked by the VRVP, that this is a strong area of volume, and this is also close to where the Realized Price is, an on-chain metric that reflects the market‚Äôs average Bitcoin cost. Is this just like last time? As I have pointed out numerous times before, a sell-off/distribution phase ahead of the halving is exactly what you would expect, given historical evidence: BTC price in 2020 (Author's work) Before the last halving in 2020, Bitcoin rallied all the way up to $14,000, actually getting quite close to its previous all-time highs. From there, it sold off over 70%. We can see that it actually even reached the 88.7% retracement level. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that BTC did dip just below its realized price at its lowest point, though it reversed quite quickly. They say history rhymes, and this could certainly be the case with Bitcoin. Not only does the technical outlook support this but so does the macro environment. Treasury yields are continuing to rise above what a lot of people expected, and the dollar is, for the time being, showing strong signs of strength as other currencies like the Yen and Yuan struggle. With that said, China is beginning to ease its monetary policy, and the Fed should be near the end of its hiking cycle. The short-term outlook is not great, but in the medium term, the environment should be more supportive. Another Lesson From History One of the highlights of this year in crypto has been the increase in the Bitcoin dominance, meaning that Bitcoin has been outperforming the other cryptocurrencies. BTC dominance (TradingView) As we can see above, BTC dominance reached close to 52% as the BTC price broke above $30K. However, we have seen a strong reversal following the latest sell-off. Altcoins are once again outperforming BTC, and this is also what happened last time. BTC dominance 2019 (TradingView) In this chart, we can see BTC dominance and the BTC price in orange back in 2019-20. The black lines outline the period when BTC slid from its $14K high down to $3K ahead of the halving. Notice how BTC dominance consistently fell during this period and, in fact, continued falling until September. If this is the case again, and based on my analysis of many of the altcoin charts, then a lot of the altcoins could have already bottomed or be very close to putting in a bottom. Takeaway In conclusion, I think that BTC could be set to re-test the $20K level. This would be a great spot to buy and should set us up for the halving rally. In the meantime, crypto investors would be well advised to look at opportunities in altcoins, which could really begin to outperform in the coming months.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4631197-bitcoin-will-history-repeat?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17202991.jpeg

Even if you expect the price of Bitcoin to rise, I believe you'd be better off just owning Bitcoin directly. CleanSpark's direct mining costs are in the middle of the pack, meaning they don't have a competitive advantage. Executive Summary This past July I wrote an article on Seeking Alpha explaining my strong-sell thesis on Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). I received some pushback from bullish investors who said a traditional valuation framework isn‚Äôt appropriate for Bitcoin mining companies because you also have to consider the price appreciation of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) itself. This is a fair point. I personally have no view on where the price of Bitcoin will go. But it‚Äôs safe to assume that substantially all shareholders of Bitcoin mining companies are also bullish on the underlying commodity. Any analysis that doesn‚Äôt consider this is incomplete. So in this article I‚Äôll look at another Bitcoin miner, CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) using a different framework. The framework is; if you are bullish on the price of Bitcoin, would you be better off buying shares in CleanSpark or just buying Bitcoin itself? I believe that in an almost any scenario, investors would be better off just buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin Miner Valuation Framework There are three sources of value for a Bitcoin mining company. First is the cash and Bitcoins they hold on their balance sheet today. Second is their current deployed hash rate. And finally, is their ability to grow their hash rate. We‚Äôll start with the third component first. Growing your hash rate costs money. In a perfectly competitive market, the present value of future growth will exactly equal the upfront cost of investment. To earn a return on assets above your cost of capital, you need to have some form of competitive advantage. Even if the price of Bitcoin increases significantly in the future, this will cause the entire industry to increase its hash rate, which will increase the difficulty rate and compete away the benefit. Bitcoin mining is a commodity industry. The only way to have an advantage is to have lower electricity costs than your competitors. We can measure this by looking at the direct cost per Bitcoin mined, which mostly consists of electricity. Of the 5 largest Bitcoin miners listed on major US exchanges, CleanSpark‚Äôs direct costs per Bitcoin mined is in the middle of the pack. Direct cost per Bitcoin mined comparison (Company filings, compiled by author) Thus, I don‚Äôt think we should give CleanSpark credit for future growth opportunities. We‚Äôll just look at what they currently have on their balance sheet. As of August 9th 2023 CleanSpark has ~$90 million of cash, ~1,200 Bitcoins, and ~9 EH/s of deployed hash rate . They have a fully funded plan to bring their deployed hash rate up to 16 EH/s. Fully funded means they do not anticipate needing to tap the debt or equity markets again. But they will have to draw down on their existing cash reserves and probably sell some of their Bitcoins to fund the expansion. But even if they had 16 EH/s of deployed hash rate today at no additional cost, I still think CleanSpark would be overvalued. How Much is 16 EH/s Worth Today? As new hash rate is deployed across the industry, the difficulty rate increases and thus, the Bitcoins mined per EH/s decreases. CleanSpark discloses how many Bitcoins they mine each month, as well as their deployed hash rate. In January 2022 they mined 145 Bitcoins per deployed EH/s. By July 2023 this had declined to 64 Bitcoins per EH/s. This is a 4% compound monthly rate of decline. For the rest of this article, I will assume mining efficiency continues to decline at a rate of 4% per month. CleanSpark mining efficiency (CleanSpark Inc., compiled by author) We must also consider the Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to happen towards the end of April 2024 . This will cut the Bitcoins mined per EH/s in half overnight. In Q2 2023 CleanSpark spent about $3.1 million per EH/s on direct operating costs. As the difficulty rate increases, eventually the cost of electricity will exceed the mining revenue and CleanSpark will need to replace its miners with newer, more efficient models. To calculate the value of 16 EH/s of deployed hash rate, we need to calculate the cumulative gross profit up until it is no longer profitable to operate. This will depend on the price of Bitcoin. I will analyze three different scenarios. Bitcoin at $26,000 which is the current price as I write this article, Bitcoin at $50,000, and Bitcoin at $100,000. If the Bitcoin price is $26,000, you can profitably operate until the halving event, which will yield ~$56 million of cumulative gross profit. Bitcoin $26k scenario (Author's assumptions & calculations) If the Bitcoin price is $50,000, you can profitably operate until May 2024, which will yield ~$260 million of cumulative gross profit. Bitcoin $50k scenario (Author's assumptions & calculations) If the Bitcoin price is $100,000, you can profitably operate until September of 2025, which will yield ~$814 million of cumulative gross profit. Bitcoin $100k scenario (Author's assumptions & calculations) We also have to consider that CleanSpark has ~$6 million per month of corporate overhead. I multiply this by how many months they operate in each of the scenarios. They had ~1,200 Bitcoins on their balance sheet as of August 9th 2023. The value of those Bitcoins is obviously different in each of the three scenarios. They have $90 million of cash. They have real estate assets worth ~$98 million. I don‚Äôt give them credit for the value of the Bitcoin miners because those will need to be replaced at the end of the period. They have ~$18 million of debt. Adding all of these together, I calculate the net value for each of the three scenarios. They currently have a fully diluted market cap of ~$694 million after you consider the ~21 million of new shares they issued between the end of the second quarter and August 8th. This is shown in the subsequent events section of their 10Q. In the Bitcoin $26k scenario, the net value is 72% less than their current market cap. In the $50k scenario, it's 39% lower. In the $100k scenario, the net value is 36% higher than the current market cap. But if you believe Bitcoin will hit $100k, you‚Äôd be better off just buying Bitcoin directly and bag a 285% gain. Returns in each scenario (Author's assumptions & calculations) Verdict Unless CleanSpark can find some way to dramatically reduce its electricity costs, I don‚Äôt see any scenario in which you would be better off owning CleanSpark than just owning Bitcoin directly.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4631191-cleanspark-better-off-just-owning-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17197696.jpeg

16544397,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548896,1692986339,"Economic Reset Alert: Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Crash Below $10,000","Bitcoin (BTC), the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a period of stability around the $26,000 mark following the recent speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell reiterated the central bank‚Äôs commitment to maintaining a 2% inflation target in his speech. As economists discuss the implications of this goal, market observers, including Bloomberg‚Äôs Senior Macro Strategist Mike McGlone, have weighed in on the potential impact of an impending recession on BTC‚Äôs price. Bitcoin Faces Bearish Outlook? During his speech, Chair Powell stressed the importance of implementing a ‚Äúsufficiently restrictive‚Äù policy to address inflation-related concerns. While economists continue to debate the merits of this approach, Powell‚Äôs emphasis on controlling inflation has sparked speculation within the financial landscape. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Buys 708 Billion SHIB, Sparks Speculation Of Price Recovery Mike McGlone, a respected senior macro strategist at Bloomberg, remains bullish on Bitcoin, often called ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù However, McGlone predicts a potential decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, stating that a ‚Äúnormal reversion‚Äù during an economic recession could see Bitcoin trading at around $10,000, or even as low as $7,500. McGlone acknowledges Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility but highlights its historical performance as an asset class, even in the face of a significant drop. Furthermore, McGlone points out that Bitcoin‚Äôs 100-week moving average (MA) is currently trending downward, indicating a negative market trend. The recent decline from its 2022 and 2023 bottom further supports this observation. Additionally, Powell‚Äôs mention of ongoing Federal Reserve interest rate hikes adds to the concerns surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs macro outlook. Nevertheless, comparing Bitcoin to the stock market in 1921 and 1929, he views the cryptocurrency as a revolutionary technology with the potential for long-term growth. In addition to concerns surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term growth, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been trending upward, thereby losing its previous correlation with BTC, which raises concerns for the leading cryptocurrency in the market. As reported by NewsBTC, the DXY is approaching significant resistance levels in the near term. However, it is worth noting that favorable conditions, increased trading volume, and renewed liquidity entering the emerging cryptocurrency industry could potentially provide an opportunity for BTC to recover and reach higher price levels. Currently, the DXY is trading at 104.169 points and is approaching two crucial resistance lines. The first resistance lies at the 104.716 mark, and the second is at the 106 level. These levels have not been surpassed since May and March, respectively. Related Reading: PEPE Token Tumbles 20% Amid Suspicious Activity ‚Äì Details Nevertheless, if the DXY surpasses these resistance levels, it could propel the index to even higher levels, possibly reaching 112 points. Such a scenario could pressure BTC and disrupt its ongoing bullish trend, especially if favorable conditions and a positive correlation between the two assets are absent. Bitcoin is being traded at $25,900, showing a minor decrease of 0.7% within the last 24 hours. However, Bitcoin bulls must reclaim the $26,000 threshold to prevent potential downward movement and further declines as the market approaches the conclusion of a new monthly closing period.

42409811,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPfsu,1692985608,Jackson Hole: Where Fed Policy Is Decided on the Fly,"With the Federal Reserve now committed to making monetary policy decisions on the fly, this year‚Äôs in Jackson‚Äôs Hole may matter more than ever. All eyes are on this resort in the Grand Teton mountains, where the polyester vests are multiple, double entendres about ‚Äúbears‚Äù are funny, and there are a surprising amount of Coin Boys dressing up like cowboys.  How exactly did a bucolic hotel situated 34 miles off from Jackson, Wyoming become the site of the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most exclusive economic get-together?‚Äù New York Times fed whisperer Jeanna Smialek writes, it‚Äôs simply where news is made.And you get on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City‚Äôs uber selective guest list, you know you‚Äôve made it monetarily-speaking.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It‚Äôs where, every year since he‚Äôs stepped up as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell has directed the flows of the U.S. economy. The thing is, he doesn‚Äôt even need to get it right. Last year he predicted glum and gloom and the U.S. got job growth and slowed inflation. This year, he said almost exactly what was predicted.  The economy has been growing faster than expected. More rate hikes may be needed. The Fed is determined to get inflation down to its longstanding target of 2%.  All that pageantry, all that caviar flown into the woods of Wyoming, for this? Well things aren‚Äôt all that simple. The Fed‚Äôs policy and outlook is essentially unchanged, but at a time when economic uncertainty has never been so heightened.  Unlike just a few months ago when it was clear that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise interest rates to slow economic expansion, whether people liked it or not, the central bank is now watching and waiting and adjusting based upon ebbs and flows that are essentially impossible to predict.  This is one of the most interesting times to be alive for anyone with an interest in economics, because it‚Äôs a moment where the world‚Äôs most important banker has never been in such a deferential position to fate. His decisions still matter. Raising rates increases the cost of living across the country and world: it makes mortgages costlier and cars more expensive. Powell's team determines whether in aggregate the American Male will buy that new rec vehicle, or hold off for another year.  One thing seems certain, a rate cut ‚Äì which would make money cheaper, and more likely to flow into assets at the far end of the risk curve ‚Äì is not happening anytime soon. How do we know? Well, Powell didn‚Äôt even mention it and according to the Fed Whisperers that means all those who expected a cut by the end of the year will have to wait.  This is not a rational system, despite all the data, though I‚Äôm beginning to suspect it was never designed to be. How is inflation measured? Well the Fed pays people to walk around grocery stores and write down the prices. Should gas, that thing that ‚Äì excuse the pun ‚Äì drives the economy by getting people to work, figure in at all? Maybe if the cost of gas were less volatile.  Have you ever looked into why 2% is the standard for inflation? Because it feels right. It‚Äôs ‚Äúlow enough for consumer comfort but relaxed enough for the economy to flourish,‚Äù as the NYTs notes, adding that it‚Äôs settled policy ‚Äúaccording to Fed doctrine settled years ago.‚Äù It‚Äôs like asking why people want to go to Jackson, Wyoming ‚Äî because that‚Äôs where the people go.  See also: What the New York Times Gets Wrong About Bitcoin Mining  I don‚Äôt know if any of this bodes well for Bitcoin, even if it looks comparatively rational. Complain about BTC‚Äôs price action all you want, but at least everyone knows next month how many bitcoins will be in circulation. But why did Satoshi settle on this emissions schedule, and are we sure they made the right choice?  What took me a longer time to figure out than I‚Äôd like to admit is that the choice between crypto and fiat is not total. Just because Michael Saylor has and seems likely to continue evacuating all his wealth into bitcoin doesn't mean that‚Äôs the only path. Saylor may wake up one day and realize he was wrong to call the U.S. dollar a ‚Äúshrinking ice cube,‚Äù and realize that the Fed did manage to get inflation under control (it‚Äôs currently been slowed to 3.2%, down from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022).  If there‚Äôs any lesson from Powell in Jackson Hole over the years is that there is no ideal economy, just the one you have. Powell has never looked less like Bitcoin, because it‚Äôs never been so unclear what his policy will look like this time next year. But there‚Äôs a certain stability in that, as much and as absurd as the assurances of Bitcoin having it all worked out in advance.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/25/jackson-hole-where-fed-policy-is-decided-on-the-fly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1be683eeea29e23f68257377892c01c853ebac4-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC has spent most of the week trading at around $26,000, below the 200-day moving average for the first time since January.  ""Historically, BTC trading below its 200-day average has been correlated with a market in a bear state,"" Ghebali said. ""The market may still be digesting the sell-off last week.""  He added that market participants are awaiting for a catalyst that could pull crypto prices up such as a potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. However, the high optimism about the recent flurry of applications including from BlackRock might be an ""overreaction,"" Ghebali noted.  In lack of an immediate catalyst, the market may take a breather and continue chopping at current levels following its breakdown from the uptrend during the first half of the year, Rachel Lin, CEO of derivatives decentralized exchange SynFutures, explained in a emailed note.  ""It's possible that BTC and the wider crypto market have just entered a consolidation phase and could potentially renew their uptrend in the near future,"" Lin said. ""Looking at the current BTC chart, we can see it has formed a ranging pattern with 25,000 as its lower limit and 31,500 as its upper limit.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Tracker Unveils SHIB Association, What Is It About? The transaction was picked up by Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking system that reports when significant amounts of cryptocurrencies that could influence the market are moved or traded.

The funds were transferred in two separate transactions to the unknown wallet with the first transaction carrying 708 billion SHIB, while the second saw 1.2 million SHIB moved to the wallet address. This is not the first time that whale activities within the SHIB ecosystem have caught the attention of market participants, injecting a renewed sense of confidence within the community as investors prepare for a potential price recovery. This is because of the likelihood that the recent massive SHIB purchases are attributed to the new developments brewing in the SHIB ecosystem. The first is Shiba Inu‚Äôs layer 2 scaling solution, Shibarium, expected to launch publicly after undergoing several successful tests and configurations to improve its system‚Äôs performance.

16540519,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitget-exchange-driving-trust-in-todays-evolving-web3-ecosystem,1692979200,Bitget Exchange: Driving Trust in Today‚Äôs Evolving Web3 Ecosystem,"Building Trust in Web3: How Bitget is Pushing the Envelope Bitget Redefines Web3 Trust Through Customer-First Initiatives The Web3 ecosystem is growing rapidly, and though its rise has seen numerous intriguing innovations and services, it is no stranger to mishaps and missteps. From protocol hacks to exchange liquidity drying up, the crypto industry is now characterized as a wild west that demands proper policing. This sentiment is not unjustified. Regulators around the world are now beginning to demand accountability from firms serving the digital currency ecosystem. This scrutiny usually centers on crypto startup licensing or know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) implementation. Further complicating these matters is that each country has unique regulations for these demands. Nonetheless, a certain level of reliability is in demand for the crypto industry, and countries are following suit. How Bitget is Fitting into These Complex Regulatory Environments Bitget was founded as a futuristic trading platform with a commitment to align with regulations regardless of the country. While this commitment can be challenging, Bitget is built with a strong value system that cannot operate without complying with local regulators. The European Union is currently touting their Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which has been seen as a comprehensive move toward protecting consumers while promoting crypto industry innovations. The MiCA framework was officially passed by the European Parliament in April with implementation arriving in 2024. In line with the EU helping tame the crypto industry, Bitget has been proactive in accepting and implementing regulatory demands. From the differences in taxation to the implementation of the 5th and 6th anti-money laundering directives, Bitget‚Äôs system is designed to help users and clients stay on the right side of regulators. The Core Bitget Products that Fosters Regulatory Compliance One of Bitget‚Äôs top features is their impressive 244% reserve ratio. Since liquidity is one of the most important issues for regulators, Bitget has emphasized stability when building confidence for its varied markets and customers. The platform holds 2.5 times the total amount of customer funds as its reserve asset. This solid block of liquidity means Bitget can meet redemption at any time, regardless of the broader market condition. Some earlier bankrupt crypto platforms had a history of commingling customer funds, which is one of the reasons for their swift demise. The custody of user assets on Bitget is separate from other fund classifications and this can be verified at any time through their detailed and accessible proof-of-reserve. This transparency is one of Bitget‚Äôs biggest initiatives to build trust. The Bitget Protection Fund Considering the complexity of the ever-evolving crypto market, Bitget also has introduced the Bitget Protection Fund. This fund is a deep liquidity pool that serves as insurance that users can turn to in the case of mishaps. Though Bitget is built for safety and the platform‚Äôs firewall is battle-tested, the Protection Fund is its way of going the extra mile in safeguarding its users‚Äô hard-earned capital. The fund is currently valued at $350 million. The platform regularly monitors the liquidity pool and the underlying industry cybersecurity landscape to ensure that the fund remains adequate for user protection. At the moment, the fund is hosted by three, highly-liquid, non-Bitget affiliated digital currencies. These cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC) which holds a total of 6,500 units, USDT which holds $120 million worth, and USDC which holds approximately $40 million worth. The wallets holding the Protection Fund can be viewed on-chain to confirm their value. According to the exchange, users who have their accounts compromised or assets stolen due to uncontrollable events may make a claim. Bitget is committed to preserving this fund for the next three years, a move that highlights their focus on driving sustainability. A popular Web3 saying goes ‚ÄúTrust But Verify.‚Äù Everyone is encouraged to visit the Bitget website to read more and verify the exchange‚Äôs proof-of-reserves and Protection Fund for themselves. After all, DYOR. Conclusion A lot has happened in the crypto industry over the past few years that calls for caution. With growing demands from regulators, it is important for users to pitch a tent with a trading platform that adheres strictly to tenets of transparency and prioritizes user safety. Bitget fits this profile better than most, and has the mandate to continuously enhance its systems to serve everyone accordingly. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42409805,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPfpb,1692977024,Sweeping U.S. Tax Proposal Met With Boos From Crypto World,"An immediate burst of criticism from the crypto industry shows the U.S. Treasury Department‚Äôs new proposal on how to handle digital assets taxes will face a long road as it enters a months-long period of public comments and hearings.  X, the site formerly known as Twitter, quickly filled with complaints about the proposal‚Äôs scope ‚Äì particularly how the tax-reporting demands may capture decentralized crypto operations that the industry would argue are impossible to bring into compliance.  Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the CEO of a decentralized finance (DeFi) lobbying group, said on the social media platform that the proposal as written is ‚Äúoverbroad,‚Äù with provisions allowing it to capture all sorts of entities. He pointed to self-hosted, or unhosted, wallets as one example.  ‚ÄúWhile acknowledging [that self-hosted wallet users ‚Äòeffectuate‚Äô their own transfers], the proposal still somehow attempts to find third-parties [sic] ‚Äòresponsible for effectuating transfers on behalf of‚Äô a wallet user,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn order to square the circle, the proposal asks one to accept that ‚Äòeffectuating‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean effectuating.‚Äù  Another poster on the platform noted that wallet providers like Metamask, decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and any smart contract with a multisignature security setup might be captured under the reporting requirements. This would force these entities to develop new know-your-customer rules for their users.  ""The crypto ecosystem is very different from that of traditional assets, so the rules must be tailored accordingly and not capture ecosystem participants that don‚Äôt have a pathway to compliance,"" said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, in a statement shortly after the proposal emerged.  But Smith also nodded to the other side of this coin -- that the future rules will potentially give the masses of crypto investors a clear path to file their taxes, eliminating what's been a major roadblock for easy involvement in digital assets.  ""If done correctly, these rules could help provide everyday crypto users with the necessary information to accurately comply with tax laws,"" Smith said.  The industry will have until October 30 to make their objections clear to the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, followed by public hearings on November 7 and 8. The proposal‚Äôs authors included language in the lengthy document that invites ideas from the crypto sector.  One immediate bright side about the proposal‚Äôs scope was that it generally excluded crypto mining operations, which had been a worry when the 2021 infrastructure law mandated the tax rules.

Despite making waves in recent months, PEPE‚Äôs momentum fizzled out by August, exacerbated by a wave of negative sentiment that battered the altcoin. The current price of PEPE stands at a mere $0.000000870194 according to CoinGecko, sustaining a 21% slump in the last 24 hours alone. Over the span of seven days, the meme coin incurred losses of 15.3%, signaling a distressing trend for its holders. PEPE price action today. Source: Coingecko Multisig Wallet Changes Fuel PEPE Rug Pull Allegations The root of this downturn traces back to recent alterations in PEPE‚Äôs multisig wallet, coupled with newfound token transfers that ignited a prevailing fear of a potential ‚Äúrug pull‚Äù orchestrated by the project‚Äôs developers. On August 24, nearly $16 million worth of Pepe tokens were transferred from the developers‚Äô multisig wallet to various crypto exchanges, sending shockwaves throughout the community. 1/4 1 hour ago, the Pepe multisig wallet, changed the amount of signatures required on their multisig from a 5/8 to 2/8. This comes after sending $15.7 million worth of $PEPE to exchanges. A breakdown of what we know: pic.twitter.com/bxBxp6Nzqz ‚Äî ASXN (@asxn_r) August 24, 2023 The tokens flowed out of the PEPE multisig wallet, directed towards addresses affiliated with notable platforms such as Binance, OXK, and Bybit. What further exacerbated concerns was the transformation in the transaction approval process within the vault-like wallet. Previously requiring consensus from five out of eight wallets, it had inexplicably shifted to a meager two out of eight. Any reason why the PEPE multisig wallet changed the threshold to just 2/8 signatures? Seems weird, this isn‚Äôt standard right? Also, seems that some has been sent to exchanges pic.twitter.com/1DVZIOvef8 ‚Äî CryptoNoddy (@Crypto_Noddy) August 24, 2023 This unprecedented maneuver marked the first instance in which the project‚Äôs crucial multisig, responsible for safeguarding a significant portion of the token‚Äôs supply, executed such an outward transfer. Investor Reactions And Realized Losses While the authenticity of the allegations remains unverified, investors swiftly leaped to conclusions, suspecting the development team of orchestrating a scam for personal gain. Contrary to this sentiment, closer analysis suggests that had foul play been intended, the transfer‚Äôs magnitude would have been substantially larger. PEPEUSD trading at $0.000001 on the daily chart: Gemini/TradingView.com Nevertheless, the panic-induced sell-off rapidly gained traction, precipitating an abrupt nosedive in PEPE‚Äôs price and fostering an environment dominated by fear. On a broader scale, the network experienced a surge in Realized Losses, reaching a three-month peak and registering the third-highest single-day losses since the token‚Äôs inception. Ultimately, investor losses tallied a staggering $14 million.

16538040,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548876,1692974711,"Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond","Bitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. From being worth less than a penny initially, it has seen massive growth over the years with some dramatic ups and downs. Today, Bitcoin is emerging as a major alternative asset class and its future valuation prospects remain optimistic. This comprehensive guide takes a data-driven approach to analyze factors affecting Bitcoin prices and makes educated projections about its potential highs and lows in the short, medium and long-term timeframes. With cryptocurrencies gaining mainstream traction, the report aims to provide clarity to investors on what lies ahead for Bitcoin prices based on historical patterns and developments. What is Bitcoin (BTC)? Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency in the world. It was created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the Bitcoin whitepaper and developed the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology to the world. The Bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions ever made. It is decentralized, meaning no single entity controls it. The blockchain is maintained by a global network of computers known as Bitcoin miners. Key attributes of Bitcoin include: Decentralized No central authority controls Bitcoin. It is maintained by a distributed network of users. Limited supply Only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist. This scarcity gives Bitcoin value. Pseudonymous Bitcoin addresses are not linked to real-world identities by default, giving users privacy. Secure Bitcoin uses cryptography and the blockchain to ensure the security of payments and ownership records. Divisible One Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis, allowing small transactions. Permissionless Anyone can use Bitcoin without the need for permission from authorities. These attributes make Bitcoin unique compared to traditional fiat currencies and a promising digital asset for investment. Factors Influencing Bitcoin Price Many factors can affect the price of Bitcoin, leading to volatility. Some major factors include: Supply and Demand Basic economic theory states that when demand increases while supply remains constant, price goes up. As more investors and institutions adopt Bitcoin, demand rises. But since new Bitcoins are mined at a fixed rate, supply remains steady, driving prices up. Media Hype and Public Sentiment Positive or negative media coverage and public sentiment can influence demand and price. For example, Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets on Bitcoin often lead to price swings based on his views. Major Protocol Changes and Upgrades Major Bitcoin developments like the SegWit upgrade or Lightning Network adoption can improve Bitcoin‚Äôs capabilities and affect price. Regulations and Legal Status Regulatory crackdowns or acceptance of Bitcoin in different countries impacts price as it affects demand. Whales and Institutional Investors ‚ÄúWhales‚Äù ‚Äì entities holding large amounts of Bitcoin ‚Äì can manipulate prices when they buy or sell. Increased institutional investment also drives up prices through increased demand. Security Breaches and Scandals Security issues with exchanges and wallets like the Mt.Gox hack or malicious business practices like the FTX collapse can erode investor confidence and depress prices. Macroeconomic Conditions Economic instability and currency devaluations motivate investors to buy Bitcoin as a hedge, boosting its price. However, it has struggled in a hawkish Fed environment and amidst rate hikes. Bitcoin Price Performance in the Past Looking at past price performance can provide insights into long-term trends and help predict future prices. Let‚Äôs take a walk down BTC memory lane. The Early Days ‚Äì Volatility and Growth (2009-2013) When Bitcoin launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, Bitcoin went from $0 to $0.39 and was extremely volatile in its early days. By early 2011, it achieved parity with the US dollar, hitting $1.00 in February 2011. In the same year, it reached $10 and then $30. This early volatility was attributed to insufficient liquidity, scarcity due to the low Bitcoin supply, and lack of exchange infrastructure. In mid-2011, Bitcoin fell from around $30 to $2 after a series of exchange hacks and thefts shook investor confidence. It took over a year to reach $10 again. 2012 saw gradual gains up to $12 but also wild fluctuations between $7-$15. In 2013, Bitcoin entered a bull run from $12 to over $1,100 driven by increasing media coverage and adoption in the dark web. But it ended the year around $700 following a China ban on financial institutions and payment processors dealing with Bitcoin. This cycle of rapid gains and dramatic crashes would come to define Bitcoin price performance. The 2014-2016 Bear Market 2014 kicked off with the collapse of Mt.Gox, then the largest Bitcoin exchange, after a series of hacks. This erased most gains from 2013 and caused Bitcoin to fall from around $850 to below $350. For the next two years, Bitcoin hovered in the $200-$300 range. Increased regulation and lack of institutional interest kept mainstream adoption low during this period. Prices were relatively stable compared to past volatility. 2017 ‚Äì The Bull Run and Mainstream Mania 2017 marked Bitcoin‚Äôs entry into mainstream awareness and a massive growth in price to nearly $20,000. Several factors drove this rally: Growing media and investment bank coverage calling Bitcoin ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù Increased adoption in countries facing currency crises like Venezuela and Zimbabwe Proposals for Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) drew investor attention Launch of Bitcoin futures trading on major exchanges like CME and CBOE lent legitimacy Large institutional investments ‚Äì U.S billionaire Michael Novogratz invested $500M in Bitcoin in 2017 Demand rose as Bitcoin went from being an obscure digital asset to a household name. But by January 2018, Bitcoin had lost over 60% from its peak following regulatory measures and other factors leading to a cool down from its previously overheated state. 2018-2020 ‚Äì The Crypto Winter and Maturation Bitcoin spent much of 2018 in a bear market following the 2017 rally, trading in the $3,000-$6,000 range. Increased regulatory scrutiny, exchange hacks, and coin scams contributed to falling prices. But this period also saw the maturation of Bitcoin with developments including: Lightning Network launch ‚Äì enabled fast, cheap Bitcoin micropayments Increased mainstream institutional investment from firms like Fidelity and US Bank Bitcoin futures added on Bakkt, Nasdaq exchanges Countries like Japan recognized Bitcoin as legal tender These developments likely prevented further drops. By mid-2019, Bitcoin recovered to the $10k-$11k range. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis in 2020 proved Bitcoin‚Äôs value as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Stimulus spending eroded fiat savings while Bitcoin held its value. Growing institutional interest like Microstrategy‚Äôs $500M Bitcoin purchase helped take prices past 2017 highs, eventually reaching an all-time high of around $68,000 in 2021. 2021-2022 ‚Äì Twin Peaks and Recession Risk Bitcoin price made not one, but two new highs in 2021. The second high failed to move significantly past the first high, catching investors off-guard who had anticipated BTC reaching $100,000 or more. Instead, Bitcoin crashed throughout 2022 as the US Federal Reserve launched its QT program and began raising interest rates to fight back against inflation. The situation was worsened by the implosion of several crypto businesses, including FTX. Eventually, Bitcoin reached a local low of $15,800 in November 2022. How is Bitcoin Doing Now in 2023? Bitcoin price is doing its best to recovery from the crypto market carnage of 2022. The US Federal Reserve continues to raise rates to record levels, and the US SEC is cracking down on the rest of the crypto industry, making it harder for Bitcoin to regain its footing. Despite the challenges, many institutions are eying launching Bitcoin EFTs, which could create a bullish narrative that drives prices higher. In the meantime, BTC is correcting after spending the majority of 2023 in a short-term uptrend. The question remains: Is Bitcoin falling back into a bear market, or will the short-term uptrend roll into a more meaningful mid-term uptrend? Short-Term Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2023 In the short-term, as in before the end of 2023, there are primarily three options from a technical standpoint. The bullish scenario is based on Elliott Wave Principle, and points to a wave 5 and a possible new all-time high this year. The bearish scenario would put Bitcoin in a further corrective pattern, targeting $6,000 per BTC. Of course, an alternative scenario is that Bitcoin simple remains in a sideways consolidation phase for several months longer to finish out 2023. Otherwise, a Bitcoin price prediction of $160,000 in 2023 isn‚Äôt impossible given past price trajectories and percentage moved. Medium-Term Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2024 & 2025 In the medium-term, Bitcoin price forecasts are based on the four-year cycle theory that relies on the Bitcoin block reward halving to tip the tides of supply and demand in favor of price appreciation. Fundamentally over the next several years, Bitcoin should have limited downside. Instead, Bitcoin price predictions for 2024 and 2025 point to anywhere between $100,000 to $250,000 per coin on the upside. Long-term Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2030 and Beyond Predicting Bitcoin‚Äôs price in the long-term is challenging considering how new it still is. However, using a logarithmic growth curve, Bitcoin price predictions reach between $150,000 and $1 million per coin by 2030. Further out into the future, if Bitcoin establishes itself as the leading global digital currency, it could be worth between $1 million and $10 million per coin. Total 21 million BTC in supply would give Bitcoin a market cap of $21-$210 trillion, rivaling major assets like real estate and global broad money supply. But such valuations remain speculative. Bitcoin may also face future competition from both other cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Bitcoin Price Predictions by Experts Here are some Bitcoin price forecasts by noteworthy experts and analysts. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes that Bitcoin could hit over $1,000,000 per coin in the long term, with a ‚Äúbase case‚Äù of $600,000. Venture capitalist Tim Draper sees Bitcoin price ultimately at more than $250,000 per BTC by the end of 2025. Standard Chartered has a Bitcoin price prediction¬†of $120,000 by the end of 2024. FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions Here are answers to some common questions about this Bitcoin price prediction article: What was Bitcoin‚Äôs lowest price? The first recorded Bitcoin transaction in 2010 valued BTC at $0.0008. Bitcoin‚Äôs lowest recent price was around $15,800 in late 2022. What was Bitcoin‚Äôs highest price? Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high price was around $68,000 in November 2021. How high could Bitcoin realistically go? Considering growing mainstream adoption and investment interest, Bitcoin realistically could reach $100,000-$500,000 by 2030. A $1 million+ valuation cannot be ruled out in the very long-term. Can Bitcoin price fall to zero? It is unlikely Bitcoin price will crash to zero given its growing adoption, finite supply, and increasing regulation. There will likely always be some demand for Bitcoin which gives it fundamental value. Anything is possible, however. Why is Bitcoin price so volatile? As a new asset class, Bitcoin is still establishing itself, leading to volatility. Manipulation by ‚Äúwhales‚Äù, media hype, and regulatory uncertainty add to large price swings. Price should stabilize with broader adoption. When will Bitcoin price stop fluctuating so much? Bitcoin price volatility should reduce significantly as it becomes a mainstream asset and gains broader public adoption in 5-10 years. But some short-term fluctuations will always remain. Will Bitcoin price rise in 2023? Considering adoption trends and investor interest, the overall Bitcoin price trajectory appears to be upwards in 2023 despite some short-term fluctuations.

Jackson Hole Takes Place, Price Of Bitcoin Reacts In the first part of his speech, the US Fed Chair highlighted the increasing inflation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the country‚Äôs economy. Government officials believe the economy has shrunk in recent years, but there is evidence that some sectors remain strong and might contribute to swelling inflation. The Fed Chair stated the following, emphasizing intentions to bring down inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), to 2%. Powell noted that further potential interest rate hikes could have unintended consequences for financial markets: We are prepared to raise interest rates further until inflation is on a convincing path towards the 2% rate. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price and the crypto market are yet to show some reaction to Powell‚Äôs seemingly hawkish speech. Across social media, some analysts are pointing out the aggressive tone from the Fed Chair, but there weren‚Äôt unexpected statements. An analyst called the current price action a classic ‚ÄúPowell is talking‚Äù dynamic, with the Bitcoin price moving sideways from $26,000.

Mastercard To Sever All Ties To Binance Binance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is facing new challenges that could impact its reputation and growth rate. According to reports, Mastercard will discontinue its services on Binance, ending a years-old relationship and crypto cards programs starting Friday, September 22. Related Reading: Is Binance Really Selling Bitcoin To Prop The Price Of BNB? The reason for the abrupt termination has not been clarified by Mastercard. Some have attributed the news to the recent regulatory challenges and lawsuits Binance has been up against since this year. Binance has refrained from making any comments regarding the reason for the suspension or who initiated the decision first. However, the crypto exchange has reassured users around the globe, stating that their Binance accounts are not affected by the news and they can continue their crypto transactions per usual. ‚ÄúBinance accounts around the world are not affected. Where available, users can also shop with crypto and send crypto using Binance Pay, a contactless, borderless, and secure cryptocurrency payment technology designed by Binance,‚Äù Binance stated. Mastercard and Binance have been working together as partners for about four years. Around August 2022, they both joined hands to initiate debit card programs for four major countries, allowing users in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Bahrain to have access to cryptocurrency assets via their Mastercards linked to a cryptocurrency wallet. Binance first partnered with Mastercard to launch crypto card payments in Brazil and Latin America at the beginning of 2023. The crypto exchange then made a similar announcement and launched prepaid crypto cards in Argentina in August 2022. BNB price struggles amid regulatory pressures | Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview.com Financial Service Companies Break Away Following SEC Lawsuit Binance has been in a legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since June when the SEC sued the crypto exchange for allegedly offering unregistered securities. The regulator further attempted to freeze all Binance assets stating that the crypto exchange was operating a ‚Äúweb of deception‚Äù and filing 13 charges against Binance. Since then, Binance has been facing regulatory hurdles and industry challenges with many companies ending year-long partnerships and the price of BNB declining as a result. The cryptocurrency exchange has also ended several projects in the course of a month and carried out massive layoffs following the SEC‚Äôs Lawsuits.

If creditors vote in favor, a wind-up plan will now proceed with a lower $0.25 valuation  Holders of Celsius‚Äô native token have failed in a bid to argue CEL should be valued at $0.80, the trading price on the day the crypto lender filed for bankruptcy in July 2022, said a judgment issued by New York bankruptcy court issued Thursday.  Trading prices don‚Äôt reflect reality because the market for CEL was manipulated, and the court could even have valued it at a lower or zero price on a par with what stockholders could expect in bankruptcy, the company argued in opposition to the token holders.  Two token holders, Santos Caceres and Otis Davis, lobbied the court to be able to take part in the bankruptcy negotiations via a special committee of CEL holders, which Judge Martin Glenn also rejected.  ‚ÄúNothing in the motions, this order, or announced at the hearing, constitutes a finding under the federal securities laws as to whether crypto tokens or transactions involving crypto tokens are securities,‚Äù Glenn said, seeking to avoid intervening in a heated dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the regulatory status of CEL and other cryptoassets.  Celsius‚Äô management have proposed to value CEL at $0.25, as they seek to wind up the companies‚Äô affairs, hasten a sale to crypto consortium Fahrenheit, and return funds to creditors. That valuation, itself a raise from a previous $0.20, appeared in a disclosure statement related to the sale to Fahrenheit which was approved by Glenn last week.  In January, Shoba Pillay, an independent examiner Glenn appointed, said the market in CEL was largely created by the company itself, to the profit of insiders such as then-Chief Executive Officer Alex Mashinsky. Regulators have since arrested Mashinsky on charges including market manipulation, to which he has pleaded not guilty.  Creditors have one month to consider and vote on the sale plan.

Crypto Players Team Up For ETF In a significant move, prominent players in the race for a bitcoin ETF have turned their attention to the realm of ether futures contracts. Ark Invest and 21Shares, considered strong contenders in the ETF space, have unveiled their involvement in the proposed ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures ETF (ARKZ) and the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (ARKY), as per a recent filing. Both ARKZ and ARKY are set to have Ark Invest and 21Shares listed as sub-advisers. Empowered Funds, an affiliate of Alpha Architect, a white-label ETF platform, will orchestrate the funds themselves. Notably, ARKZ is designed to allocate a minimum of 25% of its assets to cash-settled ether futures contracts, mirroring the offerings on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This allocation may also encompass US Treasury securities, money market instruments, and repurchase agreements. Will the SEC Approve? Recently, multiple issuers have submitted filings for similar funds, aligning with the trend. In a surprisingly positive turn of events, insiders close to the SEC have indicated that the regulatory body will not be obstructing Ether futures ETFs. This is a marked departure from the SEC's historically cautious stance. Although the specific funds that will receive approval remain uncertain, this news has spurred leading entities like Ark Invest and 21Shares to capitalize on the emerging trend. The SEC has recently disclosed its intention to ""institute proceedings"" to assess the approval or denial of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. Past Endeavors and Current Plans The two firms are no strangers to collaboration. Their initial partnership was forged to introduce a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021. Despite facing initial setbacks with the SEC blocking their first two attempts, the companies have persisted. Their most recent attempt was re-filed in April, coinciding with BlackRock's announcement of its own Bitcoin ETF plans. This development triggered a resurgence of interest among other fund issuers. While ARKZ is focused on ether futures, ARKY takes a more diversified approach. It plans to invest in both bitcoin futures and ether futures contracts in addition to its own planned ETFs holding such contracts. This strategic move highlights the growing interest in leading cryptocurrencies and their associated derivatives. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

ControlFreight, underwriter of the credit pool under distress, warned Friday that the $2.7 million pool‚Äôs largest borrower is facing liquidation due to a legal dispute.  ‚ÄúThere is a significant risk of total or partial loss of funds related to the amounts owed to us by Hanhwa AUS Pty Ltd and Hanwha New Zealand Pty Ltd,‚Äù ConsolFreight said in the post.

This collaboration enables millions of businesses operating on the Shopify platform to offer their customers Solana Pay as a secure payment option. Notably, Solana Pay's initial integration will leverage USDC, the second-largest stablecoin boasting a substantial market capitalization of $25.9 billion, according to CoinGecko. The Power of Crypto Payments Josh Fried, overseeing business development and partnerships at Solana Foundation, underscored the significance of crypto payments, saying, ""Some people argue the killer app for crypto hasn't arrived, but it has: it's payments‚Ä¶[Everyone] should be doubling down on this."" Solana Pay, launched in February 2022 and built on the foundation of the layer-1 blockchain Solana, focuses on facilitating transactions involving dollar-pegged stablecoins. This application seamlessly serves both online and point-of-sale transactions and can handle any volume of digital dollar transfers on the Solana blockchain. Noteworthy entities such as USDC issuer Circle, Phantom Solana wallet, and payment processor Checkout.com have already embraced Solana Pay, contributing to the thriving Solana ecosystem encompassing over 11.5 million active accounts. A ‚ÄúFee-Free‚Äù Alternative Compared to the standard credit card processing fees that can soar up to 3.5% per transaction, Solana Pay presents an appealing alternative. As Fried emphasizes, ""Solana Pay is effectively 'fee-free.'"" Transactions conducted on this platform incur minimal costs, with a transaction fee of approximately 0.000005 SOL at the time of writing, translating to mere fractions of a penny. Despite facing network outages in the past, Solana has evolved into a faster and more cost-efficient layer-1 blockchain compared to giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Significantly, the network has remained operational without a single instance of downtime since February. Where Does The Road Lead? Solana Pay's partnership with Shopify is not the platform's first crypto-related endeavor. Shopify had previously integrated Bitcoin lightning network payments via Strike and embraced platforms like Coinbase Commerce and Bitpay. While the initial integration features USDC, Solana Pay is exploring the inclusion of additional cryptocurrencies like the native SOL token and BONK, a meme coin, in the future. Furthermore, this integration empowers merchants to design creative loyalty programs, potentially incorporating systems like NFT loyalty tokens. This means customers using Solana Pay for repeat purchases could be rewarded with discounts and other incentives. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

16534140,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548845,1692967829,"XRP Price At Make-Or-Break Moment, Key Levels To Watch","The XRP price is facing an extremely crucial juncture, which could become a make-or-break moment for the cryptocurrency. After the XRP token managed to rally almost 100% after the summary judgment in the case between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there is almost nothing left of the gains just 43 days after the ruling, NewsBTC reported. However, this is far from the worst. The recent price decline has brought XRP to key support levels that must be held at all costs to avoid another deep fall. At the same time, there is hope due to the formation of an extremely rare golden cross on the 1-week chart. Golden Cross: A Beacon For XRP Bulls? As of August 25, 2023, XRP stands at $0.5115. The weekly chart reveals the much-discussed golden cross, a phenomenon where a short-term moving average surpasses a long-term one, often hinting at a shift from a bearish to a bullish trend. In XRP‚Äôs case, the 50-week EMA has moved above the 200-week EMA. Related Reading: XRP Bears Reverse All SEC Ruling Gains, What‚Äôs Next? This movement is typically seen as a harbinger of an impending upward trajectory. However, the tokens price is teetering just above the 200-week EMA, pegged at $0.5083. A weekly close below this figure could spell trouble. Not only would it undermine this crucial indicator, but it might also negate the golden cross‚Äôs significance. Moreover, the uptrend line (black), which has been intact since early January, could be jeopardized if XRP dips below the $0.50 mark on a weekly basis. Given this backdrop, the golden cross on the weekly chart is a beacon of hope. Yet, the risks are palpable. Should the token breach the $0.50 threshold on a weekly timeframe, a sharper decline seems imminent, potentially plummeting to the 78.6 Fibonacci level at $0.4350. Related Reading: Rumors Of Robinhood Listing XRP Take Center Stage On Crypto Twitter Before potentially hitting the year‚Äôs low of just under $0.30, XRP might find support at $0.41 and $0.36. As in previous weeks, news of the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC are the most potent catalysts for an XRP price rally. While the SEC‚Äôs interlocutory appeal is currently under review by Judge Torres, the trial is not scheduled until mid-April next year. A Historical Perspective Remarkably, XRP has only seen one golden cross on a weekly basis in its history. This was at the end of November 2020. XRP saw an increase of 196% in three weeks. However, as we all know, XRP‚Äôs rally was prematurely thwarted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple Labs and the declaration of the XRP token as a security. Therefore, the golden cross failed to materialize, while the price crashed. Probably, the next week or two will tell if the golden cross chart pattern will play out this time.

42409819,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPgCk,1692967500,"U.S. Crypto Tax Proposal Lets Miners Off the Hook, Snares ‚ÄòSome‚Äô Decentralized Exchanges","Crypto exchanges, some hosted wallet providers and payment processors will face new tax rules in as soon as two years.  The proposal, which is opening to a comment period and public hearings, would exempt miners and certain other types of activities.  The U.S. Treasury Department has finally unveiled its definition of a ""broker"" for the crypto industry, defining how crypto companies and investors will need to meet tax reporting obligations and answering a years-old question over whether decentralized finance platforms and miners will need to gather their users' personal data.  The Treasury Department published a nearly 300-page proposed rule on Friday in response to the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act saying centralized crypto exchanges, payment processors, some hosted wallet providers, some decentralized exchanges and people or entities that redeem crypto tokens they created will be bound to those reporting obligations. Moreover, Treasury unveiled a new custom tax form ‚Äì the 1099-DA ‚Äì that these brokers can file, resolving longstanding confusion over whether different versions of the U.S. tax form make the most sense for taxpayers.  Miners are exempt from the tax rules, but ""some"" decentralized finance platforms will not be, said the proposed guidance.  The big exchanges and cryptocurrency brokers would have a couple of years to get up to speed on the new tax-reporting system, which is a much longer runway than originally anticipated by the lawmakers who shepherded the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ‚Äì and its crypto tax provisions ‚Äì into law.  The proposal is, so far, just that. The government still has to take in all the public comments by October 30 and listen to participants in a set of public hearings on November 7 and 8. Where the industry may balk is the treatment of decentralized exchanges, some of which could be roped into the reporting requirement even as they may insist that there‚Äôs no staff or management to handle such affairs. Once the Treasury and IRS have heard from everybody, the rules can be approved in a final form, so the industry will have months to lobby federal officials before anything is set in stone for the 2025 tax year. That gives some breathing room to an industry that had been braced for the overhaul to hit as soon as next year.  Since the dawn of crypto, one of the nagging drawbacks of token transactions was the uncertainty about how to pay taxes on gains. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act said the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) had to work out how digital assets firms should report information on customers‚Äô tax positions ‚Äì something like a traditional brokerage‚Äôs 1099 forms that detail gains and losses.  The law, which caught the industry off-guard when it sprang from Congress two years ago, carried some major worries for crypto businesses. It wasn‚Äôt specific about whether they‚Äôll be asked to provide information to the government that they can‚Äôt get, or whether it would affect companies that don‚Äôt have direct relationships with customers ‚Äì most notably mining operations.  Friday‚Äôs documents include the Treasury push for how to define ‚Äúbroker‚Äù ‚Äì the most controversial aspect of the 2021 law ‚Äì and lays out several snapshots for how the rule may be applied to different types of entities. If implemented, the rules would begin applying to crypto exchanges in the 2025 tax year and brokers in the 2026 tax year, while giving the crypto industry its very own tax form for the newly designated brokers to use.  ‚ÄúThis is part of a broader effort at Treasury to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules,‚Äù said a statement from the Treasury explaining the proposed rule.  While the law‚Äôs original estimate had it raising almost $28 billion in U.S. revenue in its first decade, that number was based on a very different crypto industry, during its dramatic rise before the 2022 fall. Treasury officials acknowledged there have been a lot of developments in the industry since then, but they said the revenue expectations aren‚Äôt their concern.  Who‚Äôs included?  The proposal corrals exchanges and payment processors while largely exempting miners from maintaining and filing the new reports, though it‚Äôs murkier on the topic of decentralized exchanges.  The definition of brokers, it says, ‚Äúincludes digital asset trading platforms, digital asset payment processors, certain digital asset hosted wallet providers, and persons who regularly offer to redeem digital assets that were created or issued by that person.‚Äù  Treasury officials also said the reporting demand would encompass some decentralized exchanges (DEXs), if they check enough boxes to be seen as a broker. And unhosted wallet providers that also ‚Äúfacilitate or offer services to facilitate‚Äù their users buying or selling digital assets will be considered brokers, alongside hosted wallet providers.  A miner that receives fees for validating transactions would be exempted from the reporting requirements, as it‚Äôs not a middleman or broker for the purposes of this law, according to the documents‚Äô embedded analysis. Similarly, any other entities that are only focused on validating transactions on a distributed ledger would be beyond reach of the rules.  Ideas welcome  The Treasury Department indicated that it and the IRS ‚Äúrecognize that some stakeholders may have concerns‚Äù about sharing their personal information, so they‚Äôre soliciting alternative approaches that would respect privacy. The proposal also seeks information about ‚Äútechnical issues‚Äù that might block DEXs from getting this information from their users.  Meanwhile, the IRS assured the industry late last year that it could keep operating under the current laws and regulations until the new tax rules are finalized. Just because the agency has finally issued its proposal, that doesn‚Äôt mean the work is anywhere near completion.  The 2021 law also called for a reporting requirement to fully identify people making crypto transactions worth more than $10,000, which seemed derived from a separate proposal from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). On the law‚Äôs requirements, there will be plenty of complicated questions to work out, such as how the firms deal with customers maneuvering funds with private wallets that the business can‚Äôt see into and how the broker records may deal with interactions on truly decentralized platforms.

With its features and advantages, it has the potential to become a great part of what we call finance. But how do you start working with crypto? Well, a good option may be buying some coins or tokens. But to get a surprising profit, you will have to invest a significant amount of fiat, which can drive away some crypto enthusiasts. However, you can earn crypto without investing in it, and in this article, we will talk about some of the most popular ways to earn digital assets with little to no effort but lots of fun. Airdrops Crypto airdrops are special events organized by newly launched crypto projects to increase their popularity and allow crypto enthusiasts to invest in the project in its early stages. Basically, a crypto airdrop implies distributing free tokens to a certain number of wallet addresses within a particular blockchain. While being part of a project‚Äôs marketing strategy, crypto airdrops are also organized to reward existing token holders. However, the concept is similar in both situations. Such special events can build an engaged community and introduce new users to the world of cryptocurrencies by providing them with digital assets to trade. Participating in a crypto airdrop usually implies completing specific actions that can increase the popularity of the crypto project. For example, you might be required to follow the company on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, join its Discord and Telegram channels, or subscribe to its YouTube channel. Also, you may be able to refer some friends to get extra entries, and you can submit your wallet address or provide personal information to sign up for the airdrop. Your wallet address will be useful when the airdrop ends, and the project distributes the free tokens. Learn and Earn What could be better than earning crypto while learning new things about this amazing industry? Learn and earn activities have become very important for cryptocurrency adoption, offering users an interactive way to acquire knowledge about various topics, such as blockchain technology, digital assets, DeFi, and many more. Currently, plenty of apps and platforms allow users to get through some guides and then complete quizzes to earn crypto rewards. The tutorials are designed to educate newcomers regarding various crypto-related topics. As users engage with educational content, they can earn crypto as rewards, thus being able to apply what they have learned to trade the crypto rewards and make some profits. The process is extremely straightforward. All you have to do is find a platform that offers learn and earn activities, go to the section, and start reading or watching the first guide. After you gather the information you need, you will be required to take a quick test to ensure that everything you‚Äôve learned is clear and will help you afterward. When you finish the quiz, the platform will offer you a small crypto reward you can withdraw and use as you like. You can trade or swap it or even opt to stake the crypto earned if the cryptocurrency works based on a PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism. This way, you will be able to earn profit without having to study the crypto market thoroughly. Use a Crypto Browser We are not talking about simply using a crypto browser and winning crypto by searching whatever you want and navigating through the results. However, you can look for a crypto search engine that allows users to earn crypto while completing various tasks. For instance, you can get paid to watch crypto videos. All you have to do is find the crypto-related videos the platform provides and watch them. Then, a tiny crypto reward will be delivered to your wallet. Then, you can also get paid to click on ads. Ads are everywhere, but most of the time, we don‚Äôt click on them. However, if you want to earn crypto this way, you will be required to click on ads in different sections, and the crypto search engine will reward you once again. Furthermore, if you‚Äôve already earned some crypto assets this way, you can be offered more through a profit-sharing program. Some crypto browsers share a significant percentage of their profit with all those holding tokens in the system. Get Paid in Crypto These days, you can easily get paid in crypto and hold significant amounts of tokens this way. For instance, if you are a freelancer, you can offer clients the option to pay you in crypto. All you have to do is provide a valid wallet address. As a freelancer, there are many jobs available, and considering that crypto is becoming increasingly popular, there is a high possibility that some clients will prefer paying for your products or services with digital assets. Then, if you want a full-time job that offers payments in crypto, you may be able to find it on various crypto job platforms. The jobs in crypto are plenty and cover multiple fields. For instance, you can contribute to developing a project as a programmer, work with a marketing team to promote a new product or service, or even ensure that the project does not violate regulations from a specific area. Depending on your experience, crypto job platforms surely have something available that will catch your attention. Play P2E Games One of the most fun ways in which you can earn crypto without investing is by playing a P2E (Play-to-Earn) game. The name says it all; you play, you earn. Unlike traditional video games, where in-game achievements might lead to virtual rewards, blockchain-based P2E games reward users with various digital assets. There are plenty of such games in the crypto industry, and the rewards can be pretty remarkable. Usually, P2E games can challenge you to grow something, such as a dragon, or even prove your strategy and fight skills while competing in specific tournaments. A play-to-earn game will always use a native token that can be either withdrawn or used for in-game purchases. P2E games use NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and blockchain technology to establish ownership of in-game assets. Players can acquire, trade, and sell NFTs that represent items, characters, land, and many more. In Conclusion As surprising as it may seem, you can easily earn crypto without investing, and this can be a great way to start your journey in the world of cryptocurrencies. If you start with a small amount of digital assets and know how to trade them right, you will earn some profit in no time. Some of the best ways to earn crypto without investing include participating in airdrops, using crypto search engines, playing P2E games, completing learn-and-earn activities, or simply getting paid in crypto for your work.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin is clinging on to the $26,000 level as investors await the highly anticipated speech from the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole later this morning. Other attendees include European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde who will speak later in the day. Investors will watch the speech closely in search of signals about monetary policy outlook. Bank of America said in a research note that it doesn't expect strong policy signals to come from this year‚Äôs event. Both bitcoin and ether traded lower ahead of the event, with bitcoin down 1.5% and ether down 1% over the last 24 hours. Altcoins were mostly trading in the red, with Lido DAO‚Äôs LDO token taking the largest daily hit of a 6% loss.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has contacted some crypto projects with low-liquidity tokens in what it said was a move to ""enhance their liquidity protection."" ""Over the past week, our team reached out to a small number of projects that issue digital assets listed on our platform as part of our ongoing risk management initiative,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk by email. ""These projects have relatively lower market liquidity trading pairs and/or a smaller market capitalization, which potentially exposes users to risk, including potential market manipulation."" The exchange has asked for details about the projects' market makers and whether they would consider contributing up to 5% of their circulating tokens to Binance‚Äôs saving pools in return for interest, according to The Block, which reported the news earlier. Similar requests are shown in unverified screenshots posted on X, the social medium platform formerly known as Twitter.  Stablecoin issuer Num Finance has rolled out a Colombian peso-pegged token on the Polygon network, the company said in a press release on Thursday. Named nCOP, the token is overcollateralized by reserve assets and allows people and businesses to transfer, pay, earn and save money using blockchain rails, the press release said. The new offering arrives as stablecoins, a roughly $124 billion subset of digital assets, are increasingly in demand in emerging regions with frail financial systems such as Latin America and Turkey. People also use these cryptocurrencies to send remittances and store value, according to a report by crypto research firm Chainalysis. ""Currently, Colombia is one of the main recipients of remittances in Latin America, with nearly USD 10 billion flowing into the country,"" Agust√≠n Liserra, CEO of Num Finance, said in a statement. ""Num Finance aims to provide a new possibility for people to send and receive nCOP as remittances and receive a yield on it.""

16531719,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548816,1692963643,"Bitcoin Whales Buy Dip, Addresses Now At Pre-Crash Levels","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin whales have been buying the dip, as their addresses have surged back towards pre-crash levels again. Bitcoin Whales Have Fully Recovered To Their Pre-Crash Number As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the whales appear to have been accumulating recently. The relevant indicator here is the ‚Äúwhale address count,‚Äù which measures the total number of Bitcoin addresses that hold at least 1,000 BTC and at most 10,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to approximately $26 million at the lower bound and $260 million at the upper bound. These are clearly very significant amounts and the only investors large enough to be owners of these addresses would be the whale entities. The whales naturally carry some influence in the market, due to the fact that they hold a notable part of the total circulating supply of the asset. Thus, their movements can be worth keeping an eye on, as they can influence the price of the asset. Another version of the indicator tracks the addresses with balances upwards of 10,000 BTC (that is, this range‚Äôs upper bound), but at those levels, the wallets become more likely to belong to central entities like exchanges, so the trend in their addresses may not hold the same significance as what that of the normal whales would. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin whale address count over the past month or so: Looks like the value of the metric has spiked in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the whale address count observed a large drop around the time of the asset‚Äôs crash a few days back, where the price plummeted from the $29,000 level to below the $26,000 mark. This decline in the number of addresses of these humongous investors would imply that some members of this cohort participated in distribution during the crash. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom: BTC Not Fulfilling This Historical Pattern Yet These whales who participated in the selloff didn‚Äôt necessarily clear out their entire holdings and exit the market, though, as distribution just enough to bring their address balances below the 1,000 BTC mark would still lead to a drawdown in the indicator. Initially, following the crash, the number of these large Bitcoin holders remained flat, implying that there wasn‚Äôt any significant accumulation or distribution taking place. In the past few days, however, the BTC whale address count has registered a sharp spike, suggesting that more whale-sized addresses have popped up on the network. With this uplift, the indicator has returned back to about the same values as it was before the price crash had occurred. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Flashes Buy Signal, Bottom In? The whales participating in buying at the current price lows is naturally a positive sign for the cryptocurrency, as it could provide a more solid foundation for a rebound in the asset‚Äôs value.

16529287,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548841,1692959407,Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK Invest Joins Ethereum Futures ETF Race After Spot Bitcoin ETF Delay,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had on August 11 moved to delay its decision on the ARK 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF application. Following this, Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK Invest and 21 Shares has moved to apply for a separate Ethereum futures ETF in what many may consider a double-barreled approach for these firms. ARK Invest Joins Ethereum Futures ETF Race According to a filing with the SEC on August 24, ARK Invest and 21 Shares will act as sub-adviser and sub-sub-adviser respectively, on two separate funds that seek to invest in Ethereum futures contracts. These include the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures ETF on the one hand and Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF on the other hand. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why Arthur Hayes Is Not In Support Of A BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF This won‚Äôt be the first time ARK Invest and 21 Shares are partnering together to offer an ETF, as they had on different occasions jointly applied to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF, with the most recent application delayed by the SEC. If approved, the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures ETF (with ticker ARKZ) will invest in a ‚Äúportfolio of ether futures contracts.‚Äù This will include futures contracts traded on regulated commodity exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The fund is focused on futures contracts and would not directly invest in Ether or have any direct exposure to the ‚Äúspot‚Äù Ether. Futures ETFs are known only to track the underlying asset‚Äôs performance, while Spot ETFs involve direct investment in the asset. Furthermore, the document noted that the fund‚Äôs remaining assets would be put into short-term cash instruments like US Treasury securities, money market instruments, and repurchase agreements. These investments will serve as a way to shore up the fund‚Äôs liquidity and hedge against its investments in Ether futures. Meanwhile, ARK Invest and 21 Shares are also looking to offer the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (with ticker ARKY). This fund will invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. Interestingly, this is similar to what Valkyrie was trying to do when it applied to the SEC to include ETH futures contracts as part of its Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF). According to the filing, there will be an ‚ÄúActive Bitcoin Futures ETF‚Äù and ‚ÄúActive Ethereum Futures ETF‚Äù known together as the ‚ÄúUnderlying ETFs‚Äù under the fund. That will suggest that this fund is a two-in-one approach whereby there will be a standalone investment in Bitcoin futures and another for Ethereum futures. The remaining net assets of the fund will be allocated to cash or cash equivalents with a primary focus on US government securities. ETH price recovers amid high interest from institutional investors | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Bullish Or Something Else? Several traditional finance institutions have filed to offer a crypto ETF (both futures and spot). Some of these firms, including ARK Invest and Grayscale, have filed to offer both futures and spot ETFs. As such, it raises questions about whether these firms are truly bullish on the crypto space or whether other factors are involved. Related Reading: The $20 Billion Delay: Appeal Court Pushes Back Decision On Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, pointed out that the total BTC futures ETF market is valued at less than $1.5 billion in Assets Under Management (AuM). So, it might not be profitable, especially for those looking to enter the market. However, if the market doesn‚Äôt provide many profits for these firms, why are they looking to gain crypto exposure at all costs? Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, for one, stated that these firms are simply looking to become the ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù of crypto in a bid to balance their deposit base. He doesn‚Äôt believe that these firms are bullish on the fundamentals of the crypto industry and are simply to make maximum profits when cryptocurrencies disrupt the economy.

By harnessing the advantages of both planned and market economies, CAIZcoin is revolutionizing the economic landscape and paving the way for a novel hybrid model that enhances efficiency and transparency. Decentralization is at the core of blockchain technology, and its impact on the economy is profound. In a market economy, the invisible hand guides economic activities, allowing for self-regulation and optimizing social interest through the pursuit of individual self-interest. Similarly, blockchain-based economies operate without direct central intervention, replacing centralized governance and regulations with encoded programs within the blockchain system. By leveraging blockchain,¬†CAIZcoin¬†creates an environment where economic activities can flourish in a decentralized manner. The open competition driven by demand and supply dynamics is further enhanced by the transparency and efficiency of blockchain technology. Market participants can engage in transactions and exchanges with minimal intervention from the government or regulatory bodies, fostering a free and competitive economic landscape. One of the key advantages of blockchain decentralization in the economy is the consolidation of knowledge. Blockchain technology enables the comprehensive and egalitarian sharing of information, making it globally accessible. This accessibility enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of economic decision-making, as participants have access to real-time and accurate data. The democratization of information empowers businesses, entrepreneurs, and investors to make informed choices and adapt to market dynamics swiftly. Blockchain decentralization allows for seamless updates and improvements to the economic system. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that decisions and modifications are made through a consensus mechanism, involving multiple participants across the network. This inclusive approach fosters transparency and reduces the risk of manipulation or bias, creating a more equitable and trustworthy economic environment. CAIZcoin‚Äôs commitment to decentralization in the economy aligns with its mission to empower individuals and businesses. By leveraging blockchain technology, CAIZcoin enables secure and efficient transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs. This fosters financial inclusion and empowers individuals who have been underserved by traditional financial systems. The transformative power of CAIZcoin extends beyond traditional financial transactions. Blockchain decentralization opens up avenues for innovative business models, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), where individuals can participate in lending, borrowing, and investment activities without relying on traditional intermediaries. This democratization of finance allows for greater financial autonomy and fosters economic growth and innovation. CAIZcoin‚Äôs commitment to ethical and responsible practices further enhances the impact of decentralization in the economy. Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable record of transactions, making it easier to trace and verify the origins of products and ensure ethical sourcing. This promotes sustainability, responsible production, and ethical consumption, aligning with the growing demand for socially and environmentally conscious practices. By embracing blockchain technology, CAIZCOIN enables individuals and businesses to unlock their full potential, creating a more efficient, transparent, and inclusive economic ecosystem.

According to online digital storage giant Dropbox, its Dropbox Advanced plan was designed for businesses that would not have to worry about scaling up their storage as they grew. Dropbox also recognised that there would be a certain amount of uneven usage as some businesses ramped up more than others. However, it was not prepared for storage space hoggers such as crypto and Chia mining, individuals pooling storage for their own personal use, and even some customers selling on their storage to others. A post on the Dropbox blog explained how the company was planning to react: ‚ÄúWhile we prohibit abusive behavior, maintaining long lists of ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù and ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù use cases for Advanced would not be a sustainable solution, and these kinds of policies would be difficult to enforce at scale. As a result, we‚Äôre sunsetting the ‚Äúas much space as you need‚Äù policy and transitioning to a metered model. That said, we‚Äôre committed to making this transition as seamless as possible for our customers.‚Äù The company went on to say that although their ‚Äúas much space as you need‚Äù model would no longer be operating, the new Dropbox Advanced plan would grant customers with three active licences a storage of 15 TB, which it said would be enough to store 100 million documents, 4 million photos, or 7500 hours of HD video. For those who were using the storage for mining crypto and other exploitative activities they will need to find alternatives or close down their ventures. This kind of action was sometimes using thousands of times more storage than was the case with genuine business customers. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

CEO‚Äôs statement the latest in a series of mismanagement allegations to plague the crypto sector.  Crypto custodian Prime Trust lost $6 million of client funds and $2 million from its own treasury in a doomed investment in the terraUSD algorithmic stablecoin, CEO Jor Law said in a Thursday court filing.  Law, who took his role on Nov. 29 after serving on the board, also cited a January 2021 incident in which customers were told to send funds to the wrong wallet, inaccessible to the company, after which the company had to spend $76 million to buy ether (ETH) to fund withdrawal requests.  The witness statement filed as part of bankruptcy proceedings is the latest in a series of allegations of financial mismanagement and poor governance in the crypto sector, which has seen former executives including Celsius‚Äô Alex Mashinsky and FTX‚Äôs Sam Bankman-Fried pleading not guilty to multiple fraud charges.  In June, Prime Trust ‚Äì which shortly after was taken into receivership and filed for bankruptcy ‚Äì had a customer shortfall of $861,000 in digital currency and nearly $83 million in fiat, Law told the Delaware court.  The May 2022 collapse of Terra ‚Äì which sought to use automated trading to peg its value to the U.S. dollar ‚Äì ricocheted across the sector, heralding a new crypto winter.

Delving into the technical analysis on a weekly timeframe, it becomes evident that TRON has been tracing an ascending support line since November 2022. This trajectory has been consistently validated through multiple instances, underscoring its significance. TRX price action today. Source: Coingecko Resistance Targets On Tron Radar Market analysts and enthusiasts are now setting their sights on potential price trajectories for TRX. Based on a comprehensive price analysis, bullish sentiment is prevailing as TRX bulls seem poised to take on the next resistance level at $0.080. TRX market cap currently at $6.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Meanwhile, a noteworthy development has emerged within the derivatives market, adding a new dimension to TRX‚Äôs ongoing journey. This development revolves around the concept of Open Interest rates, a critical metric that measures the cumulative value of outstanding derivative contracts. Over a recent period, from August 18 to the present moment, Open Interest rates have experienced a remarkable surge, escalating from approximately $45 million to a robust figure exceeding $51 million. Tron Open Interest. Source: Coinalyze This surge in Open Interest rates carries profound implications, casting a spotlight on the prevailing sentiment among traders. The notable increase is indicative of a prevailing bullish outlook held by a substantial portion of traders and market participants. This surge essentially signifies that there is a widespread belief in the potential for further upward movement in TRX‚Äôs price. The significance of this rise in Open Interest rates transcends mere optimism. It‚Äôs also a concrete indicator of the broader market‚Äôs growing interest in TRX derivatives. This trend underscores a heightened willingness among traders to engage in derivative contracts linked to TRX, thereby enriching the trading landscape around the token. Balancing Act: Consideration Of Fluctuating Funding Rates Despite these encouraging signs, market participants are cognizant of potential headwinds. Fluctuating funding rates, which denote the cost of holding positions in futures contracts, could introduce volatility and potentially impede a solid and sustained upward momentum in the short term. As TRX ventures toward key resistance levels, it faces the challenge of maintaining its upward trajectory while navigating potential dips. The derivatives market provides a favorable backdrop, but market players remain watchful of funding rate fluctuations. The coming days will shed light on whether TRX can maintain its ascent and solidify its position. (This site‚Äôs content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

The correction in crypto markets in August, ‚Äúwhich reversed the post Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) versus Ripple court decision rally‚Äù can be partly credited to the ‚Äúbroader correction in risk assets such as equities and in particular tech, which in turn appears to have been induced by frothy positioning in tech, higher U.S. real yields and growth concerns about China,‚Äù the report said.

16525550,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/trump-nfts-surge-after-tucker-carlson-interview,1692953120,Trump NFTs Surge After Tucker Carlson Interview,"The prices and volumes of former president Donald Trump‚Äôs NFT collection surged after an interview with conservative media personality Tucker Carlson on social media platform X. Trump skipped the scheduled GOP debate, instead attacking his rivals through the interview with the former Fox News host. NFT Collection Value Soars According to data sourced from NFT marketplace OpenSea, the Polygon-based digital cards were selling for 0.13 ETH, which is just over $215. This represents an increase from 0.1 ETH or $150. Data also suggests that the collection had amassed over 17ETH of trading volume. This means that the floor price has jumped by nearly 25%, while the trading volume has risen to $23.5 million. However, it is important to note that the significant jump in activity related to the NFT collection is due to two wallets snapping up the NFTs. Like other digital assets, the price of NFTs also fluctuates considerably, especially when a bigger player gets involved and can significantly move markets. For example, just this month, the price of the Ethereum NFT Profile Picture (PFP) collection DeGods registered a significant drop after a single wallet dumped around 200 NFTs on the market. The Trump NFT Collection The former president released the NFT collection last December at a price of $99 each. The collection consists of 45,000 fantasy cards featuring Trump in various avatars, similar to collectible baseball cards. As of Thursday, the collection has more than 13,000 unique holders. Those who purchased the NFT cards were automatically entered into a ‚Äúsweepstakes,‚Äù where they stood a chance to receive certain experiences with the former president. These included a dinner in Miami, a Zoom call, or a cocktail hour at Mar-a-Lago. The cards quickly sold out at the time of launch. Data has shown that a wallet tagged as ‚Äú6D65A7‚Äù holds the highest number of individual Trump NFTs at 602. This is followed by another wallet, ‚Äú72F891,‚Äù which holds around 500. Neither of these wallets has sold or listed any of the NFTs for sale. However, interest in the NFTs has cooled since launch, and the price keeps changing each time there is news associated with Trump. This includes negative news cycles such as the recent indictment. Melania Trump has also tried her hand at NFTs, although her actions flopped in a big way. Melania had to come out and deny reports that she had to purchase her own NFTs. Trump A Major Holder Of Tokens Trump was also recently revealed to be a major holder of tokens. The leading Republican candidate for the presidential elections to be held next year reportedly has around $2.8 million in cryptocurrency as of August. Furthermore, he also earned nearly $5 million in licensing fees thanks to the Trump NFT collection. This came as a surprise to many, considering he had previously held not-so-favorable views about the crypto space and digital assets in general. Trump had stated he was extremely wary of Bitcoin because it posed a threat to the United States Dollar. He even called the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency a scam. ‚ÄúBitcoin just seems like a scam‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt like it because it is another currency competing against the dollar. Essentially, it‚Äôs a currency competing against the dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world.

Despite the broader market‚Äôs subdued performance, the Bone Shibaswap (BONE) token has registered an 11% surge in the past 24 hours. Why Is The Shiba Inu-Based BONE Up? The primary catalyst behind BONE‚Äôs commendable price action is a series of positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. A significant boost came from the recent overhaul of the Shibarium testnet explorer, Puppyscan. Furthermore, the ongoing process of releasing previously stuck BONE tokens to users has also played a pivotal role. As NewsBTC reported, the Shibarium layer-2 network faced a significant technical glitch with its bridge contract, resulting in roughly $1.7 million worth of Ethereum getting trapped between Ethereum and the layer-2 solution post the Shibarium launch on August 16. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Tracker Unveils SHIB Association, What Is It About? Lucie, a renowned Shiba Inu influencer, recently updated the community about the BONE status on Shibarium. She confirmed that many users have now received their previously stuck BONE tokens, a claim that has been corroborated by several other users. Another driving factor behind BONE‚Äôs rising popularity is the ongoing enhancement and optimization of the Shibarium mainnet in anticipation of its public relaunch. Shytoshi Kusama, on Wednesday, unveiled a slew of new features designed to elevate the user experience on the layer-2 scaling solution. Remarkably, Shibarium is still in private mode and not relaunched for the public yet. BONE Price Analysis Since it was announced that the Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) token would become the gas token of the long-awaited scaling solution for Shiba Inu, Shibarium, the price has been in a strong uptrend. This was only dampened by the failed launch of Shibarium. However, yesterday‚Äôs news has given new momentum to the BONE token. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ecosystem Token BONE Surges 88%, Too Late To Buy? BONE has thus completed its retracement to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.10. In the past two days, BONE managed to rise above the 200-day EMA (blue line). Yesterday, both the 50% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels were broken. Especially the latter at $1.3792 is of utmost importance for the further price development. From February to mid-March this year, the price level served as the most valuable support. Currently, a retest of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.3792. Should the BONE bulls manage to defend this level, the conditions would be in place for another push higher. Next target would be the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.4052 before BONE could complete its correction and target the early August high at $1.8155. To that level would be another 29% upside. A move above the August high would be seen as opening the door for an attack on the all-time high at $2.10, representing a whopping 48% price increase. After that, BONE would enter the price discovery phase. A target could be the 1,618 Fibonacci extension at $2.25.

The PEPE token is the third largest meme coin by market capitalization and has been the best-performing crypto asset of the ongoing year. Troubling Multisig Changes And FUD According to the information available, around 16 trillion PEPE tokens flowed out of the PEPE multisig wallet on Thursday. The tokens were transferred to several addresses associated with OKX, Bybit, and Binance. The transfer came shortly after a user flagged troubling changes to the Pepe multisig wallet. The user pointed out that Pepe‚Äôs multisig wallet had changed its threshold to 2/8 signatures. The initial requirement for the multisig wallet was ‚Öù signatures. ‚ÄúAny reason why the PEPE multisig wallet changed the threshold to just 2/8 signatures? Seems weird. This isn‚Äôt standard, right? Also, seems that some has been sent to exchanges.‚Äù The massive flow of PEPE tokens saw a wave of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), leading to the value of the token drop by nearly 15% in minutes. This has been the first time the wallet, which holds a majority of the token supply, has sent out such a large quantity of the meme coin to exchanges. Users are also worried about the fact that the last tweet from the PEPE X account was over two weeks ago, leaving users worried if they should be worried about a rug pull. However, other users pushed back against the fear-mongering, stating that there was a minimal chance of a rug pull in the case of PEPE. ‚ÄúQuick reminder to everyone - The only holders of more than 2.5% of PEPE are OKX and Binance, and of the top six holders, five are exchanges. Also, circulating supply = maximum supply. So there‚Äôs a minimal risk for traditional ‚Äúrug‚Äù here. The token belongs to the community.‚Äù What Next For PEPE? The PEPE token‚Äôs price has dropped over the past 24 hours. The token was already in a bearish trend but has now dropped from $0.0000012 to around $0.0000008. Assuming the latest warnings about changes to Pepe‚Äôs multisig wallet are all FUD, the token‚Äôs underlying fundamentals look strong. According to data from Etherscan, the token is closing in on 140,000 token holders. This figure has seen a considerable increase over the past few months despite there being no major price pump. This continued growth suggests that PEPE‚Äôs adoption as a crypto asset continues to grow, which bodes well for the future. New PEPE Memecoin On BNB Chain In June, the Pepe team had announced the launch of a new PEPE memecoin. The announcement came shortly after the launch of a similar token on Ethereum. The new token was issued as a BEP20 token on the BNB chain and has several unique mechanisms programmed into its tokenomics. The market capitalization for the PEPE token that debuted on Ethereum exceeded $1 billion by the 5th of May.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a key indicator of market momentum, recently attempted a reversal but was quickly thwarted, driving the index back into the oversold zone. This retreat underscored the persistent selling pressure that has hindered APE‚Äôs attempts at a price recovery. Since April 2023, the market has been dominated by bears, as each attempt by buyers to establish a support level has been met with subsequent losses. The sustained downward pressure has curtailed any bullish initiatives, leaving APE‚Äôs future uncertain. APEUSD trading at $1.41 today.

A report citing data from LookOnChain reveals substantial activity from a significant APE whale, Machi Big Brother, starting from August. The whale, making purchases totaling 1.51 million APE tokens, equivalent to a staggering $3.09 million, executed these transactions on Binance. Machi Big Brother‚Äôs substantial investments might indicate confidence in Apecoin‚Äôs future prospects. However, the larger sentiment surrounding APE tells a different story. As of August 17, prevailing sentiment remains bearish, with analysts projecting a potential decline in APE‚Äôs value to $1.36 by September. Apecoin MVRV down for the month.

The exchange cited the US regulatory environment as a deciding factor. The Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp announced it would end ETH staking services to its US customers on September 25. The exchange told Blockworks it would shutter staking services due to the US regulatory environment. Bitstamp Cites Uncertain US Regulatory Environment In a statement, Bitstamp US CEO Bobby Zagotta said: ‚ÄúAs a result, US customers will stop receiving staking rewards. All other Bitstamp services will remain unaffected.‚Äù He continued to say, ‚ÄúCustomers will continue earning staking rewards up until September 25, 2023, and after that, all staked assets will be unstaked. Rewards, along with the principal, will be credited to users‚Äô main Bitstamp account balances. Typically, this process takes a few days but could be extended depending on network conditions.‚Äù Zagotta explained the uncertain regulatory environment in the US motivated the exchange‚Äôs decision to discontinue staking services. He noted that ‚Äúas one of the most regulated and trusted exchanges in the world, we have a comprehensive framework in place to continuously evaluate the services we support, taking into account the evolving regulatory environment in all jurisdictions in which we operate.‚Äù Further stating: ‚ÄúConsidering current regulatory dynamics in the US, we‚Äôve made the decision to discontinue staking for customers residing in the United States.‚Äù Staking Controversy Continues Staking services in the US have been a topic of considerable controversy recently. The US Securities and Exchange (SEC) came down on Kraken in February when it alleged the exchange failed to register its staking service as an unregistered offering. The SEC argued Kraken‚Äôs staking program was an unlawful offer and sale of securities. In a settlement, Kraken agreed to shutter its staking program. The securities agency famously sued Coinbase in June, alleging it offered and sold unregistered securities through its staking service. Under intensified pressure from the SEC, Bitstamp recently announced that it would suspend trading for several cryptocurrencies that the SEC identified as securities in its lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance. Bitstamp said: ‚ÄúUpdate for our US users Starting August 29: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments. Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.‚Äù Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to a press release from the firm, the project's launch aims to revolutionize how Brazil-based merchants process transactions by offering a viable crypto payment alternative. The surge in the adoption of cryptocurrencies in Brazil has been notable, with a growing number of consumers and businesses exploring digital assets for both investments and everyday transactions. Recognizing this trend, Binance's strategic move is anticipated to further fuel the integration of cryptocurrencies into the country's mainstream commerce. Brazil's Push for Crypto Adoption Binance Pay promises merchants a plethora of advantages, most notably the benefit of low transaction fees. This feature can significantly enhance the profitability of businesses, especially those operating with thin margins. Additionally, the platform boasts real-time processing, which could drastically reduce the waiting times traditionally associated with financial transactions. This expedited processing can lead to swifter business operations and improved customer satisfaction. While the global acceptance of cryptocurrencies is still a topic of debate, there's no denying their transformative potential in specific markets. Brazil, with its dynamic economy and tech-savvy population, appears to be a ripe environment for such innovations. The country has also passed its crypto bill sometime in late 2022, with the country's own CBDC (central bank digital currency) already a work in progress. Binance Pay's launch in Brazil not only underscores the company's commitment to global expansion but also reflects its belief in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies as a standard payment medium. Use and Integration To use Binance Pay for purchases in Brazil, consumers follow a procedure akin to the fiat payment system, Pix. Merchants can incorporate Binance Pay into their payment process. Payments can be made via web checkout or the Binance App by scanning a QR code. At each transaction, customers choose which cryptocurrency in their wallet to use. Merchants interested in using the service can access Binance Pay directly. With Binance Pay making its services available in Brazil, local merchants in the country now have access to an advanced payment solution that can potentially reshape the commercial landscape by enabling a crypto-based payment platform to connect with their customers and clients.

Romero has also noted that many of Farcaster‚Äôs users and developers ‚Äúare building on the OP Stack across OP Mainnet, Base & Zora.‚Äù Once the cursory steps for the migration are done, the next step will be the enabling of permission-less sign-ups which will finally open up Farcaster to the broader world. This is a big step for Farcaster, especially with OP Mainnet picking up steam and the recent increase of interest in social dApps. At present, Farcaster is still on Ethereum, with a big chunk of its data stored offchain in servers. But the recent growth and developments in Ethereum‚Äôs layer 2 ecosystem have given developers a wide range of tools and options. OP Mainnet, as mentioned, is currently picking up steam with its recent ‚ÄòBedrock‚Äô update that became the first step in its goal of creating a ‚Äúsuperchain‚Äù. The update paved the way for higher transaction throughput but with lower gas fees. This migration is considered strategic, especially given how Ethereum L2s have been rapidly evolving and are now processing nearly five times as many transactions per second (TPS) as the primary Ethereum network. Projects that operate in the Ethereum ecosystem, like Farcaster, are recognizing the advantages of Layer 2 solutions and are subsequently shifting their focus. Farcaster's migration move is indicative of a broader trend in the world of Web3, where platforms are seeking to leverage the enhanced transaction throughput and reduced fees of Layer 2 and 3 solutions. For instance, Lens, another decentralized social media protocol developed by Aave, operates on a specialized Layer 3 appchain. With layer 2 protocols optimizing their transaction throughputs, the potential for decentralized social apps like Farcaster could be endless, especially with OP Mainnet‚Äôs collaborative vision as manifested in its goal of a superchain.

16511089,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548771,1692928857,Ethereum Records Massive Whale Activity Amidst ETH Price Drop: Santiment,"Over the last week, Ethereum (ETH) has seen its price take a slight hit following the general market crash due¬†to reports of a massive Bitcoin sell-off. According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH is down by 5.01% in the last seven days, bringing its total price loss in the previous month to 10.80%. Albeit, despite Ethereum‚Äôs negative performance, the on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, has noted some positive developments in terms of whale activity. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why This Crypto Expert Believes Ethereum Is The ‚ÄòBiggest Block‚Äô Against Bitcoin Adoption Ethereum Experiences Highest Whale Activity In 4 Months On Thursday, August 24, Santiment posted a report on X (formerly Twitter) stating that Ethereum has recorded its largest level of whale transactions in the last 16 weeks. According to the blockchain intelligence firm, there has been a notable increase in transactions by addresses with large ETH holdings following the token‚Äôs fall beneath the 1,650 price mark last week. üê≥ #Ethereum‚Äòs network has picked up in large address activity during this drop below $1,650 and its highly volatile price conditions. The amount of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 $ETH has risen back up to 355K, and $100K+ transactions have surged. https://t.co/X137U93ZYu pic.twitter.com/J9lyMoeBmf ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 24, 2023 Sentiment reported that Ethereum experienced 23,073 ETH whale transactions in the past week, marking the network‚Äôs highest since May 4. In addition, the report also stated that the number of wallets with 10-10,000 ETH had surged by 1,788 since the start of June, returning this metric to the previous high of 355,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could See ‚ÄúLiftoff‚Äù if It‚Äôs Able to Clear One Crucial Level Could The ETH Market Experience A Boost Soon? Based on Santiment‚Äôs report, it can be inferred that the decline in ETH‚Äôs price has led to a buying spree by large investors anticipating a price surge, thus taking advantage of the current market dip. Providing more insight into this trend, Lookonchain, another market intelligence firm, has also reported on the ongoing accumulation of ETH. Via an X post on Thursday, Lookonchain stated that four whales have collectively purchased 56,100 ETH, valued at $94 million, in the last seven days. Following such heavy investments, it appears that ETH major investors are banking on the prominent altcoin to begin a market rebound soon. However, data from Coincodex states that general market sentiments around ETH remain bearish. At the same time, the Fear & Greed Index is set at 41, indicating that many other investors are still skeptical about the token‚Äôs potential gains. ETH is trading at $1,652.06 at the time of writing, with a 1.861% loss on the last day. In tandem, the token‚Äôs trading volume is also down by 31.07%, valued at $5.67 billion. Notwithstanding, with a market cap value of $198.36 billion, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency.

16508864,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548773,1692925202,"CZ Breaks Silence, Refutes Binance‚Äôs Bitcoin Dumping Allegations To Safeguard BNB","In response to mounting speculation and accusations circulating within the crypto community, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has addressed allegations of a significant sell-off of Bitcoin (BTC) by Binance. These allegations have been linked to a 7% BTC price drop. CZ took to Twitter to respond, reposting a thread by a user named ZkHopium, who provided a detailed analysis debunking the claims and highlighting the fundamental basis of the situation. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Tracker Unveils SHIB Association, What Is It About? CZ Debunks Allegations Of Bitcoin Dumping The thread by ZkHopium sheds light on the events surrounding the Binance Coin (BNB) liquidation on Venus Protocol. It explains that the exploit occurred on October 6th, 2022, on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), creating 2 million BNB. Of this amount, 900,000 BNB were deposited on Venus Protocol to borrow approximately $150 million worth of USDT and USDC. In response, the BNB chain burned more than 2 million BNB, equivalent to around $550 million at the time, effectively removing these tokens from circulation. To facilitate the liquidation process, Venus Protocol passed a governance proposal, designating BNB Chain as the sole liquidator for the loan. BNB Chain then funded the liquidator‚Äôs wallet with 30 million BUSD in December 2022, an additional 30 million USDT in June 2023, and another 30 million USDT on August 21, 2023. The liquidation mechanism of Venus Protocol involves a collateral factor or liquidation threshold. When triggered, liquidators can gradually liquidate up to 50% of the collateral, receiving an additional 10% worth of liquidated collateral as fees. ZkHopium‚Äôs analysis highlights several significant factors that make this case unique. Firstly, only one liquidator is not incentivized to engage in market dumping. Secondly, the liquidations are performed manually, without the involvement of bots front-running the process. Lastly, given the substantial loan size, the liquidation tranches are expected to be much lower than the 50% threshold. Addressing the allegations, CZ expressed his appreciation for the detailed research presented by ZkHopium and emphasized the ‚Äúinsignificance‚Äù of a $30 million liquidation‚Äôs impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. CZ stated that Binance does not issue BTC and that most rewards are given in BNB. He highlighted that the alleged fear of a significant BTC price impact is unfounded, as $30 million represents less than 0.001% of BTC‚Äôs daily trading volume. At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $217, as the chart above indicates. However, it has experienced a marginal decline of 0.2% over the past 24 hours. BTC Hovers Around $26,000 Amid Minor Dip The largest cryptocurrency in the market by market cap, Bitcoin, currently valued at $26,000, has remained relatively stagnant, experiencing a decline of 2.4% after briefly touching the $26,700 mark. Despite the current low levels of volatility, Keith Alan, co-founder of the research and analysis firm Material Indicators, has noted the following regarding the market situation: Economic reports released this morning did not significantly impact volatility; however, they will contribute to the narrative influenced by Jerome Powell‚Äôs upcoming speech at Jackson Hole on Friday. As anticipation builds for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments at the Jackson Hole Symposium, the Bitcoin market is beginning to show signs of increased activity. Keith Alan suggests that the economic reports, although not immediately affecting volatility, will shape Powell‚Äôs narrative during his speech. Related Reading: Algorand Stuck At Bearish Price Level ‚Äì Can Bulls Reverse Path? This anticipation will likely lead to heightened volatility as the BTC market approaches the weekend.
