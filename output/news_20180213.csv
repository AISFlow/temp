42401074,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgTL,1518562822,What to Expect When Congress Talks Blockchain,"Two subcommittees in the U.S. House of Representatives will discuss potential applications for blockchain in government during a hearing on Wednesday.  “Beyond Bitcoin: Emerging Applications for Blockchain Technology,” scheduled to begin on Wednesday at 10 a.m. EST, is likely to constitute a broad overview of the technology – a key first step ahead of any possible action that focuses on the tech. Panelists will explain the basics of the technology before discussing how it can be used, said Brandon VerVelde, a spokesperson for the committee.  These panelists will come from both the private sector and from government agencies with experience in the field, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  Aides to the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which will oversee the hearing, indicated that the effort is exploratory in nature, and will not necessarily lead to any legislative or regulatory action.  Indeed, VerVelde said that ""any potential future committee action on the subject will be informed by the hearing.""  Likewise, the committee is not yet sure which specific government bodies might take advantage of blockchain technology, he said. That being said, lawmakers on the committee shared some ideas on where they see blockchain applied in the federal government.  Congresspeople strike positive notes  And while it remains to be seen what kinds of questions the subcommittee members will pose, members of the House, in comments to CoinDesk, expressed an open mind to some of the possible applications that will be discussed.  Congressman Clay Higgins (R-LA) noted that blockchain can be applied to digital information sharing, saying ""it's important that we continuously search for the most innovative processes to secure digital transactions and ensure data integrity.""  The hearing will look into those potential applications, he continued.  Similarly, Congressman Roger Marshall (R-KS) pointed out blockchain's potential cybersecurity uses, highlighting data privacy uses, particularly in the area of healthcare.  Congressman Randy Hultgren (R-IL) echoed those sentiments, saying that he was looking forward to hearing about best practices.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Blockchain has a number of applications that can increase security, better serve consumers and bring efficiency to government processes.""  Panelists will likely share the experiences had at their respective companies, including Walmart vice president of food safety Frank Yiannas, who will discuss the company's past efforts to track food items via blockchain-based systems.  Similarly, a representative from Walmart's partner in that venture, IBM – vice president of blockchain Jerry Cuomo – will explain what the tech giant has learned while building its own blockchain platforms.  ""We imagine that there will be many new applications for blockchain technology as businesses experiment and perfect new uses, many of which could also be used by the federal government, from protecting Americans’ sensitive information on government systems to supply chain risk management,"" VerVelde told CoinDesk.

42401066,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgNR,1518557408,Arizona Law Would Define When ICOs Are Securities,"The number of blockchain bills before the Arizona state legislature is growing, public records show.  Arizona state representative Jeff Weninger introduced two measures focused on the tech last week, including one that would begin laying down ar regulatory framework for initial coin offerings (ICOs) conducted in the state.  Two new bills introduced by the representative include ""virtual coin,"" ""blockchain"" and ""virtual coin offering"" as new terms to be included in the Arizona government’s list of definitions, particularly as they relate to securities and crowdfunding.  Notably, the first bill defines ""virtual coin"" as ""a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and that functions as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value.""  The bill goes on to define a ""virtual coin offering"" as any token sale where the token is treated as a security as defined by existing Arizona law. However, tokens which are not marketed as investments and which the purchaser can utilize or redeem within 90 days, according to the bill, would sit outside that definition.  The second bill  amends the Arizona Revised Statutes to account for data that is written and stored on a blockchain. In a way, the bill bears a relation to a past Weninger bill which legally recognized blockchain signatures and smart contracts, a measure that was signed into law last year.  Stepping back, the state government has made several steps in recent weeks to broaden the adoption of the tech within the state. Earlier this month, the State Senate completed work on a bill which would allow the government to collect taxes in bitcoin.

In order to provide free content, Salon primarily depended on advertisements to run its servers, the company explained in a blog post published on Monday. However, digital ads are insufficient to fully pay for most media outlets – the site noted that ad revenue fell $40 billion from 1999 to 2010 – and Salon, in particular, has decided to offer users a new option to pay for content.  Salon will profit by selling ""a small percentage of [users'] spare processing power to contribute to the advancement of technological discovery, evolution and innovation,"" the company explained. While they don't come out and say it directly, the site, according to The Verge, is using the open-source CoinHive software in order to mine the cryptocurrency monero.  ""The demand for computing power across many different industries and applications is potentially very high.

42401070,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgQO,1518548452,Telegram Founder: Crypto Mining Malware Attack Isn't Due to App Flaw,"Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab reported today that a vulnerability in Telegram's messaging app had been exploited to turn desktop computers into unwitting crypto-miners – a claim that the firm's founder is pushing back against.  The cyberattacks were uncovered by Kaspersky Lab, a global cybersecurity software provider, who reports that the covert mining operations have been underway since March of 2017. Kaspersky said that the attacks were possible because of a zero-day vulnerability.  ""We have found several scenarios of this zero-day exploitation that, besides general malware and spyware, was used to deliver mining software – such infections have become a global trend that we have seen throughout the last year,"" Alexey Firsh, a Kaspersky Lab analyst said in a statement today.  Yet Pavel Durov, who founded the popular messaging app, has taken to his own Telegram channel in order to downplay the report.  ""As always, reports from antivirus companies must be taken with a grain of salt, as they tend to exaggerate the severity of their findings to get publicity in mass media,"" he said. He went on to claim that what Kaspersky had uncovered was not a ""real vulnerability on Telegram Desktop,"" and that cybercriminals could not access users' computers without them first opening a malicious file.  ""So don't worry,"" he told the channel, ""Unless you opened a malicius [sic] file, you have always been safe.""  Cybercriminals reportedly used the malware to garner monero, zcash and fantomcoin, among other cryptocurrencies, per Kaspersky's report. The firm says evidence indicates that the malware has Russian origins, and notes that, in some cases, it is used as a backdoor through which hackers can silently control a computer. In the course of analyzing malicious servers, Kaspersky also said it found ""archives containing a Telegram local cache that had been stolen from victims.""  As the profits associated with mining have increased, mining malware has become more common.  CoinDesk reported yesterday that more than 4,000 U.K websites, including government sites, had been infected with mining malware, prompting the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office to take down its website. Likewise, in another significant case last month, it was discovered that Google's DoubleClick ad services were hijacked to distribute mining malware on prominent sites like YouTube.

42401062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgKU,1518542440,BitConnect Again? DavorCoin Price Dives After Lending Site Shutdown,"A cryptocurrency investment scheme that last month drew the ire of state regulators in Texas announced last week that it was closing its lending platform.  DavorCoin, as previously reported, was likened to BitConnect by the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) given that both involved the use of a lending site and had promised to pay steady interest income to those who invested. On Feb. 2, the board issued a cease-and-desist to Davorcoin, alleging at the time that those behind the scheme had intentionally hidden information from would-be stakeholders.  ""The emergency order found that DavorCoin is telling investors they can earn lucrative profits by investing in a lending program based on a new cryptocurrency known as davorcoin. Investors allegedly purchase davorcoin and then lend it to DavorCoin,"" TSSB wrote at the time.  Less than a week later, those behind DavorCoin announced that they were closing the associated lending platform because of a plunge in the value of the scheme's DAV token.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price nearly hit $180 just over a month ago, but by the day of the announcement, the value of DAV was around $3. Press-time data indicates that DAV's value has plunged even further, coming in at roughly $0.03 at press time.  The team wrote in the Feb. 7 blog post:  ""There is no doubt for us that the DAV value has been negatively affected by our lending program because the crypto-environment has dramatically changed recently. We did everything possible to protect our platform and our amazing community. However, DAV price still went from $180 to $0.5 in 20 days. As a result, we have decided to change our strategy and to end our lending program that has become the only reason why DavorCoin is decreasing in value.""  The blog goes on to state that those behind DavorCoin will seek to resuscitate its price through ""transforming DAV into a strong cryptocurrency."" Yet since that date, there have been no official posts on its Medium and Twitter accounts.

As part of the ECB's #AskDraghi video series, the former Italian central banker said he has seen many users on Twitter ask if the ECB would regulate or even ban bitcoin.  In response, he said:  ""It's not the ECB's responsibility to do that.""  Draghi also discussed whether he would recommend purchasing bitcoin in response to a question from a college student.  He indicated he would think ""carefully"" about buying bitcoin, explaining that he does not see it as a currency. While the euro's value is stable, he added, ""the value of a bitcoin oscillates wildly.""  Also hitting out at cryptocurrencies' decentralized nature, he continued: ""The euro is backed by the European Central Bank. The dollar is backed by the Federal Reserve. Currencies are backed by the central banks or their governments. Nobody backs bitcoin.""  This is not the first time Draghi has made such comments on cryptocurrencies and their regulation. The ECB chief said in September 2017, that the ECB itself has ""no power"" to regulate bitcoin, and, in November, he said that cryptocurrencies have a limited impact on the world economy.  At the same time as it published the video, the ECB released an explainer on bitcoin that goes into deeper detail on how the institution sees bitcoin.  In addition to echoing Draghi's comments on price volatility and the lack of institutional or government backing, the explainer notes that bitcoin is not accepted widely and ""transactions are slow and expensive.""

The startup's founder, Marco Abele, who previously served as chief digital officer for Credit Suisse, told CoinDesk that TEND is collaborating with Porsche Zentrum Zug in order to offer a 1956 Porsche Speedster 356A as the app's first tokenized car.  The luxury car will be split up into token-based shares to be registered and traded on TEND's automated marketplace. The platform hosts share-owners and a variety of service partners, while its use of a blockchain also provides a transparent account of assets' histories.  Abele said that through fragmenting ownership, the TEND app fulfills the ""modern generation's"" desire for luxury assets, while simultaneously expanding access to them.  ""It's tokenizing luxuries and very precious assets to bring them into co-ownership and onto the blockchain, and then our unique proposition is to give a full life experience on top of this investment and to enable that experience via service partners,"" he said, adding:  ""So what we want to enable people to do is not only to own a beautiful object, but to then really touch and feel it.""  Dealer role  Porsche Zentrum Zug will facilitate the crossover from asset to experience with the tokenized Speedster.  The dealership will handle everything from handing over the keys to share-owners to the maintenance of the car, the management of which is executed using smart contracts.  ""We try to be a physical platform for an app, or a community around an app that's otherwise going to be rather anonymous,"" Yves Becker-Fahr, Porsche Zentrum Zug's general manager, told CoinDesk.  Becker-Fahr explained that TEND's emphasis on experience is also one reason that it initiated a relationship with an individual dealership and not the whole Porsche corporation.  ""What the people at TEND wanted was a very personalized and individualized link to us here at the Porsche center,"" he said. ""It's really important that we start with a particular car, a particular Porsche center that stands behind it and takes care of it and knows the history and specifics of the car.""  More assets to come?  TEND and Porsche Zentrum Zug both said they are eyeing plans to bring more cars onto the platform, and TEND is in talks with a number of other brands with the hope of tokenizing a wide variety of assets, ranging from jewelry to art and photography.  Likewise, though this is Porsche Zentrum Zug's first engagement with the technology, its proximity to industry hotspot Zug means that it has many customers linked to the technology.  According to Becker-Fahr, the dealership is also open to the other potential applications of blockchain.  ""We have started thinking about it, yes, whether one day we might have to offer to our clients to pay with cryptocurrency. But it would be too soon to say that we're on the cryptocurrency train,"" Becker-Fahr told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This is the start for us, working together with TEND.

42401075,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgUK,1518530403,South Korea Mulls BitLicense-Style Rules for Crypto Exchanges,"South Korea is reportedly considering a technology-specific licensing scheme as part of it proposed regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges.  According to BusinessKorea, a government official involved with a virtual currency task force said Sunday that such rules, which bear a similarity to New York's controversial ""BitLicense,"" introduced in 2015, could be enacted or at least debated.  The source said:  ""We are positively considering the adoption of an exchange approval system as the additional regulation on cryptocurrencies. We are most likely benchmark the model of the State of New York that gives a selective permission.""  The news appears to mark a softening of the country's stance after some regulators had proposed that exchange-based crypto trading be shut down completely, as it is in China. South Korea has also recently moved to ban the use of anonymous virtual accounts for trading in the country, with real-name accounts being compulsory from the end of January.  BusinessKorea cited the government source as saying that another option on the table would be to impose taxes instead of creating additional regulations  ""We will hold a meeting to respond to national petition related to digital currencies this month but we are highly likely to make up for the defects of existing measures only at the meeting,"" the source said  The news source added that government is likely to make a final decision on cryptocurrency exchanges after local elections due in June.  Launched after some delay in June 2015, the New York State Department of Financial Services' (NYDFS) regulatory framework – dubbed the ""BitLicense"" – sets out that no company or individual can offer cryptocurrency services as a custodian or exchange without first receiving a license, and they must also operate in compliance with stringent money transmitter regulations.  The high cost of attaining a license has meant that a limited number of exchanges now operate in New York, while some have left the state completely.  S.

42401081,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgWI,1518528917,'V' Recovery? ETC Posts Big Gains In Sideways Market,"The price of ETC, the native currency of the ethereum classic blockchain, is reporting double-digit gains Tuesday, a move that effectively recovers losses seen over the last two weeks.  As of writing, ETC is changing hands at $31.70 on Bitfinex, having clocked a two-week high of $32.90 earlier in the day's trading session. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 20 percent in the last 24 hours, as per data source CoinMarketCap.  Stepping back, the move effectively means ETC has come full circle, returning back to a level last seen at January's end. The broad-based sell-off in the crypto markets that began on Jan. 30 saw ETC drop 57 percent to $14.00 (Feb. 6 low), and in this context, the rise to $32.90 marks the completion of a ""V-shaped recovery.""  So far, the asset's investor community is associating the jump in prices with top forecaster Cryptonaire's decision to include ETC in the list of verified digital assets (VDA). Investors believe the move will likely generate more public interest in the cryptocurrency, resulting in a pickup in trading volumes.  That said, the technical charts also point to a bright future ahead.  ETC chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Bulls have scored another brownie point by pushing ETC's above 50-day MA.  The relative strength index (RSI) is above 50.00 (bullish territory) and rising, thus further doors are open for further gains in ETC.  The momentum studies: 5-day MA and 10-day MA are curled up in favor of the bulls.  View  ETC will likely break above $34.38 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from Jan. 14 high to Feb. 6 low) and test $40.00 levels in the short-run.  The RSI on the 4-hour chart shows overbought conditions, so a minor pullback to upward sloping 5-day MA (currently seen at $27.01) cannot be ruled out.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $21.003 (Feb. 11 low) would signal bullish invalidation.

42401065,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgIW,1518526832,"Real Estate ICOs Are Moving In, But Investors Aren't Floored","A house on a blockchain?  That's the future a number of initial coin offering (ICO) issuers envision, one in which tokenized pieces of the property could be tracked and traded via a shared database. In this way, the tokens would allow for what entrepreneurs are calling ""fractional ownership,"" or the ability for a real estate owner to split up their home and sell off equity stakes.  Not only would this allow a homeowner to sell some of the home's equity should they need extra money, but it would also allow the equity to be freely traded until, one day, the home was sold, at which point the homeowner and equity owner could both enjoy any gain in the home's value.  It's notable a trend given the excitement the concept saw among earlier blockchain startups that were building businesses around private or permissioned blockchains. But this new round of hype comes from token sellers who believe the crypto token model, in which a digital asset is sold and traded, could bring benefits to perhaps the most fixed of the fixed assets markets.  In fact, there are at least four ICO issuers right now with a real-estate component – BitRent, a way to speed up financing construction projects; Etherty, real-estate management through equity access; Caviar, a fund that tempers the volatility of crypto investments with loans to real estate projects; and Trust, a way to tokenize equity in real estate and other real-world assets.  No doubt, there will be more.  Compound VC's Joshua Nussbaum expressed measured excitement that was representative of responses from crypto investors CoinDesk surveyed.  Nussbaum said:  ""If done responsibly and legally, I do think these types of projects can advance the industry by offering previously inaccessible liquidity and investment opportunity to individuals.""  And Nussbaum isn't alone in his thinking.  ""We will undoubtedly see tokenized real estate securities in 2018,"" Prof. Stephen McKeon of the University of Oregon told CoinDesk.  Yet, even with new momentum for this particular token use case and increasing interest by consumers and businesses in cryptocurrency, there are still hurdles to tokenizing real estate on a blockchain.  Liquid land  The concept of selling shares of a property is nothing new – real estate investment trusts (REITs), modelled after mutual funds, own and manage properties, allowing investors to buy in for small amounts.  But with a public blockchain, these practices become more efficient and cheaper, according to the entrepreneurs and interested investors in this space.  ""Using blockchains, you can securitize any asset for 1/100th the cost,"" Multicoin Capital partner Kyle Samani told CoinDesk.  And not only that, but tokenizing home equity could also make the space, which has been attractive to investors but difficult to trade, more liquid.  Scott Hoch, an analyst at Apex Token Fund explained, ""A new level of liquidity is created when tokenizing traditional assets. This liquidity makes it faster and easier to rebalance a portfolio as the market changes.""  Coming out of 2017 with its dramatic market gains, there are probably many crypto investors, surprised by how much they've gained, who would like to lock some of it into more stable assets, but Hoch believes they'll still want the investment instrument to be tokens.  Just like mobile-first internet users are less eager to use laptops, Hoch argues that crypto-first investors will prefer tokenized equities over selling to fiat and buying into traditionally structured funds, never mind actually buying a property outright.  ""Tokenizing assets that are uncorrelated with the cryptocurrency market gives these investors a way to achieve diversification more quickly and without having to leave the blockchain ecosystem,"" he said.  And traditional investors may well follow.  ""Think about what goes into paying dividends: identify all shareholders, have a bunch of bank wires in the background and file a bunch of paperwork. This can all be done in a smart contract,"" Multicoin Capital partner Tushar Jain explained, adding:  ""Tokenizing securities is a massive infrastructure upgrade for the global financial system.""  Legal hurdles  Still, there are serious hurdles to crypto real estate's success.  For one, the laws around real estate are highly complex. In the U.S., each state handles record-keeping differently, said Howard Rubin, a real estate lawyer with Goetz & Fitzpatrick who's represented Fortune 500 companies. And in the developing world, tracking titles for land ownership is hardly handled at all, as CoinDesk has previously reported.  So, Rubin doesn't expect real estate to integrate well with the token economy anytime soon, although, that isn't to say it never will.  ""There has to be a lot shaken out in the blockchain world,"" he told CoinDesk.  On top of that, some believe bringing crypto to real estate could introduce some of the magical thinking that drove the housing market, and seeing similar exuberance here could pique the interest of lawmakers and regulators.  Nussbaum acknowledged the danger, saying, ""The risk is that irrational exuberance sets in and those investors don't fully understand what they're buying.""  Arianna Simpson, the founder and managing director of Autonomous Partners, echoed that sentiment, saying, ""I don't believe most members of the public currently have a strong enough grasp of how this works to fully understand or trust the system.""  As such, while the crypto investors CoinDesk spoke to found the concept intriguing on a thought exercise level, none of them had actually invested in a crypto token focused on disrupting the real estate industry.  Summarizing the concerns, Professor McKeon said:  ""Widespread adoption as a financing vehicle is further off, partly because [crypto tokens] are untested in court and partly because it takes time to shift cultural norms.""  Tokens at the town hall  Yet, there are signs that the right people are taking an interest in crypto tokens for real estate.  According to John Mirkovic, a deputy recorder at the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, which oversees properties in and around Chicago, his office believes private parties can transact using a blockchain today.  ""That being said, we are already getting to work in Illinois on statutory changes that will pave the way for a system where the transfer of a token is both the conveyance and the public record in one event,"" he said.  Not only is Cook County interested in updating the law to accommodate crypto, but a handful of locations – a city in Vermont being the most recent – around the world have launched pilots to determine whether putting land titles on a blockchain would offer efficiencies and other benefits.  While Mirkovic suggested that investors look to the established REIT system before jumping into crypto, he said, ""Experimentation with new ways of doing business, especially in the spirit of inclusiveness and transparency, is always a good thing.""  Be that as it may, Rubin said these kinds of efforts for smoothing the path for crypto real estate will take a while.  He added, though:  ""I'm not saying in five or 10 years it won't happen.""

Fake ICO White Papers Are Drawing Scrutiny,"Months after China's clampdown on initial coin offerings (ICOs), professional copywriters are still offering white paper services that may include fabricating information, reports suggest.  The People's Bank of China notably banned domestic ICOs in September 2017, yet searches using key words such as ""ICO,"" ""blockchain"" and ""whitepaper"" result in dozens of online stores on Alibaba's Taobao platform in China that provide ICO white paper copywriting, design and fundraising consultancy services.  According to an article published today by China's Beijing News, some of these services may have been involved in abetting questionable ICO projects by agreeing to falsify information in their white papers.  Undercover reporting conducted by the state-own news outlet with one store's customer service reveals that while ICO white paper copywriting costs $600, and also caters to those wanting to make false claims about a project's credibility.

Further, bitcoin also clocked a six-day high of $9,070.64 on Feb. 10, but quickly fell back below the key psychological level of $9,000.  Thus, the area around the $9,000 mark has been established as a point of stiff resistance, as is being discussed by the investor community.  As of writing, bitcoin's global average price on the BPI is at $8,390. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by at least 40 percent from the recent lows below $6,000. However, the bulls are still not out of the woods and need to move prices quickly above $9,000 or the bears could once more exert their influence.  That said, exhaustion around $9,000 has neutralized the immediate outlook and bearish revival is seen only below Feb. 2 low of $7,845.  Daily chart: Stuck in a falling channel  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC is trapped inside a falling channel marked by trendlines representing lower highs and lower lows.  Both the bullish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA crossover and an upside break of the descending trendline on the RSI favor the upside.  Still, the cryptocurrency faced rejection at the descending trendline/falling channel hurdle earlier today and is now changing hands below $8,500.  Daily chart: Long-term momentum studies turn bearish  As discussed yesterday, the weekly chart is biased towards the bears. Thus, the bulls need progress soon,via a quick move above $9,000.  View  A close above $9,000 would confirm an upside break of the falling channel, meaning bearish-to-bullish trend change. It would also add credence to the bullish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and open doors for a move higher to $11,500–$11,800.  However, gains above $10,000 could be short-lived as detailed in the previous post.  On the other hand, a close below $7,851 (Nov. 2 low) would signal the corrective rally from Feb. 6 low has ended and would encourage stronger sell-off to $5,000.

42401079,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgXH,1518516051,Chinese Boy Band Ensnared By Fan ICO Controversy,"Self-proclaimed fans of a popular Chinese boy band have built an initial coin offering (ICO) around their idols, though controversy has emerged over the project's legitimacy.  At the heart of the project is a well-known pop band named The Fighting Boys (or TFBoys), formed by three teens – Karry Wang, Roy Wang, and Jackson Yi – in 2013. Notably, last year, Roy Wang was featured by Time as one of the 30 most influential teens of 2017.  Amid the band's overwhelming popularity in China, a group of fans have just launched an ICO to raise funds, supposedly aimed to build a blockchain ecosystem around the teen trio.  The project is notable, not only because it sets out on a mission to disrupt the dynamics between celebrities and fans using blockchain technology, but also since it has launched after China officially banned ICOs in September of last year.  While the ICO organizers state on their website that the project excludes residents from China, it has yet to physically bar IP addresses from inside the country.  According to the project's website, the token – called TFBC – will eventually be used for purchasing albums and concert tickets, as well as offline meet-ups with the teen idols. Ultimately, it aims to facilitate a blockchain ecosystem around the band, and maintained by the fans themselves.  As of press time, according to information available after account registration, nearly 20,000 people have participated in the sale and at least 4.2 million TFBC have been sold for ether.  Based on a 3,000 TFBC to 1 ETH ratio, the project may have received around 1,400 ETH – worth a little over $1 million at time of writing, according to CoinDesk's Ether Price Index.  The website further disclosed that out of the total 59,993,157 TFBC being issued, 60 percent is reserved for the band, while the remainder is being issued to fans.  However, a statement from Time Fengjun Entertainment, the official management agency of TFBoys – issued soon after the project came into public's attention on Feb. 10 via its official Weibo account – has attempted to distance the pop trio form the project.  The agency stated that it has nothing to do with the ICO and alleged that the claim of token reserves held for the three boys is completely bogus. The company further claimed that the ICO organizer is using the name of TFBoys to conduct an illegal fundraising activity.  Amid the accusations, the project issued two statements on Feb. 11 to reiterate that it is self-organized by fans who have no connection to the band's management, and that it is not offering services to Chinese residents (even though it still remains accessible by Chinese residents). The project further stated that the TFBC tokens reserved for the band are being temporarily stored in an ethereum address.  They also indicate on the ICO website that the 40 percent of the total TFBC up for sale will be available for trading on an exchange platform that is yet to be launched.  The exchange, dubbed StarCoinEx, touts its speciality in listing super-star focused tokens. According to its website, it claims that cryptocurrency assets to be available in future include ones for Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, as well as several other popular celebrities in China.  At press time, the ICO project organizer had not responded to a CoinDesk email seeking comment.

42401072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgRN,1518512428,Comcast VC Arm Embarks on 'Aggressive' Blockchain Investing Plan,"Comcast Ventures isn't just investing in blockchain startups – it's investing in blockchain startups that invest in blockchain startups, with some very specific goals in mind.  The firm last month joined IBM and Boldstart Ventures in backing accelerator mState, which invests in startups building enterprise blockchain solutions. Further, Comcast Ventures revealed to CoinDesk a recent strategic investment in Blockchange Ventures, a fund that invests in enterprises that have built technology using existing centralized protocols, but that might be in for a decentralized upgrade sometime soon.  The strategy of helping sow as many blockchain seeds as possible by investing in investors is designed to not only generate returns, but to help the venture capital firm's $184 billion parent company accelerate the rate at which it learns about the technology more generally.  To that end, newly appointed managing director Gil Beyda has assembled a team of five of Comcast's most senior investors, all of who are now tasked with planning what he called an ""aggressive"" investment strategy aimed at determining how the company can benefit from the technology.  ""We call ourselves the 'blockchain crew,'"" said Beyda, who previously founded adtech startup RealMedia, which was acquired in 2007 for $650 million. The following year, he co-founded seed investing firm Genacast in partnership with Comcast.  He continued, giving CoinDesk an idea of exactly how serious the firm was about its blockchain investments:  ""I can write the $1 million dollar checks through Genecast and the $2 million to $20 million checks for multi-stages through Comcast Ventures.""    The blockchain crew        At the core of this strategy is the small group of increasingly specialized investors.  While Beyda said he is the only member of the ""crew"" to dedicate the majority of his time to blockchain, he is joined in his work by Comcast's head of funds, Amy Banse; managing director Sam Landman; principal Teddy Himler; and Morgan Polotan, who also works with Beyda at Genacast.  The team of five meets multiple times a week to discuss trends in blockchain, and to explore how those trends might impact Comcast. Yet, the firm isn't limited to making improvements to Comcast's infrastructure and products, such as its flagship cable and internet services.  ""Our mandate is first and foremost to find great investments,"" said Beyda. ""So, we're a financially driven fund, a returns-driven fund.""  As such, the first blockchain investment Beyda made was in mState, which started as an accelerator for startups building with open-source Hyperledger Fabric, before evolving into a more broadly focused enterprise software blockchain accelerator.  Similarly, Beyda said Comcast Ventures will ""let the market decide"" which blockchains best serve any number of use cases, describing the firm's investment style as ""very hands-on,"" with an interest in leading rounds and taking board seats on the companies in which they invest.  Going forward, Beyda also hinted at collaborations with other portfolio startups.  ""We'll be working closely with them, but we need to develop this expertise ourselves first before we can see how that plugs and plays with some of these other sectors and verticals,"" he said.  ICO soul-searching  One of those sectors Comcast Ventures is exploring is venture capital itself.  Indeed, the fund is now taking a closer look at how blockchain could end up making it easier for more people to invest in projects via initial coin offerings (ICOs), a funding model in which a liquid market of provably scarce assets is used to fund new businesses and projects.  ""We're not ignoring the fact that our business may change as well,"" said Beyda.  As evidenced by the increasingly blurry lines that separate traditional venture capital from blockchain-enabled fundraises, Comcast portfolio firm YouNow last year supplemented an earlier $15 million fundraise with a $24 million ethereum-based token sale.  While Comcast does not currently own any YouNow tokens, Beyda said the firm is ""warming up"" to the idea that it might one day hold tokens on its balance sheet. As a result, the blockchain crew is now helping develop a formal position to guide their future investment decisions.  But before that can happen, Beyda said investors would need to get used to the idea of holding onto the private keys that signify ownership of a token on a blockchain, as well as overcome a number of regulatory uncertainties.  Yet, if Comcast Ventures does decide to hold tokens, it could significantly change the way it operates. To that end, Beyda said he's in close communication with a group of Comcast chief experience officers (CXOs) to help ensure that blockchain evolves into a boon – and not a detriment – to the way they earn money and learn.  ""We have a close relationship with the CXO suite at Comcast,"" said Beyda. ""And they're very interested about and excited in these new opportunities, and are open to having that discussion about the evolution of our model.""  The mothership  In many ways, this strategy positions Comcast Ventures as a bridge between the world of blockchain tech and Comcast itself.  And over the past several months, ""the mothership,"" as Beyda calls his parent company, has made a number of its own plays in the blockchain space.  Among the most notable is its support for the Blockchain Insights Platform, a consortium including Disney, Cox Communication and others working to use blockchain so members can more accurately target ads to customers without sharing sensitive customer data with each other.  To show how serious the operation is, just weeks after the platform was revealed, CoinDesk reported on a patent application that Comcast had filed that could potentially help in the process, though a representative of the company said they are not currently related.  Beyda also described a notable internal project between Comcast Labs and Comcast's Xfinity Home program that could build on the data-sharing features of blockchain to further enable the internet of things (IoT).  The project was conceived as a way to privately connect devices like cameras and automated locks in 15 million homes Comcast serves with the homes served by potentially competing customers.  ""In a world where you have a blockchain public ledger where these permissions are managed, you can allow others to have access,"" said Beyda.  While there's currently no formal ties with that work and another project called MachineQ, the synergies are obvious. Last year, Comcast started to roll-out the internet of things network in 12 markets, including Boston, Detroit and Washington D.C.  In short, in the face of rising interest in the telecom industry, including from one of Comcast's biggest competitors, T-Mobile – and from upstarts who would like to put them both out of business – Beyda sees an opportunity to not only streamline internal processes, but gain a competitive advantage.  ""Comcast Ventures really has a front-row seat with a multi-hundred billion dollar company,"" Beyda told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We see all the change and the interest that is going on internally. We see where the rubber meets the road.""

42401069,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgPP,1518508856,Petition Calls for SEC to Allow for ICO Remediation,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should give past initial coin offering (ICO) organizers the chance to seek remediation in light of possible violations, according to a petition filed with the agency last month.  The petition was penned by Liquid M Capital, a broker-dealer and fintech firm acquired by Templum earlier this month. Dated January 23 and received by the agency three days later, it was signed by Liquid M CEO Vincent Molinari and Templum CEO Christopher Pallotta.  At its heart, the petition recommends that the commission ""provide an opportunity for issuers of tokens through initial coin offerings that took place prior to the promulgation of related guidance by the SEC the opportunity to remediate their illegal offerings."" Put more simply, it's calling for the SEC to provide some leeway as the agency itself ramps up its enforcement around the blockchain use case.  The letter argues:  ""Chairman Clayton recently stated that he has 'yet to see an ICO that doesn't have a sufficient number of hallmarks of a security.' This has left many token issuers in a situation where they have already issued tokens, which more than likely violate the federal securities laws, but given the lack of regulatory guidance, were unaware that they needed to either register their offering or ensure it complied with an exemption.""  Molinari and Pallotta wrote that they ""believe issuers should be given a chance to remediate their illegal offerings now that clearer guidance has been provided regarding ICOs by the SEC.""  They also recommend that any remediation should be ""accompanied by a right of recession to all purchasers of the original tokens,"" which would refund the purchasers' investments if they did not wish to proceed with the remediated token. Liquid M and Templum say such recourse would also help the SEC fulfill its obligation to protect investors and markets.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Liquid M (formerly known as Ouisa Capital) has a history of encouraging the SEC to clarify its rules around crypto.  In May of 2017, the firm petitioned the SEC to delineate rules for ICOs, while also asking the commission to create a ""regulatory sandbox"" in which fintech firms could test new products in a limited setting under supervision.  Liquid M renewed its appeal for ICO regulation in August after the SEC published its investigation into The DAO, an ethereum-based funding vehicle that collapsed in 2016. Though the SEC stated at that time that the offering and sale of cryptocurrency tokens are subject to federal securities laws, Liquid M CEO Vince Molinari called for additional action, including draft proposals of regulation and feedback from potential stakeholders.  Templum acquired Liquid M earlier this month, and the two firms were previously partners.

The meeting's agenda, released late Monday afternoon, outlines how the first two panels will focus on blockchain and its potential applications to derivatives markets, as well as the relevant regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and futures markets, respectively.  The opening panel on blockchain will feature Jennifer Peve, executive director for business development and fintech strategy at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC); Charley Cooper, managing director of distributed ledger startup R3; and Dan Busca, deputy director of the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight (DMO).  The panel, the document shows, will focus on the tech's ""potential impact on capital markets infrastructure and regulatory reporting.""  The cryptocurrency markets and regulation panel, scheduled to begin 45 minutes later, will feature Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito; Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP special counsel Gary DeWaal; trading company RGM Advisors chief executive Richard Gorelick; and DMO director Amir Zaidi.  This panel will focus on cryptocurrencies themselves, as well as futures products based on them, according to the agenda. Changes in the markets and regulations surrounding them will also be discussed.  The panels come at a time of renewed regulatory discussion in the space. A week ago, CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo testified in front of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs about the role regulations may play in future cryptocurrency markets.

42401063,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgLT,1518497119,Russian Ministry Proposes Capital Mandates for ICO Organizers,"One of Russia's government ministries has proposed a law that, if approved, would introduce a capital requirement for initial coin offering (ICO) organizers.  The proposal, which was released by Russia's Ministry of Communications and Mass Media last week, seeks to enforce a series of requirements before any ICO activity can be officially accredited within the country.  One major element of the proposal is that ICO organizers must have at least 100 million rubles (or $1.73 million) worth of authorized capital and must be registered as a legal entity within the Russian territory, with bank accounts from licensed financial institutions. The proposal has been published as part of a public comment period which stretches from Feb. 9 to Feb. 23.  The resolution, if enacted, will also give the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media the right to accredit ICOs within 30 days after a project submits an application.  In addition, through the proposed regulation, the ministry wants to mandate inspections every three years in order to examine whether accredited projects are still in compliance with the requirements.  The new draft marks the latest step in the development of regulations around cryptocurrency and initial coin offerings in particular within Russia. It comes a month the Russian Finance Ministry submitted a proposal on Jan. 26 to regulate cryptocurrency investment as well as ICOs.  The Finance Ministry said at the time that these regulatory efforts are within the context of orders issued by Russian president Vladimir Putin last year.

42401052,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLexs,1518490504,Why It's Time Regulators Put Crypto on Notice,"David Silver is the founder of Silver Miller, a plaintiffs' law firm that brings cases against cryptocurrency exchanges and investment offerings. The views expressed here are his alone. You can reach him at DSilver@SilverMillerLaw.com.    I’m late, I’m late!      For a very important date!      No time to say “Hello.”      Goodbye!      I’m late! I’m late! I’m late!    When the White Rabbit was late in ""Alice in Wonderland,"" he rapidly scampered off to meet his appointed duties. In the wild and rapidly-evolving Wonderland of cryptocurrency, government regulators are quickly ramping up their efforts in fulfillment of their appointed duties, though the current regulatory framework still limits them in that regard.  That's the clear takeaway from last week's Senate Banking Committee hearing on cryptocurrency, where the heads of the two main financial market regulators testified.  If they weren’t already, cryptocurrency exchanges and promoters of initial coin offerings (ICOs) are now on notice: people who invest with them are entitled to be treated like all other investors in the U.S.  Exchanges that want to proclaim they are legitimate and that they follow all U.S. laws need to act like it when something goes wrong. ICO promoters who want to sell a product and raise funds by crowdsourcing crypto need to disclose all information accurately, transparently, and deliver on the product they sold.  If they don’t, they need to face the consequences of their actions.  I agree wholeheartedly with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton’s public statements over the past few months criticizing ICOs and the people behind those fundraisers.  ""I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security,"" he told the Senate committee. It is almost as if he read my CoinDesk 2017 Year In Review article ""I Love Bitcoin. That’s Why I Sue Exchanges,"" wherein I said there has yet to be an ICO that did not perform that was not a security.  Clayton went on to condemn the promoters, attorneys and other related professionals who flout federal securities laws by putting the form of their offerings over the substance of what they really are: investments, stating, ""We should regulate [ICOs] like we regulate securities offerings. End of story.""  ICO companies and their legal counsel should be scrambling over their past tone-deaf responses to investors. These entities need to take responsibility and not blame the people who sent them money. Legal loopholes are not designed to punish innocent people who were deceived.  Listening to the hearing testimony, it is also clear that squarely within the regulators' crosshairs – and an area in which enforcement actions are on the near horizon – are cryptocurrency exchanges.  ""When you have an unregulated exchange, the ability to manipulate the prices goes up significantly,"" Clayton told the lawmakers.  Those comments were echoed by his counterpart at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Christopher Giancarlo, who told the committee:  ""Any proposed federal regulation of virtual currency platforms should be carefully tailored to the risks posed by relevant trading activity and enhancing efforts to prosecute fraud and manipulation.”  Market manipulation  Because each exchange makes its own independent and unregulated market for the cryptocurrency traded on its platform, the threat of market manipulation constantly hovers over its activities. Account holders at the exchange have no protections against the exchange suddenly slashing a cryptocurrency’s value without notice.  Even today certain exchanges admit their systems don’t work, but claim that doesn’t matter. While lawyers for these exchanges claim it’s within the legal rights of these exchanges to do so, those lawyers should know that legally and ethically they’re wrong.  Just as certain law firms believed in 2015 and 2016 that there was such a thing as a pre-functional utility token, almost all lawyers and regulators believe that not to be true today. What’s changed? My firm and others started filing lawsuits.  Similarly, most crypto investors are familiar with ""flash crashes"" and oversized liquidations that have caused crypto values to plummet on individual exchanges while those same cryptocurrency values remained unaffected on other exchanges at the same time.  In instances such as those, exchanges have disavowed responsibility for any possible market manipulation and simply shrugged off the incidents as ""part of the game"" while account-holders suffered devastating losses with little to no recourse.  The exchanges would like that to be the end of the story. However, an exchange that permits trading – especially leveraged transactions – has real responsibilities to its account holders and should be held accountable when it allows or causes massive amounts of value disappear in an instant on the exchange while no such impact is felt elsewhere.  The SEC and CFTC are clearly moving in that direction, though it is entirely unclear when they might reach their destination.  The overseers are rapidly making their way to fulfill their appointed duties in the cryptocurrency Wonderland, even if – like the White Rabbit – they arrive a little bit late. Better late than never, I say.
