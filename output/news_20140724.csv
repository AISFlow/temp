42425924,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6dh,1406239365,Barry Silbert Resigns SecondMarket CEO Position,"Noted bitcoin investor Barry Silbert has resigned from his position as CEO of SecondMarket, the New York-based illiquid assets marketplace he founded in 2004 and that in 2013 made a $2m investment in the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), a private trust of which Silbert remains CEO.  In a company blog post, Silbert stated that he is confident that SecondMarket has a bright future continuing its current successful business model, but that the decision is meant to allow him the freedom to focus his full energies on bitcoin.  Silbert said:  ""I have chosen to move on from day-to-day management of the private company/fund business so that I can focus 100% of my energy on our digital currency business. My passion for bitcoin is no secret and I feel it is the right time to make this transition.""  Silbert added that the move will help formally separate SecondMarket from BIT, a decision he first announced earlier this year when he indicated that BIT would seek to build a regulated, New York-based bitcoin exchange.  The move will find Bill Siegel taking over day-to-day leadership of SecondMarket as the company's interim CEO.  In addition to serving as the head of both companies, Silbert is also an active VC, investing in more than 30 bitcoin companies through Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, a fund that most recently invested in Mexico-based digital currency company Volabit.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/24/barry-silbert-resigns-secondmarket-ceo-position,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/853d8474af41284b10b68e85bf7f22a6735c0ce1-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425922,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Zh,1406238197,High-Performance PC Maker Alienware Adds Bitcoin Payments,"Gaming computer specialist Alienware has announced that it is now accepting bitcoin payments.  The company, a subsidiary of Dell, Inc., announced the move on its official Twitter account today. In addition to the bitcoin integration, Alienware is offering a promotional discount worth up to $150 on orders purchased with bitcoin.  The decision by Alienware to take digital currency represents yet another high-profile bitcoin integration by a technology company. Alienware specializes in high-performance gaming hardware, including desktops and laptops. Originally founded in 1996, Dell later purchased Alienware in 2006.  Despite the ownership, Alienware functions with relative autonomy and focuses on a more narrow market segment.  Owing to its owner-company’s adoption of bitcoin, it makes sense that the popular gaming computer maker would tap the digital currency for payments of its own.  As the company said on Twitter:    Alienware now accepts Bitcoin! For a limited time, get up to $150 off when using this payment method! http://t.co/seXdeeC0wC      — Alienware (@Alienware) July 24, 2014      Bitcoin's merchant ranks swell  As with Dell, California-based bitcoin payments company Coinbase acts as Alienware's processing partner.  Earlier this month, Dell became the largest company to date to accept digital currency payments. Like Alienware, Dell is aiming to give its new integration a boost with a 10% discount on bitcoin payments.  At the time, Dell told CoinDesk that bitcoin integration is part of the company’s commitment to responding to consumer demands. Dell sees digital currency adoption as a means of providing additional avenues to do so, saying:  “The first thing to provide a payment method for our business and bitcoin is a great example of how we can show some innovation. We’re always going to be looking for new, innovative ways to ensure we’re driving the right experience.”  For more on Dell's decision to accept bitcoin, read our most recent interview with the company.

Though it was perhaps the major announcements by Blockchain, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and OKCoin, as well as discussion of New York's new bitcoin regulation, that reverberated most widely online, the conference itself was focused on engendering community spirit.  The array of panels and booths showcased the wide variety of businesses not only serving the space, but sharing ideas in an open and friendly setting. Further, the addition of companies such as Germany's BitXatm and China's Huobi and OKCoin ensured that new voices were able to add to the ongoing dialogue in the US.  View the gallery below:  Whether it was PayPal and Blockchain coming to the stage for a discussion on bitcoin's future, or bitcoin wallet provider Pheeva and block-chain API maker Chain holding an impromptu photo session, the event succeeded at showcasing the strong sense of unity and community spirit that still pervades the budding industry, perhaps owing to bitcoin's open-source roots.  As organiser Moe Levin quipped at the show, ""It's hard to get people that are so interested in the future of technology in the same room to speak.""  However, as Levin proved with his event, once together, there's no limit to the kinds of conversations that can be generated. He added:  ""We did an hour-and-a-half on bitcoin 2.0 and it was amazing. That was just throwing things together, matching people who were already here at the conference. This environment is so busy and fast-paced, so we need to be able to move things around.""  Organisers are now working on a follow-up conference to be held this January, with a website for the event reportedly coming online soon.

42425931,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6nh,1406232146,Bitcoin Price Drops Below $600 After Relative Stability,"The last two months have seen no shortage of positive bitcoin news.  DISH  became the latest big retailer to accept bitcoin in June, only to be eclipsed six weeks later by Dell. Then, there was the successful US Marshals auction of roughly 30,000 BTC, which proved bitcoin's fungibility in the eyes of the US government.  With all that good news, bitcoin's price must be rocketing again, right? Hardly. In fact, price volatility has been flat in the last month, making it the most torpid period this year, according to the Coinometrics volatility index.  One exchange operator I spoke to was as mystified as the rest of us. The last two month's newsflow should have goosed the price, but it barely budged.  ""In any other time, in any part of 2013, and even before that, an event like Dell [taking bitcoin], would have shot the price up by 20-50%,"" said Mark Lamb, chief executive of London-based exchange Coinfloor, which has been growing its daily trading volume of about 150 BTC since it launched in March.  In fact, the value of a bitcoin hadn't closed below $600 over the last 30 days, according to the CoinDesk BPI, except for a blip today, which saw it dive briefly to a low of $591.  Bitcoin price declines  At press time, the price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index had lost its long-time stability, dropping roughly 4% since the day's open to sit at $595.73. This figure was up from the day's low of $591.46, but down measurably from its high of $618.42, figures that baffled traders and reddit readers alike.  The day's low was observed at 13:35 UTC and was followed by a sharp recovery, but it wasn't enough to undo the mysterious and sudden decline.  Prices on the CoinDesk CNY Bitcoin Price Index followed a similar trajectory, falling from an open of ¥3,832.17 to ¥3,692.45 at press time, but for once, even China wasn't to blame for falling bitcoin prices.  With no clear news to blame for either the stability or the decline, many are wondering where to turn for answers.  The trough of disillusionment  Maybe bitcoin's price needs more than good news.  After all, people need time to figure out world-changing, disruptive technologies like bitcoin. Positive newsflow in the interim isn't going to help the world adapt to our bitcoin future, no matter how many computers Dell sells.  That's what Joe Lee, a trader and founder of bitcoin derivatives exchange BTC.sx, thinks is going on.  ""The price is stagnant because we're going through a trough of technology adoption for crypto currencies, where the world is working how to take it,"" he said, citing technology research firm Gartner's theory of a technology adoption 'hype cycle'.  Gartner's hype cycle, which comes complete with interactive chart, is a fancier way of saying that all that positive news is going to take time to sink into people's minds. In Gartner-speak, we went over the Peak of Inflated Expectations in January, when the price was soaring, and now we're headed into the Trough of Disillusionment.  And then there is this succinct explanation, from Jean Marie Mognetti, a partner at Global Advisor, which is launching a hedge fund regulated by Jersey authorities that will open for subscriptions on 1st August.  Mognetti says his firm's bitcoin fund is aiming for $200m under management in a year's time, which would put it $50m above current hedge fund heavyweight Pantera Capital.  ""There is nothing in particular going on in the market at the moment. We have good visibility of [the market's] major components right now,"" he said.  It's not about reddit anymore  As Mognetti sees it, it's not that bitcoin has become a moribund asset, it's that earlier periods saw too much volatility.  ""It really depends on what window you look at. If you're looking at two months, it's OK, it's consolidating. If you look at six months, it definitely rose a lot from a very low price. Even in May there was nice upside, from $400 to $560. That's a 50% gain. I know a lot of asset managers who would die to get 50%,"" he said.  As for the news cycle, Mognetti thinks it's going to take a lot more than a viral reddit post to get bitcoin prices moving these days. Bitcoiners were overreacting to newsflow in the past, seizing on every new announcement or reddit post to bid up or sell down prices frenetically, he said. But, it looks like bitcoiners are starting to grow up and settle down, he says, drawing a parallel with another market, the decidedly analogue trade in crude oil.  ""In the past a single tension in the Middle East would trigger a massive spike in [oil prices]. These days the market discounts [news] very early and doesn't overreact anymore. It's just a proof of the market maturing. Now only real news moves the market, it's not about Twitter and reddit anymore,"" he said.  Ron Glantz, research director at Pantera Capital, probably the largest active bitcoin fund at the moment, with $150m under management, largely agrees. There's been ""no news"", he says, and that includes Dell's announcement, biggest merchant or no.  Short-term catalysts  What could get the price moving again? Basically, whales.  Exchanges are facing a liquidity issue – it's drying up across the big exchanges, says Lamb, of Coinfloor. Exchange operators are faced with the challenge of keeping volumes up as speculative traders drift away from the relatively stable bitcoin price. Pantera's Glantz concurs, observing that a big trade in these market conditions would shift the bitcoin price.  ""There isn't much liquidity in the market. Someone trying to buy, say, $2m quickly will move the market,"" he said.  Whales aside, there's the slightly more prosaic technical analysis to consider. George Sammantic, a co-founder of BTC.sx, thinks that prices could break out of their narrow trading band imminently, and more likely upward. Sammantic cites high support levels and tight Bollinger Bands as indicators that prices could break out soon.  ""Generally, minus some kind of news event, we should see the price start to move in either direction and only afterwards will we find out why. For now I see bullish patterns forming,"" he said.  What could those surprise news events be? Glantz of Pantera submits that it could be new capital controls, perhaps imposed on an economy facing spiralling inflation.  ""A lot of people in Argentina own bitcoins,"" he notes wryly.  The Coinfloor and BTC.sx bosses hope that organic bitcoin growth and adoption will bring prices to a natural tipping point. But, Magnotti of GABI offers the most audacious theory of all:  ""I don't want to blow my own trumpet on this one, but I think GABI ending its subscription period and going live on the market will be a serious catalyst.""  Magnotti says he's been flooded with requests to subscribe to his fund, even from traditionally conservative institutional investors – although he wouldn't be drawn on giving specifics, citing client confidentiality.  For market watchers who want to test Magnotti's theory, he's planning to start trading at the start of September, so mark your calendars.

42425911,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Hh,1406216305,Coinsetter Exits Beta to Target Institutional Traders,"New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter has officially exited beta, ending the trial stage of its product that began in November of last year.  To promote the launch, Coinsetter is lowering exchange commission fees to 0.10% for most active users, down from 0.25-0.50%. Furthermore, the exchange now offers both email and live phone support.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz explained that he feels the exchange is now ready to launch because its liquidity has finally caught up to the quality of its trading tools – a development that allows it to now expand its customer base into new verticals.  He said:  ""One of the biggest shifts [has been] moving from a trading platform, which is what a lot of people know us as, to really focus on being a bitcoin exchange. We still do have a focus on people who are trading bitcoin, but we've widening our customer focus to bitcoin ATM operators, payment processors – really anyone who's building a business that needs bitcoin liquidity.""  Lukasiewicz went on to suggest that active bitcoin traders should consider the platform due to its easy deposit and withdraw options, and industry-leading trading fees.  To date, Coinsetter has raised $1.5m from investors including Barry Silbert and Tribeca Venture Partners.  Evolving company  Lukasiewicz indicated that the launch follows what he described as a successful beta that helped the company expand on its concept ideas to deliver a more nuanced and full-featured product to the market.  In particular, he cited the quality of Coinsetter's API as one example of this growth, saying:  ""Back then, it was a very basic product. [...] Now, we've been able to cut a lot of latency on it. Now, we're going as low as 40 milliseconds. I would expect in the next six months to be down at 10 to 20 milliseconds latency, that really puts us on part with major forex platforms.""  Lukasiewicz further noted the company's price alert offerings and LaunchKey product – the latter allowing customers to log in by swiping their mobile phone – as examples of features customers are unlikely to find on other exchanges and added that more advancements are on the way:  ""I think you'll see us announce a number of institutional features over the next four weeks. There are a lot of exciting things we offer that we're differentiating from other exchanges.""  Regulatory clarity needed  The launch also notably coincides with the ongoing debate over New York's proposed bitcoin regulations, published last week.  When asked how the measures could affect Coinsetter, Lukasiewicz suggested that he feels that the action is positive in principle, but that he would like more clarity regarding how companies like Coinsetter would be affected:  ""We were really hoping to see it have a focus on bitcoin exchanges. [...] These regulations only focus on bitcoin, and briefly mentioned buying and selling, and it was very vague about it. We fall in a category that gets constantly left out, which is the three party order-book exchange that does hold customer funds.""  The rules are unclear on whether Coinsetter is subject to money transmitting money licenses and whether they have the ability to hold custody of customer funds, he said.  Committed to New York  Coinsetter is now submitting its comments to the New York Department of Financial Services in the hopes of receiving more clarity, and Lukasiewicz is optimistic about its prospects in the location long-term:  ""If we want to be an international exchange, we can do it from New York. The problem is not our company location.""  He went on to laud New York as a great testing ground for the company, one that allowed it to make key connections with the state's existing financial industry.  Lukasiewicz concluded:  ""We're going to stay here, but we hope that New York is friendly to bitcoin companies.""

42425916,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Nh,1406213848,Beyond New York: What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin,"According to the proposed 17th July bitcoin regulation from New York State, the public now has 45 days to comment and then a 45-day grace period prior to full adoption. But what's after 17th October? More importantly, what's after New York?  The poor regulators are in a quandary. It's hard not to be sympathetic sometimes. They are practically in a no-win situation, because regulators must use their tools to regulate, but the more they do, the more they inadvertently encourage market-based responses.  With the New York framework for bitcoin businesses, financial regulators need to demonstrate that they have not ceded control of the payments mechanism and the wholesale money transfer business, while simultaneously trying not to be accused of squashing technological innovation.  If improved financial privacy is considered a bitcoin innovation, then, yes, government choke points do stifle innovation.  Sitting on a razor's edge, their actions can either propel bitcoin more into an off-the-books counter-currency or retard US monetary progress for decades as more nimble jurisdictions exploit the economic benefits of cryptographic money. However, in the regulator's mind, they have no good options and permitting unimpeded bitcoin growth is unacceptable – so act they must.  Regulators and their red herrings  It is this general desire for enforcement action that so fatally misses the mark, because it blindly ignores the societal consequences of the great cryptocurrency wealth transfer and the temporary turmoil for the wave of people caught ill-prepared.  If anything, governments should encourage greater bitcoin savings and user-friendly open-source software. Seismic shifts that will transform existing financial and political institutions are now occurring directly underneath our feet.  And, while all of that happens, what do New York regulators choose to focus on?  Among many red herrings, they focus on perceived problems, like identifying physical addresses of bitcoin transactional parties and prohibiting bitcoin-related companies from maintaining profits in bitcoin.  Contrary to what the alarmist Perianne Boring states, bitcoin's fate will not be decided by lawmakers and regulators in the next 18 months. The only fate that will be decided is that of New York and any other regions that would adopt such a harsh line of regulatory thinking. In other words, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) doesn't harm bitcoin, it harms only the citizens of that jurisdiction who suddenly become disadvantaged relative to citizens in the rest of the world.  Here's what happens on 17th October: bitcoin continues to be a juggernaut, rolling over the promiscuous money printers and corrupt kingpins of the centrally planned banking system, albeit with some market-based adjustments. Markets perceive regulation as 'damage' and route around it. This is true with Internet-related damage and it is equally true with bitcoin-related damage.  Ultimately, the market will provide solutions to cases of bitcoin privacy 'damage', so I provided two handy reference guides: 'Why Bitcoin Fungibility is Essential’ and 'A Taxonomy of Bitcoin Mixing Services for Policymakers’.  Bitcoin, Tor and Financial Privacy  For starters, don't be discouraged by the New York regulatory proposal, because while exchanges and banking interfaces are useful for price discovery, they are optional for everyday bitcoin usage. Government attempts to exploit systemic choke points is all part of the natural transition process.  Similar to the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Tor Challengehttps://www.eff.org/torchallenge/ to circumvent government censorship, the bitcoin community needs a challenge to support and encourage true financial privacy, compared to the sanctioned privacy permitted under the guise of consumer protection. Privacy is claimed – it is not sanctioned.  Without privacy by default in the original Satoshi bitcoin client software, additions and workarounds for various wallet implementations have been the norm.  Writing in Forbes, Andy Greenberg explains that an upcoming version of bitcoinj – the software that powers many of the most popular bitcoin apps like Multibit and Bitcoin Wallet – will route all connections to the bitcoin network over Tor’s anonymity network before reaching another bitcoin node.  Bitcoinj creator Mike Hearn said:  ""The fact I use bitcoin isn’t a secret, but I don’t want all my transactions in an NSA database. When I use bitcoin in a bar, I don’t want someone on the local network to learn my balance. The way bitcoin is used today, both those things are possible.""  Thanks to IP tracking, it’s ""possible that the NSA and GCHQ have de-anonymized most of the block chain by now,"" he added.  Also, various implementations of the CoinJoin method have emerged recently, including Shared Coin from Blockchain and the Dark Wallet alpha release from developers Cody Wilson and Amir Taaki.  Relying only on bitcoin for operations and avoiding the regulatory glare implicit via banking relationships, Blockchain's modern uniqueness is in tune with bitcoin's principles, including user-defined privacy.  Despite some prior user claims to the contrary, Blockchain does not block Tor exit nodes – although individual account owners can block Tor IP access. Denial-of-service defenses may also cause some Tor exit nodes to be blocked temporarily.  In an enormously important three-minute interview, political theorist and global resilience guru Vinay Gupta recognizes that ""[bitcoin] cannot be divorced from pre-existing political theory.""  Gupta goes into explicit detail on the meaning of power and the significance of property rights:  ""The vast majority of the people using bitcoin are politically shallow. The problem is that bitcoin has succeeded technically and is midway through the process of failing politically.""  Gupta explains that the fundamental underlying issue for bitcoin and its future success is how to do strong property rights within the system and no property rights to operate the system as whole. The answer lies in what we already know about political theory and similar economic arrangements.  Foreshadowing the coming slew of ambitious regulatory restrictions, he surmises that ""until the bitcoin community admits that it's got political problems rather than technical problems, they're trapped"".

42425923,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6bh,1406197698,DigitalBTC Reports Early Success on Australian Securities Exchange,"Australian bitcoin firm DigitalBTC has reported its quarterly earnings, the first since the company went through a reverse takeover and re-listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  The company reported positive cash flow from bitcoin mining activities and bitcoin liquidity propositions, adding that it has already managed to recoup investments in its mining operations. In addition to mining, DigitalBTC is trying to enter the consumer space and has made it clear that it plans to use revenue generated by its mining business to fuel further expansion.  As DigitalBTC is the first bitcoin company to be listed on the ASX, it is also the first such company to report its quarterly earnings in a routine filing with the exchange.  Mining success  Currently, bitcoin mining is DigitalBTC's principal revenue source. The company ordered several tranches of BitFury miners earlier this year, pledging to become one of the biggest mining operations in the world.  In addition to the BitFury arrangement, the firm also entered a strategic partnership with CloudHashing.com. Under the deal, CloudHashing.com led the deployment of the mining hardware, while DigitalBTC in turn offered trading services to CloudHashing.  ""Our purchase of Bitfury Group equipment has proved to be a wise decision, with the company now having achieved complete payback on our original US$4m equipment purchase, including all capital and operating costs incurred to date,"" said DigitalBTC Executive Chairman Zhenya Tsvetnenko.  The company says in a press release that it has mined approximately 8,600 bitcoins so far and that, as of 30th June, it held an estimated 3,600 bitcoins awaiting liquidation or use in liquidity desk operations. However, in its ASX filing the company reported somewhat lower numbers, saying it sold around 4,000 bitcoins, which generated around US$2.1m.  The company explained the difference between the figures as a foible of the accounting rules:  ""Due to the nature of accounting standards, bitcoins generated but still held prior to liquidation or use in Liquidity Desk operations will not be reported as cash flows relating to operation activities.""  Trading and product development  DigitalBTC has also rebranded its trading desk, which is now called the Liquidity Desk, which it indicates is continuing to generate ""good returns"". The firm has also expanded its list of partners and gained volume in June, it says, while additional investments in bitcoin mining operations are being considered.  Furthermore, while it hints that R&D is continuing on a number of innovative consumer products, no additional details were provided.  ""The bitcoin system continues to go from strength to strength, with significant new investments and major merchants coming on board,"" said Tsvetnenko. ""In the last week, the biggest retailer yet to accept bitcoin, Dell, began accepting payments for purchases via the Dell site.""  Tsvetnenko added that bitcoin is rapidly moving toward mainstream adoption and made it clear DigitalBTC intends to play a role in realising bitcoin's full potential.

Boost VC's  Adam Draper, who told the audience that 12 of his newest Tribe 4 of startups are bitcoin companies, may have offered the most succinct opinion.  Draper said:  ""The New York rules suck. It was awful. The worst possible outcome. It’s worse than banking regulation.""  This topic was the highlight of the first day of the conference, which continues with another jam-packed schedule on 24th July.  NYDFS framework dissected  A panel featuring some of the top bitcoin startup accelerators did not have a sunny disposition on the subject and what it will mean for bitcoin businesses.  ""They literally just listed a bunch of rules,"" said 500 Startups partner Sean Percival. He also added that user growth is still an immense challenge. ""We look at the addressable audience,"" Percival said. ""And right now the addressable audience is small.""  Scott Robinson of Plug and Play Technology Center advised anyone thinking about entering the bitcoin space to start considering how they will comply with future regulatory policy. ""You should definitely know your KYC/AML really well,"" he said.  Anthony Di Iorio, who runs Toronto coworking and accelerator space Bitcoin Decentral, said alternative coins offering advanced properties are an exciting prospect for the future along with the groundbreaking technology bitcoin brought to the masses.  ""I’m a big bitcoin fan, but I am a believer in the appcoin systems coming out now,"" Di Iorio said.  Lawyers urge cooperation  A perfunctory regulation panel made it known that in their opinion, the bitcoin community will have to comply with regulators' compliance demands no matter what.  Dan Wheeler, a regulatory partner at Bryan Cave LLP, said not taking the regulation issue seriously could be very problematic for bitcoin businesses not following the rules.  Wheeler said:  ""This is an area that the regulators are very good at. They are very sophisticated in looking at KYC programs. And unfortunately there are consequences for not doing it right.""  Tim Bynum, chief compliance officer for BitPay, implored the audience to offer feedback to the New York state regulators. ""Please read all 40 pages. KYC is littered throughout the document. We need your comment,"" he said.  Bynum added regulation is just going to be part of participating in the bitcoin economy going forward:  ""I think concentrate on what is the problem and what is the solution. I think [regulation is] going to be a cost of doing business.""  Jose Caldera, vice president of marketing and products for IdentityMind Global, said the IRS ruling on bitcoin classifying it as property shows the different capabilities bitcoin has over regular money – and that it is a new paradigm for regulators to think about.  Caldera said:  ""I think it deserves its own financial asset class. That’s why it's property, that’s why it needs that classification.""  A new economy  ZipZap  CEO Alan Safahi, an experienced operator in the payments industry, conducted the keynote for Coin Congress. ""I guess I’m the oldest guy in this space, so they asked me to talk about the state of bitcoin,"" he playfully noted.  Safahi pointed out in his presentation that the cryptocurrency bellwether, bitcoin, is growing at a dramatic pace versus its counterparts, even despite regulatory threats. He said, in terms of bitcoin's overall growth: ""Bitcoin outpaces all altcoins.""  As further evidence of this, he pointed out a number of companies that have emerged around bitcoin's technology – an ecosystem other coins have not yet developed. Safahi explicitly spoke about solutions providers such as Coinbase and Circle helping bring further legitimacy.  ""[Now] there’s a whole category of solutions providers,"" he added.  His presentation pointed to companies such as BitGo and Kraken as key operators helping to further bitcoin's use as a novel technical innovation.  Yet, there are still things holding bitcoin back. After Safahi's presentation, GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard lamented the difficulty of QR codes.  He said:  ""Nobody loves QR codes. I think the saying goes, ‘I love QR codes – never’.""  Trading bitcoin  Binary Financial  managing partner Harry Yeh offered an interesting talk towards the end of the day on the subject of bitcoin trading. He did warn, however, that making money buying and selling BTC for profit is not easy.  Yeh noted that it takes a certain amount of ebullience to trade bitcoin, saying:  ""Money management is a very, very important thing when trading bitcoin. Cut your losses early, and let your gains run.""  Yeh talked about different strategies and tools that can be used to trade bitcoin. One tactic he discussed was technical trading with charts alone, and told the audience that his firm Binary Financial uses RTBTC to analyze technical chart information.  Another trading method for bitcoin that Yeh likes to use is fundamental analysis, trading on news developments. ""Fundamental analysis could be [trading on] the NYDFS, or China news,"" he said. ""[But] be careful of bitcointalk and Reddit,"" he added.  Yeh recommended using ZeroBlock, Google News or CoinDesk in order to find accurate information about developments in the cryptocurrency industry.  He said:  ""Bitcoin’s price reaction to news is much, much heavier than a whale [large investor] coming in and buying bitcoin.""  During his Q&A Yeh added that commissions are a problem for investors who want to start out trading a small amount. A trader starting out with just a single bitcoin could suffer at the expense of cryptocurrency exchange commissions, he said.
