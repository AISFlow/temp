Speaking at Invest: NYC 2019, Gradwell said the crypto-sleuthing firm has found that only 30 percent of bitcoin is actually liquid. Of this value exchanged, more and more of it is going towards legitimate merchant services, a departure from crypto’s first use case: “buying drugs on the Silk Road.”      “In recent months there has been a lot of disruption to [dark] markets, law enforcement has taken down a number of those sites. That’s actually reduced their size in the overall crypto economy,” Gladwell said.      One notable example was the investigation and closure of Welcome to Video, the world’s largest child exploitation site, according to Gladwell. Chainalysis participated in the global cooperative effort to shutter the site and arrest the alleged perpetrators, by analyzing crypto transactions used to pay for child pornography.      “We were able to help the [IRS and Homeland Security] understand were the bitcoin came from or where it got cashed out to,” Gradwell said. “You shouldn’t underestimate the amount of non-blockchain investigations,” that contributed to the effort, he added.      Gradwell also addressed how law enforcement might respond to the distribution of privacy-protecting coins, such as Zcash, as well as the open industry debate as to how much personally identifiable information exchanges should keep under Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule.”      “The industry needs to work out what the right solution is,” Gradwell said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | ZEC,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/28/watch-chainalysis-chief-economist-wants-crypto-to-move-past-buying-drugs-on-the-silk-road,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4900405e5c98d41fc159aa07a4c46f93d809ba8-1226x634.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403595,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgNFW,1574947214,What the Fed Reserve's Balance Sheet Expansion Means for Bitcoin,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is again expanding its balance sheet and prominent experts believe that could bode well for bitcoin in the long run.      The U.S. central bank's balance sheet includes a large number of distinct assets and liabilities. When interest rates begin to rise, the Fed pumps more money into the system by buying treasuries. The banks, therefore, have more cash available to lend and lower interest rates.      In October, the Fed's assets grew by over $162 billion to register the biggest monthly rise since 2008.      Popular analyst @Rhythmtrader hinted this was a sign of impending turmoil, the kind bitcoin is supposed to be a haven from, in a Nov. 7 tweet.            Further, $270 billion has been reportedly added to the balance sheet since Sept. 11, which implies an average daily growth rate of $5.8 billion. As of Nov. 15, the Fed’s total assets were $4.04 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.    Fed intervenes in money markets    The central bank again started buying treasuries after the money markets went haywire in September, pushing short-term rates as high as 10 percent, threatening to disrupt the overall lending system.      It's worth noting that the Fed does not have the authority to enforce a particular federal funds rate and instead influences the money supply to keep rates in the target range, currently 1.5 to 1.75 percent.      When interest rates begin to rise, it pumps more money into the economy. The banks, therefore, have more cash available to lend and lower interest rates.      Back in September, the target range was 1.75 to 2 percent. So, with rates spiking as high as 10 percent, the Fed was compelled to spring to action.    Markets don't believe the Fed    Fed Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that treasury purchases are not quantitative easing (QE), whereby the central bank snaps up government bonds to boost the money supply and buttress economic growth.      Experts, however, believe the central bank is in effect implementing round four of the QE program, following three rounds between 2009 and 2015.      “The burst in the repo market is telling us that risk and debt accumulation are much higher than estimated and it has taken a disguised QE program to mildly contain it,” Daniel Lacalle, author of ""Escape from the Central Bank Trap"" wrote in an article for mises.org.      Meanwhile, Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, editor of The Boock Report and CNBC contributor, is of the opinion that the markets view any increase in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet as QE.            The recent rally in the US stock market also indicates the investors are not buying the Fed’s rhetoric and are viewing the ongoing balance sheet expansion as QE, as pointed out by Sven Henrich, popularly known as NorthmanTrader.            The S&P 500 rallied for six straight weeks, starting from the second week of October to the second week of November. The index fell by 0.33 percent last week only to clock a fresh record high of 3,154 on Wednesday.    BTC a hedge against monetary indiscipline?          The popular narrative in the crypto markets is that bitcoin is effectively digital gold and a hedge against monetary and fiscal indiscipline.      Anthony Pompliano, founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets told CoinDesk:    “Bitcoin is headed towards a unique situation – lower interest rates, more QE, and the [miners' reward] halving in 2020. These three events occurring near the same time should serve as rocket fuel for Bitcoin over the next 2–3 years.”    Indeed, the top cryptocurrency’s monetary policy is fixed – the mining rewards are reduced by 50 percent every four years. Essentially, the pace of supply expansion is reduced by half every four years as opposed to major central banks, which have been expanding money supply since 2009.      Looking ahead, the Fed is likely to continue expanding its balance sheet in the near future, as the money market is unlikely to return to normalcy any time soon, according to JPMorgan Chase. With bitcoin set to cut miner rewards next May, the bitcoin-Fed monetary policy divergence is set to widen further.      It's therefore not surprising that the likes of Cameron Winklevoss, founder of Winklevoss Capital Management, are extremely bullish on BTC:          Bitcoin may benefit from QE's Cantillon Effect    The Cantillon Effect refers to the change in relative prices resulting from a shift in the money supply. It argues that money injection (QE and other inflation-boosting policies) may not change an economy’s output over the long-term. However, as newly created money travels through the economy, it affects different sectors of the economy differently.      For instance, the expected increase in the money supply due to QE or rate cuts is first priced in by financial markets. Put simply, people who are most invested in the stock market, real estate are the first to benefit from the inflationary policies.      By the time new investors enter the market, the assets are already overpriced. Further, saving becomes difficult with low-interest rates and the falling purchasing power of the currency.      A prolonged period of QE, therefore, may force investors to diversify their investments into bitcoin, which is deflationary in nature, as noted by analyst Pierre Rochard in August.            Backing Rochard’s view is Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist/director at VanEck/MVIS, who told CoinDesk that both bitcoin and gold could benefit from QE-led dollar devaluation and asset inflation.      Gurbacs said:    ""Central banks expanding their balance sheets is quantitative easing in disguise. In effect, central banks buy government bonds and expand the repo market program with the intent to keep money markets in check. Bitcoin and gold may provide an alternative to and potentially a hedge against catastrophic failures in such heavily controlled central banking systems.""    Some may argue that BTC is not a haven asset and tends to track equities more closely.      ""Prior bitcoin bull runs were characterized by a gradual decline in equity market volatility. For example, we’ve noted its, albeit imperfect, inverse relationship with the VIX Index over longer time horizons (i.e. 2017 run-up),"" according to analysts at Delphi Digital.      Even if we consider BTC a risky asset, the Fed’s QE still appears to be a price-bullish development.      The central bank conducted three rounds of QE between 2009 and 2015, during which time the S&P 500, a benchmark for risk assets across the globe, rallied by more than 200 percent. Gold, a classic safe-haven asset, rose from $800 to $1,921 in the three years to 2011 only to fall back to $1,050 by December 2015.

The U.S Patent and Trademark Office-issued patent, published on Nov. 19, describes an automated system and accompanying scoring mechanism that together root out non-compliant user accounts – specifically ones suspected of trafficking in illegal activity.      It assigns an overall compliance score from a variety of factors, according to the patent description. Some are user-inputted or executed data points, including user age, account balance, transaction volume, location, verification history and the number of devices with access.      Other factors are calculated by the exchange itself. The compliance enforcer also measures “the level of due diligence that has been performed on the respective account,” and any past history of compliance review in determining “whether the account is bad or good.”      Good accounts pass through untouched. Bad ones are suspended and referred to law enforcement authorities if the transaction involves more than $2,000, the patent indicates.      Investigators have an override function allowing them to bypass the suspensions, according to the patent      The system learns to differentiate from a training set. It constantly updates its compliance model from the data collected and the accounts flagged.

42403596,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgNIT,1574939002,"Bitcoin Eyes $7,800 After Biggest Daily Price Gain in a Month","View  Bitcoin jumped above $7,400 on Wednesday, confirming a bullish breakout on the short duration technical charts.  Resistance at $7,800 could come into play in the next 48 hours. A violation there would expose $8,200.  The nascent recovery will fall apart if Wednesday’s low of $6.848 is breached. At press time, that looks unlikely.    Bitcoin eked out the biggest single-day gain in four weeks on Wednesday, confirming a short-term price breakout and opening doors for a test of resistance at $7,800.      The number one cryptocurrency printed a UTC close at $7,528 on Bitstamp, representing a 5.15 percent gain on the daily opening price of $7,168. That's the biggest single-day price rise since Oct. 26. On that day, BTC rose by 6.81 percent and printed highs above $10,300.      Wednesday’s gain looks more impressive if we take into account the rejection of lower prices seen during the European trading hours. Prices had dropped to $6,850, but were quickly reversed and the cryptocurrency ended the day on an optimistic note, validating the seller exhaustion signaled by key technical indicators.      More importantly, BTC activated twin bullish cues on the intraday charts with a convincing move above $7,400 and could continue to draw bids in the short-term.      At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,480, having hit a high of $7,670 during the U.S. trading hours on Wednesday.    4-hour chart          Both an upside break of the descending trendline and inverse head-and-shoulders breakout indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side.      The latter represents a transition from the lower-highs, lower-lows set up to one of higher lows and higher highs. It's considered a potent bullish reversal pattern if it appears following a significant price drop, which is the case here.      The bullish reversal pattern has created room for a rally to $8,200 (target as per the measured move method).      On the way higher, the pair may face resistance at $7,800 (horizontal line) and the descending 100-candle average, currently at $7,936.    Hourly chart          The 50-hour average is beginning to trend north – a sign of strengthening upside momentum – and looks set to cross above the 200-hour average in coming days. The impending bull cross may invite stronger buying pressure, possibly yielding a rally to $7,800.      That said, a short-term bullish reversal would only be confirmed if the current three-day candle closes (Friday, UTC) above $7,380.      On the downside, Wednesday’s low of $6,848 is key support, which if breached with strong volumes, would kill the nascent recovery and shift risk in favor of a re-test of $6,500.

42403599,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgNHU,1574937770,"A Third of Crypto Exchanges Have Little or No KYC, Says CipherTrace","A good portion of the cryptocurrency exchange industry is running the risk of falling afoul of the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) ""Travel Rule"" guidance announced in July, according to new research.      Blockchain compliance solutions provider CipherTrace says in its Q3 Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Report, published Wednesday, that around one third of the top 120 exchanges are ""weak"" when it comes to know-your-customer (KYC) verification, while fully two-thirds ""lack strong KYC policies.""      The FATF guidance, which is more or less obligatory for its 39 member nations and jurisdictions to adopt in regulation, stipulates that exchanges, or virtual asset providers (VASPS), must obtain, store and be able to pass on data on their users when transactions worth $1,000 or over are made. This provides a digital paper trail that can be followed in order to prevent financial crimes such as money laundering or terrorism financing.      CipherTrace says there's now just seven months left for the members to align legislation with the guidance, and VASPs to set up solutions in order to remain in compliance. However, it says, some 65 percent of exchanges are not yet able ""to handle basic KYC, let alone comply with the stringent new funds 'Travel Rule'.""      The firm's researchers found that they were able to transact 0.25 bitcoin daily with little or no KYC at 35 percent of exchanges tested, described as ""weak"" AML protections in the report. Forty-one percent were ""porous,"" CipherTrace found, with ""some sort of ID verification process,"" while just 35 percent had ""strong"" KYC, with multiple levels of verification, including a proof-of-address requirement and perhaps video or telephone calls.      CipherTrace further says that the Travel Rule is ""problematic"" for so-called privacy coins, cryptocurrencies that offer features that can obfuscate a user's personal data. Such features put these cryptos at odd with FATF's guidance.      Already, some exchanges have been delisting such coins, including zcash, monero and dash, citing compliance with national regulators' moves to align with FATF's stipulations.      However, the report says that the researchers found 32 percent of exchanges, including some with less-then-strong KYC, still list privacy coins.      The firm states, though:    ""Although the report does punctuate a concern for privacy coins that have no compliance strategy, CipherTrace affirms that recent reports of the death of privacy coins have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, many of the top privacy coin developers have already released statements ... on how they could comply with the Travel Rule.    Indeed, a planned suspension of zcash and dash trading support by OKEx Korea was put under review in October, partly thanks to efforts by the Electric Coin Company – the co-developer of zcash – to assuage the exchange's fears.      Josh Swihart, the Electric Coin Company's VP of marketing and business development told CoinDesk at the time, “Zcash is entirely compatible with all FATF recommendations including the travel rule.""

Speaking at a joint conference held by the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Belgium, outgoing executive board member Benoît Cœuré said the bank will examine the potential influences of digital currencies over the existing financial system.      “A digital currency of this sort could take a variety of forms, the benefits and costs of which the ECB and other central banks are currently investigating, being mindful of their broader consequences on financial intermediation.” Cœuré said.      However, he advocated for private companies to continue their own work in the space.      “But potential central bank initiatives should not discourage or crowd out private market-led solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area,” he said.      The speech came on the heels of Cœuré’s appointment as head of the newly established Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements this month.      Effective on Jan. 1 2020, he will lead the institution’s effort to help central banks explore the benefits of financial technologies such as a digital currency.      European central banks in general have been speaking out about cryptocurrencies recently.      French central bank first deputy governor Denis Beau said last week the eurozone would consider building a blockchain-based settlement system for the euro and potential a digital currency to address payment issues between institutions in the area.      However, the ECB has struck down a proposed cryptocurrency proposed by Estonia in September 2017, stressing the euro is the only valid money in the European area.      Senior officials from the bank also said in the past that they do not consider digital currencies such as bitcoin to be a threat and cryptocurrencies do not pose risks on financial risks on financial stability.

To drive home what he meant, Kruger said “something that settles into a range in real terms still trends in nominal terms due to inflation, as most commodities do.”      But timing is always the question and BTC could be faraway from that level of maturity, where it ‘settles’ into a defined range as the budding market of cryptocurrency moves into its 10th year.      Willy Woo, a crypto on-chain analyst and trader, said the price of BTC still had some ways to go in discovering a price ceiling.      “Anything between a [market capitalization] of $10 trillion to $100 trillion is fair game,” Woo said.      BTC’s market capitalization, a measurement of total coins in circulation multiplied by its spot price, stands at $204.4 billion, down from its yearly peak of $233 billion witnessed June 27, according to information provided by Messari, a cryptocurrency data provider.      Kruger said volatility is likely due to the lack of total capital in the space right now. As the market cap increases, the impact to BTC by large market participants, aptly named “whales”, is likely to be less impactful in shifting price.      That is a sobering fact for retail investors as volatility tends to be the most attractive aspect to cryptocurrency trading.      For institutional investors, it would be a welcome change.      Nic Carter, Partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on public blockchains, said BTC resembles a commodity more than any other asset class, but also said that volatility isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.      “The lack of a supply response to a demand shock all but ensures it is likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future,” Cater said.      BTC’s halving, an event where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, meaning miners receive 50 percent fewer BTC for verifying transactions, is set to trigger on May 14, 2020.      In macroeconomics, scarcity tends to be a fundamental driving force that increases the value of an asset, much the same way that diamonds, oil and gold functions based on the supply and demand from speculative investors.      Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group, a regulated financial services enterprise for digital assets, said Kruger’s second scenario, in which scarcity continues to drive prices higher is likely to remain a constant forever. He also said global cryptocurrency adoption was a long way from mainstream adoption but said the markets continue to march on, regardless of price.      “I can tell you with great confidence that global adoption at established brands is growing steadily and purposefully,” Landsberg-Sadie said.      How far along BTC’s market cycle is, is yet to be determined, but if traditional economics prove true, BTC could be highly valued in the very near future.
