42429625,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Cth,1536091812,Crypto Exchange ShapeShift Is Moving Away From Its No-Account Model,"Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift has launched a new membership program that will eventually become mandatory for its users.  Positioned  as a loyalty program, the initiative will see the startup offer a range of benefits while also moving to start collecting some personal information from its users, essentially forming a pivot away from its ""exchange without accounts"" model.  In a blog post, CEO Erik Voorhees wrote that ""that last detail sucks"" in reference to the plan to make the membership program mandatory, which will take place sometime later this year.  Nothing that ""we would prefer if the collection of personal information was not a mandatory element,"" Voorhees went on to write:  ""We still firmly believe that individuals, regardless of their race, religion, or nationality, deserve the right to financial privacy, just as they deserve the right to privacy in their thoughts, in their relationships, and in their communications. Such privacy is a foundational element of a civil and just society, and should be defended by all good people. We remain committed to that cause and it is best served if we are smart about our approach.  Members will receive discounts on exchange rates, volume-based rewards for transacting with the FOX token and higher transaction limits.  The broader changes, according to Voorhees, are a result of requests from ShapeShift users for account-related features, an ""increasing interest in ... tokenization"" and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges at present, he said.  ""Membership is, in essence, an advanced loyalty program. It will lead over time both to better pricing and a superior user experience,"" he wrote.  While ShapeShift is adding new features for the program, Voorhees stressed, it will remain a non-custodial exchange, meaning it will not hold customer funds.

The Manila Times reports that SEC Commissioner Ephyro Luis Amatong told journalists that the rules are set to be published ""by the end of next week,"" though an exact date hasn't been specified.  Regulators in the country have been mulling various ways of regulating the cryptocurrency space for the better part of two years, a process that has seen officials putting together a framework for initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as the actual registration of cryptocurrency exchanges. The coming ruleset is focused on exchanges that offer trading services.  ""We see the need to regulate them as trading platforms,"" Amatong was quoted as saying.  Further, the proposed rules for ICOs are also expected to be released in their final form next week.  There's another reason that the Philippines is looking to formalize its exchange rules: the potential for millions of dollars worth of revenue in the form of license fees.  As CoinDesk reported earlier this summer, the authority that governs the Philippines Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport is aiming to earn $67 million through such issuances.  The agency's senior deputy administrator has said that the CEZA charges $360,000 for a principal license and $85,000 for a regular one – opening the door to a potential income stream for the government.

42429652,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0D9h,1536075394,Litecoin Price Nears $70 to Hit One-Month High,"Litecoin's (LTC) price hit a one-month high on Monday amid a broader bullish tone in the cryptocurrency market.  The world's seventh largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization reached $68.59 at 12:10:00 UTC – its highest price since August 7th, according to CoinDesk's Litecoin Price Index – and was last seen trading at $68.18, up roughly 4.2 percent on the day.  The recent bullish mood in cryptocurrency markets could be attributed to bitcoin's 20 percent rally from the August low of $6,000. More importantly, the world's leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is looking up, having witnessed a pennant breakout, as CoinDesk previously reported.  The long-term picture is also looking rosy, courtesy of the weekly MACD's bullish turn. As a result, LTC could soon find acceptance above the immediate resistance lined up at $69.00 (50-day MA).  Litecoin's market capitalization stands at $3.95 billion – its highest level since early August.  The broader market is also flashing green. Names like bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and EOS are all recording price growth in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Monero (XMR) is the biggest gainer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies with a more than 10 percent price increase since yesterday.

42429624,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Crh,1536073227,British Maritime Society Builds Blockchain Tool for Ship Registration,"British maritime classification society Lloyd's Register has developed a prototype blockchain platform aimed to enable more efficient shipping registration, the organization announced Tuesday.  The not-for-profit, which is already looking at using blockchain to improve the safety and security of critical shipping infrastructure and individuals in the industry, is now working to speed up the process of registering vessels using the nascent technology, according to a press release.  Lloyd's uses its register – first created in 1764 – to record information about a ship's condition, which merchants and underwriters can then use when determining whether to insure or charter a vessel.  It has now put that data on the prototype register, built in partnership with development firm Applied Blockchain, and will demo the tool this week at the international maritime trade fair SMM.  Gary Pogson, Lloyd's Register lead technical specialist, marine and offshore, said in the release that he had been studying blockchain technology for roughly two and a half years, and that ""from very early on, I recognized this as an area of great potential.""  He continued:  ""We have taken a systems approach in undertaking this project, exploring customer needs to derive requirements. In looking at potential solutions, we've been careful to ask whether blockchain is a valid component of a solution. In our view, applied carefully as part of a well-designed system, it is uniquely disposed to offer additional value and set a foundation for the maritime industry's future needs.""  Similarly, Lloyd's marine and offshore director, Nick Brown, said that the company has ""identified multiple potential sources of value by adopting this technology.""  He specifically cited blockchain's immutability and auditability as benefits. Further, using a blockchain register may be more efficient in sharing information than existing systems, allowing different parties to quickly transfer information about vessels to each other and potentially allow ""financing, insuring, payments etc. to be provided more dynamically.""  ""This value discovery project has culminated in a prototype blockchain-enabled register tool. We are now focused on how we can extend the value to other stakeholders in the maritime supply chain,"" he concluded.

According to a report from 21st Century Business Herald on Tuesday, the first phase of the so-called Bay Area Trade Finance Blockchain Platform is already deployed across financial institutions in the southern city of Shenzhen and is currently undergoing final trials.  The Bay Area in Southern China is an economic development zone consisting of major cities along the Pearl River and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.  The trade finance project was jointly pushed through and coordinated by the Digital Currency Research Lab of the People's Bank of China and the central bank's Shenzhen branch, the report indicates. Major commercial banks in the country, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, China Merchants Bank, Ping'An Bank and Standard Chartered, also participated and assisted with development.  The platform is aimed to boost the efficiency of interbank transactions and to help small- and medium-sized businesses access a wider range of financing tools, such as asset-backed securities, as data can be easily shared across participants via a distributed network  Further, greater levels of transparency of transactions and information shared on the blockchain is expected to give local regulators more granular oversight for improved risk control and fraud prevention, the report added.  The trade finance effort comes as Hong Kong's de facto central bank is also deploying a blockchain-based trade finance platform, with participation from a group of financial institutions in the Chinese special administrative region.

42429622,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Cph,1536066032,Not Just Tron: Neo's Failed $170 Million Bid to Buy BitTorrent Revealed,"When Tron founder Justin Sun bought BitTorrent in one of the most talked-about tech acquisitions of the year, it turns out he wasn't even the highest bidder.  What's more, Tron wasn't even the only crypto startup that wanted a piece of the pioneering peer-to-peer file sharing software company, CoinDesk has learned. Based on internal documents and multiple interviews with people close to the deal, CoinDesk is able to reveal Sun's rival in his quest to acquire the influential Silicon Valley startup was one of Tron's top competitors, the $1.5 billion blockchain project Neo.  Through its related venture capital firm, Neo Global Capital (NGC), the project made a much higher offer than Sun, a fact confirmed both by NGC and multiple sources familiar with the deal.  According to Neo Blockchain's head of investment, Weiyu ""Wayne"" Zhu, and internal BitTorrent documents obtained by CoinDesk, NGC's bid was for $170 million, amounting to $50 million dollars more than Tron founder Justin Sun's $120 million bid for the shares. Nevertheless, Sun's offer eventually succeeded.  Tron did not reply to a request for comment. BitTorrent declined to answer requests as well.  Although first reported in June, Sun announced in July that he had acquired BitTorrent on behalf of Tron, the controversial blockchain project he founded in 2017 after leaving San Francisco startup Ripple. The acquisition marked one of the first times a crypto company had successfully acquired an established web company, leaving Tron investors thrilled (though the project's skeptics were more suspicious).  At the time, observers speculated that Sun bought the company for its user base.  Tron and Neo have also faced off in other ways. Though their explicit goals are different, both projects seek to stake a claim in the already competitive market of creating faster, more scalable blockchains. Likewise, both claim a common competitor – the world's second-largest blockchain ethereum.  Tron, which launched its network in July, aims to ""decentralize the internet,"" and has chiefly positioned itself as an alternative to ethereum, with Sun sparking controversy in April after tweeting that his project was ""better.""  Likewise, Neo, previously called Antshares, has positioned itself and has been referred to as ""the ethereum of China."" The project focuses on smart contracts, digital identity and digital assets, and has a $1.5 billion market capitalization to Tron's $1.6 billion.  For all their similarities, though, the two projects did not offer BitTorrent the same deal. Despite bidding $50 million more than Justin Sun, BitTorrent's board nonetheless said in the documents that NGC's offer was ""not more favorable to the company and its shareholders"" and accepted Sun's offer.  One further commonality perhaps sheds light on these peculiar circumstances. Both projects are based in China, and therefore must also face the obstacle of its capital controls.  ""Only specific business purposes will be approved by Chinese government,"" Minhui Chen, a partner at Global Blockchain Innovative Capital (GBIC), which helps entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of international deals, told CoinDesk. ""The process takes months.""  But it turns out the Chinese government was not NGC's primary concern.  Two bids, one deal  Sun made the first move to open the bidding process.  According to documents detailing the acquisition, Sun approached investor David Chao at DCM, a venture capital firm which controlled most of BitTorrent's equity, in late December 2017. However, Sun did not initially try to acquire BitTorrent as a whole.  Instead, he sought to purchase a controlling stake in the company by purchasing DCM's preferred stock, which amounted to 99 percent of the total preferred stock. According to public documents submitted to the California secretary of state in June, each of these shares were valued at about $1.85 in the final deal.  Sun offered approximately $90 million to $100 million for DCM's stake.  However, the documents describe how Chao later insisted that Sun purchase BitTorrent's common stock in addition to its preferred stock, for fear that common stockholders would be left empty-handed.  NGC entered the picture approximately one month after these discussions, and conducted meetings with DCM and BitTorrent. Unlike Sun, NGC sought to become BitTorrent's sole owner from the start, offering $115 million for all preferred stock and $55 million for all common stock.  Zhu said NGC was interested because it hoped BitTorrent could build a decentralized file storage system that would be generally useful for any decentralized web project or blockchain.  Washington's shadow  At this point, the accounts diverge on one point: who backed away when.  In mid-February, NGC revised its offer to exclude a provision that would nullify the acquisition if it was not completed within six months, a change that appears to have been considered a drawback by BitTorrent and DCM.  Just one day after NGC submitted their revised letter of intent, BitTorrent and DCM determined that the despite the higher price tag, NGC's offer was not as ""favorable"" as Sun's offer. The documents specifically cited, ""the risk of the transaction not being consummated due to the projected closing of such proposed transaction being late in 2018 and [NGC's] primary assets being cryptocurrency holdings, which required an additional foreign currency conversion prior to the closing of the proposed transaction.""  Zhu offers a different interpretation of events.  At this point, he says NGC had become concerned about the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). At that time, attempts by companies such Huawei and ZTE to invest in U.S. telecoms was stirring up significant political controversy about Chinese access to American intellectual property.  In addition, the fact that BitTorrent's primary architect, Bram Cohen, was committed to his new venture, Chia, and therefore unwilling to return to the company proved to be an impediment.  ""We were not so sure that BitTorrent is technically advanced enough to become the decentralized file project we had hoped it would be,"" Zhu said. Cohen has declined a request for comment.  From Zhu's perspective, by expressing serious concerns about CFIUS and never revisiting the point, NGC was letting BitTorrent know it was walking away.  On Valentine's Day, BitTorrent and DCM accepted Sun's final offer of $90 million for all preferred stock and $30 million for all common stock the following day.  The documents acknowledge that there were subsequently adjustments to the price to account for ""net working capital, outstanding debt and unpaid transaction expenses,"" amounting to approximately $20 million more.  What Tron wanted  BitTorrent has yet to unveil a major new Tron specific project, other than becoming in August another Tron controlled super representative on the network.  Observers speculated  at the time of Tron's announcement that Sun had acquired the company for its user base or to lend legitimacy to his project, which has been plagued by allegations of plagiarism and failing to properly attribute code in its repository. Several employees have since left BitTorrent under its new owner, citing concerns about its new management and direction.  Like NGC, Sun also tried to compel several former BitTorrent employees and major holders of common stock, including Cohen, to rejoin the company. Sun later dropped this condition before submitting his final offer.  Founded in 2004 by Cohen and Ashwin Navin, BitTorrent is a protocol for filesharing in which users would download one file from multiple peers at once, which improves speed. At times, peer-to-peer filesharing represented a large amount of all internet traffic.  While challenges with its business model ultimately led it to shopping itself for sale, its architecture anticipated the decentralized web at the heart of today's token boom. The inventor of most of its technology, Cohen, left the company in late 2017. Shortly before the sale finalized, BitTorrent acquired a small stake in his new company, the eco-friendly blockchain protocol Chia, as CoinDesk previously reported.  That stake transferred to Sun, who has since moved BitTorrent into Tron's Silicon Valley office, establishing a beachhead in the U.S. for the Chinese company.  So far, Sun does not seem to have run afoul of CFIUS, as NGC feared. And the Chinese state is happy for domestic companies to acquire Western companies if there's a good reason.  As GBIC's Chen put it:  ""Then the Chinese government will support you, but the process is still tedious and long.""

42429614,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Cdh,1536064228,IBM Debuts Stellar-Powered 'Blockchain World Wire' Payments System,"IBM is taking its long-in-the-works blockchain-based payment system out of beta, with the launch of a new product called Blockchain World Wire.  Aimed at institutions and harnessing the stellar blockchain network, Big Blue says its new financial rail ""can simultaneously clear and settle cross-border payments in near real-time.""  Similar to other blockchain-based payment networks such as Ripple, World Wire attempts to do away with banking intermediaries that add complexity and cost to the traditional international payments systems.  According to a document provided by IBM, the product works by substituting the banking intermediaries normally needed for cross-border payments with digital assets sent over a distributed network.  The company says on its website:  ""Two financial institutions transacting together agree to use a stable coin, central bank digital currency or other digital asset as the bridge asset between any two fiat currencies. The digital asset facilitates the trade and supplies important settlement instructions.""      Effectively, using World Wire APIs plugged into banks' existing systems, fiat currency is exchanged into a digital asset at bank A. It is then transmitted to bank B, where it is converted into a second fiat currency. ""All transaction details are recorded onto an immutable blockchain for clearing,"" says IBM.      As CoinDesk reported, IBM was in July revealed to be working with a startup called Stronghold on the launch of a low-volatility stablecoin that will run on the stellar blockchain and use its consensus mechanism to verify transactions.  ""What we really want to do is enable all sorts of digital transactional networks to settle their transactions with digital fiat currency on the same blockchain networks,"" said Jesse Lund, IBM's head of blockchain services for financial institutions, at the time.  IBM plans to demo the product at the Sibos banking conference in October, according to a report.  With it's move into blockchain payments, IBM will be competing with industry startup Ripple, which already offers several similar products aimed at institutions, such as xCurrent and xRapid, that have been seeing increasing usage globally.  A number of notable institutions are also working towards their own similar products, with GMO, Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial and others recently announcing moves in the space.  IBM has been working with the stellar project since last October, indicating in March that it is interested in expanding the business applications of cryptocurrencies.  Lund told CoinDesk at the time:  ""What's happening is there's this emergence of a new segment that could actually be one of the biggest segments, that is a permissioned but public blockchain network typology.""

42429634,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0D7h,1536059114,Bitcoin Price Indicator Turns Bullish for First Time in 8 Months,"The list of indicators signaling a long-term bullish reversal in bitcoin (BTC) continues to grow with each passing week.  The latest to join the list is the MACD histogram, which has moved above zero – turned bullish – for the first time since January. The MACD, which oscillates above and below the zero line, is one of the most popular technical indicators used to determine a trend's reversal and momentum.  A bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed when the histogram moves above the zero line. On the other hand, a bearish reversal is confirmed when it dips below zero.  The bullish turn of the MACD adds credence to BTC's strong defense of the psychological support of $6,000 in the last 10 weeks.  Further, it validates bearish exhaustion indicated by BTC's long-tailed monthly candle and the record low net shorts in the BTC futures market.  At press time, BTC is trading at $7,320 on Bitfinex, representing a 0.8 percent appreciation on a 24-hour basis.  BTC weekly chart  As seen in the chart above, the histogram has moved above the zero line for the first time since January. More importantly, the bullish turn in the MACD is accompanied by a falling channel breakout (bullish pattern).  So, it seems safe to say that the outlook as per the weekly chart is bullish. As a result, BTC could explore the upside towards the July highs above $8,500 in the next few weeks.  While the long-term picture is looking rosy, the cryptocurrency could drop to $7,000 (psychological support) in the next day or two, if the wedge pattern seen in the chart below ends with a downside break.  4-hour chart  The rising trendline has been breached, so BTC could dip below the wedge support of $7,230 in the next few hours.  On the other hand, a high volume bullish breakout would signal a continuation of the rally from the August low of $5,859.  View  A combination of the falling channel breakout and the bullish weekly MACD indicates scope for a rally to the July highs above $8,500.  For the next 24 hours, the investors need to keep an eye on the pennant pattern seen in the 4-hour chart. A bullish breakout could yield a rally to $7,500, while a downside break would shift risk in favor of a drop to $7,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

According to the EOS white paper, these perks are likely to make the system ""gain more widespread adoption,"" and some dapp developers apparently spot an opportunity.  For instance, Kevin Rose, the co-founder of EOS New York, a block producer, an entity that performs a similar function to miners in other blockchain networks, told CoinDesk:  ""I'm having conversations with at least one group a week about, 'These are the challenges we're having on so-and-so platform, we want to come onto EOS.'""  Rose mentioned Tixico, which announced that it would transition from ethereum due to EOS' ""better performance and scalability to serve high demand.""  Yet, the grass may not be as green as some dapp developers hope.  That's because, whereas ethereum dapps can be costly for the ones using them, EOS dapps can be costly for the teams deploying them.  In order to onboard users to an EOS dapp, developers generally have to make sure they've secured sufficient amounts of three separate resources: RAM, which amounts to state storage on the blockchain; CPU, which measures average consumption of computing resources in microseconds; and network bandwidth, or NET, which measures average consumption in bytes.  And getting these resources has proved costly.  Yutin Chen, CEO of PandaFun, a game that recently launched on EOS, said the team bought 10,000 EOS worth of RAM or around $65,000 at current EOS prices. The company also staked 10,000 EOS for CPU and 1,000 EOS for NET. Although, Chen made it clear that most of the RAM would go toward an upcoming token sale, saying, ""The game doesn't cost that much.""  By contrast, deploying a smart contract to ethereum only costs a bit of gas, whether it houses functionality for a dapp or a token contract. The cost of deploying the ethereum smart contracts could be $1 or $100, but it's a far cry from what it would cost on EOS.  Ultimately, that's not only a problem for the developers, but also EOS users.  For instance, some dapps might begin shifting expenses back onto users, to the extent that's possible. And others might do what would-be dapps on ethereum are doing, and decide to launch elsewhere.  RAM: Speculators and hackers  Arguably the biggest headache for developers right now is RAM, as the resource has to be bought at a changing market price using EOS, with trades taking place on the Bancor algorithm.  Each dapp user takes 4 kilobytes of RAM to onboard for developers. According to the current RAM price, that's around $3.12 per user. RAM is necessary for other actions as well, besides just creating an account.  And as such, Rose told CoinDesk:  ""We do not understand the total costs of onboarding a dapp user yet. I don't think that that data […] could give us confidence in an average of sorts.""  Even before the EOS mainnet launched in June, an open issue of GitHub (which has received 60 replies since it was created) argues that the RAM model ""simply can't work if your target is to create tens or hundreds of million user accounts for your dapp!""  And at the time that was written, RAM prices were far cheaper.  Following the launch, however, speculators jumped on the limited available RAM in hopes of selling it later at a profit. This drove prices as high as 0.94 EOS per KB – eight times higher than the current level.  In response to the spiking price, block producers decided to double the total supply of RAM, adding 64 GB over the following year at the rate of 1 KB per block. This move has so far helped to calm the market.  The issue around RAM, though, isn't just how expensive it is.  It is also vulnerable. In August it emerged that attackers could eat up an account's RAM, using a notification feature to stuff the target's available RAM with useless data. Developers can avoid this attack by sending tokens through proxy smart contracts that contain no RAM, but that adds another step developers must take into account.  The issue was serious enough for EOS' chief architect to weigh in. Dan Larimer, CTO of Block.One, the company that developed the protocol and held the $4 billion EOS ICO, wrote that block producers could free up maliciously consumed RAM by enforcing the principle that ""intent of code is law.""  While that rule is contained in Larimer's proposed revision to the EOS ""constitution,"" a set of bylaws that network participants are in theory held to, the problem is that the constitution has not been adopted, because the voting system necessary to do so hasn't been implemented yet.  CPU: WE LOVE BM  EOS' other two network resources, CPU and NET, haven't received as much attention, but CPU in particular could squeeze both developers and users.  These resources work differently from RAM. Rather than being bought and sold, they're obtained through staking, in which a network participant delegates EOS tokens to a particular kind of smart contract.  When the network is not being fully utilized, participants can get an outsized amount of CPU time for a relatively modest stake. In theory, that should mean early adopters don't need very large stakes for the time being.  After all, according to Dapp Radar, just a handful of EOS dapps have more than 100 daily users, so how strapped for CPU could the network be?  As it turns out, a spammer has stepped in to fill the void. A single account, Blocktwitter, has been ""sharing messages comprising of 192 million actions, which is about 95 percent of all EOS transactions to date,"" said Tom Fu, a partner at standby block producer GenerEOS.  Nearly all of them say simply ""WE LOVE BM,"" a reference to Larimer's nom-de-net, bytemaster. As Fu put it, the messages are ""not important.""  But they're still having an impact, due to Blocktwittter's high CPU stake. Users, as well as developers, are seeing their allotted CPU times get squeezed due to all the spamming.  Fu told CoinDesk:  ""RAM can be pushed onto users, however, CPU cannot. In this sense whoever executes the action needs to have the CPU staked in their account.""  A recent Reddit post by an EOS Knights player underscores this point. The user wrote that they delegated 10 EOS – $59 worth – to play the game, thinking that would be enough, but actually it wasn't even close. EOS Knights suggests staking at least 15 EOS ($88) on CPU to play the game, but the Reddit user claimed that even a $500 stake would not meet the recommended required CPU time.  As such, Larimer has proposed a model for renting CPU and NET, which he writes ""will lower the cost of using the EOS network.""  Worth it?  Yet, it may be overly simplistic to say that ethereum pushes costs onto users, while EOS pushes costs onto developers.  ""There are use cases where a developer can write a dapp where the user has to bring their own CPU and/or [NET] and/or RAM to the interaction,"" former Block.One VP of product Thomas Cox said, adding: ""that's one way to write an early version of your dapp that won't bankrupt you if it suddenly gets popular.""  One thing that is clear is that EOS dapp developers will have to think hard about their business models, perhaps more so than their counterparts on ethereum.  In the final analysis, though, EOS might have its advantages, according to Cox.  For one, whereas a popular dapp like CryptoKitties can clog the entire ethereum network, EOS staking does guarantee a certain minimum access to CPU.  Another potential advantage is that unlike ethereum's gas, investments in EOS resources can be recouped. Tokens staked on CPU can be unstaked, and RAM can be sold – perhaps at a lower price, though.  Finally, Cox said, ethereum dapp developers are ""one bug away from bankruptcy.""  EOS' arbitration system has been the subject of considerable controversy, but it does provide some recourse and the potential to avoid a DAO- or Parity-type fiasco.  As such, Cox posed, but didn't answer, the question:  ""What's that worth?""

42401890,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2j22,1536034251,ASX Postpones Roll-Out of Blockchain Settlement System,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has pushed back the launch of a blockchain replacement for the decades-old CHESS clearing and settlement system until the second quarter of 2021.  The ASX published a new report on Tuesday in response to public feedback on a consultation paper it published in April for the new system. The company expected at the time the new system would go live by the end of 2020.  The exchange said it had received 41 written submissions from various stakeholders in the process, such as clearing and settlement participants, payment providers and market operators.  Based on the responses, the ASX decided to postpone the targeted go-live time to March or April 2021. It will also extend a user development testing period and an industry-wide testing phase for another six months each prior to the official implementation.  The reason for the delay was cited as concerns raised by respondents over ""whether the proposed implementation window of Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 was achievable given the significance of the technology change and the range of new scope being introduced.""  The ASX went on to explain that ""there was a common view in responses that too much new functionality was being proposed to be implemented in too short a timeframe,"" adding:  ""It was argued that this would result in increased complexity and risk across project phases and in the implementation timeframe.""  As such, seven features of the blockchain system that the ASX initially planned to include at launch will be released at a later stage, such as settlement in foreign currencies and a reporting feature for showing account balance information.  Further, the ASX cautioned that the new features that will be available to users at launch will also depend on potential risk issues and regulatory clearance.  The ASX has been exploring how to adopt distributed ledger technology since 2015, announcing last year that it will launch a blockchain-based settlement system in an effort to cut operational costs and to boost transaction efficiency.  The revised implementation timeline follows recent remarks made by the exchange's managing director and CEO Dominic Stevens that the new system will be able to save as much as $23 billion once implemented.

42401877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2irD,1536026444,There's a Problem With Crypto Funding – And Vitalik Just Might Have a Solution,"There are free-riders in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  At least, that's the contention of a new paper, shared with CoinDesk on Monday, written by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Microsoft researcher Glen Weyl and Ph.D. of economics at Harvard, Zoë Hitzig.  And free-riders pose a problem.  Described in the paper, free-riders are people or businesses that profit from the under-provision of public goods. And, on top of that, ""the more people [these public goods] benefit the more they will be under-provided."" It's an issue that plagues development even outside the cryptocurrency space, but the authors are – at least – initially focused on how the idea creates harmful incentives for the funding of blockchain projects.  Whereas currently, crypto development teams rely largely on donations, the altruistic whims of their creators, and ICOs — the paper details a new financing method to support a ""self-organizing ecosystem of public goods.""  Titled ""Liberal Radicalism: Formal Rules for a Society Neutral among Communities,"" the method described – a system written in code – seeks to allow groups to allocate funds for the maintenance of public goods and services without becoming vulnerable to the ""free-rider"" problem.  The mechanism is similar in principle to Quadratic Voting, a form of stake-based voting championed by Weyl in a recent book, ""Radical Markets.""  While Quadratic Voting allows participants to vote with crypto tokens according to how much they care about an issue, Liberal Radicalism (LR) expands the same concept to how communities contribute to public goods, such as software development, cryptocurrencies and journalism.  And it works by increasing the funding of projects incrementally depending on the number of participants and the degree to which they care about the issue at hand.  ""Individuals make public goods' contributions to projects of value to them. The amount received by the project is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received,"" the paper states.  And while the authors have ambitions for the technology that are far-reaching (including applying the code to municipal projects and campaign financing) cryptocurrency communities, with their open-minded attitudes towards experimentation, are a ""particularly appropriate"" testing ground for the technology.  Speaking to CoinDesk, co-author of the paper Hitzig said that interest is already building between many different groups. That currently includes about ""a half dozen"" cryptocurrency communities looking to potentially implement the technology, as well as ""other innovators and philanthropists.""  As such, Hitzig told CoinDesk:  ""Once we circulate the paper we expect that experimentation will begin in earnest shortly thereafter.""  The crisis of liberalism  The new paper is part of an ongoing collaboration between Buterin and Weyl since the publication of the latter's ""Radical Markets"" book.  As detailed by CoinDesk, the duo co-authored a blog post in May, in which the authors discussed their shared interest to ""harness markets and technology to radically decentralize power of all sorts and shift our reliance from authority and to formal rules.""  For this collaboration, Hitzig told CoinDesk, the key focus is on using technological insights to solve growing political tensions.  ""This set of ideas goes from the ground up — we offer solutions to localized, real-world problems, and then demonstrate how these proposals fit into a coherent political philosophy that solves important aspects of the crisis of modern liberalism,"" Hitzig said.  Defining liberalism as the guiding principle underlying The Enlightenment era, the authors summarize the trend as ""an anti-authoritarian commitment to neutrality across ways of living and valuing.""  Expanding upon that idea, Hitzig said, ""the crisis of modern liberalism"" stems from an ""unhappy marriage"" of capitalism and democracy that ""produces frictions that make it highly inflexible, inefficient and actually fundamentally illiberal.""  Hitzig, who is a poet and an economist that was drawn to the idea of Quadratic Voting, continued:  ""These tensions are increasingly manifesting in discontent with existing liberal democratic systems and the rise of authoritarian populist alternatives on both the left and right.""  Indeed, the paper looks to solve those issues and create a more cooperative society.  Aligning the ethos  In addition to the incremental funding mechanism LR proposes, there are some additional characteristics that the authors believe will significantly benefit the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  For example, small contributions are heavily subsidized, while large contributions are not.  As such, according to the authors, ""Under the standard selfish, independent, private values, quasi-linear utility framework, our mechanism leads to the utilitarian optimal provision of a self-organizing ecosystem of public goods.""  The paper notes that this could have an immediate impact on projects like ethereum, zcash and other projects that rely on non-profits to distribute funding to the development of the network.  This process of grant-making is ""reasonably centralized,"" according to the paper, relying on the curatorial judgment of a select group of individuals, and is therefore ""both poorly attuned to the needs of the communities and, perhaps more importantly, antithetical to the principles of decentralized authority on which they were founded.""  LR, on the other hand, hopes to create a form of financing that better leverages the wisdom of the crowds, and align financing better with the ethos of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  Not just math  While it might seem strange to have such a highly interdisciplinary science — combining technology, economics and politics — Hitzig said that it's a very important combination.  ""To us, it's strange that collaborations across the social sciences, philosophy and technology aren't more commonplace,"" she said. ""Technology is changing society at breakneck speed – economists, political scientists and philosophers have the conceptual tools to understand the potential economic and political consequences of that change and to guide it into its most socially valued uses.""  Still, LR isn't a mechanism that can be deployed and widely adopted right away.  For one, it hasn't been fully tested in the wild and may be vulnerable to unanticipated attacks or economic quirks. Secondly, the mechanism relies heavily on identity systems, meaning that for now, it can't coexist with anonymity, which is highly important to many people in the space. Plus, certain kinds of known vote attacks could mean that LR might need people to use trusted hardware, which some warn come with their own security trade-offs.  As such, Hitzig said there's further work to be done to make the technology usable to a wide number of people — potentially working with artists and designers who can describe the method in different ways.  ""We are aware that the mechanism may seem esoteric at first, and thus worry about a situation in which LR becomes a nice abstraction that never gets put to work and that only a select few understand,"" Hitzig told CoinDesk.  But above all else, Hitzig hopes that by publishing the paper – even though it is imperfect — it will encourage others to think about these problems and either build on top of LR or experiment with their own solutions.
