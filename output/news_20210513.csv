As part of the new policy, the leading U.S. exchange will be listing meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin in the next six to eight weeks. Coinbase sat on the sidelines this year as competing exchanges raked in untold millions in trading fees on DOGE, a cryptocurrency that was started as a joke but has exploded in popularity.      Speaking on the company's Q1 earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong said Coinbase is also accelerating its process for listing coins to include digital assets that have just been minted. In the future the company will try to be the first exchange to list what are called “debut” coins or cryptocurrencies that have just been minted and are seeing their first day of trading volume.      “We’re going to have to do this in the future – be the first to list a number of these coins,” CEO Brian Armstrong said.      Currently, the company evaluates cryptocurrencies based on the security of the digital asset and whether or not it could potentially be deemed a security. Coins listings like those for Internet Computer (ICP), The Graph (GRT) and Ampleforth Governance Token (FORTH) have been the first time the exchange has listed coins with no volume. Currently, there is a backlog of assets that the exchange needs to get to, and it’s working on accelerating its entire coin listing process, Armstrong added.

The storied quant fund manager of $115 billion ended Q1 with 1.16 million Riot Blockchain shares ($61.8 million), 1.56 million Marathon shares ($75 million) and 203,672 Canaan shares ($4.2 million), according to Thursday disclosures.      Renaissance Technologies has chased crypto mining’s upside since at least 2017 with occasional bets on MARA, RIOT and CAN. But those positions had never eclipsed $1 million, and the hedge fund ended 2020 with no exposure to the crypto mining sector at all.      Crypto mining stocks rallied to new heights during the recent bull run, giving U.S. investors a sideways route to speculate on crypto without actually owning any. RIOT and MARA actually outperformed bitcoin at times.      The combined positions far outstrip RenTech’s 2020 positions in MicroStrategy, another crypto bellwether stock that raced upward with bitcoin’s rise. In fact, RenTech, which at one point held over $40 million in MSTR, according to The Block, appears to have closed out its MSTR holdings, ending Q1 2021 with no MSTR on the books.

A bearish tweet from the entrepreneur on bitcoin and Tesla reneging on using it as a payment method sent crypto markets dropping.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $48,769 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 10% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $47,720-$54,781 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $3,651 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Dropping 10% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,595-$4,243 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin fails to find market bottom    Bitcoin was down 10% Thursday as of press time and going as low as $47,720 around 01:00 UTC (9 p.m. ET). The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.      One fundamental reason for bitcoin’s drop: Tesla. Bitcoin’s price has been in a very defined range over the past two weeks but the electric car maker’s announcement Wednesday that it would stop accepting BTC because of environmental issues related to bitcoin mining led to immediate selling that spilled into the next day.      “What saddens me is the way the weak hands and recent buyers see Elon Musk as a prophet, powerhouse and decisive figure in bitcoin,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a bitcoin over-the-counter trader.      Bitcoin's price has tumbled 17% since Sunday, on track for the worst weekly performance since February.      “The BTC chart structure is very weak and there is not any significant positive trigger for BTC to move higher,” said Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani.    Musk bites DOGE    Some analysts lament Musk's ability to sway crypto prices, with even dogecoin (DOGE) at his mercy.      DOGE is down 32% so far this week, after the price failed to pump when the billionaire entrepreneur appeared as host of the long-running comedy show ""Saturday Night Live.""      “If anything, what this is revealing is the sensitivity of the new money in the space,” said Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “Right now, the drivers are mostly macro, and hence correlation to other assets is back in the cards.”      Tesla’s stock is down 3.1%. Its 2021 performance has been poor, down over 22% so far.    More volatility?    In the bitcoin derivatives market, it appears traders are doing less hedging. A Forbes article Thursday points to traders cashing out short positions on CME as bitcoin fell.      Data from Skew also suggests a large number of sell liquidations on the futures market occurred during the past 24 hours, maxing at over $400 million in selling around 22:00 UTC (6 p.m. ET) Wednesday.      However, traders may want to start hedging more often because Delta Exchange’s Balani expects choppy waters ahead for crypto.      “Now there is a clear negative trigger that can lead to a large correction in BTC and altcoins,” he said. “Given a breakdown of crucial support levels in BTC, volatility in BTC and alts is going to be higher.”      Read More: MicroStrategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin, Adds Another $15M    Ether dropping, DEXs pumping    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $3,651 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), down 10% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.      Despite the drop, there is at least one long-term fundamental positive for ether: The use of decentralized finance, or DeFi, on Ethereum. According to data aggregator Dune Analytics, Wednesday was the highest volume day in the past month for decentralized exchanges, or DEXs. Uniswap, as usual, led the way with $3.7 billion in volume.      While the market may be dipping and volatility may crop up,Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, is focused on the core technologies of crypto and the value they may unlock for a bull case over the long haul.      “For many crypto assets such as bitcoin and ethereum, the long-term story has not changed,” said Peters. “This emerging asset class continues to revolutionize many aspects of financial services. And while nothing goes up in a straight line, the long-term fundamentals for crypto assets remain as solid as ever.”      Read More: Crypto App Alice Raises $2M for US-Centric Terra DeFi Portal    Other markets    Despite a down crypto day, analysts expect altcoins to continue to flourish.      “Overall, the market is now being driven by alternative assets that are able to innovate faster than bitcoin and ethereum,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer of quant firm Global Digital Assets. “This provides a massive opportunity for new networks to test and build innovations faster that bring over value away from bitcoin and ethereum.”      Technical analyst Katie Stockton from Fairlead Strategies likes stellar (XLM) and cardano (ADA), while she is bearish on dogecoin. “Note that dogecoin has assumed an unfavorable trajectory relative to bitcoin over the past week, while stellar and cardano have the best short-term relative strength outlooks,” she said.

42434349,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCAVh,1620938003,Crypto Directory Shows Continued Interest in Monero Adoption,"The adoption of Monero by merchants and retailers continues to rise. That’s according to updated metrics from Cryptwerk, an online directory of companies, websites, shops and services where people can pay with bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies, such as monero.      Monero is one of the more prominent and popularly transacted privacy coins in the cryptocurrency field, with almost $7 billion in market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.      Currently, monero is accepted at over 950 merchants on the site. In July of 2018, for comparison, only 41 merchants on Cryptwerk accepted monero.      In the month of May alone, the number of merchants accepting monero on the platform rose by 31. The majority of merchants are also located in the U.S., which captured nearly 25% of merchants listed. The next closest was Russia, with just over 10%.      There are 208 discounts and special offers if users pay with XMR. Cryptwerk also lists 28 payment gateways that allow merchants to accept XMR.      Monero was the eighth-ranked coin out of 25 on the platform, in terms of its popularity with merchants.      The continued interest tracks as well with Monero’s own figures, looking at figures from April 2020 to April 2021. In that period Monero transactions grew from around 10,000 transactions per day to 23,000 transactions per day. During that same period. Monero's blockchain size grew 180% faster year over year, while the average transaction size dropped 13.76%.      Responding to Cryptwerk's Reddit post, some users sought to add their companies to the directory.      The concentration of merchants in the U.S. was interesting given that privacy coins have been under scrutiny.      Last year, law firm Perkins Coie released a white paper contending that privacy-enabling cryptocurrencies were not in need of specific and ratched-up AML regulations. Parts of the paper pointed to the fact that these cryptocurrencies were no more risky than things like cash, for example.      “Ultimately, absent evidence that existing AML regulations cannot adequately address the risks posed by privacy coins, there is no reason to impose new and overbroad AML requirements that specifically target privacy coins,"" wrote the authors.

42434366,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCAzh,1620937764,What If Somebody Hacks the Money Pipeline Next?,"A revealing new detail has emerged in the saga of the Colonial Pipeline. The key gasoline distribution link was shut down for six days following a hack, causing gas shortages across the southeast United States. According to a CNN report, though, the main target of the hack wasn’t pumps or switching stations or other physical pipeline infrastructure. Instead, the hackers went after the money.      “The company halted operations because its billing system was compromised,” sources told CNN. The pipeline’s operators “were concerned they wouldn't be able to figure out how much to bill customers for fuel they received.”    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist.    The Colonial shutdown is just the latest in a drumbeat of examples of the rising threat of cyberattacks. Ransomware attacks are rapidly approaching crisis levels, while cyberespionage between nations also continues to accelerate. Most recently, the reportedly Russian-backed Solarwinds attack burrowed deep into a still-unclear number of systems, with ramifications likely to last years.      Despite the rising tide of hugely damaging hacks, many nations’ central banks are pursuing the creation of new digital systems that would be major hacking targets: central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. The goal of these systems, broadly, is to allow users to directly hold central bank dollars in a digital form, rather than through an intervening bank or payments platform. Central banks already do this in the form of physical banknotes, and so creating ""digital cash"" isn’t a wild stretch of their mandate.      But CBDC systems, while nominally influenced by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, are unlikely to be based on the distributed blockchain technology that keeps cryptocurrency base layers essentially hack-proof. That means the systems could become an unimaginably alluring target for hackers – with potential disruptions even bigger than the shutdown of a crucial gasoline pipeline.    Read more: US Will Not Race China to Develop a CBDC: Fed Chairman Powell    The targeting of the pipeline’s financial system, rather than its valves or switches, highlights the fundamentally heightened cybersecurity risk that accompanies conventional digital finance. While it’s true that more and more infrastructure is digitally connected in one way or another, it’s still generally a very challenging and long-term process to compromise those systems. Attacks like the Stuxnet worm, which the U.S. and Israel allegedly used to physically damage Iranian nuclear facilities, take many years and state-scale resources to execute.      The Colonial hackers, at least for now, appear to have been a freelance criminal gang rather than state actors. Because they had more limited resources, it’s little surprise that they aimed for the softer target of financial records (It’s also a matter of strategy: Though it could turn out to be a misdirection, the gang said in a statement that their goal was to make money, not disrupt the pipeline). Interfering with such records is fundamentally easier than disrupting physical infrastructure, for the simple reason that for the most part they are purely digital. Changing numbers in a computing system (or, in this case, just locking the files) is pretty much always more straightforward than using that same system to change the physical world.      That core vulnerability of digital money is what necessitated the unwieldy but nigh-impenetrable blockchain system securing bitcoin. Any central bank digital currency has to solve the same problem, but politics makes the same solution impractical: The security of a cryptocurrency like bitcoin is inextricable from the fact that nobody truly controls it. Most central banks, which ultimately must be responsive to governments, can’t make that trade-off.      But CBDCs could still introduce decentralized security by taking carefully selected pages from the crypto playbook. One might be “elements of node validation” similar to the way blockchains rely on many copies of a ledger, according to J.P. Schnapper-Casteras, a lawyer who works with the Atlantic Council on CBDC research and consulting. At least in broad outline, that would make it impossible for a FedCoin to be hit with the same kind of attack that took down Colonial’s system by locking up financial data housed in one central location.      Similarly, one proposed “two-tier” CBDC design would allow various versions of a piece of software to interact according to standards established by central banks. While a fully centralized system with uniform code could be leveled by one vulnerability, a diverse codebase makes cyberattacks harder to scale, increasing security.      Even more crucial is the use of open-source software to build CBDCs. Releasing source code publicly, along with incentives like bug bounty programs, means legions of white-hat hackers can and will scrutinize it for bugs. “Open-source systems have proven to be more enduring, more reliable, [and] more extensible over time,” says Schnapper-Casteras. That’s why much of the internet now runs on software that was battle-tested in the open-source arena, such as Apache and Linux. And bitcoin is famously open-source, with a particularly arcane and bureaucratic update process that prevents unnecessary changes that might introduce security risks.    Read more: CBDCs and Stablecoins: The Regulatory Battle to Come    But that option is likely unavailable to arguably the most influential player in CBDCs – the People’s Bank of China. Its “digital yuan” is widely believed to be subject to major centralized surveillance and censorship, ""features"" that would likely be highlighted if its code were public.      That would seriously interfere with another apparent goal of China's project: driving greater usage of the yuan outside China. But it also means the system can’t be robustly tested for security vulnerabilities. Lack of transparency could in turn box the PBOC out of negotiating standards for international CBDC interoperability. “I’m not sure if China and the U.S. will be playing at the same standards-setting bodies at the end of the day,” Schnapper-Casteras says.      Though things are still quite early, the U.S. Fed may be more amenable to making its system open-source. The Boston Fed last year launched a CBDC research program with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and will reportedly be releasing not just its ideas, but also its code, in July.      That's one major reason why, though much has been made of China’s first-mover status on CBDCs, Schnapper-Casteras and others think that being careful will ultimately be more important than being fast.      “In terms of being deliberate about security choices and having an open-source codebase, it could in the long run be a major advantage and source of strength,” Schnapper-Contreras says. “Because you don’t want to roll out something super quick and have it be buggy. That would be a disaster.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

The U.S.' largest cryptocurrency exchange boosted its year forecast range for active users, a key metric.      For the Q1, Coinbase reported:    Net income $771.5 million, preliminary $730 million to $800 million.  Adjusted EBITDA $1.12 billion, preliminary $1.1 billion.  Revenue $1.8 billion with $1.54 billion from transaction revenue and $56.4 million from Subscriptions and Services revenue, preliminary $1.8 billion.  Transaction revenue from institutions increased eightfold from $10 million in Q1 2020 to $85 million in Q1 2021.  Growth in custodial fee, earn campaign, and staking revenues. Custodial fee revenue was $23.5 million or 41.6% of what the firm made in subscriptions and services. Staking followed with $10.3 million, and $4 million of staking revenue came from the Bison Trails acquisition.  Total operating expenses were $813 million in the quarter. The exchange spent the most on transaction expenses, which cost $234.1 million.  Coinbase had 1,717 employees at the end of the quarter, a 96% increase from the same period last year.  The exchange had 6.1 million Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs), matching the preliminary figure.  Trading volume was at $335 billion; $120 billion from retail trading and $215 billion from institutional trading.  The company boosted its year forecast range for MTUs to 5.5 million to 9 million, up from its earlier predicted range of 4 million to 7 million.  Average net revenue per user has been $34 to $45 during the past two years, the company said. The low part of that range occurred in 2019.

Then the part we don’t see: Finance and insurance are 8.4% of the gross domestic product in the U.S., only slightly behind manufacturing. That means millions taking the subway or driving to the office – or, the pandemic equivalent, firing up an army of laptops and call centers – to sling paper money under fiat’s harsh fluorescent glow.

Beyond the human toll, each recession has brought trillions in wealth destruction, wealth that took an enormous amount of resources and, yes, an enormous amount of carbon to create.      To translate this recession cost into something that can be compared to Bitcoin, I relied on the most mainstream estimates of the carbon cost of a dollar of GDP – about 5,000 BTU (British thermal units), or 1.5 kWh (kilowatt hour), per dollar. Then, using the Federal Reserve’s own estimate of $11 trillion destroyed peak to trough in the 2008 crisis – the very crisis that inspired Satoshi to create Bitcoin – you simply multiply the two. That comes out to 16,500 TWh (terawatt hour) of carbon equivalence destroyed during that single recession. Accounting for the rest of the world, that might triple. Accounting for the other 16 recessions the Fed has given us – with more to come – makes it astronomical.    Read more: Nic Carter – The Virgin Bitcoin Fallacy  Bitcoin, by implication, is among the most green technologies humanity has ever invented.    The modern recession and the boom-bust cycle that drives it is entirely a creation of fiat money. Governments intervene in the allocation of capital, randomly starting and stopping a fire hose of credit that whipsaws the real economy and destroys real lives. Just as the cost of a five-second delay in a footrace can be measured in distance lost, the cost of a recession can be measured by the resources it will take to rebuild lost wealth. Bitcoin, by taking purchasing power out of central banks’ manipulation space, can reduce or even eliminate their ability to cause boom-bust cycles.      Even Bitcoin’s worst critics allege the distributed network consumes no more than 86 TWh per year, of which perhaps 16 TWh might be Americans, with much of that green energy. It would take between 500 and 1,000 years for Bitcoin’s energy use to even approach the 2008 crisis alone. With another recession permanently on the way, over and over again. That 500 to 1,000 years’ worth of energy goes on top of the 8.4% of GDP, the 80,000 bank branches and 470,000 ATMs and those skyscrapers.      These ratios suggest that central banks are vastly more polluting than Bitcoin, indeed more polluting than the worst industrial offender you could imagine. Bitcoin, by implication, is among the most green technologies humanity has ever invented. Indeed, if Bitcoin even slightly reduces central banks’ ability to cause recessions, it could pay back every watt many times over. For example, if Bitcoin reduces the odds or magnitude of central bank recessions by just 2%, Bitcoin would actually save us far more energy than it uses – it would be net carbon negative.    Read more: The Myths and Realities of ‘Green Bitcoin’    Of course, collateral damage from fiat doesn’t end at recessions. Inflation, business cycles and money printing lead to economic chaos and human misery, bailouts of politically connected industries and fiat-subsidized wars – with carbon footprints and human costs all their own. Fiat money perverts the natural symbiosis between taxpayer and tax collector, whereby governments do well when we do well, by allowing governments to magic up what they need via the printing press.      Given we live in a world of irresponsible governments, bankers with senators on speed dial and still-immature altcoins, Bitcoin remains the safest bet for reducing the enormous energy waste and human cost of rebuilding our economy over and over again.      Skipping the roof on your new house may be green in the moment, but not if you have to rebuild every 5.6 years. If you really do prioritize the environment, help Bitcoin shut down the most polluting industry on Earth: central banking.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Peter St. Onge,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/13/whats-the-carbon-footprint-of-fiat-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cadd58fe3b27a2d63f2a968e8fc62e015bb6b1be-1000x706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434360,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCAbh,1620930329,"Coinbase’s First-Ever Q1 Earnings Report Is Today, but the Real Focus Is on Q2 View","Coinbase is set to report detailed financials for the first time on Thursday just after 4 p.m. ET.      While the exchange released preliminary first-quarter earnings results in April just ahead of its direct listing on Nasdaq, the results on Thursday will include more specific numbers on expenses and cash levels at the exchange.      Even with the extra financial insight, however, analysts will be more focused on the second quarter than on the first quarter in order to get a clue on where the company’s shares are heading.      Some guidance would likely be appreciated as opinions about where COIN stock is headed are wildly divergent. In the past week, Nashville, Tenn.-based New Constructs said that COIN could fall to $100 or less, while Oppenheimer gave a price target of $434.      ""They'll be almost halfway through the quarter by the time they report on Thursday,"" said Gil Luria, D.A. Davidson's head of institutional research. ""The commentary about how things are going right now is going to be what everybody really pays attention to.""      In recent trading, shares of COIN were down 9.5% at $256.54, just above the reference price of $250. That's the price market makers said the stock should start trading at when it was first listed.      Shares are falling after Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of bitcoin's most vocal supporters, said yesterday that Tesla was suspending accepting bitcoin as payment because of concerns about the cryptocurrency's impact on the environment. Investors will almost certainly be scanning Coinbase's release for any comment on Musk’s action.      Jamie Friedman, senior fintech research analyst at Susquehanna International Group, said in an email that he will be looking for monthly figures for April and May on trading volume and the number of users conducting transactions on the exchange. Friedman said he is also looking for comments on recent partnerships and on regulation.      Davidson's Luria will also be watching for how much of the trading volume was institutional versus retail and for any additional information on transaction fees for trading.      ""They get paid on trades and they get paid a lot more for consumer activity than institutional activity,"" Luria said.      Lisa Ellis, senior equity analyst at MoffetNathanson, said that she is interested to see how Coinbase plans to make crypto brokerage services become more mainstream by possibly forming partnerships with the likes of Fidelity and Charles Schwab. She said that would “go far to de-risk the bear thesis on the stock,” which is that other crypto exchanges could grab customers from Coinbase by undercutting it on price, leading to a race to the bottom on fees.      In April, Coinbase announced its users could buy cryptocurrency using their PayPal accounts. The fees for using PayPal are much higher than other ways of purchasing crypto from the exchange.      “There’s like a handful of big retail brokerages and big retail wallets,” Ellis said. “If they lock up partnerships with a few of them, then it goes far to de-risking that.”      Ellis added that she is also interested in an update on the Bison Trails acquisition, which could be a “huge area of growth” for the company. In January, Coinbase said it agreed to buy Bison Trails, a blockchain infrastructure company.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/13/coinbases-first-ever-q1-earnings-report-is-today-but-the-real-focus-is-on-q2-view,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abde4b9c828987cb3def92297650f575529c3258-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434350,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCATh,1620926071,Binance's Indian Crypto Exchange Lists SHIB Token as Vitalik Gift Garners Local Press,"The memecoin mania has reached Indian shores – just as prices for digital tokens from dogecoin to the shiba inu coin are falling this week.      The Mumbai-based WazirX exchange, owned by the giant cryptocurrency exchange Binance, listed the shiba inu (SHIB) token on Thursday. The dog-themed token has been referred to by some cryptocurrency analysts as a dogecoin (DOGE) imitator, but shibu inu, in its own marketing materials, hails itself as a ""dogecoin killer.""      ""We were receiving a lot of requests from our community to bring SHIB on WazirX, and hence, we decided to list it,"" CEO Nischal Shetty told CoinDesk.      WazirX listed dogecoin on April 1, when DOGE was trading at around 6 cents. Even after a market crash on Wednesday, dogecoin is up more than sixfold since then, at about 40 cents.      The SHIB token is available on WazirX for trading against the Indian rupee (INR) and stablecoin tether (USDT). But according to its official blog, the exchange does not accept direct SHIB deposits or facilitate SHIB withdrawals.      WazirX's listing comes a day after Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin donated 50 trillion SHIB tokens, worth $995 million at press time, to the India Covid Relief Fund, which was started last month by layer 2 scaling solution Polygon's founder, Sandeep Nailwal.      Buterin's donation garnered plenty of attention from mainstream Indian media with the likes of Indian Express, Economic Times and Mint taking note of the market action that followed Ethereum founder's philanthropic gesture.      ""Soon after he made his donation public, holders of ‘memecoins’ began to panic and the prices of these currencies began to drop,"" according to the Indian Express.      SHIB token fell by 40% on Thursday and was last seen changing hands at $0.00001981, according to CoinGecko.      Earlier this week, the Mumbai-based CoinDCX exchange also launched a spot market for SHIB pairs. CoinDCX listed DOGE in February.      Of course, cryptocurrency experts note that these dog-token projects offer little in the way of promising technological advances or blockchain innovations – with volatile trading action that can seem more like a game or social experiment than a long-term investing strategy.      But the Indian exchanges may be betting that the dog will still hunt.

Not only are these traditional hedge funds setting up dedicated cryptocurrency investment vehicles, plans are afoot to start earning returns using decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, according to the sources, who all asked to remain nameless.      “Point72 is standing up a crypto fund. They are probably six months away from launch with a product,” said one of the people. “Millennium is hiring operations people right now, and Matrix has started to build out a crypto team as well.”      The term “DeFi fund” is being mentioned in connection with those hedge funds, the source added.      DeFi is booming and institutions are edging towards it, trying to figure out how to get a slice of the alpha, or above-market returns, that is commonplace on platforms like Aave, Uniswap and Compound. Even Netherlands bank ING recently released a report diving into the DeFi sector.      Point72, whose entrance into the crypto space was reported earlier Thursday by The Block, declined to comment. Matrix did not answer requests for comment.      After this story was published, a representative of Millennium sought to clarify the hedge fund's position regards crypto via email:      ""We’ve been engaged in crypto trusts, futures, and ETFs. It’s likely we’ll continue to be active in the space.”      Read more: Hedge Fund Billionaire Steven Cohen Is Getting into Crypto      Another of the sources, harking from the cryptocurrency custody world, said they were aware two of the hedge funds mentioned were entering DeFi, without stating which firms. The source said these funds were going beyond simply buying DeFi tokens.      “These very conservative, traditional hedge funds are not just looking to buy these tokens, but are interested in using these protocols,” said the source. “So they're looking to trade on some of these decentralized exchanges. They're looking to provide liquidity on some of these platforms to earn a yield on top of their positions.”      Millennium, the largest of the three, co-founded by fund manager and philanthropist Israel Englander, has close to $50 billion in assets under management (AUM).      Steven A. Cohen’s Point72 has about $17 billion in assets, while Matrix, launched by former Tiger Management trader David Goel, has AUM of around $10 billion.

42434367,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCB3h,1620921427,Elliptic Is Mapping Bitcoin Stolen From 2016 Bitfinex Hack,"Blockchain analysis of the billions of dollars in bitcoin stolen during the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex shows an interesting evolution in the slow and careful laundering of those funds.      Cryptocurrency exchanges may once have been a quick cashing out option, but criminals like the Bitfinex hackers mostly gravitate towards large darknet marketplaces these days, according to research provided exclusively by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.      Meanwhile, privacy wallets like Wasabi Wallet or JoinMarket appear to have become the preferred option over once-popular bitcoin mixing services. (At least 13% of all proceeds of crime in bitcoin were sent through privacy wallets in 2020, according to early data from Elliptic.)      Not everyone will remember the August 2016 Bitfinex hack when almost 120,000 bitcoin (worth $72 million at that time, but now around $7 billion), was stolen from the exchange.      Only about 4% of the stolen bitcoin has been laundered or exchanged to date, and the vast majority has not moved at all, according to Elliptic. However, an uptick in bitcoin’s price may have tempted the thieves into shifting about $100 million worth in November 2020; in April 2021, another $774 million worth of coins were moved.    Too private?    You don't have to be a crypto libertarian to be concerned about privacy on the internet, which seems paradoxically pulled between rules like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the one hand and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements on the other.      Wasabi Wallet, an open-source software that weaves together a collection of bitcoin transactions as an obfuscation tactic, is largely administered and overseen by a private company called zkSNACKs, based in Gibraltar.      This raises an interesting philosophical question, at least from the point of view of blockchain analytics firms like Elliptic, which has been busy tracking bitcoin swiped from Bitfinex.      “Given that Wasabi Wallet is now facilitating a huge proportion of all illicit transactions in crypto, is what zkSNACKs doing, as a company, legal?” said Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson in an interview. “They are effectively doing the same thing as a mixer operator would. So aren’t they going to be in the sights of regulators?”    Wasabi’s stance    There are a couple of important points to note here.      First, the current regulatory regime applies to cryptocurrencies in custodial settings, that is to say where a company like an exchange (virtual asset service provider, or VASP, in regulator speak) takes custody and holds a user’s coins. Applications that are non-custodial, which includes Wasabi Wallet, do not fall within the regulator’s purview. (Although, it’s also worth noting that regulatory guidance is steadily creeping towards non-custodial wallets.)      Second, the “zk” in zkSNACKs stands for “zero knowledge,” a branch of technology that shields any information about the user of the zkSNACKs platform from prying eyes, including from the company itself.      “Police departments from all over the world have knocked on our door, investigating certain transactions,” zkSNACKs CEO and co-founder Bálint Harmat said in an interview, adding:    “They have figured out through blockchain analytics companies that some of the transactions were made through Wasabi Wallet, and they ask whether we can share any kind of personal identification information with them, or IP addresses or whatever.”    Harmat said to the firm’s best knowledge it simply cannot share anything because of the way the software is built.      “Even if we gave someone access to all of our servers, they wouldn't be able to gather any kind of data because we don't have data. This is the way we build the software,” he said.    Gibraltar, where zkSNACKs is based, became a hub for e-gaming back in the early 2000s is proud of its talent for keeping up with innovation including crypto. The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) even has a Distributed Ledger Technology Frameworkhttps://www.fsc.gi/dlt.    The company has touted Gibraltar's laws and regulations on its website and in interviews, without claiming it is under the government's supervision.      ""zkSNACKs will protect processed data in the customer Service process adequately against unauthorized access (of third parties) in accordance with the provisions of the legal framework of Gibraltar as well as the European Union,"" the website says.      Hillebrand told CoinDesk: ""This company was created in Gibraltar where there is clearly stated regulation, that non-custodial transactions or wallets do not fall under these [U.S.] FinCEN regulations. So according to Gibraltar law, this is absolutely legal for the company to exist and to offer the service that it does. It's just like a communication service basically, and not a financial intermediary of some sort.""      But to be clear, a spokesperson for GFSC from the U.S. public relations firm Wachsman stated unequivocally that zkSNACKs is ""NOT regulated in any way by the GFSC (or any other regulator in Gibraltar).""    Made in Gibraltar    Albert Isola, MP, Gibraltar’s minister for Digital and Financial Services, said firms regulated in the jurisdiction should report suspicious activity to the Financial Intelligence Unit (which uses another well-known blockchain analytics firm called Coinfirm).      Asked if the jurisdiction’s Financial Intelligence Unit has received some or any suspicious transaction reports (STRs) relating to Wasabi Wallet and zkSNACKs, Isola said he was not aware how many such reports related to any particular firm.      “I know that we have a significant number of STRs reported by the online gaming community, and also by the blockchain community. So I know that they are reporting, which is what I want to see,” Isola said, adding:    “I think we're in a much better position than we were with cash, if I could use that as an example. Because at least you've got trails and tracks, you can follow. And you can see the movement of these virtual assets.”  Censorship resistance    Elliptic’s Robinson said it’s the very fact that Wasabi is non-custodial that makes it more attractive than previous bitcoin mixers. Wasabi’s centralized forebears ran the risk of things like exit scams – not to mention the possibility that such services could be law enforcement in disguise.      Robinson likened the zkSNACKs scenario to decentralized exchange (DEX) dYdX, which runs a centralized order book but remains non-custodial and settlement happens on-chain.      “Like Wasabi, dYdX never has control of funds, but because they control the order matching they can block orders if they want,” said Robinson. “Therefore, does that mean that they should be checking whether their customers are sanctioned entities, for example, and blocking transactions?”      The fact that zero-knowledge proofs stand in the middle of a protocol like Wasabi Wallet does not change the fact that a firm like zkSNACKs should be aware that bitcoin inputs are coming from something like the Bitfinex hack and take responsibility, Robinson argued.      “They might not know who their users are or where the funds are going, but they are helping criminals to hide their tracks,” said Robinson.    Too public?    A counterargument is that blockchain analytics is not an exact science to begin with.      Firms that have designed and built platforms to protect the privacy of their users and be censorship-resistant are not about to start blocking those users based on heuristics, pointed out Wasabi wallet contributor Max Hillebrand.      “This sort of analysis is not conclusive and these types of censorship of transactions do not work,” Hillebrand said in an interview. “It doesn't make sense philosophically and it’s impossible to implement technically. Therefore we don’t do it.”      UPDATE (May 14, 14:50 UTC): Corrected passages about zkSNACKs' status in Gibraltar and added clarifying statement from the regulator.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/13/elliptic-is-mapping-bitcoin-stolen-from-2016-bitfinex-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cf26a46f7951854adeacb0fafa2e96ae6206a59-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434364,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCAxh,1620920704,Economic Uncertainty Drives Crypto Growth in Sri Lanka,"Ravipriya Bandara, a 30-year-old marketing strategist and corporate trainer from Sri Lanka, had his work hours reduced amid nationwide lockdowns during the first wave of COVID-19.      With more time on his hands, Bandara started looking for investment opportunities and came across a conversation on Facebook about bitcoin. Bandara was soon introduced to an online community of crypto enthusiasts from various parts of the island.      “I didn’t know crypto was that popular in Sri Lanka. But when I joined the Telegram groups and all the communities, I realized that there had been a good amount of people who had been interested in crypto since 2015 or even earlier,” Bandara said.      A steady stream of newcomers like Bandara are joining the island’s veteran bitcoin investors. While many new investors are attracted by the promise of quick gains in an ongoing crypto bull market, others are shaken by the coronavirus pandemic’s economic devastation and are searching for a more promising store of value.      The crypto industry remains unregulated in Sri Lanka, although purchasing virtual assets using credit cards is prohibited under foreign currency exchange laws, making it difficult for prospective investors to purchase cryptocurrencies.      Even so, increasingly more Sri Lankans are turning to peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading platforms or closed social media groups to purchase crypto. P2P bitcoin trading platform Paxful saw a 730% rise in trading volume between April 2020 and April 2021, according to data from Useful Tulips.      “The average monthly volume so far in 2021 is three times what we saw in 2020,” said Danny Stagg, director of communications at Paxful.      Stagg said the trading volume recorded on Paxful for Sri Lanka in the first three months of this year alone has already surpassed the total volume traded in 2020. A number of other emerging markets have seen similar trends, particularly in Brazil and Morocco.      Sri Lanka’s interest in crypto has ballooned to such an extent that, in April, the country’s central bank (CBSL) published a warning, alerting the public of the risks involved in virtual currency investments for the second time in the last three years.      “There are no regulatory safeguards relating to the usage, investment or dealing in [virtual currencies] in Sri Lanka. Therefore, investing or using [virtual currencies] in Sri Lanka poses significant risks,” the warning said.      CoinDesk reached out to CBSL for comment on the most recent warning but the institution did not respond by press time.    A struggling economy    For nearly three decades, Sri Lanka was embroiled in an internal conflict that came to a violent end in 2009, with the United Nations later launching a probe into whether war crimes had been committed. Since the end of the war, the country has been attempting to fast-track development, becoming heavily indebted to China in the process.      Nonetheless, Sri Lanka slowly cemented itself as a top tourist destination, and the tourism industry accounted for 12.6% of the country’s GDP in 2019. But the same year a series of ISIS bombings on Easter Sunday claimed 250 lives including 42 foreigners, dealing a heavy blow to the economy.      Now, Sri Lanka’s tourism sector, and the economy as a whole, is struggling to recover from the impact of the prolonged nationwide lockdowns imposed during the pandemic. With COVID-19 cases on the rise again, travel restrictions within and into the country have been reinstated.      The island reported a devastating -3.6% economic growth in 2020, the country’s worst economic downturn in the last 73 years. The Sri Lankan rupee (LKR) fell to record lows against the U.S. dollar last year while the government turned to China for a bailout to avoid defaulting on debt owed to foreign creditors.      Meanwhile, the central bank is holding interest rates down until the economy shows signs of recovery. The rupee fell further in April following a $1.5 billion currency swap deal with China, leading to speculation about a rise in inflation towards the end of 2021.      “With these conversations, people are now trying to see what other avenues, what alternative investments they can get into, rather than putting money into fixed deposits or the other savings in banks,” Bandara said.    Buying into crypto    When Chirath Rajapaksha, an early crypto investor with a background in traditional stock trading, tried to buy bitcoin in 2018, it was difficult for him to find sellers online.      “I had a very hard time finding people. But now when you go on Facebook and just type ‘bitcoin’ you can find 10 or 20 people to buy from. On Binance P2P, you easily have more than 20 or 30 sellers,” Rajapaksha said.      In 2020, Binance added support for the LKR on its peer-to-peer trading platform. According to Dilip Ishara, blockchain community manager and Binance Angel, Sri Lanka’s local Binance community has around 4,000 members.      As crypto trading booms, the number of scams in the local trading industry is also growing.      On a daily basis, Ishara gets hundreds of requests from prospective investors looking to join the closed groups but because of the prevalence of scammers, administrators of various online groups have to vet all requests before making any decisions, Ishara said.      According to Rajapaksha, the pandemic has revealed the “ugly side” of crypto in Sri Lanka: Those who are new to crypto can easily fall victim to the scammers and fraudulent schemes that have permeated the crypto space.      “A lot of people are struggling with their current jobs, especially people from the travel and tourism sectors. They’ve had two very rough years. When the pandemic started, we had more people join our groups. But those who are not knowledgeable about crypto who want to make money quickly end up falling for pyramid schemes and losing their way,” Rajapaksha said.      As veteran crypto enthusiasts, Rajapaksha and Ishara spend a lot of time advising newcomers on how to avoid scams and trade carefully.      “But we can’t stop the scams completely,” Ishara said.    Regulation    In 2018, Aman, 22, invested the $1,200 he earned while working with his father, a carpenter, on a basket of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ethereum and chainlink. In fact, Aman got some help from Rajapaksha in navigating the space when he first started.      “At first crypto was something like a part-time job for me, and then gradually I became a full-time trader and now it is my main source of income,” Aman said.      Aman is eager for the government to step in and regulate the space.      “Maybe proper regulations and awareness programs will be helpful for newbies as well as to avoid scams. Regulating the space in a good way will attract more investors,” Aman said.      While Sri Lanka’s neighbor, India, is contemplating a potential ban on cryptocurrencies, Aman doesn’t think the Sri Lankan government will ban crypto.      According to Dr. W. A. Wijewardena, economist and former deputy governor of CBSL, in Sri Lanka the only currency that is legal tender is the rupee issued by CBSL, making any other means of payment illegal.      “However, if people choose to issue alternative currencies, the central bank cannot stop it,” Wijewardena said, adding that’s why CBSL has issued multiple warnings concerning the use of cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/13/economic-uncertainty-drives-crypto-growth-in-sri-lanka,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d402daff0e58c248c8abdfd5e8e637ff2b24b8d6-2560x1416.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406384,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu0WN,1620920093,Looking to Buy a Crypto Business? Here’s What You Should Know,"The rapidly expanding crypto world has started to see an uptick in investments and M&A deals (and lofty valuations). Galaxy Digital acquired BitGo. Coinbase bought Routefire. Recently founded NYDIG is moving into mining through M&A. By some estimates, crypto M&A is a billion-dollar-plus business.      Understanding the assets and revenue streams of target businesses is critical to capturing and realizing value in any equity investment or M&A deal – especially in crypto. Given the complexity and nuances of crypto businesses, this understanding requires a deep dive into a few key areas: cybersecurity, data privacy and regulations.    Joe Castelluccio is a partner at Mayer Brown LLP and counsels clients on M&A, equity financings and other corporate and business matters.    While these issues are not unique to businesses in the crypto space, effective analysis and due diligence in this space is particularly complex and challenging.    Cybersecurity    While every company in the world should be concerned about cyberattacks (for several reasons), businesses in the crypto space should be particularly focused on it. There are a host of negative effects that this kind of attack or breach can have. To name just a few:    Theft of data, trade secrets and/or other IP can result in a business’s “special sauce” being lost to competitors or bad actors  Loss of trust can destroy future revenues and cause reputational damage that is difficult (or impossible) to repair  Attackers that are able to access bank account or crypto wallet information can reroute payments or currency, often to off-shore or untraceable accounts.    To guard against this, an acquirer must have a thorough understanding of the data, software and hardware that will move onto its network prior to joining together its and the target’s IT infrastructures. If the target’s systems are vulnerable, those vulnerabilities may transfer to the acquirer’s systems when they are integrated. If the acquirer cannot get a sufficient level of comfort regarding the target’s systems, other steps may be necessary (even if those steps result in delayed operational efficiency and synergies).      Even if an investor is only taking a minority equity stake in a target, there is potential for the target’s cyber risk to spread to its new owners – especially if there are business or commercial arrangements that accompany the investment. And, of course, the physical and digital security of the digital assets themselves is critical to mitigating the risk of loss and theft.    Data collection and privacy    Another key part of due diligence in any investment or acquisition is determining what privacy policies – and restrictions – apply to a company’s data. These restrictions may thwart an efficient integration (in an acquisition) or monetization of data (in any deal), and limit the ways in which data may be used in future business plans.      A company’s right to use the data it collects is governed by the company’s privacy policies in effect at the time the data was collected and the applicable laws. This may include the laws of countries outside of a company’s home base.      An investor or acquirer cannot assume a target business’s data can be monetized without a thorough review of the policies under which the data was collected and stored. In addition, an investor or acquirer must also review the target’s compliance with its policies – in other words, how it functions day to day, not merely how it looks on paper.    Regulations    The regulations that apply to cryptocurrency are numerous, overlapping, evolving and, in some cases, contradictory. In the U.S. alone, different states have taken vastly different approaches to regulating crypto.      Colorado and Wyoming have encouraged crypto investment in their states and passed pro-crypto regulations, while New York has pursued cases and fines against crypto businesses for running afoul of its existing financial services regulations.      While the U.S. federal government has been slow to adopt a broad regulatory position (other than selected enforcement actions, such as Ripple), the new chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, said recently that a federal regulatory framework is needed for cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S.    Read more: Joe Castelluccio - M&A Using Crypto? Here’s How to Make It Work    All of this means the crypto regulatory environment will be a key concern for operators in this sector and those that look to buy into it. This will require both an understanding of the current, complicated landscape and a watchful eye on regulatory changes as they develop.      If a crystal ball is not available, an experienced and thoughtful team of advisers is the next best thing.      With the massive amount of attention being given to crypto by global companies, financial institutions and central banks, it’s no surprise that investment cash is flooding this space. For those investments to pay off – and prevent damaging ripple effects for investors and acquirers – it will be important to closely examine these key areas of the target business.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Joe Castelluccio,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/13/looking-to-buy-a-crypto-business-heres-what-you-should-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56c0d4935921a7da72cb5b41780ce7b77df14f0a-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406390,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu0aJ,1620914400,Samsung Adds Ledger Wallet Support in Latest Crypto Tie-Up,"Samsung is connecting its smartphone’s cryptocurrency wallet to Ledger storage devices, adding to a string of recent crypto-centric news to come out of the South Korea-based technology giant.      Announced Wednesday, the Samsung Blockchain Wallet that comes with Galaxy smartphones will support Ledger Nano hardware storage devices, designed specifically for the safekeeping of cryptocurrency.      Since launching with the Galaxy S10 in 2019, the Samsung Blockchain Wallet supports bitcoin, ether, ERC-20 tokens, tron (TRX) and Tron’s ERC-20 analog. A software development kit allows third parties to create “D-apps,” which could include things like paying for goods and services in crypto by scanning a merchants’ QR code. More recently, the Samsung wallet announced its integration with U.S. crypto exchange Gemini.      “By providing support for hardware wallets we are providing our customers with not just enhanced convenience, but also an entirely new level of security,” Woong Ah Yoon, Samsung’s VP and head of blockchain, said in an interview, adding:    “We will begin with providing support for Ledger products including Nano S and Nano X. Then we plan to expand our support to more cold-storage wallets.”  Samsung’s crypto ambitions    Monthly active users of the Galaxy blockchain ecosystem have doubled over the past seven months, Yoon said, and the smartphone wallet is now used to hold hundreds of millions dollars in assets under management, he added, declining to share exact figures.      A mobile crypto wallet such as Samsung’s is, by definition, connected to a network and so cannot have the same level of security as a Ledger cold-storage device, which remains remote from the internet.      That said, Samsung’s wallet with its clever key store system uses an independent memory enclave on the device meaning “some of the logic of cold storage applies,” said Yoon.      “The Samsung Blockchain Wallet is not 100% cold storage but it's not a hot wallet either,” Yoon said. “It’s not susceptible to all the external attacks that could accompany an online connection. So it kind of sits in the middle of a cold wallet and a hot wallet; a warm wallet, you could say.”    Read more: Dapper’s NBA Top Shot Launches Out of Beta With Samsung Galaxy Store Deal    As well as belt and suspenders security for a user’s crypto assets, Samsung’s Ledger connection adds some nice convenience features, such as being able to use the Samsung app to check the prices and the number of crypto assets stored in the hardware wallet, even after the two devices have been disconnected.      “I believe we are the first mobile blockchain app to allow you to do that,” said Yoon.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/13/samsung-adds-ledger-wallet-support-in-latest-crypto-tie-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0990e0b37bdeac2292168add8c22ad52a87613d-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406391,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu0cH,1620914395,Polkadot-Based Derivatives Exchange Raises $6.4M at $50M Valuation,"Decentralized crypto derivatives exchange dTrade announced a $6.4 million seed round of funding Thursday as it prepares to go live on Polkadot later this year.      DTrade will be the first derivatives decentralized exchange on Polkadot’s multi-chain network, according to those running the project. At a $50 million valuation, according to co-founder Nikodem Grzesiak, dTrade secured lead backing from Su Zhu's Three Arrows Capital and DeFiance Capital with investments from Polychain, ParaFi Capital and other crypto venture capital firms.      Run by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), dTrade will aim to capture a slice of the heavily centralized, multibillion-dollar market for crypto derivatives. Brand names like FTX and Binance see tens of billions of dollars in derivatives volume daily, while decentralized alternatives – none of them smash hits – capture orders of less magnitude.      Grzesiak estimated that less than 1,000th of the crypto derivatives market’s perpetual swap volumes flows through decentralized exchanges. He said he's “optimistic” that dTrade’s perpetual swaps and options support can help close that gap.      “Ultimately the thesis is that decentralized platforms are better at distributing value to the end users, so there is simply a better value proposition for traders,” Grzesiak said. He also said holders of the protocol’s DET governance token can decide where to allocate the revenue generated by the exchange, instead of it flowing to “the management, or the holding company behind the exchange.”      But DEXs face additional challenges in the derivatives market in that they don’t go after traders who close their trades below the bankruptcy threshold, according to Grzesiak. That would create an untenable negative balance, he said.      To cover the gap, dTrade is prepping an “insurance mining program” that rewards users who stake their USDC as a backstop with a share of the exchange’s native governance token, Grzesiak said. The DAO has set aside 5% of the DET token supply as an incentive.      Other investors in the round included Huobi, Mechanism Capital, Magic Ventures, Bixin Ventures, IOSG Ventures, Hypersphere Ventures and Fenbushi Capital.      Alameda Research, CMS Holdings, Wintermute, MGNR, PNYX, Kronos, Altonomy and LedgerPrime will support liquidity on dTrade, Grzesiak said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/13/polkadot-based-derivatives-exchange-raises-64m-at-50m-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b6c7bf3906e34411b98e5f34054633a48acb23c-1280x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu0VO,1620910894,"Brave Integrates .Crypto Blockchain Domains, Expanding Access to Web 3.0","Blockchain domain name provider Unstoppable Domains is integrating with privacy-oriented web browser Brave to provide native browser support for "".crypto” domains.      Unstoppable Domains builds domain names on blockchains, meaning that each domain name is a non-fungible token (NFT) stored inside the user's cryptocurrency wallet instead of within a traditional, centralized registrar like GoDaddy.      Practically, this means Brave users will be able to navigate to 30,000 decentralized websites and 700,000 blockchain domain names registered with Unstoppable Domains, drastically expanding access to Web 3.0.      “The entire domain name system is a suite of smart contracts living on the blockchain, which means that when a browser like Brave wants to go and resolve a website, instead of going and pinging the DNS servers, they go and read the blockchain directly,” said Unstoppable Domain co-founder Brad Kam. “That's how they find the record. And so what is unique and different here is really around custody and ownership.”    How it works with blockchain domains    Unstoppable Domains makes blockchain domains decipherable. Blockchain domains are essentially suites of smart contracts, software written on a public blockchain. They can work as a naming registry for crypto wallet addresses, for example, or they can point to content hosted on the blockchain, like a website.      Kam describes the domains as “your user name for crypto,” akin to a decentralized Venmo. So while my Venmo address is really [insert long string of alphanumeric characters here], what someone searching for me might see is “Ben Powers.” Right now, any wallet address on a blockchain is a string of long, random characters.      Some examples of existing domains include Brad.crypto, an NFT art gallery owned by Kam himself; and vault74.crypto, a decentralized chat with 4k streaming and file sharing.    Read more: Brave Acquires Tailcat to Create Private Search Engine Competitor to Google    Typically, we understand domain addresses on the web to take us to a site where we can view content. Blockchain domain addresses can also host content; for example, Kam has a NFT gallery website at his domain.      More commonly, blockchain domain addresses are used for payments. These .crypto domains work inside of 50 different crypto wallets and exchanges. According to Kam, you can just send money to Brad.crypto, for example, because that’s essentially his username for the crypto web.      At its core, the idea is that this makes decentralized tech easier to use.      Brave has previously integrated a crypto wallet where you can send money and Brave has also integrated the decentralized storage network InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Kam acknowledged that both of those technologies are extremely powerful, but he suggested that easy-to-remember domains make them easier to use.      “So you can now send me money in the Brave crypto wallet with Brad.crypto, and instead of having to go and find my crazy long 30- to 50-character IPFS hash in order to go see my decentralized website, you can just type in Brad.crypto and see my decentralized website,” said Kam. “So just like how it works with the consumer internet today, you need a domain name system in order for this technology to be easy enough to use that it can go mainstream.”    Domain Name Systems and Web 3.0    The DNS is the system that runs the web, resolving the search for long, numbered IP addresses with the common .com websites we are familiar with today.      For the almost 30 years of history of DNS there's really been one DNS system the entire internet has been using.      “This is really the first time we’re seeing browsers have embraced an alternative system,” said Kam. (Unstoppable Domains also recently integrated with the browser Opera.)      Kam sees this adoption as somewhat of a watershed moment for the decentralized web and for alternate DNS systems in general. The traditional DNS comes with a long approval system, regulatory bodies and various committees. But on the blockchain, using something like Unstoppable Domains, anybody can launch anything.      In a sense, the fact that browsers are able to resolve these .crypto domains is proof blockchain domain name systems are as valid as the traditional DNS.      “Browsers are kind of the access points for decentralized websites but there are no decent-sized websites without browser support,” said Kam. “They'd be up there but who cares? They wouldn't be accessible to you and me.”      That’s why browsers are critical to the success of the overall decentralized web idea.      “I like that there's no trust involved with this solution,” said Brave’s co-founder Brian Bondy. “I think it's a much better way to do it via owning NFTs, basically, and whoever owns that private key is the only one that really has access to the ownership of that domain. I think it makes a lot more sense.”    The issues with centralization    The lack of centralization means that decisions about a domain can’t be arbitrarily made by any one body, there isn’t a need to keep subscribing as once you own the domain: You own it forever and it can’t be taken away.      Centralized DNS providers struggle with, or enable, all of those issues.      For example, in 2020, GoDaddy was hacked using social engineering techniques and employees were tricked in transferring ownership and control of targeted domains to fraudsters. In November, hackers were able to redirect traffic intended for a number of crypto platforms.      “A domain hosting provider, ‘GoDaddy,’ that manages one of our core domain names incorrectly transferred control of the account and domain to a malicious actor,” said crypto trading platform Liquid CEO Mike Kayamori in a blog post. “This gave the actor the ability to change DNS records and in turn, take control of a number of internal email accounts. In due course, the malicious actor was able to partially compromise our infrastructure and gain access to document storage.”      In April of this year, a man in Argentina was able to register the country’s local Google domain (google.com.ar) for a few bucks after an error was seemingly made at NIC, Argentina’s centralized government-run service registry that sells all “.ar” domains.      The error was remedied a few hours later, but shows both the control (and lack thereof) these centralized entities have.    Brave’s perspective    Echoing Kam, Bondy said two big areas where Brave will benefit from native support for Unstoppable domains are their wallet and IPFS sites. Overall, though, it will just open Brave users up to access a lot more content.      Bondy said a lot of the time, .crypto domains will point to an IPFS site. These sites are not really easy to access, given the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) uses a long string of characters that users have to memorize to access the sites.      “That's where things like Ethereum Naming Service and Unstoppable Domains come in and give you a really easy way to be able to have immutable IPFS content,” said Bondy. “So you can change the content of your website on IPFS, and you can just remember a really simple thing like, like Brave.crypto for example, and it gets served over that.”    Read more: Brave Becomes First Browser to Offer Native IPFS Integration    The other value-add is for their wallet. When you're sending cryptocurrencies to another user, usually you have to input a long string of characters.      “That's kind of error prone,” said Bondy. “You can make a mistake or it looks scary. You don't really know who it belongs to at a glance.”      So instead of all that, you could just remember you're sending ETH or BAT or any of the other 50 different cryptocurrencies that Unstoppable Domains supports to a simple .crypto domain.",POSITIVE,BAT | ETH,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/13/brave-integrates-crypto-blockchain-domains-expanding-access-to-web-30,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e4d8405c22da39b351540c58eb451703ee86092-2560x1645.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406392,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu0dG,1620907200,Tether's First Reserve Breakdown Shows Token 49% Backed by Unspecified Commercial Paper,"Tether revealed the breakdown of its reserves for the first time, casting another sliver of light on the backing of USDT, the largest cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar.      Much remains murky, however, in part because the pie charts provided by Tether on Thursday make no mention of any independent review by an accounting firm. Moore Cayman, an audit firm in the Caribbean with five employees, has published two reports this year attesting that USDT is fully backed. But the auditor (part of the Moore Global confederation of accounting and consulting firms) did not detail what exactly is backing the token.      To be fair, other stablecoin issuers like Circle and Gemini don't typically produce breakdowns of their reserve compositions at all. Gemini’s accountant, for example, states in its attestations that the client’s reserves are held in either FDIC-insured accounts at State Street Bank or a Goldman Sachs Asset Management money market fund that invests solely in U.S. Treasury securities. The percentage of each is not provided — but then again, both are considered highly liquid and creditworthy assets (“money-good,” in Wall Street parlance). The same cannot be said of all the assets on Tether’s balance sheet.      The new composition report is part of Tether’s efforts to stay in compliance with a settlement agreed to with the New York Attorney General’s office (NYAG) after the prosecutor investigated it and its sister crypto exchange Bitfinex over the cover-up of some $800 million in losses.      Bitfinex and Tether paid an $18.5 million dollar fine and agreed to provide quarterly breakdowns of its reserves as part of the settlement.      “Tether proposed ongoing publication of the reserve breakdown as part of our settlement agreement with the New York Attorney General’s Office, and we committed to make that information available to both the Attorney General’s office and the public,” Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner said in a statement. “Today’s publication reflects our ongoing dedication to transparency.”    The breakdown    The breakdown states that the bulk of Tether’s reserves are in cash, equivalents or other short-term deposits, with the remainder in secured loans, corporate bonds and other investments. However, the first category is mostly made up of commercial paper, a form of corporate debt that can be easily converted to cash – or not, depending on the issuer and market conditions.      According to the breakdown, Tether’s reserves as of March 31, 2021 were composed of 75.85% cash and equivalents, 12.55% secured loans, 9.96% in corporate bonds and precious metals and 1.64% in other investments, including digital currencies. This is consistent with the company’s past statements but more precise.      The cash section was further broken out into different components: 65.39% commercial paper, 24.2% fiduciary deposits, 3.87% cash, 3.6% reverse repo notes and 2.94% Treasury bills.      It is unclear what the ratings are on the commercial paper or the corporate bonds, which agencies rated them or which companies issued them. Likewise, Tether declined to identify the borrowers of the loans or the collateral backing them.      ""That's a little iffy,"" said Francine McKenna, an adjunct professor at American University's Kogod School of Business, former auditor and writer of The Dig, a newsletter about accounting and corporate governance. ""All commercial paper is not created equal, because of the credit ratings of various companies. Even some of the multinationals that used to be pristine are not so anymore.""      Do the math, and the unspecified commercial paper comes to just under half – 49% – of USDT's collateral.      Tether’s reserves are partly invested in bitcoin, which makes up less than 1.64% of its overall backing (in the “other investments” category) and gold, which makes up less than 9.96% of its backing (in the “precious metals” category).      While Thursday’s publication isn’t attested to, the reserves would be the same that Moore Cayman would have examined in publishing assurance reports for the company. The firm published its first report at the end of March, addressing the USDT stablecoin’s backing as of Feb. 28, 2021. Another report was published last month, attesting to the backing as of March 31.    The backstory    USDT is a key piece of plumbing for the roughly $2 trillion global crypto market. Traders use it to quickly transfer dollar value between exchanges to capture arbitrage opportunities when a bank wire is unavailable or too slow.      The opacity of Tether’s operations, however, has fanned the flames of speculation by critics who question USDT’s backing and conjecture that the company props up the market by printing tokens.      Tether has a long history of attempting to verify its reserves, but without providing much in the way of documentation. The company first hired audit firm Friedman LLP, which produced a preliminary report that stated the amount of USDT Tether had issued was backed by its cash reserves, though with several caveats.      Read more: A Bridge Called Tether      The firm then tapped law firm Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP to publish a report on its backing, but this too was hedged.      In late 2018 Tether’s bank, Bahamas-based Deltec Bank & Trust, published a letter with an illegible signature stating the company had $1.8 billion in reserves, matching the amount of USDT in circulation.      During the NYAG’s investigation, Hoegner revealed that at one point, Tether was only about 74% backed by reserves.      Despite all this, USDT has traded at or near $1 for nearly all of its history.      This year, Tether has committed to publishing regular attestations through Moore Cayman.

42406379,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu0PU,1620905167,Bitcoin Makes Weak Bounce After Tesla Blow but Pullback May Not Be Over: Analyst,"While bitcoin has rebounded somewhat from 10-week lows seen early Thursday, analysts say the relief could be short-lived.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $48,700 at press time, having printed a low of $46,294 during the Asian hours. That was the lowest price since March 1, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The drop to multi-week lows happened after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter that the electric car maker has suspended BTC payments for its vehicles over the environmental cost of mining.      Despite the latest recovery, bitcoin is still down 10% on a 24-hour basis and trading at least 25% lower from record highs above $64,000 reached in mid-April.      According to Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, the possibility of a deeper correction cannot be ruled out. ""Fundamentally, the risk-off in markets could have a weighing influence,"" he said.      Global financial markets have turned risk-averse in the past 24 hours on fears the Federal Reserve may scale back stimulus sooner than expected to contain inflation, and the dour mood looks set to continue.      The central bank's massive monetary easing efforts have been primarily responsible for the unprecedented risk taking seen across all corners of the financial market over the past 12 months.      The Fed reduced rates to a record low of 0.25% a year ago and has been buying bonds worth $120 billion per month to support the economy and markets amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bitcoin has charted a fivefold rally since April 2020.      However, with inflation running hot, the U.S. central bank now looks to be running out of ways to keep the liquidity tap flowing.      Official data released Wednesday showed the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods and energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% year on year in April, marking the fastest inflation rise in 12 years.      Bitcoin fell from $55,000 to $53,000 after the data was revealed, then extended losses following Musk's tweet. U.S. stocks also suffered sharp losses and look set to begin Thursday on a negative note. Futures tied to the S&P 500 are trading 0.5% lower at press time.      ""A combination of weaker than expected payroll [data] and much higher CPI suggests stagflation [high inflation and low growth], which has subsequently reined in the bulls, equally in equity markets and digital assets space,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital.      Data from the rates markets shows traders are ratcheting up the odds of an interest rate hike in 2022 in response to high inflation. According to Bloomberg, eurodollar futures contracts are now pricing in more than an 80% likelihood of a quarter-point rate hike by the end of 2022, up from a two-in-three chance at the beginning of the week.      Also read: Bitcoin Plunges as Tesla Halts BTC Payments Over Environmental Concerns      Thus, the immediate prospects for bitcoin and other asset classes look bleak. ""If the rate hike expectations do not subside, market participants will be keenly looking for any evolution of trends surrounding central bank liquidity and whether bitcoin flows actually benefits from higher inflation,"" Vinokourov said. ""For all the talk of bitcoin being a hedge against inflation, up to now its existence was in a very low-inflation environment.""      Technical charts also suggest scope for a deeper pullback for bitcoin.      ""The monthly relative strength index is still showing highly overbought conditions, and this latest breakdown below what had been support at $47,000 now exposes the possibility for a measured move downside extension back into the $34,000 area,"" Kruger said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/13/bitcoin-makes-weak-bounce-after-tesla-blow-but-pullback-may-not-be-over-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b2aea77acf20965ede3dea166025f43ef496bab-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Robert Wearing, deputy associate chief counsel at the IRS, told a virtual conference Wednesday that crypto can be seized in the event of failure to pay taxes, just like other property.  This is in line with a 2014 IRS notice that crypto will be treated as property, not currency, for tax purposes.  “Bottom line: The IRS will seize that property and will attempt to follow its usual procedures to sell it and use it to satisfy collection,” Wearing said, according to a Bloomberg report.

Bitcoin’s difficulty adjusted upward 21.53%, at 25.04 trillion, after dipping to 20.61 trillion in the last adjustment, according to this journalist's Bitcoin node. This comes after Bitcoin’s hashrate, which is a measure of the combined computing power of Bitcoin’s miners, rose to an all-time high this week, per multiple sources.    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works    Bitcoin's difficulty is an internal score that begins at 1 (the easiest level) and grows or shrinks exponentially depending on how many miners are competing on the network. Today's adjustment was the largest in seven years.      ""Today's difficulty increase of 21.53%, the largest percentage increase since 2014, and it's also the largest absolute increase in history,"" Compass Mining CBO Thomas Heller told CoinDesk.      About a month ago, coal mining accidents shut down bitcoin miners in Xinjiang, China, clipping roughly 25% of bitcoin’s hashrate from the network. Heller commented that these miners have come back online recently, leading to the surge in hashrate and, by extension, difficulty. Some of these miners have begun migrating machines to Sichuan for its incipient rainy season, which will supply them with gushes of cheap hydroelectricity.      On the other side of the world, North American pools are growing at a rapid clip and turning on more machines than ever before.      Even as competition escalates to new heights, bitcoin miners are making more than they have in two years, according to Luxor Technology’s hashrate index.    When Taproot?    This difficulty adjustment also gives mining pools a fresh start to signal for Bitcoin’s Taproot update, an upgrade that outfits Bitcoin with new signature and scripting schemes that allow for cheaper, more flexible multi-signature transactions, among other things.    Read more: Bitcoin Taproot Activation Has Begun; Miners Now Have 3 Months to Get on Board    Taproot will pave the way for improvements to outstanding technologies like Lightning, multi-signature wallets and Bitcoin-based “smart contracts” like discrete log contracts (DLCs).      Per rules to coordinate the upgrade, at least 90% of mining pools within any given difficulty period must signal their support for the upgrade using a special identifier in the blocks they mine. These periods last 2,016 blocks (or roughly two weeks); miners now have five epochs left to signal if they want Taproot to activate in November.

The investment arm, Huobi Ventures, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Huobi Group focused on boosting the firm’s investment portfolio and providing long-term support for innovative blockchain projects, according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.      The $100 million pledge is the latest hefty fund to be thrown at DeFi development. Last month, Polygon launched a $100 million fund to support DeFi adoption. In March, crypto asset investment firm BlockTower Capital raised a $25 million DeFi fund.      In addition to supporting early-stage blockchain projects over a three-year period, Huobi’s $100 million fund will also be used to make strategic acquisitions to grow the firm's product offerings, according to the statement.      “Acquisitions will be integrated into Huobi’s growing suite of blockchain-enabled applications and services to expand the business into new markets. The venture capital unit will make long-term investments in emerging blockchain use cases and DeFi projects,” the statement said.      Huobi Ventures is also setting up a $10 million NFT fund focused on investing in non-fungible token (NFT) collectibles and marketplaces, the firm said.      The new investment arm also consolidates a number of the firm’s many investment vehicles, including Huobi Eco Fund, Huobi Capital and Huobi DeFi Labs, into a single entity, according to the statement.      “We have had separate teams focus on different investment strategies, but by bringing everyone together under a single entity, we can create a more cohesive strategy and continue to invest in and support the most innovative projects that are shaping the blockchain and DeFi spaces,” said Lily Zhang, Huobi Group CFO.      To date, the company has invested $69.42 million in blockchain, media, stablecoin and other projects, according to the statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MATIC,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/13/huobi-groups-investment-arm-dedicates-100m-to-defi-mergers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f3738ced9d93920e9ae40a44c675242c5ddcba8-2560x1774.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406369,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetyQV,1620868130,Bitcoin Plunges as Tesla Halts BTC Payments Over Environmental Concerns,"An already down day for bitcoin turned into a rout Wednesday evening, with the leading cryptocurrency dropping to its lowest point in almost three weeks after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car company will discontinue accepting bitcoin as a form of payment due to environmental concerns.      Musk's about-face on bitcoin put to flight a market already in a nervous mood. And bitcoin wasn't the only crypto affected – a screen showing the top 15 cryptos by market cap showed not a speck of green.      The decision by Tesla removes a psychological support for the original cryptocurrency. On Feb. 8, the price of bitcoin soared by more than 14% after Tesla said it had put $1.5 billion of its treasury funds into the cryptocurrency and that it would soon accept the crypto as payment, a promise it kept.      Tesla's addition of bitcoin to its balance sheet also set off a guessing game of which major company would be the next to do so. While Musk's tweet today said Tesla won't be selling any of its bitcoin, it's likely safe to say it won't be buying more anytime soon, and other companies that may have been tempted to add bitcoin to their balance sheets may now have second thoughts as well.      At around 01:00 UTC on Thursday (9 p.m. ET Wednesday), bitcoin's price fell from $54,800 to a low of $46,294, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices have since rebounded slightly and are currently changing hands for around $48,500.      April 25 marks the last time bitcoin fell below the $50,000 psychological support level. It did not remain below for very long because prices shot back up 15% the following day to around $54,000.      Hourly sell volume has also shot up to its highest point in over two days to levels not seen since May 10, Bitstamp exchange data shows.      Bitcoin's volatile price action has also affected orders on Coinbase Pro, which has been experiencing intermittent outages and delays to its service. CoinDesk attempted to access the exchange's native mobile app and webpage but was met with the following error message.      CoinDesk attempted to contact Coinbase but did not receive a reply by press time.      Other notable cryptocurrencies in the top 10 weighted by market cap also fell in dramatic fashion alongside bitcoin, with ether, dogecoin and polkadot suffering the most and falling between 8% and 12%.      See also: Elon Musk Says Tesla Is Suspending Bitcoin Payments Over Environmental Concerns      Meanwhile, cryptocurrency-related equities also fell across the board, with Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) down 4.8% in post-market trading.
