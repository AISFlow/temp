37401173,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624631,1733701841,President Trump says he never wanted to kick Jerome Powell out of the Federal Reserve,"President-elect Donald Trump has shut down speculation about removing Jerome Powell from his position as Federal Reserve Chair. These speculations come from him saying during campaign that he would take over the central bank and be in charge of the economy himself. But now, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press , Trump said , “Fire him? No, I don’t see it.” “I think if I told him to, he would,” the president added. “But if I asked him to, he probably wouldn’t.” Sounds like he knows his man all too well. He did appoint him, after all. And Powell has made it clear that he’s not going anywhere. Days after Trump’s victory, the Fed chair reaffirmed the central bank’s independence, telling reporters he wouldn’t step aside if asked and that the president doesn’t have the authority to fire him or other senior Fed leaders. Trump’s take on Powell and monetary policy Trump’s views on the Federal Reserve have always been controversial. He genuinely believes that the president should have more influence over monetary policy. In an October interview with Bloomberg, Trump said, “I think I have the right to say, ‘I think you should go up or down a little bit.’ I don’t think I should be allowed to order it, but I think I should be able to comment.” He didn’t stop there. Trump ridiculed Powell’s job, calling it “the greatest job in government.” In his words, “You show up to the office once a month, and you say, ‘Let’s see, flip a coin.’” It’s no secret that Trump’s frustration with Powell stems from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes during his first term, which Trump believed slowed economic growth. Back in 2018, Trump even considered firing Powell but didn’t follow through. Legal scholars pointed out that removing a Federal Reserve Chair isn’t as simple as giving the order. The Federal Reserve Act only allows board members to be removed “for cause,” which means serious misconduct or abuse of power, not just disagreements over policy. “Looks like I’m stuck with you,” Trump told him over the phone one night from the Oval. Despite their past clashes, Powell has said he isn’t anticipating new tensions with Trump’s administration. While Powell’s term as Chair runs through 2026, his 14-year tenure as a Federal Reserve Governor doesn’t expire until 2028, which gives Trump limited room to replace him outright. POTUS’ power over the Federal Reserve The president of the United States has the power to appoint members to the Board of Governors. This includes selecting key roles like Chair and Vice-Chair. Governors serve 14-year terms, and chairs serve four-year terms. All of them sit on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the group that decides interest rates. During his next term, Trump will have at least two opportunities to appoint members to the Fed Board. One of those openings will come in January 2026 when Fed Governor Adriana Kugler’s term ends. These appointments will require Senate confirmation, but with a Republican majority in the Senate, Trump is likely to face less resistance than he did during his first presidency, when several of his Fed picks were blocked. Even with these appointments, Trump’s influence is limited. The Fed’s policymaking structure includes 12 regional bank presidents who are selected independently by the boards of their respective banks, subject to approval from the Federal Reserve Board. This decentralized system reduces the president’s ability to directly control monetary policy. Trump isn’t the first president to try to influence the Federal Reserve, but his approach has been one of the most public. He often airs his grievances in press conferences and interviews, accusing Powell of making poor policy decisions. He also criticizes the Fed’s track record, saying they’ve “sort of gotten it wrong a lot.” According to Trump, Powell’s timing on key decisions has been “a little bit too early and a little bit too late.” The case for Fed independence The central bank’s role is to manage inflation and employment without political interference, which Powell believes is essential for maintaining credibility with investors and the public. “Without question, the Fed must remain apolitical,” Powell said earlier this year. But the reality is more complicated. The Federal Reserve often operates within a political context, collaborating with the Treasury Department and considering the economic impact of government policies like tax cuts or spending initiatives. Critics argue this interaction makes it impossible for the Fed to be entirely apolitical. Economists like Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the Wharton School, describe the Federal Reserve as a “deeply political institution.” However, he distinguishes between politics and partisanship, emphasizing that the Fed’s decisions often reflect input from multiple factions. Despite these challenges, the Federal Reserve has maintained its independence for over a century. Central banks around the world rely on this model to make tough decisions, such as raising interest rates to fight inflation, without fear of political retaliation.

37400875,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26106,1733701320,Cardano Foundation X Account Hacked in ADAsol Scam,"On December 8, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was compromised, with hackers promoting a fraudulent token called “ADAsol” and falsely claiming that the foundation would cease support for ADA due to an alleged lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the breach in a social media post. However, before action was taken, the scam token generated about $500,000 in trading volume, only to crash by 99%. The fraudulent posts, including the SEC lawsuit claims, have since been removed. The Cardano Foundation stated it is working to secure its account, emphasizing that no other parts of the Cardano ecosystem were affected. Users are advised to avoid clicking any links from the foundation’s X account until the issue is fully resolved. Frequent X Account Hacks Targeting Crypto Projects The Cardano Foundation joins a growing list of entities impacted by social media hacks involving crypto scams. In December 2023, Compound Finance’s X account was hacked, with phishing links posted to a counterfeit website advertising fake COMP tokens. These links drained funds from unsuspecting users. In October 2024, Symbiotic’s X account was hacked, and the attacker posted fake interaction checklists resembling airdrop campaigns. These led users to phishing sites that stole legitimate tokens. The same month, Eigenlayer’s X account was compromised to promote a fraudulent airdrop campaign. Even non-crypto accounts have been targeted. On October 29, the Truth Terminal AI account was hacked to market a scam memecoin. In November 2024, rapper Wiz Khalifa’s X account was hacked to promote “WIZ,” a fake memecoin falsely linked to the artist.

37403104,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318020,1733700600,Expert Explains Why Martial Law Threw South Korea’s Crypto Markets into Chaos,"A South Korean expert says panicked investors thought their crypto was under threat when President Yoon Seok-yul declared martial law last week. In an opinion piece for Hankyoreh , the author and crypto journalist Kim Oe-hyeon identified four key reasons why domestic traders responded to Yoon’s move with a mass sell-off. Martial Law Decree Sparked ‘Crypto Chaos’ Kim noted that “a number of structural problems” worked in tandem behind the scenes to cause chaos on South Korean crypto exchanges . Trading volumes spiked on platforms like Upbit and Bithumb late on December 3 when Yoon declared martial law. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past seven days. (Source: CoinGecko) Crypto traders continued to sell off their coins in the early hours of December 4. But the sell-off came to an abrupt halt after Yoon accepted the National Assembly’s decision to block his martial law decree. Trading volumes have since shrunk back to their lowest level in almost a month. South Korean media outlets on December 8 reported that parliament’s subsequent failed motion to impeach Yoon had so far failed to move investors to act. The market has also been unmoved by a series of prosecution service attempts to arrest the President on “treason” charges. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko) Kim wrote that Yoon’s “absurd” decision to declare martial law had “sent huge shock waves” across the crypto market “in real-time.” Bitcoin (BTC) prices tumbled by up to 30% on major exchanges, at a time when the token was trading for just under $96,000 on overseas platforms. The leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power Party says that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will manage the nation’s affairs as the country deals with the fallout from a political crisis sparked by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s bungled martial law. https://t.co/trWbLHg1yk — Bloomberg (@business) December 8, 2024 ‘Uncertainty and Anxiety’ Kim wrote that the first major fact influencing the price drop was a sudden rush of “uncertainty and anxiety.” He added that traders were concerned about the “possibility of additional regulations such as asset freezes or the suspension of exchange operations.” Hong (first name withheld), a Seoul-based crypto investor, told Cryptonews.com that he “slept through the whole thing,” but noted that some of his acquaintances joined the sell-off. He said: “When I woke up, I checked my [crypto-themed chat app] groups and saw that once a few people said they were selling their tokens for cash, others said they’d do the same. I think that once a few traders said they were selling, it had a snowball effect.” The Special Prosecutor’s Office said Sunday that President Yoon Suk Yeol is now a suspect facing potential charges of insurrection and abuse of power. https://t.co/WdqVq7ef5j — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 8, 2024 Kim, meanwhile, noted that the “structural characteristics” of the South Korean market had “amplified” anxiety levels. He remarked that, unlike the United States, the South Korean market is “overwhelmingly dominated by individual investors.” He explained: “This means that the market is structured to be easily swayed by news and sentiment.” A ‘Vicious Cycle’ And the expert noted that ill-timed network issues may also have spooked the market. He added that late on December 3, “many investors” were complaining “about connection problems with major exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb.” Kim wrote: “This further fueled investor anxiety. And it led to a vicious cycle of sudden sales whenever orders became available. This is a chronic problem that occurs every time there is a market crash. And it is not being fixed.” Online Korean-language crypto- and stock trading-related forums also contained accounts of “crashes” on Bithumb and Upbit. One investor claimed he had successfully tried to “buy” the 30% “dip,” but “couldn’t buy more” because Bithumb’s site was down. Another trader said they had “sold” their holdings at a “low price,” and then mused: “I regret acting so quickly. The news came like a bolt from the blue in the middle of the night.” US calls for 'proper' functioning of democratic processes in S. Korea after scrapped impeachment motion https://t.co/VIVbwGL1WC — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 8, 2024 Lack of Market Makers ‘a Problem’ Kim, meanwhile, noted that a fourth factor had also helped fuel the panic. He noted that since the launch of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July, “market-making activities have been prohibited.” The act classifies many traditional market-making activities as a form of “unfair” crypto trading. As such, there is no longer anyone to “fill in the gaps between bids” and help “mitigate volatility.” The expert explained: “Market makers provide liquidity in the market and mitigate price volatility by simultaneously presenting buy and sell prices. If they had provided buy prices and acted as a buffer [on December 3-4], the price drop would not have been so large.” The post Expert Explains Why Martial Law Threw South Korea’s Crypto Markets into Chaos appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/expert-explains-why-martial-law-threw-south-koreas-crypto-markets-into-chaos/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37403104.jpeg

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/shiba-loves-trump-shibtrump-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37400270,https://crypto.news/?p=14317398,1733700337,Global think tank proposed Bitcoin reserve to Amazon,"A global think tank proposed Amazon to include Bitcoin into its strategic reserve by next year. This proposal is the same as Microsoft’s proposed by Michael Taylor a few weeks ago. The National Center for Public Policy Research, an independent global conservative think tank based in Washington D.C, has proposed the Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategic reserve to the 5th world’s largest company, Amazon. This proposal aims to bid the cash and cash equivalent of the company, which accounts for $88 billion that includes the U.S. government, corporate, and foreign bonds, to consider adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserve by the next annual meeting in April 2025. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding asset to its treasury that appriciate more than bonds, even if those asset are more volatile short-term,” Based on the document that was shared by Tim Kotzman X’s post on Dec. 09 The U.S. inflation rate reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, which is the main reason why the company should adopt Bitcoin as the other company did. As their bond rates also did not exceed the real inflation, it’s not adequate to protect billions of dollars of shareholders by holding these assets. National Center also noted that Bitcoin’s performance in the past year has risen to 131%, surpassing the bonds by 126%. It also outperforms the corporate bonds by 1.246% in a single year.

A few weeks ago, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor also presented the Bitcoin reserve for Microsoft; the company will decide it within this week. They also mentioned that Saylor’s action is followed by many companies and institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, which are releasing Bitcoin’s ETF to the stock market earlier this year. In conclusion, the National Center has advised Amazon to diversify its balance sheet by adding at least 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. It’s not only part of the move that technological companies need to make, but they should preserve their asset and the value of the shareholders with the unbeaten inflation of digital assets.

For investors eyeing the best altcoins to invest in for short-term ROIs, it’s all about spotting the next big wave before it crests. And boy, do we have some movers and shakers for you! Today, we’re diving into three altcoins that are making serious noise: Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol. These projects aren’t just riding the crypto hype train—they’re powering it. Take Qubetics , for example: this blockchain disruptor has raised a jaw-dropping $5 million in its presale, selling over 288 million $TICS tokens. With its price currently sitting at $0.0282 and climbing, it’s no wonder analysts are predicting massive short-term ROIs. Meanwhile, AAVE and Near Protocol are flexing their muscles in DeFi and scalability, proving there’s plenty of room for innovation in this volatile market. Buckle up, because this ride’s about to get interesting. Qubetics: The New Blockchain on the Block If you haven’t heard of Qubetics , you’re missing out on one of the hottest presales of the year. This revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain aims to unify networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum with its groundbreaking chain abstraction technology. Translation? Qubetics makes it ridiculously easy to manage real-world tokenised assets , conduct cross-border payments, and launch decentralised applications. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s a next-gen digital economy. The numbers speak for themselves: Qubetics has raised over $5 million in its presale, selling a whopping 288 million $TICS tokens. That’s not hype—it’s proof that investors are seeing the long-term potential here. At a current presale price of $0.0282, you’d snag about 177,304 $TICS tokens for a $5,000 investment. Now, let’s dream a little: analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, giving you an ROI of 785%. And if post-launch momentum propels it to $1 or more? We’re talking about life-changing gains. Why is Qubetics standing out? Because it solves major pain points in the crypto world—scalability, interoperability, and security—all in one sleek package. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newbie, this one’s worth watching closely. Learn more by watching this video . AAVE: The DeFi Darling Moving over to AAVE, the poster child for decentralised finance. If Qubetics is the bold new kid on the block, AAVE is the savvy veteran redefining how we interact with money. Its protocol lets users lend and borrow assets without a middleman—kind of like Venmo but decentralised and with way cooler tech. AAVE has been making waves recently, with its total value locked (TVL) climbing steadily. But the real appeal here is its short-term potential. With the launch of its AAVE v3 upgrade, which improves cross-chain functionality and liquidity efficiency, the token is expected to see significant price action. Imagine investing in AAVE at its current price of $246.79. With analysts predicting a potential ROI of 30% in just a few weeks, the gains can simply be mind-blowing. Sure, it’s not Qubetics-level explosive growth, but in the world of crypto, steady gains can still add up. AAVE isn’t just a token; it’s an ecosystem. From staking to governance to seamless DeFi applications, it’s a must-watch for anyone serious about crypto investments. Near Protocol: The Quiet Powerhouse Now, let’s talk about Near Protocol—a blockchain that flies a little under the radar but is quietly building the future. Near combines user-friendly tech with serious scalability, making it a top choice for developers creating dApps and DeFi platforms. Near’s short-term potential lies in its growing ecosystem. Recent partnerships and the buzz around its sharding technology (which splits the blockchain into smaller pieces for faster transactions) have analysts bullish. Let’s do the math: If you invest your money at its current price of $7.36 and the price climbs to $18.76 in the short term, as some experts suggest, you’re looking at a little bit over a cool 150% ROI. Not bad at all! Near is proof that you don’t need to be flashy to be effective. It’s quietly building a foundation for long-term success, which is why it’s a solid choice for both short-term traders and long-term holders. Why Timing Matters When Buying the Best Altcoins to Invest in for Short-Term ROIs Investing in crypto for short-term ROIs is all about timing. Whether it’s Qubetics smashing presale records, AAVE revolutionising DeFi, or Near Protocol scaling to new heights, the window of opportunity doesn’t stay open forever. Crypto moves fast, and today’s underdog can become tomorrow’s champion in the blink of an eye. Wrapping Up: The Big Picture Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics offers mind-blowing growth potential with its disruptive blockchain tech. AAVE continues to lead the DeFi charge with innovation and reliability. And Near Protocol proves that quiet powerhouses can still deliver massive returns. If you’re looking to make moves in the crypto world, don’t sleep on these projects. Qubetics’ presale is already setting the stage for historic returns, and with the token price expected to skyrocket, now’s the time to act. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Qubetics presale, stack up on AAVE and Near Protocol, and get ready to ride the wave of short-term ROIs. Because in the world of crypto, fortune favours the bold.

37399433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659127,1733698853,Dogecoin Sees Quiet Breakout As Data Signals Rally Continuation,"Dogecoin has finally surged above the crucial $0.48 resistance level, briefly reaching $0.484 before pulling back slightly. This marks a significant development for the meme coin, as it had struggled to break past this level for weeks. The move has sparked renewed optimism among traders and investors who see potential for further upside. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast – Analyst Sets $4 Target After Potential Retrace Key data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment highlights that Dogecoin, along with other meme coins, is experiencing mini breakouts this weekend. This trend suggests increasing bullish momentum in the meme coin sector, often viewed as a precursor to broader market rallies. The data indicates rising trading volumes and heightened on-chain activity, both of which point to sustained interest in Dogecoin. If this momentum continues, Dogecoin could be on the verge of extending its recent gains, with many market participants eyeing the $0.50 psychological level as the next target. A successful breakout above $0.50 could pave the way for even higher levels, further fueling the ongoing rally. However, failure to maintain its upward trajectory might lead to a period of consolidation. Dogecoin Sets The Stage For New Highs Dogecoin is positioning itself for higher prices as it continues its upward trajectory, but the latest breakout lacked the explosive momentum many anticipated. Despite pushing past critical levels, Dogecoin failed to sustain its price above the previous high, signaling a need for more significant buying pressure to maintain its rally. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment has shed light on the recent activity, revealing that meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, Dogewithhat, and Bonk are experiencing mini breakouts this weekend. According to their data, larger wallets, often referred to as “whales,” have been instrumental in driving up market caps for these coins. This trend is expected to continue until retail FOMO (fear of missing out) resurfaces, potentially pushing prices higher in the short term. However, the dynamics of meme coin markets suggest caution. Santiment’s analysis shows that when social dominance for these tokens spikes significantly, it often signals a market top. Whales typically capitalize on heightened retail enthusiasm, offloading their holdings at inflated prices. This pattern frequently results in a sharp retrace as prices correct following the sell-off. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Keep Buying – Price Holds Above Crucial Mark Santiment also shared a comparative chart tracking social dominance across these meme coins, highlighting past instances where peaks in attention preceded pullbacks. For Dogecoin, maintaining its current momentum while avoiding overbought conditions will be critical to sustaining its rally. Price Testing Fresh Supply Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.46, following a failed attempt to break decisively above the $0.48 level. The price remains in a consolidation phase, struggling to build enough momentum to push beyond the psychological $0.50 mark. Despite this, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, offering a supportive backdrop for potential price advances. The current environment suggests that Dogecoin is likely to continue ranging below $0.50 in the near term. However, if bulls can muster the strength to break above this critical level and sustain it for a few days, a massive breakout could be on the horizon. Breaking and holding above $0.50 would likely signal renewed buying interest, setting the stage for a strong rally. The bullish market conditions driving other major cryptocurrencies could also work in Dogecoin’s favor, provided that overall sentiment continues to improve. Still, traders should watch for clear confirmation of a breakout before expecting significant price movements. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week? A failure to break and hold above the $0.50 level could result in prolonged consolidation, delaying any meaningful upward momentum.

37397526,https://nulltx.com/?p=135397,1733695260,PEPE PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 8) – Pepe Gears Up For Another Rally Following 20% Surges Overnight,"Following a two-week bounce from close support, Pepe broke higher and looks ready for a massive rally, although the price looks calm. Pepe ended last month’s trading super strong after going through a short pullback. This brought a little pause in the bullish momentum as the price revisited the previously broken resistance (yearly high) as support. Bouncing back in the late month, the price increased but fell slightly earlier this week. Intercepting the $0.0000188 level, the buyers pushed back and briefly broke higher to a new high of $0.000027 yesterday. That high was rejected, and the price dropped to $0.000025, where it traded calmly. As volatility turned low in the past hours, the buyers are finding it difficult to sustain pressure. A further drop could bring a little retest at the $0.000023 level that broke on the lower timeframe. However, from the look of things, the buyers are likely to gain more dominance in the coming days. But if yesterday’s rejection turned out to be a double-top pattern, it may lose grip until it finds a solid level for a rebound. As of now, the trend remains strongly bullish daily. Looking at the daily chart, Pepe has provided a notable discount during the last leg down, and considering the latest bounce back, we can expect a huge rally in the coming week. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While trading under the key $0.00003 level, the higher price level to watch for an increase is $0.00004, followed by the $0.00005 level. The long-term target to keep in mind is $0.0001. The $0.0000173 level has been providing support since Pepe bounced back in late November. If by any chance it collapses, the $0.0000131 and $0.0000101 levels are lower supports to keep in mind for a test. Key Resistance Levels: $0.00003, $0.00004, $0.00005 Key Support Levels: $0.0000173, $0.0000131, $0.0000101 Spot Price: $0.0000245 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tesla-trumtesla-memecoin-will-explode-over-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The trend currently looks bullish following a 14% increase since yesterday. Last week saw WIF through an end to a three-week retracement after retesting the key $3 level. Holding this level as support, the meme coin entered a consolidation phase and remained calm throughout the week. Things changed this week due to enhanced volatility and the price tests broke out of the consolidation phase yesterday. Trading looks indecisive today as the bulls are yet to reiterate actions due to low buying pressure. While today may end strong, more positive actions should be expected in the future. An increase above $5 should set WIF up for bigger moves. Looking at the daily chart, it seems to be repeating last month’s pattern and if that comes into play, this current buying phase could reach $6. The bears are currently off the market. If they return with a pull below the mentioned key level, it may navigate the ascending trendline, which has been acting as diagonal support over the past months. From the look of things, WIF will likely increase rather than decrease in the coming week. WIF’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential resistance level for the latest surge is $4.86 – November’s high. A successful break above it should soar the price to a new high of $6. The next key level to watch above this high is $7. Losing the holding key support, the close level to watch for a rebound is $2.54, testing the ascending trendline. Breaking it could roll us back to last month’s $1.9 low.

If you’re searching for the best meme coin presales to join this weekend, the spotlight is on BTFD Coin . Meanwhile, Shiba Inu and Dogs continue to showcase their staying power in the meme coin market. Let’s explore what makes each of these coins a standout choice. BTFD Coin: The Newcomer Redefining Meme Coins If there’s one presale turning heads this weekend, it’s BTFD Coin. This rising star in the crypto world is more than a meme—it’s a movement, offering utility and fun in equal measure. BTFD Coin’s Play2Earn feature is stealing the show. Players can dive into exciting, competitive games while earning $BTFD. Imagine this: you’re battling it out in an epic game, and each win directly boosts your crypto portfolio. It’s a concept that’s attracting gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, creating a buzzing community around the token. With BTFD Coin, staking isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a game-changer. By staking $BTFD, investors earn rewards effortlessly, all while supporting the coin’s ecosystem. Analysts predict that these staking rewards could lead to significant ROI for early adopters.

Its developers have rolled out initiatives like meme creation contests and exclusive airdrops, ensuring the community stays engaged and invested. For instance, a recent contest saw users creating memes that went viral, further solidifying BTFD Coin’s presence online. It’s no wonder why many are calling BTFD Coin one of the best meme coin presales to join this weekend . Shiba Inu: The Veteran with Endless Potential You can’t talk about meme coins without mentioning Shiba Inu. Often dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” this token has evolved from being a joke to becoming one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu isn’t just a token; it’s an ecosystem. With projects like ShibaSwap, the coin has proven it can innovate and adapt. ShibaSwap offers token swapping, staking, and liquidity pools, making Shiba Inu much more than just a meme coin. Shiba Inu’s success is powered by its loyal community, the SHIB Army. This global network of supporters constantly drives the coin’s popularity through social media campaigns and grassroots movements. Just last month, the SHIB Army organised a charity event, raising thousands of dollars while promoting the coin. With the launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, Shiba Inu is entering uncharted territory. This move could lower transaction fees and boost adoption, paving the way for even more significant growth. Dogs: The Underrated Contender with a Strong Bite While lesser-known than its counterparts, Dogs is making a name for itself in the meme coin world. Its focus on creating a sustainable, community-driven model sets it apart. Dogs doesn’t overcomplicate things. The coin’s mission is straightforward: to create a fun, engaging community while delivering steady growth for its investors. This simplicity resonates with a wide audience, from crypto newbies to seasoned traders. Dogs is all about its people. The project regularly hosts live Q&A sessions, exclusive giveaways, and meme contests. One recent event saw Dogs’ developers answer hundreds of questions from eager investors, showcasing their transparency and dedication. Dogs might not have the hype of BTFD Coin or the legacy of Shiba Inu, but it has the potential for steady, long-term growth. Its low market cap and focus on community engagement make it a hidden gem for those willing to take a chance. Conclusion Meme coins are here to stay, and each of these tokens proves why. BTFD Coin shines as a presale powerhouse with its Play2Earn game, staking rewards, and vibrant community. Shiba Inu continues to dominate with its ecosystem and loyal SHIB Army, while Dogs offers simplicity and steady growth for those who value long-term investments.

Chaudhary also highlighted the government’s growing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency sector, noting that 47 Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers (VDA SPs) have been registered as Reporting Entities with the Financial Intelligence Unit-India under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. This is not the first instance of the government acting against crypto exchanges. In 2021-22, 11 platforms were penalized for tax evasion, with $1.08 million in unpaid taxes identified. At the time, authorities successfully recovered $1.2 million, including penalties. Crackdown on Binance’s Tax Evasion This report comes months after Indian law enforcement agencies demanded around $86 million in unpaid taxes from Binance in August. Binance and several other offshore crypto exchanges were banned in India in January 2024 for non-compliance with local regulations. However, in April, the exchange announced its intention to resume operations in the country after settling pending taxes. Despite this, in August 2024, the Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence (DGGI) demanded $86 million from Binance under GST. According to The Times of India, the platform had reportedly earned $480 million from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. Investigations revealed that these earnings were credited to an account belonging to Nest Services Ltd. Authorities also sent email notices to Binance’s offices in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands, and Switzerland, which the exchange initially ignored. Binance later appointed local counsel to address its tax obligations. India requires all crypto service providers and investors to pay a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every transaction, regardless of its value. Additionally, all profits from crypto investments are subject to a 30% tax.

The nearest resistance level is at $53; breaking this could propel AVAX toward the next target at $62.72. The RSI at 45.77 suggests the coin is not overbought, leaving room for upward movement. Despite a slightly negative MACD, the overall trend hints at bullish potential. With altcoin season on the horizon, AVAX could surge significantly, possibly exceeding upcoming resistance levels.

The RSI is near neutral, suggesting there's potential for more buying pressure. With moving averages around $10, a move upwards could align with bullish trends.

Following Bitcoin’s milestone, the crypto-focused X account Autism Capital asked Bukele to disclose El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio to “dunk on the haters.” In response, Bukele posted the portfolio, revealing the nation’s nearly $270 million investment in Bitcoin. The portfolio confirms that no Bitcoin has been sold, and unrealized gains now exceed $333 million, a significant validation of the country’s strategy. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021, when its Bitcoin Law came into effect. A day prior, the government made its inaugural purchase of 200 BTC. Since then, the country has continued accumulating Bitcoin. On November 17, 2022, Bukele announced a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, committing to purchasing one Bitcoin daily. According to Nayib Tracker, a platform monitoring El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, the country currently owns 6,180 BTC, with an average purchase price of $44,739.88. Based on current prices, the portfolio has gained approximately 122%. Beyond financial gains, El Salvador has also seen increased tourism and international recognition since adopting Bitcoin. IMF Urges El Salvador to Reconsider Despite the reported benefits, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly advised El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin initiatives. On January 25, 2022, the IMF urged the country to stop recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, citing financial stability risks but acknowledging its potential for financial inclusion. The IMF renewed its concerns on October 3, 2024, with communications director Julie Kozack recommending the country narrow the Bitcoin Law’s scope and limit public sector exposure to Bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/el-salvadors-bitcoin-gains-surpass-333-million-amid-btcs-100k-milestone/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37396619,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624624,1733693150,Amazon shareholders tells company to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury,"Amazon shareholders are requesting the company to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet as a way to protect against inflation. This follows a trend where companies, including Microsoft and Tesla, are exploring Bitcoin as an asset. Amazon’s shareholders are asking the company to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, following in the footsteps of other big companies like Microsoft and Tesla. This proposal is part of a bigger trend where companies are considering Bitcoin to protect their money from inflation and make more money for their shareholders. Why Bitcoin for Amazon? As Inflation is going up, cash and bonds aren’t the best way to protect a company’s money anymore. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been increasing in value. In 2024, Bitcoin grew by 131%, which is much better than bonds. Over the last five years, Bitcoin’s value went up by more than 1,200%, which is far outpacing bonds. Shareholders believe that with Amazon’s $585 billion in assets, including $88 billion in cash and bonds, the company should consider adding Bitcoin to its reserves. Holding Bitcoin could help Amazon protect its profits from inflation and possibly earn better returns in the future. Following the proposal, which is already making rounds on X (formerly Twitter), former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) made a post by asking the company to simply add support for crypto as a payment option on the leading e-commerce platform. “Simple. Accept bitcoin payments?,” CZ posted. Simple. Accept bitcoin payments? 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ud5PVNYHrj — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 8, 2024 Companies like MicroStrategy, which holds a lot of Bitcoin, have seen their stock prices increase. Other companies like Tesla and Block (formerly Square) have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The proposal suggests that Amazon could do the same to increase shareholder value. While Bitcoin is a volatile asset, having some Bitcoin in its reserves could give Amazon more long-term value, even if its value fluctuates in the short term. The shareholders suggest that Amazon could start by holding just 5% of its assets in Bitcoin in the initial. This proposal reflects a bigger trend of companies starting to see Bitcoin as a safe investment to protect against inflation. Microsoft’s shareholders are voting soon on whether to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet. As Bitcoin becomes more accepted by big companies, it may soon become a regular part of how companies manage their assets. Amazon has yet to decide whether to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. However, one can say that more companies are likely to follow suit with firms like Microsoft and Amazon now joining the discussion.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's scarcity, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Starting as a joke, it quickly gained a following, showing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, fueled by online buzz and endorsements from Elon Musk. It entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value over $50 billion. Is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology is simple, similar to early cryptocurrencies but without a supply limit. This means it's less about scarcity and more about usage and community support. While some see it as a fun entry into crypto, others are cautious due to its meme origins and volatility. Compared to coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features like smart contracts. Yet, its strong community keeps it popular. In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike its predecessor, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, opening up possibilities in the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Launched by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain credibility, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB's place on Ethereum allows it to support smart contracts and decentralized apps. This led to ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. The team also plans an NFT platform and a governance system using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These features give SHIB real utility beyond being a meme. In the current market, where investors seek coins with real-world uses, SHIB's technology and growth plans make it attractive. While sharing Dogecoin's meme appeal, SHIB's Ethereum foundation could give it an edge in the long run. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB remain popular, XYZVerse offers a unique blend of sports and memes, aiming for massive growth and to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's scarcity, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Starting as a joke, it quickly gained a following, showing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, fueled by online buzz and endorsements from Elon Musk. It entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value over $50 billion. Is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology is simple, similar to early cryptocurrencies but without a supply limit. This means it's less about scarcity and more about usage and community support. While some see it as a fun entry into crypto, others are cautious due to its meme origins and volatility. Compared to coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features like smart contracts. Yet, its strong community keeps it popular. In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Conclusion While coins like DOGE, PEPE, and MOG offer strong potential, XYZVerse stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin poised for exceptional growth in the current bull run.

This Crypto is Your Chance Now for Massive Gains in 2025,"If you’ve been keeping tabs on the crypto market lately, you know it’s been a whirlwind. Algorand (ALGO) has been at the center of attention, skyrocketing in price thanks to its fast, secure, and eco-friendly blockchain. But let’s face it—if you didn’t jump in during its earlier days, you’re probably wondering if it’s too late to see those jaw-dropping returns. Don’t worry, though. Missing the ALGO train isn’t the end of the line. There’s a new player in town, and it’s got analysts buzzing. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS), the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone looking to make massive gains in 2025. While Algorand has been making waves in scalability and decentralisation, Qubetics is carving out its own lane with real-world asset tokenisation. Imagine owning a slice of prime real estate, fine art, or even small businesses, all without the massive upfront costs. That’s the power of Qubetics. And right now, it’s in its presale phase, which means you’ve got a golden opportunity to jump in early and ride the wave to potentially life-changing returns. Qubetics ($TICS): A New Frontier in Asset Tokenisation Let’s get one thing straight: Qubetics isn’t just another “hype” token. It’s solving a real-world problem that most crypto projects barely scratch the surface of—making high-value assets accessible to everyday investors. Think about it. How many of us dream about owning a piece of a luxury condo, investing in a startup, or putting money into rare art? For most folks, those opportunities feel about as out of reach as winning the lottery. But Qubetics is changing all that with its Web3 aggregator platform. Here’s how it works: Qubetics takes real-world assets—like real estate, businesses, and even fine art—and breaks them into smaller, tokenised shares. That means you don’t need millions to get in the game. For example, say you’re a small-town teacher in Kansas with $300 to invest. With Qubetics, you could own a piece of a high-end Manhattan apartment or a slice of a growing café in Seattle. It’s like crowdfunding, but on steroids. And it’s not just individuals who benefit. Businesses are loving this model, too. A local brewery in Texas could tokenize its equity to fund a new taproom, while an artist in LA could sell shares of their latest painting to collectors worldwide. By democratizing asset ownership, Qubetics is opening doors that were once slammed shut for anyone without deep pockets. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 11, priced at just $0.0282 per $TICS. So far, it’s raised over $5 million, with more than 288 million tokens sold to a growing community of 7,500+ holders. And here’s the kicker: a 10% price increase happens every week, with a final phase bump of 20% before the token launches at $0.25. That’s a potential 900% ROI for early investors. Let’s break it down with an example. If you invest $300 today, you’ll snag roughly 10,638 $TICS tokens. When the price hits $0.25 after the presale, your investment could be worth a cool $2,659.50. That’s enough to kickstart your 2025 goals, whether it’s paying off bills, starting a side hustle, or just treating yourself to something nice. Algorand (ALGO): A Green Giant Making Big Moves Algorand has been a darling of the crypto world for a reason. It’s fast, secure, and, most importantly, eco-friendly—a major selling point in a world where sustainability is top of mind. Designed by MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand’s blockchain is a marvel of efficiency, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without breaking a sweat. Over the past year, ALGO has seen a massive resurgence, fueled by partnerships with governments, institutions, and even DeFi projects. Its price surged by over 75% in just one week, reaching a new yearly high of $0.5208. Open Interest (OI) in ALGO futures has also skyrocketed, jumping from $75.69 million to $204 million in a matter of days. This influx of capital has analysts buzzing, with some predicting ALGO could hit $0.75 in the short term and potentially cross the $1 mark by mid-2025. But here’s the rub: While Algorand’s tech is undeniably impressive, its gains might not be as explosive as they once were. For early adopters, the ride has been thrilling. But for new investors jumping in at these higher price levels, the upside might feel more like a gradual climb than a rocket launch. That said, ALGO is still a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable blockchain project with long-term potential. Its use cases in areas like supply chain management, digital identity, and carbon offset tracking make it a cornerstone of the green blockchain movement. But if you’re hunting for those “life-changing gains,” you might want to look at newer projects like Qubetics. Don’t Miss Out—Get in on Qubetics Before It’s Too Late So, where should you put your money—Qubetics or Algorand? Honestly, it depends on your goals. If you’re looking for a tried-and-true blockchain project with a focus on sustainability and scalability, Algorand is a safe bet. It’s already proven itself, and its partnerships give it a strong foundation for growth. But if you’re chasing those big, juicy returns that make your friends go, “Wait, you made how much?” Qubetics is the clear winner. Its presale phase is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that’s tackling a massive market. With its real-world asset tokenisation model, Qubetics is poised to become a household name in 2025. And let’s not forget that potential 900% ROI—that’s the kind of growth most crypto investors dream about. Crypto is all about timing, and the clock is ticking on Qubetics’ presale. If you’ve been kicking yourself for missing the Algorand frenzy, now’s your chance to turn things around. With a growing community, innovative technology, and analysts calling it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 , Qubetics has all the makings of a breakout star. Head to the Qubetics presale page today and lock in your investment before the next price hike. Whether you’re putting down $300 or going all in, this could be your ticket to massive gains in 2025. Don’t wait until you’re reading about its success next year—be a part of it now.

The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, is the first cryptocurrency. It uses blockchain technology to let people send money directly to each other without banks. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin exists as a shared record across many computers worldwide. This system aims to be secure and protect against fraud. Transactions are confirmed by ""miners"" who solve complex puzzles to validate them. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins for their work. Every four years, an event called ""halving"" cuts these rewards in half. This process limits the total number of bitcoins to 21 million. Today, Bitcoin's limited supply and growing acceptance have boosted its value. In the current market, it stands out compared to other cryptocurrencies. While new coins emerge with different features, Bitcoin remains the leader. Its established network makes it a significant player in the digital currency world. Market trends show increasing interest in cryptocurrencies as alternatives to traditional money. Bitcoin's resilience and pioneering technology make it an important part of this shift. As more people look to digital options, Bitcoin's role could become even more prominent. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, has revolutionized the blockchain world with its pioneering Proof-of-Stake mechanism and smart contract capabilities. Unlike traditional blockchains, Ethereum supports decentralized applications (dApps) that power a vast ecosystem, including finance, gaming, and more. Innovations like Layer 2 solutions—such as Arbitrum and Polygon—enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs, making the network more efficient. The introduction of ERC-20 tokens set a standard for creating new tokens used for governance, utility, and value storage within various applications. Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake with ""The Merge"" in 2022 marked a significant milestone, reducing energy consumption and setting the stage for future scalability improvements like sharding. Looking ahead, Ethereum's potential continues to grow as it strives to address scalability and cost issues. The upcoming sharding phase aims to increase transaction throughput, making the network more accessible and efficient. In the current market cycle, Ethereum stands out not just for its technological advancements but also for its resilience and adaptability. While other cryptocurrencies face challenges, Ethereum's strong developer community and continuous upgrades keep it at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Market trends suggest that Ethereum remains a vital asset in the crypto space, serving as collateral, rewarding stakers, and facilitating countless transactions. Its trajectory indicates a promising future, making it an attractive option for those interested in the evolution of decentralized technologies. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's scarcity, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Starting as a joke, it quickly gained a following, showing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, fueled by online buzz and endorsements from Elon Musk. It entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value over $50 billion. Is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology is simple, similar to early cryptocurrencies but without a supply limit. This means it's less about scarcity and more about usage and community support. While some see it as a fun entry into crypto, others are cautious due to its meme origins and volatility. Compared to coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features like smart contracts. Yet, its strong community keeps it popular. In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is turning heads in the cryptocurrency world. It's a flexible and scalable blockchain designed for smart contracts. This allows developers to build decentralized finance apps, create crypto tokens, and design games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake ADA on the Cardano network. What makes Cardano stand out is its eco-friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is much more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work model. Cardano's innovative design splits the blockchain into two layers. The Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computing Layer manages smart contracts. This could boost its transaction speed up to a million per second. Since March 2021, Cardano's native tokens have enabled secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. This sets a new benchmark for efficiency and scalability in blockchain technology. In the current market, where sustainability and scalability are key, Cardano shows great potential. While other networks face challenges like high fees and slow transactions, Cardano offers a promising alternative. Its technological advancements might position it as a strong contender in the evolving crypto landscape. XRP (XRP) XRP is a cryptocurrency that sets itself apart with speed and low cost. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it was created to be a digitally native, programmable currency that's open and borderless. Unlike traditional systems, XRP operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. You don't need a bank account to use it, which opens up possibilities for people everywhere. Launched by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company that was gifted 80 billion XRP, uses it to improve network liquidity and supports the ecosystem by releasing supply in a controlled manner. In the current market cycle, XRP shows potential due to its focus on fast and low-cost cross-border payments. While other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained attention, XRP's unique approach to facilitating seamless transfers across various currencies makes it stand out. Recent trends suggest that there is growing interest in efficient payment solutions, and XRP could play a key role in that space. Its resistance to censorship and counterfeiting adds to its appeal. For investors looking at the evolving crypto market, XRP presents an interesting option to consider. Conclusion While BTC, ETH, DOGE, and ADA show promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a groundbreaking memecoin uniting sports fans, aiming for massive growth and a community-driven future.

In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. XRP (XRP) XRP is a cryptocurrency that sets itself apart with speed and low cost. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it was created to be a digitally native, programmable currency that's open and borderless. Unlike traditional systems, XRP operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. You don't need a bank account to use it, which opens up possibilities for people everywhere. Launched by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company that was gifted 80 billion XRP, uses it to improve network liquidity and supports the ecosystem by releasing supply in a controlled manner. In the current market cycle, XRP shows potential due to its focus on fast and low-cost cross-border payments. While other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained attention, XRP's unique approach to facilitating seamless transfers across various currencies makes it stand out. Recent trends suggest that there is growing interest in efficient payment solutions, and XRP could play a key role in that space. Its resistance to censorship and counterfeiting adds to its appeal. For investors looking at the evolving crypto market, XRP presents an interesting option to consider. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike its predecessor, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, opening up possibilities in the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Launched by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain credibility, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB's place on Ethereum allows it to support smart contracts and decentralized apps. This led to ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. The team also plans an NFT platform and a governance system using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These features give SHIB real utility beyond being a meme. In the current market, where investors seek coins with real-world uses, SHIB's technology and growth plans make it attractive. While sharing Dogecoin's meme appeal, SHIB's Ethereum foundation could give it an edge in the long run. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run begins, ETH, DOGE, XRP, and SHIB show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) offers a unique blend of memes and sports with huge growth potential.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency created in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional digital currencies. Featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo, it was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin's value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and exceeding $50 billion in total value. This growth was propelled by social media influence and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's open-source technology and strong community support contribute to its potential. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and investor sentiment. BONK: A Solana-Based Memecoin Empowering the Community BONK is a memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by shifting influence from venture capital-backed tokens to users. BONK surged over 100% after being listed on Coinbase. Half of its supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi sectors, promoting widespread adoption. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase exceeding 10,000%. Despite challenges like high total supply and memecoin volatility, BONK's integration into Solana's growing ecosystem of decentralized apps, including the launch of BonkSwap, shows potential. In the current market cycle, BONK presents an interesting opportunity due to its community focus and ecosystem involvement. Dogwifhat (WIF): A New Dog-Themed Meme Coin on the Solana Blockchain Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. As part of the trend of dog-themed cryptocurrencies, WIF focuses on community engagement and fun, leveraging internet culture to gain attention. Built on Solana, it benefits from fast transaction speeds and low fees, which can enhance user experience. Meme coins like WIF often gain popularity through viral marketing and strong community support. In the current market cycle, interest in meme coins persists, and WIF's unique theme may attract enthusiasts looking for fresh and entertaining projects in the crypto space. Conclusion While DOGE, BONK, and WIF show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it expects 700% growth by presale's end and potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. DOGEN is forming a community of leaders aiming for market dominance, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

Santiment says on the social media platform X that Bitcoin miners offloaded over $8.55 billion worth of BTC in just two days, representing the largest distribution of the last 10 months. While Bitcoin miners are heavily unloading their BTC stacks, Santiment notes that other deep-pocketed investors are picking up the slack. “Bitcoin’s collective mining balances have been dropping since April 2024. However, this latest drop of 85,503 BTC in just 48 hours is the most extreme we’ve seen since late February (two weeks before the then $73,000 all-time high). Note that these wallets have NOT been correlative with price for most of this year. Overall, non-mining whales and sharks are still accumulating. Consider this a net-neutral signal for the time being.” Source: Santiment/X Looking at Bitcoin’s current price action, the analytics firm says BTC appears to be trading in tandem with the S&P 500 (SPX). According to Santiment, breaking the price correlation between stocks and Bitcoin will bode well for BTC. “After crypto’s ‘Trump Pump’ has settled down over the past two weeks, Bitcoin has began to range in close correlation with the S&P 500. In fact, most of the year has seen a fairly tight bond between the two, with BTC often being memed about being a ‘high leveraged tech stock’ by cryptocurrency traders. Regardless, pay attention to a more mid or long-term break between crypto and equities. If this correlation begins to weaken, it would be a bullish signal. Historically, crypto has flourished when there is little to no reliance on world stock markets.” Source: Santiment/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $99,856.

37395408,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659110,1733691634,Ethereum Active Addresses Surge By 36% In Support Of Bullish Price Action – Details,"Shortly after surging above $4,000 on December 6, Ethereum (ETH) has sunk into a state of consolidation showing no significant price action over the last day. With growing speculations over the altcoin’s next price movement, CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci has shared a report that suggests a sustained price rally by Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breakout: Charting The Uncertain Part Of ETH To $18,000 US Election Results Drive Ethereum Active Addresses To 417,000 Following the US elections of November 5, Ethereum, alongside a host of other cryptocurrencies, has experienced massive price gains driven primarily by the emergence of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump as the US President-elect. According to Burak Kesmeci, the results of the US elections removed much uncertainty around the crypto market while encouraging investment as evidenced by price gains of several tokens. Notably, Ethereum, known as the “Father of altcoins”, has recorded a price growth of 70% since November 5 reaching a local peak of $4,077. As with all price rallies, there is continuous speculation on Ethereum’s ability to maintain its current upward price trajectory. Joining the discourse, Kesmeci has drawn a bullish inference from the asset’s change in active address. The CryptoQuant analyst highlights that during Ethereum’s recent price surge, active addresses on its network increased by 36.26% from 306,000 on November 5, to its current value of 417,000. This development indicates that the price increase of Ethereum was based on an equal rise in organic demand and market interest by investors and blockchain users. In conclusion, Burak Kesmeci states the growth in Ethereum active addresses backs the recent price rally as “healthy and sustainable”. Importantly, it is also a bullish signal that indicates ETH is likely to experience a long-term price surge. Related Reading: Ethereum To Pull A BTC 2021-Like Rally? Analyst Shares Massive Prediction ETH Price Overview According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum trades at $4,006 reflecting a slight loss of 0.54% in the past 24 hours. For long-term investors, the prominent altcoin remains in profit based on gains of 7.36% and 39.31% in the last seven and 30 days, respectively. If ETH breaks upward following its current consolidation, the altcoin will face significant resistance at $4,100. However, moving past this price zone opens a potential pathway to $4,900 which lies around Ethereum’s all-time high at $4,891. Aside from a rise in Ethereum active addresses, other developments continue to contribute to the heightened bullish sentiments around the second-largest cryptocurrency. This includes an increase in the inflows to the Ethereum spot ETFs, as backed by a cumulative total net inflow of $1.41 billion. In addition, the altseason appears to be kicking off with widespread gains tipped to occur in early 2025.

They say IntelMa r kets , an AI-driven project could rally to $0.1 in the coming months, making it a good crypto to buy. Ripple could surge to $7-$10 in Q1 2025 A top expert known as a faceless trader argued that Ripple could fall to $1.56275 in December. Afterward, the expert says the Ripple coin price might pump to $7-$10 in the first quarter of 2025. One factor that could propel this price surge is the end of the ongoing Ripple-SEC battle. Analysts like JackTheRipper believe the emergence of Donald Trump could end the legal tussle, a move that could push the Ripple XRP to new levels. Besides, the potential launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, adds more momentum to the mix. In the meantime, the cryptocurrency has corrected to the lower part of $2. Still, CoinMarketCap price info reveals the value of the Ripple token has risen by 68.2% in the weekly timeframe. It has also increased by 376.5% on the monthly level.

With SEC clarity, XRP leads the bull cycle as DTX Exchange eyes gains with a feature tied to XRP’s ETF potential. With regulatory clarity from the SEC, XRP is leading this bull cycle, reigniting investor confidence in long-term investments. Meanwhile, market attention is turning to DTX Exchange as it launches a new feature poised to capitalize on XRP’s probable ETF launch. As institutional and retail investors evaluate these opportunities, the crypto market’s focus highlights a potential shift toward platforms that combine innovation with regulatory approval, signaling new frontrunners in the race for dominance. You might also like: DTX Exchange bound for rally, draws in Cardano and Hedera holders Ripple’s XRP balances hype and history in current rally In one month, XRP accumulated more than $130 billion in market cap to become the 4th largest cryptocurrency. Currently trading above $2.30, XRP is up 37% this week, driven by optimism surrounding Ripple’s planned RLUSD stablecoin and potential XRP ETF approval. There’s also the expansion of cross-border payment in partnership with the NYDFS. Despite bullish momentum and predictions of reaching new all-time highs, XRP faces skepticism. Analysts warn of volatility and note Ripple’s significant reserves of 38.9 billion tokens, raising concerns about market supply. Recent price consolidation, including a 2.9% dip in the past 24 hours, suggests profit-taking and waning short-term momentum. Experts are divided: some foresee further surges due to ecosystem growth, while others anticipate a pullback below $0.60, citing XRP’s history of sharp declines, such as its 75% drop post-2021 peak. Nevertheless, market sentiment remains largely bullish as XRP continues to lead this bull cycle. At the press time, XRP is trading above its moving averages with a “buy” signal on its momentum indicator. DTX Exchange Capitalizes on ETF buzz with new features DTX Exchange is the latest example of a unique approach to decentralized finance, poised to disrupt the ETF market.

The distributed liquidity pools on the platform also guarantee the best execution of trades, tighter spreads, and smooth price discovery. Global access is another advantage since DTX Exchange operates without the geographic or regulatory restrictions seen in traditional platforms. Blockchain transparency ensures real-time tracking of ETF components, fostering trust and security among users. Moreover, traders can use up to 1,000x leverage and leverage advanced on-chain analytics to inform their trading decisions. Retail investors are encouraged with tools and educational material to stand squarely with institutions in the markets. DTX Exchange blends the best of DeFi accessibility with the stability of traditional ETFs to provide a next-generation gateway into the markets. Currently, one DTX token is sold for $0.12 in the sixth stage of its ongoing presale. Early DTX holders have access to premium features like enhanced analytics and priority customer support. Interested investors who get in now can join a growing DeFi ecosystem that has already raised nearly $10 million and is rumored to be the dark horse of the next cycle.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world!🚀 Bitcoin: The First Cryptocurrency and Its Ongoing Potential Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto to create an electronic cash system without central authorities. It operates on blockchain technology, allowing peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks. Transactions are validated through mining, where miners solve puzzles and are rewarded with bitcoins. The total supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins, and every four years, a ""halving"" reduces miners' rewards by half. This system aims to prevent fraud and inflation. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply contribute to its potential as a store of value. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin continues to play a significant role, and its unique features may appeal to those interested in digital currencies. Ethereum's Evolution: From Smart Contracts to Scalable Proof-of-Stake Initiated by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum is a leading Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for its smart contracts and vast decentralized application ecosystem. It introduced ERC-20 tokens, widely used for governance, utility, and value storage, while transactions require ETH for gas fees. The transition to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 marked a significant evolution, aiming to enhance decentralization and efficiency. Upcoming sharding seeks to boost scalability and reduce costs. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon further improve transaction efficiency. Price predictions estimate Ethereum reaching up to $6,580.53 next year. With its technological advancements, Ethereum remains central in the blockchain space, showing significant potential in the current market cycle. Solana (SOL): A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. It aims for faster transactions without using sharding or second-layer solutions, allowing development across multiple programming languages. SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. By supporting the network's operation and providing access to various projects, SOL holds significant value within the ecosystem. With its high-capacity network and potential to host high-activity products and services, SOL presents considerable potential. In the current market cycle, SOL's technological strengths may make it an attractive option for those interested in scalable blockchain solutions. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, it offers security and resistance to censorship or counterfeiting, and does not require a bank account for settlements. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for development and liquidity support. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., placed 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across currencies, making it suitable for global financial transactions. Its features make it a significant player in the current market landscape. Conclusion While BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP may see limited short-term growth, DOGEN emerges as the choice for those pursuing excellence. Expected to grow 700% by presale's end with potential for huge returns, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders, offers genuine benefits, and follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat.

Coutts remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term potential, while noting the challenges posed by the deteriorating liquidity environment. “Bitcoin reached new ATHs amid worsening liquidity,” the analyst said, adding that this could limit the duration of the rally. Coutts explained that Bitcoin’s performance is highly sensitive to liquidity conditions, as measured by the Bitcoin Macro Sentiment Indicator (MSI). He said the model has proven effective in predicting critical market reversals, including the start of a bear market in January 2022 and the bottom in December 2022. Currently, the MSI indicator has entered a bearish crossover since mid-October, signaling that investors should be careful. “The macro and liquidity charts are unequivocally showing continued bearish momentum for most metrics,” Coutts said. “This is not a moment of panic; this is a warning. Bitcoin is the lowest yielding in these environments.” He also noted that Bitcoin tends to perform best when liquidity conditions are favorable. “BTC can rally when conditions are adverse, but the best returns are achieved when these factors are bullish,” he added. Coutts outlined two potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory: Deteriorating Liquidity Conditions: If the liquidity environment continues to deteriorate, the current rally may only continue for a limited period of time. Easing Liquidity Conditions: If central banks start providing liquidity, a pullback may occur followed by a new rally. Related News: Watch Out: 38 Altcoins Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Coutts noted that the Fed is aware of tight liquidity conditions and has discussed measures to ease them in recent meetings. He also cited the views of macro analyst Raoul Pal, who pointed out that Bitcoin tends to lag global liquidity by several months. “Based on this, Bitcoin could go up a bit more before reaching a cap,” the analyst said, hinting at the possibility of a short-term pullback before the next rally. *This is not investment advice.

37394658,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624612,1733689828,Is Bitcoin a national threat? Peter Schiff thinks so,"Peter Schiff warns that Bitcoin has become a national security threat, especially if government funds are used to buy it. As Bitcoin’s value rises, debates continue about Bitcoin’s ability to change financial systems and create risks. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has become a hot topic again, especially after financial expert Peter Schiff called it “public enemy number one.” He believes Bitcoin is no longer just a risky investment for private individuals, “it’s now a threat to national security,” he argued. According to Schiff, Bitcoin supporters are bribing government officials to use taxpayers’ money to buy Bitcoin, which he argues is dangerous for people. Bitcoin as a reserve asset Peter Schiff’s comments only come amid ongoing discussions on whether Bitcoin could be used as a national reserve asset, like gold. Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, advocated for Bitcoin to replace gold in reserves in a recent interview. Saylor believes Bitcoin could help the US stay financially strong and reduce dependence on gold. However, not everyone agrees with this idea. Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers called it “crazy,” pointing out the risks involved. While the US government is still unsure, individual states are moving ahead with their plans to adopt. For example, Florida plans to create its own Bitcoin reserve by 2025. As more states and countries consider Bitcoin a potential asset for their treasuries, the idea gains more traction in the countries. Is Bitcoin a national threat? Bitcoin’s price has been climbing fast. Recently, it reached over $100,000 per coin for the first time and created a new all-time high. This price surge has drawn more attention to Bitcoin especially non non-crypto people and from big companies and investors. Some believe that if Bitcoin becomes a reserve asset, its price could hit $3 million by 2025 and more. While Schiff argues Bitcoin is a threat to financial stability, some strongly believe that it is the future of money, offering new opportunities for investors and governments.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a flexible and sustainable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. It enables the development of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum's ETH, allowing users to store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano stands out for its environmentally sustainable approach, using the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism for energy efficiency, unlike energy-intensive proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, setting a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. POL Token: Unlocking Utility and Governance in the Polygon Network POL is the utility token in the Polygon network. It plays a key role in many operations and services. Holders can stake POL to support the network's security. They earn rewards based on the amount staked. POL also allows holders to participate in governance. They can vote on proposals that shape the Polygon network. This ensures the community has a say in its development. POL gives access to exclusive services within the ecosystem. It unlocks special features and applications. As the Polygon network grows, POL may see increased demand. Its wide range of uses ties its potential to the expansion of the ecosystem. XRP: A Decentralized Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that runs on the XRP Ledger. It is designed as a digital, programmable currency that is open, borderless, and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. Transactions are irreversible and secure, operating without a central authority. Settlements do not require a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion coins. Ripple, originally known as OpenCoin Inc., was gifted 80 billion XRP to enhance network liquidity and support the ecosystem. To control the supply release, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow. The name XRP comes from ""ripple credits,"" highlighting its goal to facilitate smooth payment transfers across different currencies. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for Seamless Interoperability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables different blockchains to communicate securely. It allows value and data to be shared between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions more efficiently than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network, giving holders a say in development and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, co-creator of Ethereum, and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot offers a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. Conclusion In conclusion, while ADA, POL, XRP, and DOT may offer modest returns in the short term, CYBRO stands out as a remarkable opportunity for investors. This advanced DeFi platform enhances earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. It features attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Users enjoy a superior experience with effortless deposits and withdrawals. With a strong commitment to transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO is gaining significant attention from major investors and influencers in the crypto space.

37394809,https://thecoinrise.com/ethereum-decentralization-and-functionality-the-big-take/,1733689149,"Ethereum, Decentralization and Functionality: The Big Take","The crypto space has recently seen a resurgence of discussions about the core Ethereum core principles. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, has largely sparked these discussions. These debates focus on balancing decentralization with functionality in a growing ecosystem. While Ethereum has long championed decentralization, it now faces the challenge of integrating new technologies that could compromise its core values. Decentralization vs. Centralization: The Core Debate Vitalik Buterin’s comments on the subject have sparked important discussions about Ethereum. While the platform is dedicated to decentralization, real-world applications have sometimes made it difficult to achieve this goal fully. Unlike Dogecoin, which operates without any centralized control , Ethereum relies on centralized intermediaries like API nodes and oracles to perform specific tasks. While these solutions can enhance performance and usability, they contradict Ethereum’s founding principle of decentralization. While these solutions can enhance performance and usability, they contradict Ethereum’s founding principle of decentralization. Buterin argued that if Ethereum were to adopt centralized solutions fully, it would lose its identity as a decentralized platform. His position underscores the network’s dedication to verifiability and democratized participation, key values that set the platform apart. As Ethereum continues to evolve, its ability to maintain decentralization while integrating effective solutions will be crucial for its future success. The Challenges of Decentralized Solutions Recently, Flashbots , a blockchain researcher and infrastructure provider, launched BuilderNet. The infrastructure provider claimed this would address the centralization challenges in the Ethereum blockchain. Nevertheless, the major challenge for Ethereum is implementing low-latency API nodes and secure multi-party computation (MPC). This could replace centralized intermediaries, but it is still years away. Despite these challenges, Ethereum’s community prioritizes verifiability and decentralization. This commitment reflects the ongoing effort to ensure ETH stays decentralized while improving usability and functionality. Ethereum and Current Market Movements As the Ethereum blockchain’s debates continue, its market performance is evolving. Recently, the network’s native token surged past $4,000 , marking a 28% increase since November 18. Despite dipping to $3,615 on December 5, it has recovered to $3,984.97, up by 0.62% as per CoinMarketCap data at the time of writing. Crypto analysts are optimistic about Ethereum’s future . An anonymous trader known as “Venture Founder” recently highlighted that the asset is nearing a significant breakout from a three-year ascending triangle pattern.

37394606,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51660,1733688947,BTFD Coin Skyrockets with Play2Earn Hype While Pepe Coin and Brett Skyrocket,"The world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, but some projects stand out more than others. While investors keep an eye on top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a different class of tokens has surged in popularity over the past few years: meme coins. Meme coins have turned the crypto landscape upside down, offering high-risk, high-reward opportunities that capture the attention of traders everywhere. Whether it’s for quick gains or the unique communities they build, meme coins have become a staple in the portfolios of many crypto enthusiasts. So, if you’re looking for the best meme coin presales to join right now, you’re in the right place. Here, we’ll dive into three of the hottest meme coins making waves today: BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin, and Brett. Each of these projects has something unique to offer, and by the end of this comparison, you’ll have a clearer picture of where you should put your money. Let’s start by taking a closer look at BTFD Coin . In the cryptocurrency world, it’s not just about joining the hype—it’s about understanding what sets a project apart from the others. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme; it’s a full-fledged movement aimed at engaging communities and rewarding holders. But that’s just the beginning. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Revolution with Utility and Engagement BTFD Coin has emerged as one of the most exciting meme coin projects in recent months. But what makes it so special? For starters, BTFD Coin isn’t just about laughs and viral memes—it’s a project with real utility that aims to carve out its own space in the market. When you look at meme coins, many of them seem to have a short lifespan, fuelled mainly by social media trends. However, BTFD Coin has a well-rounded approach that goes beyond a joke. One of BTFD Coin’s most talked-about features is its Play2Earn game. Imagine this: playing a game that’s fun, engaging, and lets you earn rewards in the process. This isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a strategic move designed to draw in users who enjoy gaming and crypto. The Play2Earn ecosystem gives players a reason to stay active, interact with the community, and keep coming back for more. The game’s mechanics are designed with accessibility in mind, so even those who aren’t seasoned gamers can jump in and play. Plus, it’s an excellent way for new investors to get familiar with the $BTFD token while having a good time. If you’re not into gaming, don’t worry—BTFD Coin’s got your back. With staking rewards, the project offers users a way to put their tokens to work and earn passive income. Staking involves locking up your $BTFD tokens to support the network and, in return, receiving rewards. This feature provides more utility for the token and attracts long-term holders who want to benefit from their investment while contributing to the project’s growth. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on viral hype, BTFD Coin focuses on building lasting value. The coin’s utility goes beyond speculation; it includes staking, gaming, and community engagement. This is where BTFD sets itself apart from the pack. By creating real-world use cases, BTFD Coin attracts not just speculative investors but also people who genuinely want to be part of the community. And when you look at other meme coin success stories, that kind of genuine engagement is what helps them last. Take Shiba Inu for example. Initially, it started as a meme but has grown into a project with an ecosystem that includes DeFi, NFTs, and even a dedicated DAO. BTFD Coin has similar aspirations, aiming to be more than just a meme. It’s already seeing early adoption and is positioning itself as a leading player in the meme space. Analysts’ Take on BTFD Coin: Many analysts are bullish on $BTFD, seeing potential for substantial price growth. Some price predictions even point to a possible doubling or tripling of the token’s value in the next few months. With the right marketing push and community support, BTFD Coin could very well be the next big thing in meme coins. Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin That Started It All When it comes to meme coins, it’s impossible not to mention Pepe Coin. Inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, this coin has become a cultural phenomenon. But what’s behind its popularity? Pepe Coin rides the wave of nostalgia while blending a fun, community-driven model. It’s a coin that appeals to a younger, internet-savvy audience that appreciates the humour and culture surrounding Pepe memes. Pepe Coin is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s an online community. Members are dedicated to memes, online challenges, and engaging in playful banter. This sense of belonging is what keeps the coin alive and thriving. The community actively promotes the coin through social media, which helps maintain its momentum. As with many meme coins, Pepe Coin can be highly volatile. Its price can spike rapidly due to a viral meme or celebrity mention, which can lead to significant short-term gains. However, it’s also susceptible to sudden dips. Investors looking at Pepe Coin need to be ready for this roller-coaster ride. If you’re all in for the hype and quick profits, Pepe Coin could be a top contender on your list of best meme coin presales to join now. Analysts’ Take on Pepe Coin: Although some analysts see it as a fun investment with high risk, others view it as a “once-in-a-lifetime” kind of opportunity. The key is to invest wisely and not chase the hype blindly. Brett: The Underdog with Potential While BTFD Coin and Pepe Coin have already made a splash, Brett is the underdog that’s worth watching. This meme coin might not have the same level of recognition as the others, but it’s growing fast and has some distinct advantages that set it apart. What makes Brett stand out is its innovative approach. While many meme coins mimic popular trends, Brett’s focus is on building a meme coin that embodies a unique story. It leverages humour and relatability in a way that resonates with people. Think of Brett as the underdog that keeps surprising everyone, from traders to analysts. Unlike quick-buck investments, Brett is positioning itself as a long-term project. It aims to build a community that’s invested not just in price pumps but in creating value over time. Brett’s developers are emphasising transparency and building trust within the community. This kind of strategy attracts investors who are tired of the hype-driven cycles and are looking for something more sustainable. Analysts’ Take on Brett: Many analysts are cautiously optimistic about Brett’s potential. It’s seen as a coin that could go under the radar now but might just explode when the timing is right. The Final Word The best meme coin presales to join now, like BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin, and Brett, offer different experiences and opportunities for investors. BTFD Coin stands out with its solid utility, staking rewards, and a growing gaming ecosystem. Pepe Coin taps into cultural nostalgia and meme power, making it an appealing yet volatile choice. Brett, on the other hand, could be the underdog that surprises everyone in the coming months. If you’re ready to take your crypto investments to the next level, consider joining BTFD Coin’s presale today. It’s not just about the hype; it’s about being part of a movement with real potential. Join the next meme coin bull run and see why BTFD Coin is the project everyone will be talking about. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of the next big thing in meme coins!

They’re bold, fun, and unafraid to rewrite the rules. Across Europe, from the trendsetting cafes of Milan to the high-tech hubs of Stockholm, these cheeky coins are making waves. Whether you’re a crypto newbie or a seasoned pro, the hunt for the best meme coin presales to invest in for the short term is always on, and today, we’ve got three names that deserve your attention: BTFD Coin, Shiba Inu, and Dogwifhat. Let’s talk about the current darling of meme coin presales: BTFD Coin. In just under 10 days since its presale launched, BTFD Coin smashed through the $1 million mark, raising over $1.5 million so far. More than 30 billion coins have been snapped up by over 3,200 enthusiastic holders, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. The buzz isn’t just about the numbers; it’s the community spirit and FOMO-inducing energy surrounding this coin that’s turning heads across Europe. If you’re looking for a presale that feels like joining a movement rather than just an investment, this might be the one. BTFD Coin: The New Meme Coin Packed with Features You Can’t Ignore At the heart of BTFD Coin is its ethos of seizing opportunities in market downturns—Buy The Dip, as the name boldly proclaims. But it’s not just a catchphrase; it’s backed by solid features. From a currently-live staking platform offering an APY of 90% to a play-to-earn (P2E) game that rewards players with tokens, BTFD Coin has something for everyone. Its presale price is still a steal, and analysts predict its value could skyrocket post-launch. Europe loves a good underdog story, and BTFD Coin might just be the meme coin to champion in 2024. Shiba Inu: The OG Meme Coin Continues to Thrive If you’ve been in crypto for even a hot second, you’ve heard of Shiba Inu. While it’s no longer the new kid on the block, this meme coin still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve. Its ecosystem has expanded beyond its playful exterior, introducing ShibaSwap, NFTs, and a layer-2 solution, Shibarium. For investors across Europe, the appeal of Shiba Inu lies in its staying power and potential for short-term gains. Recent market movements hint at another surge, and while it might not be as groundbreaking as it was in its early days, it still offers a relatively low barrier to entry for those who want a taste of the meme coin magic. Dogwifhat: The Whimsical Newcomer Europeans have a soft spot for the quirky and offbeat, and Dogwifhat ticks all the boxes. As the name suggests, this coin embraces its absurdity with a mascot—a dog proudly wearing a tiny hat. But don’t let its whimsical branding fool you. Dogwifhat has positioned itself as more than just a joke, with a focus on community-building and innovative tokenomics. Dogwifhat is still in its early stages, making it a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. For those looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio, it could be an exciting addition. Its community has been growing steadily, particularly in cities like Amsterdam and Prague, where creative and tech-forward thinkers are always on the lookout for the next big thing. Why Europe Loves Meme Coins (And Why You Need to Start Investing Now!) From the Scandinavian appreciation for transparency to the Mediterranean flair for risk-taking, meme coins seem to resonate with European values. Their sense of humour, coupled with genuine innovation, makes them perfect for a continent that thrives on blending tradition with modernity.

He rejects using committees or middlemen to verify transactions that would go against what Ethereum was built for. Buterin made the statement in response to Nick White, a Celestia blockchain partner, regarding blockchain verification. In a recent discussion, he clarified that if Ethereum started using committees and centralized intermediaries, he would no longer consider it Ethereum. He responded to the post by saying “I don’t think this is a fringe take at all.” Rejecting committees in Blockchain verification Buterin stressed that blockchain must remain decentralized and avoid relying on committees or middlemen for transaction verification. He precisely stated, “If Ethereum gave up on verifiability and accepted committees and centralized intermediaries, it would no longer be Ethereum.” According to Buterin, decentralization is essential to blockchain’s success, and it sets Ethereum apart. Nick White argued that the primary goal of blockchain is verifiability, irrespective of the method. He suggested decentralized committees could work, but Buterin disagreed with the statement, saying even decentralized committees would undermine true decentralization and lead to centralization. Buterin added that blockchain networks should be open for anyone to participate by running nodes and securing the system. This approach ensures power remains distributed and not concentrated among a few. Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, is valued for its strong decentralization, openness, and security, allowing anyone to participate in its growth. Buterin’s argument about decentralization shows why Ethereum is so valued in the blockchain space. He further argued that decentralization is key to Ethereum’s success, opposing Nick White’s idea of using committees for verification. According to Buterin, committees, even decentralized ones could weaken blockchain’s core principles of accountability and independence.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TIA,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/vitalik-ethereum-prioritize-verifiability/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37393946.jpeg
37393564,https://nulltx.com/?p=135357,1733688451,"Regret Missing Litecoin? Here’s Your Shot at the Best Crypto to Buy Now, with Over 52,000% ROI Potential!","Investing in cryptocurrency often feels like chasing lightning in a bottle. For those who missed Litecoin’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) back in 2011, the regret might sting a bit. But here’s the good news: another golden opportunity is knocking on the door— Qubetics ($TICS). With an innovative approach, a thriving presale, and unparalleled growth potential, it’s making waves as the best crypto to buy now. The Rise of Litecoin: A Missed Fortune Back in 2011, Litecoin (LTC) emerged as Bitcoin’s silver to its gold. Charlie Lee created this peer-to-peer cryptocurrency to offer faster transactions and a more accessible mining experience. During its early days, Litecoin was trading for mere cents. Imagine scooping up LTC for $0.03 per token—a small gamble for what is now a top-20 cryptocurrency with a current price hovering around $127 (as of 2024). Investors who believed in Litecoin’s potential in the early days now enjoy returns that seem almost mythical. A $100 investment back then would be worth well over $233,000 today. Stories like this are why cryptocurrency remains one of the most exciting—and sometimes painful—markets for investors. Enter Qubetics: The Opportunity of a Lifetime For those who missed Litecoin and are looking for the next big thing, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy now. With its unique approach and staggering growth projections, this rising star is turning heads in the crypto community. Currently, in Presale Phase 11, Qubetics’ $TICS tokens are priced at $0.028, with over $5 million already raised and 288 million tokens sold to more than 7,500 holders. Here’s where it gets exciting: the presale operates in weekly phases, with each phase delivering a 10% price hike. The price will jump by 20% by the final stage, creating an electrifying opportunity for early adopters. Right now, $TICS offers a potential 783.45% ROI, but that’s just the start. Analysts predict that post-presale, the token could climb to $0.25—and if it hits $10 or $15 in the long term, investors are looking at astronomical ROIs of 35,244.90% and 52,917.35%, respectively. If you’re asking yourself, “Where can I find the best crypto to buy now?” The answer is Qubetics. Why Qubetics Stands Out? The Qubetics Network isn’t just another crypto project. It’s reshaping the blockchain market by offering groundbreaking solutions for financial institutions. By partnering with the Qubetics Network, banks and enterprises can tap into the $TICS token to facilitate near-instant cross-border payments. Forget the headaches of traditional payment systems—Qubetics is all about speed, efficiency, and transparency. Funds move securely across borders without the usual delays, making it a game-changer for businesses that need quick settlements to maintain cash flow and operational efficiency. Individuals benefit too, with faster remittances and hassle-free international transactions. In today’s global economy, this kind of innovation is priceless. No wonder Qubetics is already being recognised as the best crypto to buy now. The Qubetics Presale: A Moment You Can’t Afford to Miss The buzz around Qubetics’ presale is real, and for good reason. This isn’t just a chance to invest—it’s a chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big thing in crypto. With the next phase imminent, the window for securing $TICS tokens at the current price is closing fast. The excitement isn’t just hype; it’s grounded in solid metrics. With $5 million raised and a growing base of enthusiastic holders, Qubetics is proving it has what it takes to disrupt the market. If you missed out on Litecoin, don’t let this chance slip through your fingers. The Bottom Line Investing always involves a bit of risk, but the greatest regret often comes from not taking a chance. Litecoin showed the world how life-changing an early investment can be. Now, Qubetics is stepping up as the best crypto to buy now, offering unparalleled potential for those ready to believe in its vision. With the presale’s 10% weekly price hikes, innovative technology for cross-border payments, and analysts predicting massive long-term growth, Qubetics has all the hallmarks of a future crypto titan. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone just stepping into the crypto world, this is your moment. So, what’s it gonna be? Another “what if” story—or a smart move into the future? Don’t wait for hindsight to remind you of the opportunity staring you in the face. Act now, and let Qubetics prove why it’s the best crypto to buy now.

In its new Holiday Shopping Survey, WalletHub surveyed 210 individuals and then normalized the results by age, gender and income to accurately reflect U.S. demographics. The results paint a relatively bleak picture of the American consumer. According to the survey, 68% of people say “Santa will be less generous this year due to inflation,” and 31% say they’ll spend less on holiday shopping this year than in 2023. Nearly half still have debt from last year’s holiday season, and 52% of people will apply for a new credit card in order to do their holiday shopping. Sixteen percent say they won’t pay off their holiday shopping debt until spring 2025. Seventy-two percent say their charitable giving is also being affected by inflation. Despite the apparent financial stress of the holiday season, 72% answered “Yes” when asked if holiday shopping was worth it. According to data from the St. Louis Fed, US consumer sentiment – measured by the University of Michigan – rose slightly to 70.5. Generally, a reading below 70 is considered “negative.” Consumer sentiment has been in a downtrend since February 2020. Source: St. Louis Fed According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu at the University of Michigan, there is currently a political divide in the US in regard to inflation expectations and consumer sentiment. “Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation. Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation. As such, national measures of sentiment and expectations continue to reflect the collective economic experiences and observations of the American population as a whole.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Hydra—Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution—has notably outperformed Visa by successfully performing 2 billion transactions in just four hours. This marks a huge achievement for Cardano, not only showcasing ADA’s innovative prowess but also strengthening its position in the DeFi space. Meanwhile, rising altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is creating a loud buzz among crypto insiders with its zero-gas technology and other Web3 innovations. JetBolt’s presale has soared to over 100 million tokens sold already. With Hydra’s remarkable success, could Cardano continue its upward trajectory towards setting new all-time highs in 2025? Or could JetBolt’s rising momentum be the catalyst for other next-gen altcoins to keep surging in the exciting days ahead? Let’s explore further. Cardano Price Prediction: Is ADA ready to set new all-time highs in 2025? In November, ADA surged to its highest level since April 2024 when murmurs circulated that Cardano’s co-founder, Charles Hoskins, would be helping reshape cryptocurrency policies in the U.S. under the Trump administration. 7-day Price chart of Cardano as per data from Coingecko website Adding to this momentum, Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra, recently processed 2 billion transactions in just four hours, surpassing Visa’s daily volume. This historic achievement underscores Cardano’s technical prowess and solidifies its position as a strong contender in the DeFi space. Currently trading at $1.19, Cardano has skyrocketed by an impressive 231.9% over the last 30 days, making ADA one of the heavy gainers among the top 10 biggest coins. However, analysts suggest that whales seem to have calmed down for now after accumulating ADA in November. The outlook for ADA remains optimistic, as reflected by its EMA lines, with short-term averages still above long-term ones. Analysts predict that if buying pressure holds, ADA could break through the $1.32 resistance level, with a potential further push to $1.40—a price ADA has not seen since 2022, and one that could trigger ADA’s climb to new highs in 2025 JetBolt: Surging in the Web3 space with zero-gas technology While Cardano strengthens its position, a young altcoin continues to gain traction in the Web3 space preparing the way for 2025: JetBolt (JBOLT).

With blockchain innovation at the core of its rising momentum, JetBolt is rapidly becoming a revolutionary altcoin that could continue surging in the crypto space. Final Thoughts: Will Cardano reach new all-time highs in 2025 as next-gen altcoins surge? The crypto market is open and ripe with exciting opportunities for all.

It introduced ERC-20 tokens, widely used for governance, utility, and value storage, while transactions require ETH for gas fees. The transition to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 marked a significant evolution, aiming to enhance decentralization and efficiency. Upcoming sharding seeks to boost scalability and reduce costs. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon further improve transaction efficiency. Price predictions estimate Ethereum reaching up to $6,580.53 next year. With its technological advancements, Ethereum remains central in the blockchain space, showing significant potential in the current market cycle.

President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypt stance has triggered a bullish market cycle since his victory. Additionally, more and more institutional players have embraced digital asset ownership, as seen by the surging figures in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This wave of adoption has seen a handful of U.S. states pushing for state-owned Bitcoin reserves. This drive comes following speculations that Trump might establish a national Bitcoin reserve. Florida Leads the Charge with Pro-Crypto Momentum Some states, including Florida, could establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the first quarter of 2025. In a post on X, Samuel Armes, President of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), highlighted possible avenues to embrace Bitcoin. These include budget surplus and state pension investment. He noted that with a $116.5 billion budget surplus for the financial year 2024-25, Florida could invest responsibly in Bitcoin without cutting essential services. “Investing just ONE percent of our surplus would be $1.165 billion,” Armes stated. He assured that FBBA would push for the actualization of this move along with three pro-Bitcoin bills for legislative action. Interestingly, Danny Perez, Speaker of the Florida House, and Ben Albritton, the President of the Senate, are both pro-crypto. Additionally, Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, is also pro-Bitcoin. Some States Explore Bitcoin ETFs Meanwhile, Pennsylvania is also looking to develop its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which was introduced last month. Co-sponsor of the bill, State Representative Mike Cabell, believes it is a way to diversify investments and hedge against inflation. As per the proposal, Pennsylvania could invest as much as 10% of its General Fund into Bitcoin. Other states like Wisconsin and Michigan have chosen an indirect route to Bitcoin exposure. The two states are exploring ETFs and trusts . The State of Wisconsin Investment Board has ploughed over $220 million of capital into Grayscale and BlackRock Bitcoin ETF shares. National Bitcoin Reserve Sparks Debate As per Michigan’s recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it holds $11 million in Ark 21Shars Bitcoin ETF. Its Ethereum holdings signal a more bullish stance. Michigan has over $33 million (920,000 shares) worth of assets across two Grayscale Ethereum trusts. It remains to be seen how President-elect Donald Trump will implement the national Bitcoin reserve proposal. However, Lawrence Summers, Former U.S. Treasury Secretary, has critiqued the move , calling it politically motivated and impractical. Summers maintains a national Bitcoin reserve, which would not benefit the U.S. The post U.S. States to Lead in Bitcoin Reserves Amid Federal Speculations appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Coin Rise,https://thecoinrise.com/u-s-states-to-lead-in-bitcoin-reserve-amid-federal-speculations/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png
37392790,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312060,1733687108,Former New York Fed President Says Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Would Drive Up Inflation and Government Debt,"A former Fed president is warning that the proposed Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategic reserve concept won’t yield any positive benefits for the American people. Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and ex-vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), says in a new opinion piece on Bloomberg that the incoming Trump administration’s proposal for a BTC-backed reserve has zero positives. Dudley says the main effect of a Bitcoin reserve would be higher inflation and more national debt. “But what benefit does establishing a Bitcoin reserve have for the government or those who do not hold Bitcoin? None. There is no exit strategy, so its purpose is to drive up inflation rather than create value for the government – the government would be forced to hold a volatile token that generates no revenue. To provide the funds for purchases, the Treasury must either borrow (thus increasing debt service costs) or the Federal Reserve must create money (thus exacerbating inflation). The latter is almost indistinguishable from the Federal Reserve monetizing US government debt (similarly, directing the Federal Reserve to utilize the government’s gold reserves based on congressional legislative proposals would also be the case).” The former Fed boss says that if the Trump administration really wants to support Bitcoin and the crypto industry, it should establish laws and regulations that “allow it to develop and operate safely.” Specifically, Dudley says that the government should work to define whether tokens are currency or securities, and establish rules to “protect consumers and prohibit their use for activities such as financing terrorism or selling illegal drugs.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The financial companies collectively expect the US stock market to reach fresh all-time highs next year amid expectations that a Trump presidency will create a favorable macroeconomic environment for equities, reports Yahoo! Finance. Wells Fargo is the most bullish among the group, believing that the S&P 500 could skyrocket to as high as 7,007 by the end of next year. Says Wells Fargo equity strategist Christopher Harvey in an investor note, “On balance, we expect the Trump Administration to usher in a macro environment that is increasingly favorable for stocks at a time when the Fed will be slowly reducing rates. In short, a backdrop where equities continue to rally.” Harvey also notes that the stock market will be boosted by rising corporate profits as well as the US economy growing faster than expected and a supportive regulatory environment. “2025 is likely to be a solid-to-strong year.” Meanwhile, market research firm Yardeni Research and Deutsche Bank see the SPX climbing to a high of 7,000 next year.

Table of Contents Goodbye, Gensler. Hello, Atkins A closer look Will Atkins hit the reset button? Crypto bulls react Goodbye, Gensler. Hello, Atkins President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Atkins to lead the SEC. The announcement sparked optimism across financial circles—particularly within the crypto community. A renowned regulator with extensive experience, Atkins has been selected to bring a fresh perspective to the SEC at a time when innovation and regulation are locked in a critical tug-of-war. The announcement alone pushed Bitcoin ( BTC ) past the $100,000 mark for the first time, with prices climbing to $103,550 as of Dec. 5. For the crypto industry, his appointment feels like a long-awaited shift. Under outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler , the agency’s relationship with digital asset firms has been fraught with tension, characterized by lawsuits and aggressive enforcement. Atkins, however, is viewed as a potential catalyst for change—someone who might clarify regulatory frameworks while promoting growth in the sector. But who is Atkins, really? What does his track record reveal about his stance on crypto and financial regulation? And why are both traditional and digital markets reacting so strongly to his appointment? Let’s dive into the background of the man who could redefine the SEC. A closer look Atkins may not be a household name, but in the world of finance and regulation, his reputation speaks volumes. Born in Lillington, North Carolina, and raised in Tampa, Florida, Atkins built a strong academic foundation early on. He graduated with honors from Wofford College in 1980, earning a Bachelor of Arts and induction into Phi Beta Kappa. In 1983, he obtained his law degree from Vanderbilt University, where he served as Senior Student Writing Editor for the prestigious Vanderbilt Law Review. Atkins launched his professional career at Davis Polk & Wardwell, one of the most esteemed law firms in the world. He specialized in corporate transactions, M&A, and securities offerings, honing his expertise in high-stakes financial matters. His career soon took on an international dimension with over two years in the firm’s Paris office, where he also earned credentials as a French legal advisor. Atkins first joined the SEC in the early 1990s, working under former chairman Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt. During this period, he concentrated on enhancing corporate governance and improving communication between shareholders and companies. In 2002, when Atkins returned to the SEC as a commissioner, he found himself in the hot seat during a period of corporate scandals involving giants like Enron and WorldCom. Amid the chaos, he advocated for stricter fraud enforcement, while cautioning against overly punitive measures that could stifle legitimate business practices. After leaving the SEC in 2008, Atkins founded Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm advising financial institutions, including fintech innovators and crypto startups. Through Patomak, he solidified his reputation as a leader in financial policy, particularly as blockchain and digital assets became trendy topics. His contributions even extended to testifying before Congress on the need for streamlined regulations that support crypto innovation while safeguarding markets from malfeasance. He has also served as a co-chair of the Token Alliance since 2017, an industry-led initiative by the Chamber of Digital Commerce focused on promoting the responsible growth of tokenized networks and applications. Will Atkins hit the reset button? Over the past few years, regulatory uncertainty has been the industry’s biggest roadblock. Under Gensler, the SEC took a hardline approach, treating most cryptos as securities and bringing lawsuits against major players like Coinbase and Ripple ( XRP ). Against this backdrop, Atkins brings a collaborative and clear approach to crypto policy, drawing on years of experience as co-chair of the Token Alliance and as an advisor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce. These roles have given him firsthand insight into the challenges facing both crypto startups and established firms. One of his key contributions has been advocating for clearer definitions of what constitutes a security versus a commodity—something the crypto world has long been asking for. But what does this really mean for the industry? For starters, unlike Gensler, who leaned heavily on enforcement actions—filing several dozen lawsuits against crypto firms during his term—Atkins’ approach could be far different. His tenure at the SEC from 2002 to 2008 is a good indicator. During that time, he pushed for policies that lowered barriers for small and medium-sized enterprises to access capital markets. If he applies the same principles to crypto, the U.S. could become a global hub for blockchain innovation, instead of losing talent and investments to countries like Dubai, Singapore, and Switzerland. Another key area where Atkins could make a difference is decentralization. Gensler’s SEC often treated decentralized finance projects with suspicion, framing them as unregulated securities platforms. Atkins, on the other hand, has spoken in favor of technologies like blockchain that democratize access to financial systems. This doesn’t mean he’s likely to give DeFi a free pass, but his history suggests he’ll look for ways to support innovation while addressing fraud and market manipulation. However, there’s also reason to approach this shift with caution. During his previous SEC tenure, he opposed hefty penalties on corporations involved in fraud, arguing that such fines ultimately hurt shareholders. While this approach appeals to businesses, consumer advocates worry it might not do enough to protect retail investors. As the SEC enters this new era, the U.S. has an opportunity to reclaim its position as a leader in blockchain technology and digital finance. Crypto bulls react Atkins’ nomination as the next SEC chair has sparked a series of reactions from key figures across the crypto and financial sectors. While the crypto community seems largely optimistic, the deep-woven sentiments reveal deeper frustrations with the outgoing administration’s approach and hope for a more balanced future. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, set the tone, calling Atkins’ appointment “sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.” For firms like Coinbase, entangled in lawsuits and fines, Atkins’ arrival offers a much-needed breather. Congratulations to Mr. Atkins. We appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating US securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at @SECGov . It's sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon. https://t.co/QRBC2MSPGe — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 4, 2024 Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse doubled down on this optimism, describing Atkins as an “outstanding choice” while addressing the stakes involved. An outstanding choice – Paul Atkins at the helm of the SEC will bring common sense back to the agency. Along with Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto, restoring freedom of choice, economic growth, and innovation. https://t.co/w8Rqrnubyj — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 4, 2024 “It’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto,” he stated, hinting at the billions lost in legal fees and the delays in critical projects under Gensler’s leadership. Hester Peirce, often dubbed “Crypto Mom” for her pro-crypto stance at the SEC, also shared her excitement. “Having worked for him during his last stint at the agency, I cannot think of a better person for the job.” We have a lot of work to do at the SEC to advance free markets, capital formation, investor choice, and innovation. I'm delighted that Paul Atkins will be returning to lead the effort. Having worked for him during his last stint at the agency, I cannot think of a better person… — Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) December 4, 2024 Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest and a vocal advocate for crypto, likened Atkins’ nomination to a broader defense of digital property rights. “Incoming SEC Chairman Paul Atkins will free digital assets from Gary Gensler’s chokehold and protect private property rights in the digital world,” she tweeted. Great day for #bitcoin and digital property rights! Incoming SEC Chairman Paul Atkins will free digital assets from Gary Gensler’s chokehold and protect private property rights in the digital world. — Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) December 5, 2024 Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, also chimed in with a common critique of the SEC under Gensler: “The SEC is in dire need of a reset. Instead of protecting investors and fostering innovation, it ‘protected’ investors from the likes of bitcoin ETFs and stifled innovation.” Paul Atkins is a great choice as next Chair of the SEC. The SEC is in dire need of a reset. Instead of protecting investors and fostering innovation, it ""protected"" investors from the likes of bitcoin ETFs and stifled innovation. Atkins will usher in common sense and a do no harm… — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) December 4, 2024 Summing it all up, the crypto industry isn’t looking for a free pass—it’s looking for fairness, clarity, and a recognition of its potential to drive economic growth. Under Atkins, many hope for an SEC that encourages innovation while protecting investors in a balanced, constructive way.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tesla-trumtesla-will-explode-over-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This acknowledgment highlights Bitcoin's status as a key financial asset, similar to gold, and reflects its rising importance in the digital economy. The Treasury’s recent report explores the rapid growth of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. While these markets are expanding quickly, they still remain small compared to traditional financial instruments like US government bonds. The report underscores Bitcoin's primary use as a store of value and its appeal as a hedge against financial risks. Bitcoin’s market value has seen remarkable growth. It rose from $6.4 billion in 2015 to $134 billion by 2019, reaching a staggering $1.3 trillion by 2024. This growth reflects increasing interest in decentralized finance and digital assets. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has also compared Bitcoin to gold , adding further weight to its reputation as a financial safe haven. However, most people still use cryptocurrencies as speculative investments, hoping for future profits, rather than as replacements for traditional assets. Stablecoins are also gaining significant attention. Over 80% of cryptocurrency transactions involve stablecoins, which play a critical role in digital markets. These coins, often pegged to fiat currencies, use US Treasury bills and other government-backed securities as collateral. Stablecoin providers like Tether currently hold approximately $120 billion in US Treasuries . As the stablecoin market grows, the demand for Treasury bills is expected to rise. Stablecoins are becoming a bridge between blockchain-based systems and traditional finance. The Treasury also noted that stablecoins’ reliance on US Treasuries could increase structural demand for government bonds. Stablecoins serve as a hedge against price fluctuations and a safe-haven asset within blockchain ecosystems. This highlights how digital currencies are shaping demand for traditional financial products. Despite this progress, cryptocurrencies have not yet overtaken traditional financial systems. US government bonds still dominate global markets, reflecting their stability and reliability. However, the Treasury’s acknowledgment of Bitcoin and stablecoins shows an increasing intersection between traditional and digital finance. While cautious, the report signals an openness to exploring digital assets’ potential. This recognition of Bitcoin as ""digital gold"" and stablecoins’ role in driving demand for US Treasuries marks an important moment for the financial world. The Treasury’s stance suggests that digital assets are no longer seen as fringe innovations but as integral parts of the evolving financial ecosystem. As digital markets grow, their relationship with traditional finance is expected to deepen, reshaping global financial systems.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/us-treasury-calls-bitcoin-digital-gold-highlights-stablecoin-growth,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37391896.jpeg

Whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or a total newbie looking for the next big thing, the market’s buzzing with opportunities that could be life-changing. But here’s the million-dollar question: Which crypto projects deserve your attention this weekend? Let’s cut through the noise. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to join this weekend, three names stand out: Qubetics, Chainlink, and Kaspa. Each project brings its own flavour to the crypto space, offering unique features and long-term potential that go beyond the usual pump-and-dump drama. While Chainlink and Kaspa have earned their spots as household names in the crypto community, the real buzz right now is around Qubetics, a groundbreaking Web3 aggregator redefining how we think about decentralised finance and asset tokenisation. Let’s dig into what makes these cryptos worth your time, starting with the one stealing the spotlight: Qubetics. Qubetics: Revolutionising Web3 with Real World Asset Tokenisation Imagine a world where physical assets—think real estate, art, or even your prized collector’s car—can be digitised, bought, sold, or traded on a blockchain. That’s the magic of Real World Asset Tokenisation, and Qubetics is leading the charge. Whether you’re an entrepreneur trying to fund your next big venture or just someone who wants to fractionalise a physical asset, Qubetics makes it possible. Here’s an example: imagine owning a $1 million property. Not everyone can buy it outright, but through tokenisation, you could break that property into, say, 10,000 tokens worth $100 each. Suddenly, the property isn’t just real estate—it’s a liquid, tradable digital asset. From big-shot corporations looking to streamline logistics to everyday folks managing their portfolios, Qubetics bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds. But Qubetics isn’t a one-trick pony. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, bringing tools like QubeQode IDE for developers, a decentralised VPN for secure browsing, and a multi-chain wallet that simplifies cross-blockchain transactions. With a thriving ecosystem, it’s no surprise Qubetics has already sold over 288 million tokens during its ongoing presale. Currently in its 11th stage, the presale has raised more than $5 million and boasts over 7,500 token holders. Here’s the deal: you can snag $TICS tokens at $0.0282 before the price jumps another 10% this weekend. Projections from analysts suggest Qubetics could see exponential growth, with some predicting $TICS prices will skyrocket once the token hits major exchanges. And hey, if you’re curious to dive deeper into how Qubetics is changing the game with asset tokenisation, you can check out this video . Or, for a broader look at its ecosystem, watch this . Spoiler alert: the future is looking bright. Chainlink: The Oracle Powering Smart Contracts Now let’s talk about Chainlink, a name so synonymous with decentralised oracles that even crypto sceptics nod in recognition. Since its launch in 2017, Chainlink has become the backbone of smart contracts, acting as a bridge between blockchain systems and real-world data. Think of it as the translator that makes your blockchain application smarter, more functional, and, well, a lot more trustworthy. Why does that matter? Well, imagine you’re running a decentralised insurance platform. You’d need real-world data, like weather conditions or flight statuses, to execute claims automatically. That’s where Chainlink’s oracles shine—they pull verified data from the real world and plug it directly into smart contracts. Over the years, Chainlink has built partnerships with major blockchain platforms and real-world companies. The project’s LINK token has remained a staple in the portfolios of crypto veterans, cementing its status as a go-to for those looking to diversify their investments. Currently, Chainlink trades in the single or double digits (depending on when you’re reading this), making it a compelling buy for those betting on the future of decentralised applications (dApps). Chainlink is less about hype and more about utility, which explains why it’s still one of the best cryptos to join this weekend. Kaspa: Speed Meets Scalability While Qubetics is breaking new ground and Chainlink is building smarter contracts, Kaspa is quietly revolutionising blockchain infrastructure. Known for its innovative blockDAG architecture, Kaspa offers the scalability and speed many blockchain projects only dream of. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa doesn’t rely on a single-chain structure. Instead, its blockDAG technology allows blocks to be mined simultaneously, significantly reducing transaction times. If Bitcoin is a slow-moving freight train, Kaspa is a bullet train zipping through the digital landscape. Kaspa’s $KAS token has earned a loyal following among crypto miners and tech enthusiasts. The network’s energy-efficient approach and ability to handle high transaction volumes make it an ideal choice for those who believe scalability will define the next era of blockchain adoption. Despite being a more niche project, Kaspa’s community is passionate, and its technological innovation keeps it on the radar of savvy investors. If you’re after a crypto that prioritises speed and efficiency, Kaspa is one of the best cryptos to join this weekend without a doubt. Why This Weekend Matters The crypto market moves fast—blink, and you might miss the next big opportunity. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics ’ game-changing tokenisation model, Chainlink’s unmatched oracle services, or Kaspa’s lightning-fast blockchain, now’s the time to act. Each of these projects offers something unique, catering to different investment strategies and risk appetites. So, what are you waiting for? This weekend is your chance to stake your claim in the ever-evolving world of crypto. Head over to the Qubetics presale, load up on $LINK, or dive into $KAS. Whatever you choose, just don’t miss out. The clock is ticking, and these projects won’t wait for anyone.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. CYBRO raises $7M in its presale, drawing crypto world buzz with predictions it could surpass ADA and XRP by 2025. Table of Contents CYBRO races toward exchange listing after 450% token surge and $7M presale Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform XRP: A Decentralized Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions Conclusion CYBRO has made waves by raising $7 million in its presale, attracting attention across the crypto world. This achievement has led to forecasts that it could overtake major coins like ADA and XRP by 2025. The rise of CYBRO is sparking curiosity, and many are keen to see what this new contender brings to the table. You might also like: Why market leaders are flocking to CYBRO over XRP and ADA CYBRO races toward exchange listing after 450% token surge and $7M presale CYBRO , a unique AI-powered multichain DeFi platform, has fast-tracked its plans to list on major exchanges following an explosive presale. Surpassing $7 million in raised capital and drawing in nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is rapidly emerging as a leader in the decentralized finance space. Throughout its presale, CYBRO’s token price saw an impressive 450% surge—jumping from $0.01 to $0.055. With an anticipated listing price of $0.06, analysts are bullish on CYBRO’s future, predicting strong gains as investor interest continues to intensify. CYBRO is on a mission to democratize DeFi access, featuring unique tools for staking, yield farming, and lending. Its presale also marked several key milestones, including: CYBRO App Launch: Introducing more than 30 DeFi vaults with competitive APYs, designed to accommodate different investor preferences and strategies. Blast Index Debut: A simple, one-click investment feature that integrates seamlessly with lending protocols, making DeFi accessible to everyone. Platform Expansion: Laying a solid foundation for a streamlined, user-friendly ecosystem in the DeFi space. Looking ahead, CYBRO’s roadmap through 2025 includes ambitious plans such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered portfolio management. The upcoming listing arrives during a surge of interest in AI-driven financial solutions. With its robust fundamentals and impressive growth trajectory, CYBRO is set to catch the eye of both retail and institutional investors alike. Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a versatile and sustainable blockchain platform designed to support smart contracts. It facilitates the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, crypto tokens, and gaming projects. The native cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum’s ETH, enabling users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the Cardano network. Cardano’s environmentally conscious approach sets it apart, utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism to achieve energy efficiency, unlike energy-intensive proof-of-work systems. The blockchain architecture is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer, which handles transactions, and the Cardano Computing Layer, which manages smart contract computations. This separation enhances its scalability, allowing for efficient transaction processing with the potential to reach up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano’s native tokens enable secure and low-cost interactions with smart contracts, setting a new standard for blockchain efficiency and scalability. XRP: A Decentralized Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions X R P is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger, designed as a digital, programmable currency that is open, borderless, and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. Transactions on the network are irreversible and secure, functioning without the need for a central authority or bank account. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, with an initial supply of 100 billion coins. Ripple, originally known as OpenCoin Inc., received 80 billion XRP to support network liquidity and enhance the ecosystem. To manage the supply release, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow. The name “XRP” originates from “ripple credits,” highlighting its aim to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies. Conclusion In light of these developments, CYBRO emerges as a promising project poised to outperform established coins like ADA and XRP, which show less potential in the short term. CYBRO’s advanced DeFi platform leverages AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, offering investors exceptional opportunities to enhance their earnings. Features such as generous staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases contribute to a superior user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. With a strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has captured significant interest from major investors and influencers, positioning itself as a standout contender in the evolving crypto market.

37391604,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373193,1733685097,"BNB Chain Hit by Record Sandwich Attacks in November, Impacting Thousands of Traders","A record 35.5% of BNB Chain’s blocks were affected by Sandwich attacks in November. Over the past week alone, 645 Sandwich Bots were found to be active on the chain. In total, roughly 43,400 DEX traders were impacted during the entire ordeal. Sandwich Bots Exploit BNB Chain According to data compiled by Dune Analytics, the trading volume on BNB Chain’s DEX reached $9.232 million that week, with Sandwich Bot transactions contributing $1.322 million. A sandwich attack, which is also referred to as front-running, is an MEV technique where an attacker identifies a pending transaction and strategically places orders before and after it, effectively surrounding the target transaction. While front-running is one of the most common MEV methods, other strategies like back-running and transaction ordering manipulation also take place. These types of attacks are especially prevalent on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where the mempool’s transparency exposes transactions before they are confirmed. In contrast, Ethereum has seen a reduction in Sandwich attacks since July, with the percentage dropping from 62.9% to 40.2% over the past five months. During the past month, over 12,000 DEX users on the network fell victim to these attacks. Sandwich Attacks on Solana Solana too has seen a significant increase in these attacks this year. As a result, the Solana Foundation took decisive action against validators involved in sandwich attacks in June 2024. The foundation removed a group of validator operators from its delegation program for their involvement in these attacks, adding that any validators engaged in such behavior would be permanently excluded and have their stake removed. Tim Garcia, Solana Validator Relations Lead, reaffirmed that enforcement would continue as the foundation detects operators participating in such malicious activities. Mert Mumtaz, co-founder of Solana RPC provider Helius, explained that while Solana’s design prevents these attacks, some actors modified their validators to enable them. Mumtaz also suggested that other stake pools might adopt similar policies against sandwich attacks in the future.

37391273,https://finbold.com/?p=217972,1733684484,This is how Solana (SOL) performed in 2024 so far,"Solana ( SOL ) was one of 2024’s top-performing cryptocurrencies, surging from $100 at the start of the year to $235 by early December—a staggering 135% gain. In the last month alone, SOL added 19% to its value, driven by bullish sentiment across the market. Analysts are now setting their sights on a $420 target, underpinned by growing network activity, institutional adoption, and Bitcoin’s rally beyond $100,000. However, regulatory challenges remain a hurdle, with ETF rejections casting a shadow over what has otherwise been a stellar year. Solana one-month price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Regulatory hurdles for Solana ETFs Despite its strong price performance, Solana has faced significant regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) recently rejected applications for spot Solana ETFs filed by major players like VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital. Notably, crypto asset manager Grayscale also recently applied to convert its Solana Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund. With President-elect Donald Trump appointing Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto policy expert, as the incoming SEC Chair, optimism is growing. Analysts expect the leadership transition in January 2025 to pave the way for broader ETF approvals, potentially benefiting Solana and other cryptocurrencies. Nice scoop. Solana ETFs getting told to take a hike by the Genz-led SEC (which @JSeyff predicted in a recent note). Look for them to just refile after the new Atkins regime takes over. https://t.co/0AEOHg3ZWH — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 6, 2024 Institutional confidence soars despite challenges Institutional interest in Solana remains strong, with Q3 2024 marking $173 million in investments across 29 decentralized applications (DApps)—a 54% quarter-over-quarter increase, according to Messari . This surge underscores institutional confidence, further bolstered by prominent players like Franklin Templeton, which is launching an SEC-compliant money market fund on Solana. Additionally, Société Générale’s SG-Forge has announced plans to deploy a MiCA-compliant stablecoin on the network. The growing confidence is also visible in Solana’s on-chain activity. Average daily fee payers increased by 109% quarter-over-quarter to 1.9 million, while new fee payers surged by 430%, reaching 1.3 million. Memecoin mania drives ecosystem growth A resurgence in meme coins has also significantly boosted Solana’s ecosystem. Tokens like Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) recently captured market attention, driving daily transaction fees to $4 million and pushing active addresses above 8 million. This activity has also contributed to Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) reaching a two-year high of 41 million SOL, a 13% month-over-month increase. In contrast, Ethereum ( ETH ) and BNB Chain ( BNB ) saw relatively flat TVLs during the same period. Decentralized platforms like Raydium and Sanctum have also reported notable deposit increases, further showcasing the network’s growing appeal. The path forward for Solana With regulatory clarity anticipated to improve in 2025, Solana is poised to capitalize on its expanding ecosystem and robust on-chain activity. Analysts have grown increasingly optimistic about Solana’s prospects. Notably, analyst Gordon highlighted Solana’s strong bullish trajectory, underpinned by its consistent respect for an upward-sloping trendline that has provided critical support throughout 2024. Solana price analysis chart. Source: Gordon/X Recently, SOL decisively broke above a key resistance between $220 and $230 and retested it as a strong support zone, further solidifying its bullish momentum. This breakout was accompanied by a significant surge in trading volume throughout November, indicating robust buying interest. The rally aligns with broader market optimism fueled by Bitcoin’s climb past $100,000 and growing institutional confidence in Solana’s expanding ecosystem. Analysts project Solana’s next price target at $420, a level that seems attainable given its robust technical setup and favorable macroeconomic backdrop. However, any breach below the critical upward-sloping trendline could undermine the bullish momentum, prompting a potential retest of lower support levels and raising caution among traders. If Solana maintains its momentum and benefits from improving regulatory clarity, it is well-positioned to achieve the $420 target, likely within the first quarter of 2025.

37391224,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659166,1733684415,"Technical Analysis Puts XRP Price Above $5 In Next 3 Days, Whales Buy $288 Worth Of XRP","The XRP price is consolidating after a crazy 460% surge within four weeks that saw it breaking above $2.8 on December 3 for the first time since 2018. This consolidation saw the XRP price dropping to $2.22 on December 5 as many investors took some profits after the rally. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself Interestingly, on-chain data shows that XRP whales have taken advantage of this dip to stock up their holdings to essentially prevent further price declines. With this in mind, technical analysis of the coin’s price chart shows that the cryptocurrency is well on track to breaking above the $5 price level in the next three days. Technical Analysis Suggests Breakout To $5.26 By December 11 Amidst the backdrop of whale activity and price consolidation, technical analysis is now pointing to the possibility of the XRP price surpassing the $5 mark within the next three days. This rally hinges on XRP breaking through key retracement levels like it did in November. Interestingly, a crypto analyst (CryptoInsightUK) outlined a compelling case for the altcoin’s next price target, citing a historical pattern in the asset’s movement. His analysis, shared on the social media platform X, highlights how XRP’s range-based corrections often find resistance at the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. Once these levels are breached, the price tends to rally swiftly toward the 4.236 Fibonacci extension. During XRP’s last breakout, it took just over three days to reach the 4.236 Fibonacci extension after breaking through retracement resistance. During that time, the price surged from below $1.46 to reach $2.9 on crypto exchanges within three days and 17 hours. Based on the current price chart, XRP is once again trading between the 0.5 to 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the recent high of $2.9. If a similar trajectory were to play out, this should push the XRP price on another rally to reach $5.26 by December 11. Such a move would see the XRP price rapidly breaking above its current all-time high of $3.40 that has stood for almost seven days. Interestingly, analyst CryptoinsightUK suggests that the predicted move could unfold even faster this time due to increased market velocity. Whale Accumulation Supports Bullish Price Outlook The behavior of XRP whales is a key factor bolstering the bullish sentiment. Fortunately, on-chain data shows significant whale accumulation during the recent price dip, with some investors purchasing the crypto in bulk. As noted by Santiment data, XRP addresses holding 1 million to 10 million tokens have purchased over 120 million XRP worth $288 million since December 5. This accumulation serves a dual purpose. Not only does it prevent further price declines, but it also provides the liquidity necessary for the next upward movement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Days At The Top Numbered?

With this rally, the Dogecoin price broke above $0.4, and the XRP price rallied above $2.3. The bullish movement of these coins prompted many to lean towards investing in these projects. However, analysts stated that an RWA project with a massive high-growth potential will outperform them by 2025. Let’s analyze Dogecoin and the XRP price action and compare them to their ROI potential for the fast-rising real estate project. Dogecoin and the XRP Price Vs. the Rising PCHAIN XRP remains one of the top altcoins that has remained relevant in the crypto-world, over the years. The token has provided a cross-border payment solution, and its ability to process thousands of payments in seconds has helped it stand out among other coins. Despite the issues with the SEC over the years, this token remains a top cryptocurrency, and in the wake of the Donald Trump administration, it is gaining value. The XRP price is over $2.3, just 30% below its all-time high. Similarly, the Dogecoin price rally just over $0.41 as the year ends; many believe it will break the $0.5 resistance level in 2025. More increases are expected in the value of the global crypto market come 2025, and PropiChain has been gaining traction in recent times. Although it’s still at the presale level, whales and experts believe that with its intrinsic value, buying it cheaper will bring more than Dogecoin and the XRP price can. PropiChain aims to bring revolutionary change to the 300 trillion dollar industry with incredible technological and web3 features. It is also listed on the CoinMarketCap platform, increasing investors’ confidence in this project. Therefore, unlike DOGE and the XRP price action, the PropiChain value is backed by real-world assets. Why Billionaire Investors Believe So Much In PropiChain? PropiChain is a decentralized marketplace that has improved how the traditional real estate industry operates with its unique additions. This has attracted real estate investors and crypto whales, as many now expect this project to deliver massive ROI in the coming year. The following are the reasons behind the recent rise in popularity. Accessibility to the $300 Trillion Global Real Estate Market The traditional real estate industry is known for being reserved for high-worth investors over the years. This is because huge finances and top skills are needed to invest in the industry. However, with the fractional asset ownership and botherless marketplace introduced by PropiChain, investors no longer need to worry about financial and geographical constraints. PCHAIN users can now invest a few dollars on a percentage of property on the PropiChain marketplace. They can also access diverse property globally on this decentralized platform. For instance, investors in the USA can take advantage of the booming real estate market in Asia or any other continent. Investment Aided by Technology and Web3 Tools PropiChain marketplace integrated artificial intelligence, Metaverse, and Blockchain to bring convenience and safety to the real estate industry. Before PCHAIN’s emergence, assets’ filtering, valuation, analysis, etc., were handled by humans. This sometimes gives room for human errors and a few other issues. However, efficiency is guaranteed with AI at the helm of affairs in the marketplace. This is because it goes beyond common criteria in sorting properties for buyers, and once they’ve been selected, it handles the complex calculations to arrive at precise asset value. Blockchain technology makes all asset details available as transactions are stored on “Title Contract.” This increases the transparency and security in the sector. The BlockAudit review on PropiChain further shows that the platform is secure and that investors’ assets will be well-protected. Further, the 3D videos on Metaverse simplify the inspection process before concluding real estate deals. PCHAIN’s AI can also provide insightful predictive trends to aid successful investment decisions. All these are available without extra cost to realtors or the stress of traveling across geo-locations as we have in the conventional real estate industry. Join PCHAIN Now for Over 30000% ROI in 2025 There is no better time to join the PropiChain presale than now, when it’s still cheap and worth just $0.004. It is cheaper now, and that’s why many smart traders are getting as much volume as possible. This will guarantee a better return than DOGE and the XRP price action and help you break into the $300 trillion real estate industry. Analysts forecasted that early investors could gain over 30000% ROI from this project by 2025. This means an investment of $1000 will yield more than $300,000. Dogecoin and the XRP price can deliver decent gains, but PropiChain is the project that can deliver a life-changing profit.

You might also like: As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu move closer to $1, XYZVerse gears up for a $10 surge Ethereum Ethereum , created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, is a leading blockchain platform known for smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum recently switched to a Proof-of-Stake system, making it more energy-efficient. It supports ERC-20 tokens used in many applications for governance and utility, but you still need ETH to pay for transaction fees. What’s exciting is Ethereum’s upcoming upgrade called sharding. This aims to make the network faster and reduce costs. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon are already enhancing transaction efficiency. As the crypto market gears up for the next Bitcoin halving, Ethereum’s price predictions are optimistic. Some estimates suggest ETH could reach up to $6,580.53 next year and potentially more by 2030. With its strong technology and ongoing improvements, Ethereum looks attractive in the current market cycle compared to other coins. Its central role in facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers makes it a key player in the crypto space. Pepe Meet PEPE , the latest sensation in cryptocurrency. Launched on Ethereum, this deflationary memecoin is a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Embracing the fun of memes without utility claims or taxes, PEPE keeps it simple. In April and May 2023, it skyrocketed, with its market cap reaching $1.6 billion. Early investors became millionaires overnight, and a strong community formed around it. PEPE’s rise sparked a “memecoin season,” causing other meme coins to experience wild surges and drops. PEPE aims to join the ranks of meme giants like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Its roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover.” In today’s market, PEPE’s appeal lies in its simplicity and the power of its community. With the upcoming Bitcoin halving fueling hopes for a bull run, some see PEPE as an exciting opportunity. However, memecoins are known for their volatility. Whether PEPE will reach new highs remains to be seen. Its explosive growth highlights the influence of internet culture on crypto, but caution is advised as trends can shift rapidly. XRP XRP is a cryptocurrency known for its speed and low transaction costs. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it’s designed to be fast, open, and borderless. Transactions on its decentralized network are irreversible and secure, without a central authority or bank account. This makes XRP resistant to censorship and accessible to anyone worldwide. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion tokens, with a large portion gifted to Ripple. Ripple uses XRP to boost network liquidity and supports the ecosystem by controlling XRP release through escrow. In today’s market, XRP’s potential lies in facilitating seamless payments across currencies. It’s designed to make cross-border transactions faster and more efficient than traditional systems or other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can be slower and costly. With finance moving towards instant solutions, XRP’s technology makes it an attractive option. Investors should consider market trends and regulatory developments that could impact its adoption and value. As demand for quick and affordable transactions grows, XRP could play a significant role in the future of digital payments. Cardano Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible, sustainable, and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. This means it’s perfect for developing decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake ADA on the network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient, unlike the energy-hungry proof-of-work model. Cardano’s innovative design splits the blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This boosts its processing capability, potentially handling up to a million transactions per second. In March 2021, Cardano introduced native tokens, offering secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. This sets a new standard for efficiency and scalability in the blockchain world. With the current market focusing more on sustainability and scalability, ADA looks attractive. While Ethereum has been dominant, Cardano’s green and efficient technology is catching attention. As the crypto market evolves, ADA’s potential makes it a coin worth watching. Conclusion ETH, PEPE, XRP, and ADA may fulfill crypto dreams this bull run, but XYZVerse, uniting sports and memes with ambitious growth plans, could be an even better opportunity.

The rally coincided with the ongoing accumulation by whales. In an X post, Lookonchain identified one whale who moved LINK coins worth over $9.6 million from Binance and moved them to AAVE (AAVE). The investor then borrowed 4 million and deposited to Binance, possibly to buy more LINK.

In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, reaching a market capitalization of $1.6 billion and attracting a dedicated community. The project’s roadmap includes listing on major exchanges and initiating a “meme takeover.” PEPE’s rapid rise has sparked interest in its potential within the current market cycle, highlighting the growing influence of meme-based cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While WIF and PEPE show less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility features, it unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers in the fight against crypto villains.

As Bitcoin recently surpassed the $100,000 mark, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele shared the country’s Bitcoin portfolio on social media. His post revealed that El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have resulted in over $333 million in unrealized gains. Despite initial skepticism, this move underscored the country’s success in its bold financial strategy. The El Salvador Bitcoin Journey Many were skeptical when El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to recognize BTC as a legal currency in September 2021. The move was seen as risky. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) quickly raised concerns about the potential impacts on the country’s financial stability. However, Bukele remained undeterred, positioning Bitcoin as a digital asset and a core part of El Salvador’s economic future. Since Bitcoin became legal tender on September 7, 2021, the Salvadoran government has steadily invested in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s surge to $100,000 marks a key milestone, especially for El Salvador, which has invested heavily in the asset. The crypto community celebrated as Autism Capital on X urged Bukele to reveal El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings to silence critics. Nayib Bukele, ever the advocate for his country’s Bitcoin investment, shared the details, showcasing a portfolio worth more than $333 million in unrealized gains. A Deep Dive into El Salvador’s Bitcoin Portfolio According to Nayib Tracker, a platform dedicated to monitoring the country’s BTC investments, El Salvador currently holds 6,180 BTC. Altogether, El Salvador has spent around $270 million on these acquisitions, with an average purchase price of $44,739.88 per Bitcoin. The country’s Bitcoin holdings have seen a staggering 122% return on investment, given the recent market price of $100,000 per BTC. Interestingly, El Salvador has held onto all of its Bitcoin without selling a single coin. This long-term strategy, combined with the soaring value of Bitcoin. This strategy has allowed the country to accumulate significant unrealized profits. In a country that has long struggled with economic challenges, Bitcoin has become a symbol of hope for financial autonomy and growth. Bitcoin’s Ripple Effect: Boosting Tourism and Global Attention The impact of Bitcoin adoption extends beyond financial markets. Since the country’s shift toward Bitcoin acquisition, El Salvador has experienced a rise in tourism. The country has attracted digital nomads and Bitcoin enthusiasts from around the world. However, despite the success stories and rising profits, the IMF has remained critical of El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. In January 2022, the IMF urged the country to stop recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, citing risks to financial stability. The IMF recently renewed its pressure on El Salvador to scale back Bitcoin policies .

Compared to the overall performance of the crypto market, Pepe Coin ( PEPE ) outshone a majority of the altcoins as well as the top meme coins. The third-largest meme coin has seen its price spike to a new all-time high of $0.00002678. The price of Pepe was also up by over 20% in the last seven days and over 130% in the last 30 days.

You might also like: Baby Doge Coin surges over 75% following Elon Musk’s cryptic tweet PEPE hits $10 billion market cap Pepe has also breached the $11 billion market cap. One of the possible reasons for this surge is Ethereum’s ( ETH ) recent price performance. ETH had reclaimed the $4,000 level on Dec 6, a level that was seen in March. This breach of the crucial $4,000 milestone has aided the Ethereum ecosystem tokens, including Pepe. Moreover, the open interest of PEPE has a new high of $356.79 million as per Coinglass data . This metric has seen a 30% hike in the last 24 hours. Source: IntoTheBlock As per IntoTheBlock data , 98% of Pepe holders are now making money at the current price, with 0% of the holders in losses.

He Gave His Answer,"In a recent interview with Kirsten Welker on NBC, President-elect Donald Trump confirmed that he has no plans to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when he takes office in January. Asked if he would ask Powell to resign, Trump replied: “No, I don’t think so. I think if I told him, he would resign. But if I asked him to resign, he might not.” The comments mark a shift from speculation during Trump’s campaign about possible clashes with the Fed over monetary policy. Powell’s tenure has been marked by debates over inflation and interest rate adjustments, which Trump has previously criticized. Trump reiterated his campaign promise to impose tariffs on imports from the U.S.'s largest trading partners, a cornerstone of his economic policy aimed at protecting American manufacturing, but acknowledged uncertainties about the potential consequences for consumers. Asked if he could guarantee that American families would not face higher prices because of the tariffs, Trump said: “I can't guarantee anything. I can't guarantee tomorrow.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will Donald Trump Fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell?

Tron (TRX) has matched the incredible price pump of ADA, pumping by more than 100% to set a new all-time high (ATH). While TRX holders are celebrating their first ATH in more than seven years, a new competitor, Lunex Network (LNEX) , is set for a bigger price pump. While LNEX has pumped 200% , analysts believe a bigger surge of up to 18x in this bull run. Tron (TRX) Pumps To New All-Time High Amid increased bullish sentiment among altcoins, Tron coin has stood out with a massive 100% price pump, per CoinMarketCap . As TRX rallied to over $0.4407, the altcoin also saw a massive increase in its trading volume of over $14.7 billion. While this is the first time the Tron crypto has set a new ATH in more than 7 years, there is a dispute as to where the altcoin price could go. According to MMCrypto , TRX could suffer a massive decline as it has dropped under the key support level around $0.3750. However, Team LAMBO has said that $TRX could be in the early stages of forming a massive bull flag. According to the data, the bottom of the trendline for the Tron token to defend is at $0.35 – 0.36. A breakout above $0.42 could lead to a rally to $0.60. Price Pump Could Take Cardano (ADA) As High As $3 Before the massive TRX price pump, Cardano (ADA) led the top altcoins in gains. From a monthly low of $0.325, the Cardano price skyrocketed to trade above $1.3 for the first time since early 2021. While ADA has dropped to the $1.20 price range, per CoinMarketCap , analysts believe the altcoin could extend its gains soon. According to Jupiter, the Cardano coin will go “ABSOLUTELY BERSERK this cycle” and could pump to $3 because of its expansive ecosystem built to service retail and institutional clients. The recent milestone reached by the Cardano network is one of the reasons crypto experts are very bullish about ADA. According to Dan Gambardello, the TPS of Cardano’s Hydra just crossed 1 million and “is just getting started.” In addition, the unique active addresses on the network have crossed 100,000 unique wallets, according to Benjamin Cowen . High Investor Interest To Fuel 18x Lunex Network (LNEX) Price Pump Interest in Lunex Network (LNEX) , the native coin of the new trading platform, has been steadily building over the last few weeks. The DeFi project has pulled in over $4.5 million from investors as a result. There is huge interest in the LNEX coin because stakers can get up to 18% APY. What Lunex Network aims to do is create a trading and swapping platform for cryptocurrencies at a low cost across multiple blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. This rapid and cheap way of swapping between multiple chains is why there has been a huge interest in Lunex Network. The Lunex ecosystem also features a B2B merchant payment gateway that lets companies accept cryptocurrency and easily convert it into fiat in real time. The Lunex Network also has a service called Lunex Pro. This is the paid version of this platform, offering advanced trading tools and analytics tools that help beginner as well as seasoned traders make better decisions. The LNEX coin has also kept up with the likes of $TRX and $ADA, rallying by more than 200% to reach its current price of $0.0038. In Summary While Tron (TRX) has rivaled Cardano’s (ADA) recent price pump, holding the $0.35-$0.36 support level will be crucial to extending its gains over the next few weeks. Meanwhile, as the Lunex ecosystem expands, experts are positive that the LNEX coin can record an 18x price pump.

Uniswap ( UNI ), the biggest player in the decentralized exchange industry, jumped to $18.38, up by over 400% from its lowest level in 2023. Crypto analysts are optimistic that the coin will continue rising, and even reach its all-time high of near $45. Such a move would imply a 135% from the current level. In an X post, Sus Ape , a crypto analyst, identified a few catalysts that may help the coin jump to a record high. First, he sees Unichain as a gamechanger in the network’s evolution. Unichain, which is set to launch soon, will be its layer-2 network and will have features like multi-chain token spending, instant transactions, and significantly lower fees. Cryptocurrencies often rally ahead of a major event or launch. Ape also sees the upcoming Uniswap Router V4 launch, which will happen before the year ends. The fourth version will enable hooks, dynamic fees, and have a singleton design. Uniswap price will also benefit from the recent election of Donald Trump, and his decision to appoint Paul Atkins to be the next head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins may decide to drop charges the agency brought under Gary Gensler, in which it was accused of selling unregistered securities. https://twitter.com/Sus_Ape/status/1864993225674457368 Meanwhile, third-party data shows that Uniswap’s volume of transactions has risen in the past few weeks. Its weekly transactions rose by 27% to over $31 billion, more than double what Raydium ( RAY ) handled. It has cumulatively handled volume worth $1.56 trillion.

Uniswap also formed a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day moving averages flipped each other. Also, the Percentage Price Oscillator and the relative strength index have pointed upwards — a sign that it has the momentum. Therefore, the next potential Uniswap price target is $30. This target is established by measuring the depth of the cup, and then extrapolating the same distance from the upper side of the cup.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

However, these sentiments have shifted as Ethereum continues to record impressive gains, surging by 50% in the past month. This gain has attracted optimistic price predictions for Ethereum, with the likes of Deltec Bank, a Bahamian financial institution, providing several projections for ETH’s future value, the most recent being $10,000 by the end of 2025. The firm has also provided conservative targets for 2025 and 2030, which are $9,000 and $20,750, respectively. Binance coin, on the other hand, has surpassed Solana in securing the 5 th spot by market capitalization after a historic surge that saw the BNB token record a weekly rally of over 22%. Similarly, Lunex Network also hit a new milestone in presale revenue, surpassing over $4.5M, contributing to LNEX price movement to $0.0038 as it eyes the $0.5 target. Lunex Network Hits Over $4.5 Revenue Milestone Lunex Network ICO has seen an incredible journey so far. The project managed to raise over $4.5M, with the new target being $5M by the end of the year. Moreover, the LNEX price has also surged by 200% to hit the $0.00038 target. This impressive gain in Lunex Network presale has been attributed to the project’s unique DeFi features, which make it easy for traders to swap 50,000 crypto assets across 40+ blockchains. This cross-chain swap feature also means that traders can execute swaps at the lowest costs possible, backed by top speed, without switching from one platform to another. In addition, Lunex Network offers a robust staking model, allowing users to earn up to 18% APY. This provides an attractive option for investors looking for passive income. Lunex also provides traders with the right tools needed to make informed decisions. With its data-driven decision-making features, users can access up-to-date market insights that could help traders remain ahead of the game, especially in the Q4 bull run. Lunex Network is, therefore, a stand-out project that could record more gains in the coming days. Ethereum Price Predictions: ETH Short-Term and Long-Term Price Targets While Ethereum has not witnessed a massive rally this altcoin season compared to ADA and BNB, the bulls have managed to defend the strong ETH support levels. According to crypto analyst IncomeSharks, Ethereum’s daily support remains intact, reinforcing confidence in the holding positions entered earlier. The analyst also emphasized the importance of on-chain utility plays while setting a downside threshold at $3,200. A drop below this region could trigger an Ethereum sell-off. However, with the bullish momentum, Ethereum’s price performance is set to target $4,000 in the short term. On the Multi-year chart, the Ethereum price has formed a giant cup-and-handle pattern since November 2021. To achieve a long-term price target as predicted by Deltec Bank, Ethereum’s price must first confirm a breakout above $3,800, setting the stage for explosive growth. The Ethereum price has been hovering around $3,700, with a market cap of over 445B. Inflows into the Ethereum ETF have also remained strong, showcasing a surge to $132M led by Fidelity’s ETH and BlackRock’s ETHA. Technical indicators also support a bullish outlook, with the RSI at 67 pointing to a building uptrend momentum. BNB Outshines Solana in Market Listing: Will BNB Hit $1,000 Before The End of Q4? Several altcoins have taken charge within the crypto market, including Binance coin, which has seen impressive price performance over the past months. BNB price movement has recorded a YTD of over 234%, surpassing Solana in market cap to secure the fifth position. Additionally, Binance coin trading volume has surged by over 147% to hit the $6.3B mark. This impressive BNB’s price momentum has triggered a notable liquidation across the market. According to CoinGlass data , $5.4M of short positions in BNB have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. BNB open interest also surged by over 39% to $1.5B, indicating heightened market participation and a growing speculative interest in the token. Its technical indicators have also signaled continued bullish momentum despite a slight pullback. Binance coin’s RSI is at 77, suggesting a continued uptrend momentum. This bullish outlook confirms Ali’s previous BNB price prediction, suggesting that a close above $662 could open the path for a potential move to $1,630. Binance coin price has been hovering around the $770 region while eying the $1,000 price target before the end of the year. Can LNEX Price Performance Exceed ETH and BNB Price Movements? Ethereum and Binance coins are well-established cryptos that continue to dominate the market. However, Lunex Network is also a unique DeFi project with the potential to record impressive gains before its official launch. Lunex Network’s presale momentum reflects its impending gains, and investors have grabbed a chance as they anticipate more gains in the future.

37389132,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624592,1733680668,Jeff Bezos suggests how to decrease US national debt to rival Elon Musk,"Jeff Bezos has proposed a solution to the United States’ $33 trillion debt crisis to his longtime rival, Elon Musk: grow the economy so big and fast that the debt shrinks as a percentage of GDP. In his words, “You have to grow the denominator.” The Amazon founder laid out his economic vision at a New York Times DealBook event, doubling down on his support for Trump’s deregulation agenda, while also taking subtle jabs at Elon. Bezos described America as bogged down by excessive regulations, from infrastructure projects that never seem to get off the ground to the slow-moving approval processes in almost every sector. “You can’t even build a bridge,” he said , optimistic that Trump, in his second term, could strip away barriers holding the economy back. “I’m actually very optimistic this time around. [Trump] seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help him do that, I’m going to help him.” But this could also be about taking on Elon, who some say could use his ties to Trump to tilt the playing field in his favor. The Bezos playbook: GDP growth over debt cuts Bezos sees the solution to the national debt as a matter of scale. Shrinking the debt outright? Unrealistic. Growing GDP by 3%, 4%, or even 5% a year? That’s how you make debt “a very manageable problem,” according to him. He pointed to America’s unique advantages, including abundant natural resources, energy independence, and what he called “the best risk capital system in the world.” But Bezos didn’t stop at optimism. He hammered on the roadblocks: endless permitting delays and regulations that stifle growth. He’s betting on Trump’s ability to overhaul these systems, describing the former president as “calmer, more confident, and more settled” than in his first term. Elon’s power play? Elon has spent years cultivating an image as a disruptor, and his new relationship with Trump has some worried he could use government power to crush competition. Critics warn Elon could push federal agencies to investigate rivals, change regulations to benefit his companies or lock down government contracts for SpaceX and Tesla. “The federal government has a set of tools in its toolbox,” said one legal expert, speaking anonymously, “and the question is, will those tools be governed by objective standards or by the material impulses of either the president or Elon Musk?” Bezos knows this all too well. The two billionaires have been rivals for years, fighting over NASA contracts, satellite launches, and even the title of the world’s richest person. Elon’s SpaceX has consistently outperformed Bezos’s Blue Origin, winning splashy deals for lunar landings and missions to the International Space Station. Elon has been mocking Bezos for a long time, calling him a “copycat” and dismissing Blue Origin as a distant second in the space race. Now, Elon’s dominance extends beyond rockets. SpaceX’s Starlink has launched thousands of satellites, giving it a commanding lead in the low-earth orbit internet market. Bezos’s competing Project Kuiper is still in development, with Amazon planning to send up 3,200 satellites to challenge Starlink. NASA and AI Jared Isaacman, an Elon ally, has been tapped as Trump’s pick for NASA administrator. Critics say this appointment could further entrench SpaceX’s dominance in space exploration, sidelining competitors like Blue Origin. Bezos, however, shrugged off these concerns. “I take it at face value that he’s not going to use his political power to advantage his own companies or to disadvantage his competitors,” he said, though he added, “I could be wrong about that.” The rivalry isn’t just about space. Elon’s battle with OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman has also escalated, with lawsuits and public spats over the future of artificial intelligence. Elon, who helped launch OpenAI in 2015, accused the company of abandoning its non-profit mission by prioritizing profits. OpenAI responded by releasing emails showing Elon’s initial support for revenue-driven models to fund large-scale AI research. Elon’s influence on AI policy could grow even stronger under Trump. David Sacks, another Elon ally and the White House’s new AI czar, could steer contracts and regulations toward “open source” AI projects like Elon’s xAI. That would spell trouble for competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft, both of which have invested heavily in proprietary AI models. Tesla and the future of EVs Tesla stands to gain the most from Elon’s Washington connections. The company has long dominated the electric vehicle market, but government investigations into Tesla’s autonomous driving technology could disappear under Trump’s administration. Elon’s buddy Vivek Ramaswamy has already criticized a $6.6 billion federal loan commitment to Rivian, a Tesla competitor, suggesting such subsidies could be rolled back. Tesla received similar federal support in 2010—a $465 million loan from the Department of Energy that helped it survive its early struggles. Vivek’s position as co-chair of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) group only amplifies these concerns.

37388915,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312043,1733680538,Treasury Department’s FSOC Says Stablecoins Represent Potential Risk to US Financial Stability,"The U.S Treasury Department’s Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) says the role of stablecoins as a bridge between the digital asset market and the broader financial system warrants continued attention. In its 2024 annual report , the FSOC says that stablecoins – commodity or currency-pegged cryptocurrencies – do not have adequate safeguards against risks and failures. “As the Council has stated over the last several years, stablecoins continue to represent a potential risk to financial stability because they are acutely vulnerable to runs absent appropriate risk management standards.” The FSOC says the lack of precautionary measures becomes more concerning because more than half of the stablecoin sector’s total market value is held by a single firm: USDT issuer Tether. USDT’s total market cap is approximately $138 billion, representing around 70% of the global stablecoin market, according to FSOC. “Given that firm’s market dominance, if it continues to grow, its failure could disrupt the crypto-asset market and create knock-on effects for the traditional financial system.” The council says many stablecoin issuers are also operating outside of the prudential regulatory framework, which increases the risk of fraud. “ Although a few are subject to state-level supervision requiring regular reporting, many provide limited verifiable information about their holdings and reserve management practices.” Amid the continued growth of the crypto market, the FSOC urges legislators to enact laws to mitigate risks related to stablecoins. “The Council recommends that Congress pass legislation creating a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers to address run risk, payment system risks, market integrity, and investor and consumer protections, including for entities that perform services critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement.” Read the full report here .

Today, December 8, 2024, a crypto expert made a post on X (previously Twitter) and made a bold prediction that has captured widespread attention from crypto enthusiasts. Crypto Expert’s XRP Price Prediction In a post on X, followed by a chart, the expert noted, that for others, XRP looks overbought, but for me, it appears undervalued after breaking out of the multi-year symmetrical triangle price action pattern. Additionally, he predicted that XRP’s conservative target is $8.40, while its optimistic target is $48.12. This XRP prediction has captured the attention of over 150,000 crypto users on X. However, the expert has not specified when XRP might reach these levels in the coming days. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Besides this unrealistic prediction, CoinPedia’s technical analysis hints that XRP appears bullish but currently, it is there in a pennant price action pattern on a daily time frame. However, the price has entered a narrow zone and is poised for a breakout. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if XRP breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $2.65 level, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 60%, reaching the $4.20 level in the coming days. Meanwhile, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) further supports this bullish outlook, as it currently stands at 60, below the overbought threshold of 70. This technical indicator suggests that the altcoin has enough room to rise significantly in the coming days to achieve its forecasted level. Rising Open Interest With this bullish price action, traders’ participation has skyrocketed, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Currently, XRP’s open interest has increased by 5.4% in the past 24 hours and continues to rise steadily, indicating the formation of new positions.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As a bull run looms, investors diversify portfolios, eyeing RXS, DOGE, WIF, BONK, and OM for promising returns. Looking at the current crypto market situation, where a bull run is anticipated, almost every investor is considering diversifying their portfolio by substituting old tokens, including Cardano (ADA), with promising tokens. With the next few months looking favorable for various altcoins, it is not an exaggeration to say that these tokens will yield a good return on investment. Some attractive options include Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Mantra (OM). Let’s explore why these tokens are worth your attention. Rexas Finance: The top in asset tokenization Rexas Finance is a game-changing blockchain project with a vision of tokenizing real-world assets, one of the most untapped trillion-dollar industries. With the unique ecosystem of Rexas Finance, RXS integrates traditional investment opportunities with the growing space of decentralized finance (DeFi). Over $21 million has been raised by RXS , with over 298 million tokens sold across all stages of the presale. Based on price ranges, stage 1 tokens were presold for $0.03, while stage 9 presale tokens were currently going for $0.125. This success demonstrates the firm trust of the community and business demand, which is why a solid business model supports RXS. Completing its integration into the model are the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings, which add credibility to RXS. The token’s attractiveness is also expected to increase ahead of the top exchange listing planned for 2025, with an initial price of $0.20. Rexas Estate, Rexas Launchpad, and Rexas GenAI tools allow tokenizing real estate, offering a platform for upcoming blockchain projects and AI-powered NFT creation, respectively. Rexas Treasury also supports users with a multi-chain yield optimizer that allows compounding on crypto assets. Security for RXS is critical, as demonstrated by the CertiK audit. Additionally, RXS currently runs a giveaway program worth $1 million, where 20 individuals will win 50,000 RXS tokens each, providing more incentives for investors. To participate, users can visit the official site, where they will be required to perform simple tasks to increase their chances of winning. Dogecoin: The original meme coin staying strong With a price of $0.3987 and a market capitalization of around $58.6 billion, DOGE is heavily endorsed by high-profile individuals like Elon Musk and its community. Considering recent events, it appears accessible to invest in DOGE as it continues to grow as a payment alternative. In light of the upcoming market explosion, multiple specialists foresee that the DOGE price will hit $1 or higher again. Even if it takes many months, it remains promising for investors. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Dogwifhat: Another meme coin with purpose Another funny meme coin starting to gain momentum is DogWifHat, thanks to its growing ecosystem and dedicated community. WIF is currently priced at $3.20, with its market cap peaking at $3.2 billion. It is an interesting investment as WIF integrates the fun aspects of meme coins with practical utility features. More and more platforms are embedding DeFi applications within their framework, amplifying the token’s application possibilities. Based on the current scenario, WIF is projected to progress in value by 2x-3x within months. Bonk: A low-cost meme coin with big prospects Priced at $0.00004599, Bonk is often referred to as the “Shiba Inu coin of Solana.” With a market cap of $3.46 billion, BONK is an appealing investment for those looking for “low price, high return” ventures. The Bonk project’s active liquidity and marketing approach attracts both retail and institutional investors. Given its strong community and high daily trading volume, BONK holds the potential for short and quick bursts of profitability. With more favorable market conditions, BONK could rise significantly from its current price. Mantra: A DeFi giant Mantra provides staking, lending, and borrowing services. One OM token is worth approximately $3.53, and its market cap is $3.19 billion, making it a viable option for DeFi investors. The platform’s core proposition revolves around governance, trust, and community. Analysts suggest expanding the DeFi space could lead to a significant price increase for OM, potentially two- or three-fold within the next five months. Conclusion: Why do these tokens stand out? Several factors make these tokens worth considering. For meme coin enthusiasts, Dogecoin and Bonk offer exposure. Dogwifhat provides an interesting mix of humor and utility. Mantra is ideal for DeFi enthusiasts, offering unauthenticated transactions in a fast-growing space. However, Rexas Finance stands out the most. With its unique asset tokenization, robust ecosystem, and strong presale performance, RXS offers unparalleled growth potential. Its upcoming exchange listing and community-focused initiatives make it the most promising choice. For those looking to turn $500 into $50,000, these tokens, with RXS leading the pack, are compelling options. To learn more about RXS, visit the official website , Whitepaper , X , and Telegram .

Here's what the new crypto chief has said about BTC in the past. Sacks, who has been a Bitcoin advocate for years, has said that he started buying Bitcoin in 2013, when it was just $130. Today, with Bitcoin’s price up over 76,000% since then, Sacks has clearly benefited from his early foresight. “I’m buying BTC,” Sacks said in 2013. A key theme in Sacks’ tweets is Bitcoin’s importance as a decentralized currency, highlighting its role in protecting against fiat currency devaluation by providing a hedge for those wary of inflationary pressures on traditional monetary systems. Sacks also expressed his admiration for Bitcoin's anonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, saying, “Satoshi Nakamoto deserves to be a billionaire.” Sacks had previously announced that he was working on a fictional feature film about Satoshi Nakamoto, a reference to Bitcoin’s deep connection to history. He described the project as “like watching The Social Network without knowing who the Mark Zuckerberg character might actually be.” Related News: Binance Labs May Have Sold These Two Tokens After Altcoin Market Rise Sacks noted that Bitcoin is a highly portable and impregnable store of value. Sacks sees Bitcoin as a tool that could fundamentally change the relationship between governments and money, and foresees the potential to separate money and the state. Sacks has made significant investments in Bitcoin-focused companies such as Lightning Labs, Fold, Bitwise, and Bitgo through his venture capital firm Craft Ventures. Reflecting on his time at PayPal, Sacks said he never thought he would be involved in payments again after leaving the company. However, Bitcoin changed that perspective. He sees Bitcoin as fulfilling PayPal’s original vision of creating a new world currency. Finally, Sacks said he believes Bitcoin represents the invention of digital scarcity. *This is not investment advice.

37388405,https://finbold.com/?p=217965,1733679603,This is how XRP has performed in 2024 so far,"In 2024, XRP finally broke out of the prolonged price consolidation, emerging as one of the biggest winners of the ongoing cryptocurrency market rally. To put this price breakout into perspective, XRP rallied by over 300% in the past month, elevating the cryptocurrency to third place based on market capitalization, surpassing Solana ( SOL ) and Tether’s USDT. Overall, XRP’s price remained relatively stable throughout most of 2024, fluctuating between $0.50 and $0.60. However, in early November, the token took a new turn, and its value tripled by the end of the month to about $1.50. In recent trading sessions, the asset has surged past the $2 mark to trade at $2.55 as of press time, reflecting a year-to-date spike of 342%. $3 remains a psychological resistance level for the short term. XRP YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Despite this newfound momentum, XRP still trades below its record high of $3.40 when some market players have questioned the authenticity of the current gains. Drivers of XRP performance Like other digital assets, XRP received a boost from the euphoria surrounding Donald Trump’s election and his anticipated implementation of pro-cryptocurrency policies. Indeed, this momentum was led by Bitcoin ( BTC ), which surged past the historical $100,000 mark. However, some XRP-specific elements partly contributed to the coin’s meteoric rise. Specifically, renewed optimism emerged after Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD ) relisted XRP on November 13. The platform had delisted XRP in 2020 following the court battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), where the regulator accused the blockchain firm of selling unregistered securities. At the same time, Ripple’s partial legal victory in August reignited interest in XRP as the chances of the token being reclassified as a security diminished. Further momentum emerged after SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his planned departure in January. Interestingly, for the cryptocurrency community, Gensler’s role at the SEC, particularly in the Ripple case, became the poster child of the regulator’s alleged stifling of the sector. With Gensler’s exit, there is speculation that the XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) might receive approval. This anticipation follows Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the next SEC chair, should lawmakers approve him. Several spot XRP ETFs from entities such as WisdomTree, Bitwise, and 21Shares are already awaiting feedback from the SEC. Adding fuel to the XRP momentum, Ripple may soon launch its stablecoin , RLUSD, which the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) could approve by the end of the year. The dollar-pegged RLUSD, issued via Ripple’s acquired Standard Custody & Trust Company, has reportedly been beta-tested with mints worth tens of millions. “I’m still hopeful that we’ll launch by the end of the year. The stablecoin is launched through a New York state trust and regulated by the NYDFS. We are very much looking forward to having the launch headaches behind us, but we will get there,” Ripple CTO David Schwartz said. What next for XRP Overall, the highlighted catalysts are likely to help XRP sustain its bullish sentiment as it targets the $3 mark. From a technical perspective, prominent cryptocurrency trading analyst Ali Martinez noted on December 8 that the next conservative target for XRP is at least $8. Martinez’s analysis indicated that XRP has broken out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle, signaling further upside potential. This continuation pattern , formed by converging trend lines with lower highs and higher lows, typically marks a period of accumulation before a breakout. The breakout suggests a bullish shift, with the chart indicating two key price targets: a conservative $8.40 and an optimistic $48.12. If XRP reaches the target of nearly $50, its market cap could hit almost $2.8 trillion, potentially making it the top cryptocurrency if Bitcoin sees minimal gains. XRP price analysis chart.

Among them, PEPE, inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, has garnered significant attention with an influx of major whale purchases. On Sunday, Whale Alert reported that two wallets, possibly controlled by the same whale, spent $4.89 million USDC to acquire an astounding 190.14 billion PEPE tokens at an average price of $0.00002572, all within a span of just six hours. Adding fuel to the frenzy, another fresh wallet, “0xa9dc99628,” accumulated an even larger position of 264.8 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $6.4 million, via Coinbase. This wallet is one of several fresh accounts observed accumulating PEPE on centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase. Similarly, wallet “0x0a8746384e” amassed 260.9 billion tokens worth $6.2 million during PEPE’s breakout to its all-time high on Friday. Notably, this accumulation trend extends beyond Coinbase, with activity noted across Binance, Kraken, Upbit, KuCoin, and more, signaling robust interest in the meme token. Meanwhile, the significant accumulation of fresh and existing wallets has sparked bullish sentiment among investors and analysts. Popular crypto analyst Javon Marks highlighted the growing momentum in a Saturday tweet, suggesting PEPE’s price could almost double in the coming days. “PEPE prices are moving and climbing with strength here on growing positive volume. With its recent breakout holding, there could still be much more upside, including a potential +50% to $0.0000375 or even a 150% climb to $0.000063+.” He tweeted. Similarly, analyst Max described PEPE as the “highest probability” meme token to deliver explosive gains this cycle, predicting it could surpass a $50 billion market cap one day, positioning it as a serious contender to challenge DOGE and SHIB in the meme coin hierarchy. That said, PEPE’s rise to prominence comes from an impressive rally. On Friday, the token reached a record price of $0.00002662, boosting its market cap to $11 billion. This surge coinc ided with high-profile listings on platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood, which have historically been cautious about meme tokens. Notably, these listings could grant the token broader accessibility, potentially driving further price growth. While PEPE has faced skepticism due to its meme-based origins and alleged concentration by insiders, the continued accumulation by whales and its growing adoption on major platforms suggests that the token may have staying power.

37387975,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-foundation-loses-x-account-to-hackers-fake-token-promoted/,1733678412,"Cardano Foundation Loses X Account To Hackers, Fake Token Promoted","The Cardano community faced a wave of confusion on Sunday after the X account of the Cardano Foundation was hacked. The attacker used the account to spread misinformation. This includes a fake announcement about a new Cardano-based token and a false claim of a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These false claims caused chaos in the blockchain community, leading to confusion and financial losses. The Fake Token: $ADASOL The hacker’s first move was to post a thread about a token called $ADASOL. According to the post, $ADASOL was a Solana-based token that combined “Cardano’s vision” with “Solana’s speed and innovation.” The thread was surprisingly convincing. It included thirteen posts explaining the supposed token’s purpose and linked to legitimate resources. This includes the Cardano Foundation’s official website and a podcast. These tactics made the scam appear genuine and led to over $500,000 in trading volume on the token, according to DexScreener. However, the deception did not last long. Within an hour, traders began to realize the token was a scam, and the fraudulent post was deleted. Cardano Foundation Hack: A False SEC Bombshell As the dust seemed to settle, the compromised account escalated the drama. A new post falsely claimed that the SEC had filed a lawsuit against the Cardano Foundation. It alleged that the Foundation was forced to stop supporting the ADA token immediately. This announcement was designed to create panic among the community. The post, viewed over 256,000 times, had replies disabled but was widely shared with warnings that the account was compromised. The misleading announcement sparked concern and confusion among community members until Cardano representatives stepped in to address the situation. A Cardano Foundation team lead acknowledged the account breach and confirmed it was being addressed. The Cardano Community X account told followers to ignore posts from the hacked account and reassured them that the issue was being addressed. Cardano took a significant step in fighting crime and illicit activities in the blockchain space in March by partnering with the Dubai Police. This initiative highlights the Foundation’s ongoing commitment to strengthening security within the crypto ecosystem. Heightened Security Breaches in Blockchain: A Growing Concern The crypto and blockchain sectors are increasingly threatened by sophisticated cyberattacks, leading to greater emphasis on security measures. In November 2023, Atomic Wallet suffered a massive breach that led to over $100 million in stolen user funds. Recently, Ethereum-based restaking protocol EigenLayer suffered a $5.5M token heist after an email breach. These breaches underscore the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, particularly for organizations at the heart of decentralized finance.

Solana Crash But This New Altcoin Continues To Rally With XRP,"Investors in Solana and Ripple may be concerned that alt-season has topped out here as these legacy coins lose momentum. However, the brand new GambleFi protocol Rollblock ($RBLK) continues to make new highs as it storms through to stage 9 of its presale. Let's find out why experts stand by that 50x price prediction. Solana ($SOL) Runs Out Of Steam Despite New High Solana is down 1.7% today to reach $231. Things were looking incredibly bullish for Solana as it recently made a new high at $263 before being rejected and consolidating below resistance. Despite this it has still been a stellar month for Solana holders, who will be looking at gains of more than 39% in this time. Solana's daily volume recently reached $13 billion, signaling that traders have returned to the Solana ecosystem in size. Open interest in the Solana chain has risen to more than $4 billion which suggests that bulls are optimistic that Solana will return to its all time high in the weeks ahead. Is Ripple ($XRP) Cooling Off After Monumental Month? Ripple has also given investors cause for concern recently after briefly falling from its recent high of $2.32. Although Ripple is currently finding support at $2.2 it has rebounded to $2.43 which still represents a stunning performance this month of over 341%. Ripple recently overtook Solana in the CoinMarketCap crypto top five as Ripple reached the third position. The Ripple market cap is now an incredible $130 billion, as huge numbers of buyers stepped in in recent weeks to pump Ripple to new yearly highs. It is only natural that Ripple will consolidate here after such a massive run, although there are many bullish catalysts that might launch Ripple above $3 in early 2025. Rollblock ($RBLK) Inspires Confidence In Early Investors As Price Makes Another Run For New Highs Rollblock ( $RBLK ) recently delighted its community by launching its dedicated sports betting feature, allowing sports fans the chance to win massive amounts of $RBLK with the accuracy of their sports predictions. A recent successful trial on the Rollblock Discord server was met with great acclaim, and the full feature now sits alongside the existing 7,000 casino classics on the Rollblock platform to form a truly comprehensive GambleFi offering. Rollblock is powering through its early-stage presale offering and recently reached stage 9 as more than $6.9 million of investment has been made into this upstart gem. Rollblock aims to disrupt the massive $450 billion online gaming industry with its secure inscription of all transactions onto the Ethereum blockchain. Gamers can now verify for themselves that their bets remain exactly as intended. The $RBLK token benefits from regular token buybacks, using platform profits to burn 60% of these purchases and allocate the remaining 40% to stakers in the Rollblock community. Token supply will only trend lower as Rollblock grows to appeal to mainstream gamers in the coming 12 months. Stage 9 tokens are already selling fast at the discount price of $0.041!

37387452,https://crypto.news/?p=14317303,1733678066,Microsoft shareholders to decide on Bitcoin investment this week,"As Bitcoin’s value surged above $100,000, Microsoft shareholders wonder: Should the top cryptocurrency be integrated into their financial strategy? The answer to this major decision could be made on Tuesday, Dec. 10, according to a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . The proposition at hand is dubbed “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin.” It has been brought forward by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank. This group lauds Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a hedge against inflation. Despite this push, Microsoft’s board has advised shareholders to vote against the proposal. The board’s reluctance is mirrored by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who has previously expressed skepticism about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. He called the digital asset trend “100% based on greater fool theory” in 2022. You might also like: Baby Doge Coin surges over 75% following Elon Musk’s cryptic tweet This skepticism is shared by other board members who believe that the tech giant already gives adequate consideration to such investment opportunities. This upcoming vote could influence the entire cryptocurrency investment sector. Approval from Microsoft could ramp up BTC’s legitimacy and its adoption by mainstream financial entities. Conversely, a decision to reject the proposal might indicate Microsoft’s intent to maintain a more conservative asset portfolio. This diverges from companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, which have heavily invested in BTC. What Saylor says… MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, saying he will continue accumulating the asset as part of his company’s strategy. In early December, he addressed Microsoft’s board , promoting Bitcoin as a necessary evolution in digital asset management and urging its inclusion on Microsoft’s balance sheet in the foreseeable future.

This New DeFi Crypto Set To 18x In 2025,"XRP’s price consolidated after attempting to breach the $3 resistance level. Recent bull market trends pushed the price of Ripple toward the $2.9 mark before retreating above the $2.5 level. Since then, it has been hovering between a narrow range of $2.4 and $2.6, sparking discussions of a potential $3 barrier breakthrough. At the same time, just days after securing a 200% return, Lunex Network’s holders anticipate another price increase this week. It’s no wonder its presale campaign has experienced an influx of buying pressure as forward-thinking investors capitalize on this intriguing opportunity before the Lunex price soars further. Lunex Network: The Game Changer That DeFi Needs Lunex Network is a DeFi hybrid project that offers innovative features for a faster yet secure trading experience. To eliminate the common problems in the DeFi sector, Lunex Network focuses on high TPS and better cross-chain interoperability, allowing for easy swaps across more than 50K assets and 40+ blockchains at the lowest possible fees. The project also guarantees its LNEX holders a passive income stream. Through its revenue-sharing model, a percentage of the platform’s profits will be allocated to buying back the LNEX tokens from the open market and redistributing them to token holders. Holders will have a chance to enjoy up to 18% APY. This feature has already led to high demand for the LNEX token, pushing its price to $0.0038, representing a 200% rally. Moreover, the project has also eliminated KYC checks, giving traders who wish to remain anonymous a better chance. Its AI-powered portfolio tracker, showing real-time market insights based on data analytics, also provides new entrants and professional traders with a chance to make calculated decisions. XRP Faces Resistance at $3: Going Headlong Ripple (XRP) has experienced incredible growth in the past few days but now faces resistance at the $3 level as sell-off pressures intensify. While resistance looms at the $3 level, XRP’s pricehas formed solid support at lower levels. Market pundits have remained cautiously optimistic about the price of XRP. The current momentum could set the stage for future rallies, fueling discussions of the possibility of the XRP coin hitting the $5 mark. The on-chain technical indicators suggest a positive outlook for the XRP coin. Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, the XRP token is in wave three of five, a phase historically associated with sharp parabolic runs. This theory highlights that the XRP token could jump to $5.80 in December. While the $5 price target remains speculative, XRP’s positive price outlook and favorable market trends could fuel massive gains. However, inherent market volatility could sway its prices drastically. The $3 resistance level has become crucial for XRP’s next big move. Can LNEX Emulate XRP Price Movements? As the crypto market heads to explosive 2025, most cryptos, including Ripple, are set to continue recording impressive gains. However, for investors seeking safe returns, Lunex Network stands out. The project has already hit over $4.5M in presale revenue, with the new target being $5M. The project aims to achieve an 18x price surge before its official launch.

37387312,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98556,1733677606,XRP ETFs Could Be the Next Big Thing as Asset Managers Bet Big on Ripple’s XRP Future,"The race to launch XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has just gone overdrive. Major asset managers are filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch these crypto-backed financial products, the question on everyone’s mind is: Will XRP be the next big thing? Now ranked third by market capitalization, XRP has never been a stranger to volatility. However, data extracted from the latest filings reveal that large investors are ready to bet on Ripple’s XRP. Asset managers like WisdomTree, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have filed for permission from the SEC to list the XRP ETF. These funds seek to offer retail and institutional investors access to regulated XRP, a step forward for the crypto space. The Power of XRP ETFs Overall, for most institutional investors, an ETF is a safer bet because it brings them closer to cryptocurrencies but in a risk-free environment. WisdomTree has filed an S-1 to launch an XRP ETF that tracks the value of XRP in real time. The fund would be an exchange-traded fund traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with BNY Mellon as the administrator. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1863559841341485547 Likewise, 21Shares has registered for its Core XRP Trust; this is another spot-based ETF aimed at bringing exposure to the cryptocurrency through Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian. These filings come a few months after Bitwise tried to list the first XRP ETF, which underlines the increasing sentiment of optimism about Ripple’s future. Still, the pathway to XRP ETFs has not been smoother, with multiple regulatory challenges at present, such as the legal issues between the SEC and Ripple. Institutional Confidence in XRP Growing Ripple’s chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse expressed his excitement at more institutional players getting involved in the XRP ecosystem. Over $33 billion poured into Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 alone, and Garlinghouse sees room for XRP-based ETFs to open a similar floodgate. These would also improve the cross-settlement and liquidity of XRP and act as a magnet to fresh entrants in the crypto market. Similar to Garlinghouse’s comments, another XRP investor, Bitwise Asset Management’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, noted that the cryptocurrency has yet to reach its full potential because of the existing regulatory hurdles. She believes that XRP’s ledger technology and its large fan base will ultimately drive its future growth and usage once the regulators weigh in. Nevertheless, despite the filings, several hurdles remain to be crossed. The SEC’s ability to appeal the Ripple ruling remains a cause for concern regarding when it will be approved. The crypto community still believes that a change of guard and a new pro-crypto SEC chairperson will result in less pressure and, who knows, maybe the green light for XRP ETFs. This new wave of crypto regulation policy, which the SEC is expected to institute, is believed to be friendly to Ripple and XRP. The current SEC chairman is Gary Gensler, who has been quite strict on cryptocurrencies and XRP in particular. He recently resigned from his position, and Trump’s nominee Paul Atkins will be the next chairman . Some people believe that this kind of change could lead to the passage of clear rules that will allow XRP ETFs. XRP’s Price Potential The filings have also elicited renewed attention to the XRP price . XRP, which had dropped to 20% from its yearly high of $2.9, has demonstrated market activity recovery in recent weeks. Moreover, now on-chain data shows that approximately $315 million in XRP has been transferred from exchanges to other categories, which may be a positive sign for the future. If the market can break the $2.4 resistance level, analysts predict XRP could surge by 20%, reaching the $3 mark. Whale activity and market sentiment suggest that a rally could be imminent. The ETF filings are not just regulatory approvals; the institutional players are indicating they are becoming increasingly bullish about the XRP assets. Based on the demand side, institutional adoption, and a positive outlook for the regulation of XRP ETFs, it is not entirely impossible to consider the fact that XRP ETFs may one day turn the tables in the crypto market. While the SEC continues to examine these filings, the market is waiting for an influx of capital that will push XRP to the next phase of its rally. The question remains: Where is the next big thing?

TradingView shows that this altcoin is valued above its 20-day EMA of $0.23 and its 30-day EMA of $0.21. Furthermore, its MACD level shows a value of 0.03, which is in the buy zone and suggests a good entry point. Lunex Network (LNEX) Value Surges 200%, More Increases Coming Lunex Network (LNEX) is also making some headlines in this sector. This is all thanks to its great crypto ICO performance, which has given early buyers a 200% return. Given that the price of this DeFi coin rises on a three-day basis, this growth is far from over. People are also excited about Lunex Network's long-term vision. This new DeFi project will connect all isolated blockchains and launch a non-custodial exchange. On it, people will trade many crypto coins across different blockchains in total privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. Those who hold the LNEX native token will get the following: ● Governance: The ability to vote on important decisions for the platform.● Staking Rewards: Up to 18% APY in staking rewards.● Discounts: Holders of this DeFi coin will get various discounts on trading fees. Currently, one LNEX costs just $0.0038, a 200% rise from its starting presale price. But traders are waiting for the long-anticipated Tier-1 crypto exchange listing, which may push this value to $0.0216. This increase could bring those who buy LNEX now a 500% return. Ripple (XRP) Price Rises, Technicals Show Further Gains Ripple (XRP) is another altcoin showing some green charts. On the one-month chart, the price of Ripple has grown from $0.51 to $2.56. CoinMarketCap shows a 400% surge during that time for this crypto. Market analyst Crypto Rover says this is the craziest chart he has ever seen in the crypto market. Further gains are expected, with many analysts pointing to a $3 value for Ripple (XRP) coming soon. TradingView data backs up this Ripple price prediction. The Ripple coin is currently valued above its 30-day EMA of $1.46 and its 50-day EMA of $1.19. Additionally, its MACD level shows a 0.44 value in the buy zone and suggests a good entry point for buyers. What Could Come for Tron (TRX), Lunex Network (LNEX) & Ripple (XRP)? Some experts think Tron (TRX), Lunex Network (LNEX), and Ripple (XRP) are all altcoins to watch. They think these tokens could all see big price gains. However, they are focusing on one—Lunex Network. This rookie will have a smaller market cap than its peers, which means it will need less money to see price growth. Thus, experts foresee a potential 3x surge for LNEX in 2025.

37387028,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373699,1733677358,Gemini Joins Coinbase in Rejecting SEC Veterans in the Crypto Industry,"Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of the Gemini crypto exchange, has declared that his company will adopt the same policy as Coinbase, cutting ties with any law firms or entities that hire former U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials associated with alleged overreach against the digital asset industry. His decision comes in the wake of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s recent remarks, where he criticized law firms and industry stakeholders for welcoming ex-SEC employees implicated in anti-crypto policies. Tyler Winklevoss Amplifies Armstrong’s Message In a November 5 post on X, Winklevoss asked for a “running list” of SEC officials involved in what he described as an “unlawful war on crypto,” vowing to do the same at Gemini as Armstrong had done at Coinbase. The Coinbase executive’s strong position led to his company cutting ties with global law firm Milbank after it hired former SEC Director of Enforcement, Gurbir Grewal. The lawyer, who played a central role in more than one hundred enforcement actions, resigned just before the SEC’s appeal in its high-profile case against Ripple. At the time, legal experts questioned why he had picked that particular moment to jump ship, with some speculating it signaled discord within the agency. The broader crypto community also scrutinized the SEC’s tactics, with critics like attorney Jeremy Hogan arguing that its appeal in the Ripple case risked backfiring, potentially weakening its regulatory influence over the industry. Armstrong had accused the financial watchdog’s leadership of attempting to stifle the crypto sector through unclear regulations and enforcement actions. He argued that senior officials who did not resign during this tenure bear responsibility for the SEC’s controversial tactics. Further, he emphasized that while he did not support “canceling people permanently,” he was of the opinion that those who contributed to the regulatory agency’s overreach should not be allowed to benefit financially from the crypto industry. Justin Sun Offered to Hire Gary Gensler Previously, Tron founder Justin Sun proposed a job offering to outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler following Donald Trump’s November poll victory. During his campaigns, Trump made several promises to the crypto community, including getting rid of Gensler on his first day in office. With speculation rife about the future of the highly unpopular regulator, Sun shared his willingness to hire Gensler in an unspecified capacity, provided the former MIT professor treated the crypto industry with sincerity. However, Winklevoss and Armstrong’s actions may be an indicator that not all players in the sector are willing to let things go; instead, they are attempting to create accountability within the legal and regulatory spaces.

Interestingly, recent developments in the XRP market indicate a sustained bullish outlook for the prominent altcoin. Related Reading: Ripple Labs Future Under Trump: CEO Brad Garlinghouse Outlines Vision For 2025 Whales Accumulate $288 Million XRP As Price Slides To $2.22 In an X post on December 7, renowned crypto expert Ali Martinez shared that XRP whales had embarked on an accumulation spree amidst a recent price dip. Notably, XRP has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in Q4 2024 rising by over 350% since the US elections. However, the altcoin recorded a significant 23% decline in the past week, falling from $2.90 to $2.22 between December 3-December 6. During this period, Martinez noted that whales i.e. wallets holding between 1 million – 10 million XRP, acquired over 120 million XRP, valued at $288 million, as they increased their market holdings to $4.7 billion. Generally, such large purchases by market whales are indicative of confidence in an asset’s long-term profitability and are common bullish signals. Rightly so, XRP has experienced an 18% price gain rising to $2.60 in the 48 hours following this bullish whale activity. In regards to how high XRP can go, Ali Martinez has set a projected target of $4.34 which may be a good price zone for traders to take profit. However, any unexpected price decline could force the altcoin to return to around $2.23 which Martinez describes as a “key area of support”.

XRPL Active On-Chain Addresses Surpass 100,000 In other news, the number of on-chain active addresses on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has recently recorded a significant increase. According to CryptoQuant analyst Wenry, exchange transfers dominated the transaction volume on the XRPL up until Q3 2024. However, on-chain XRP transactions have now overtaken exchange inflows as the number of active addresses rose rapidly in recent months reaching a yearly high of 100,000 on December 2. This development can be attributed to several factors including improvement on XRPL’s DeFi infrastructure which has created a better working environment that attracts top decentralized protocols similar to Uniswap, Maker, etc. In addition, there has been significant progress in the development of layer 2 solutions for the XRPL to improve scalability, interoperability, and functionality. Notable projects on this front include The Root Network, XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machin,e and XRPL Hooks. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.57 after a 3.94% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 13.70% and valued at $12.03 billion. The altcoin now ranks as the third largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $147.98 billion.

Polkadot (DOT) is expanding rapidly, fueled by continuous innovation and significant momentum within its ecosystem. On the other side, Ripple (XRP) enthusiasts remain steadfast and optimistic through price fluctuations, eyeing a hopeful recovery. Taking cues, BlockDAG (BDAG) enhances its cutting-edge ecosystem, incorporating WebAssembly (WASM) to transform dApp development through enhanced speed, scalability, and interoperability. Moreover, the network’s $159 million presale indicates a growing demand, with expectations for the BDAG coin to reach $20 by 2027. Polkadot Network Expansion: DOT Aims for $22 Polkadot’s network has seen impressive growth, with DOT recently rising by 14.1% to $9.96. Over the last week, it has increased by 24.30%, surpassing the general market’s 9.70% rise. The token’s growth over 30 days of 154.50% and a three-month rise of 143.75% underscores its strong trajectory. Compared to last year, Polkadot’s expansion is notable at 79.67%. Analysts foresee DOT reaching $22, marking a 222% rise, driven by optimistic market sentiments and cyclical trends. Events like October’s market volatility and March’s Bitcoin halving underscore Polkadot’s robust potential for sustained growth. XRP Enthusiasts Navigate Volatility, Yet Hopeful of Recovery XRP enthusiasts have encountered volatility as South Korean exchanges paused trading briefly, leading to a 7% fall in XRP’s price. This steep drop, prompted by panic selling after President Yoon’s martial law announcement, brought XRP down to $1.89 on major platforms like Upbit and Bithumb. Despite the market’s ups and downs, XRP is showing signs of recovery with a 24-hour trading volume reaching $44.5 billion, driven by active buying. Large holders have been resilient, adding to their positions even as profit-taking peaked, with over $4 billion realized in profits within three days—signaling the token’s continued appeal amid market changes. BlockDAG Enhances dApp Development with WASM Feature BlockDAG’s integration of WebAssembly (WASM) sets it apart in the blockchain arena, enhancing flexibility and efficiency. It supports a variety of programming languages, including Rust, C, and C++, drawing a wider range of skilled developers. This feature speeds up the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and spurs innovation in areas like decentralized finance, gaming, and complex financial applications. With WASM, BlockDAG boosts its scalability and operational efficiency, reaching speeds up to 2000 transactions per second and almost immediate transaction completion. Developers enjoy quicker loading times, lower resource usage, and heightened security, which are crucial for demanding, high-performance dApps. Additionally, WASM fosters easier integration with other blockchain networks, enhancing the entire ecosystem’s growth and connectivity. The impressive results from BlockDAG’s recent presale, amassing over $159 million, underscore its substantial market promise. Currently priced at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, BDAG is anticipated to surge to $20 by 2027 according to analysts, signaling significant returns for early participants in the cryptocurrency presale . As BlockDAG leverages WASM to advance its platform, it establishes itself as a model for future blockchain technology by delivering exceptional speed, security, and accessibility for developers. The Bottom Line WASM compatibility marks a pivotal development for BlockDAG, drawing elite developers with its robust support for various programming languages and superior operational capabilities. This advancement positions BlockDAG for accelerated growth, with significant engagement already evident from its presale earnings exceeding $159 million and 16.9 billion coins sold. Reflecting the growth trends seen in networks like Polkadot and the steadfastness of XRP holders, BlockDAG is distinguished by its potential for a $20 valuation by 2027. BlockDAG is shaping up as a leading contender in the next generation of blockchain technology, poised to drive forward the decentralization movement and dictate future trends in the industry.

Floki ( FLOKI ), the sixth-biggest meme coin, was trading at $0.000256, pushing its market cap to over $2.4 billion. The coin could have more upside, helped by the ongoing token burn. Data by CryptoEye showed that Floki has burned over 103 billion tokens in the last 12 months. It burned 4.9 billion tokens in the last three months, leaving the total coins in circulation at over 9.6 trillion. According to Dune Analytics , the number of these circulating tokens has continued to fall in the past few months. These token burns will continue in the longer term, following a vote earlier this year that authorized the elimination of 15.2 billion tokens. Token burns help to boost a crypto asset’s value by making the existing ones more valuable. https://twitter.com/cryptojack/status/1865681945973400060 The Floki price is also doing well, helped by the ongoing inflows into the Floki Locker. Data shows that the total value locked in the network rising to a record high of over $57 million. This is a strong number since it started the year at around $10 million.

On the daily chart, the coin has formed a bullish pennant pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. It often leads to more upside in the long term. Floki, named after Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages flipped each other. Therefore, more upside will be confirmed if the Floki price rises above the key resistance at $0.00029, its highest level in November. Should that happen, and the crypto bull run continues, there are signs that the coin will jump by 40% and retest its all-time high at $0.000350. Floki was created by a group of crypto influencers using aliases, including B, PetaByte Capital, Sabre, and MrBrown Whale. It has since expanded its vision, focusing on developing an NFT gaming metaverse, called Valhalla, and aims to bring real-world utility and decentralized applications to its ecosystem.

SOL traded at $236 at press time after a 1.8% loss in 24 hours. Despite the underperformance, the Solana blockchain continues to lead in terms of adoption. Data from DeFiLlama shows that the blockchain posted the highest decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes in the last 30 days. The 30-day DEX volumes on Solana stood at $129 billion, nearly two times the DEX volumes of $70 billion recorded on Ethereum (ETH). The Solana blockchain is also witnessing similar growth in December as it is already leading with DEX volumes of $19 billion month-to-date. (Source: DeFiLlama) Rising volumes have also contributed to a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Solana. The blockchain’s Total Value Locked has increased from $5.69 billion to $8.98 billion, ranking it as the third-largest blockchain by DeFi TVL. Solana dApp volumes surge Besides the rising DeFi activity, the Solana blockchain has also significantly increased decentralized application (dApp) volumes. Per DappRadar, the dApp volumes on the network have increased by 80% to $9.34 billion. The other dApp metrics on the network that also saw a significant rise include Unique Active Wallets (UAWs), which increased by 0.24%, while transactions soared by 10% to 604M. Much of this activity came amid a meme coin mania on the blockchain attributed to the Pump.fun meme coin launchpad.

From its present presale price of $0.125, Rexas Finance is expected to reach $10 in the next weeks, a startling increase because of its presale success and creative method of tokenizing real-world assets. Rexas Finance’s (RXS) Meteoric Rise With its outstanding presale performance, Rexas Finance (RXS) has drawn the interest of analysts and investors separately. Priced at $0.125, the coin is in its ninth stage and has already seen an amazing 317% price rise from the presale start. Rexas Finance’s expansion has surpassed forecasts and generated over $22.42 million, preparing the ground for its much-awaited offering. Market analysts believe Rexas Finance is about to experience a big price increase; estimates place the token at $10 in the next weeks. Should this estimate be accurate, it would show an incredible 7,900% rise from its present presale-level pricing. Investors are assured almost a 2x return before reaching the $10 level when RXS lists its expected price of $0.20. With almost 392,000 entries recorded, the continuous $1 million prize on the Rexas Finance website has increased interest even further. Provided they satisfy the entrance criteria—holding at least $100 worth of RXS tokens, accomplishing specific activities, and introducing others to the platform—this project will reward 20 lucky winners with $50,000 worth of RXS apiece. Along with increasing presale involvement, early adopters of this creative marketing strategy have developed a feeling of community and loyalty. The Vision Behind Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with novel technology that lets customers tokenize actual assets. RXS lets anyone easily own or fractionalize real estate, art, goods, or intellectual property from anywhere across the globe. Attractive to individual and institutional investors looking for creative investment prospects, the platform’s capacity to close the gap between physical and digital economies changes everything. The convenience and flexibility provided by Rexas Finance are unmatched. Tokenizing assets at their speed and comfort allows users to usher in a new age of asset management and ownership. With Ripple (XRP), a token that has long dominated the cross-border payments and asset tokenization sectors, RXS is directly in rivalry with thanks for its exclusive value proposition. Rexas Finance underwent a comprehensive assessment by top blockchain security company Certik to guarantee openness and security. This certification has greatly raised confidence among users and investors by ensuring the credibility and technological soundness of the platform. The Certik audit for Rexas Finance is a solid justification since when reliability and security are paramount. Despite this, Ripple (XRP) has for long remained an active player in the crypto market, especially within cross-border payments. However, the rise of Rexas Finance offers a real threat to XRP’s hegemony. Unlike XRP, which mostly addresses payment solutions, RXS presents a more flexible method, allowing the tokenization of practically any real-world asset. Rexas Finance’s wider use makes it a solid substitute for XRP, appealing to a wide spectrum of investors seeking next-generation blockchain solutions. By tokenizing and fractionalizing assets, RXS creates a distinct niche outside conventional cryptocurrency use cases. The Path To $10 Several important elements help validate Rexas Finance’s forecast of $10 in the next weeks. First, its repeated price hikes and great presale momentum show clear investor interest. Second, the token has a competitive edge since it helps to tokenize actual assets, therefore addressing growing market demand. Moreover, the worldwide trend toward asset digitalization and decentralization fit the objective of Rexas Finance. RXS is in a good position to profit from additional sectors using blockchain technology for asset management. The expected $10 milestone reflects the increasing acceptance and market usefulness of Rexas Finance rather than only a speculative aim. Early players stand to benefit greatly as the token proceeds from presale to general trade. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a transforming tool in the blockchain realm, ready to reinvent our perspective and handling of real-world assets, not only another cryptocurrency. Its quick climb from below $1 to a projected $10 in the next weeks shows its great potential and expanding market impact.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-gay-musk-gaymusk-to-surge-12000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-dogecoin-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Needless to say, conclusions of this kind are incredibly far-fetched, and the price is more or less flirting with the line. Bitcoin Price Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin’s price has dropped back below the key $100K level, as it failed to close above it. Yet, the market has quickly recovered from the flash crash witnessed a few days ago, and $90K remains intact. The price is currently testing the $100K resistance zone once again, and with the market structure still bullish on this timeframe, it seems likely to rally higher in the coming weeks. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart A large ascending channel has been formed on the 4-hour chart, with the price gradually rising inside the pattern. Yet, the higher boundary of the formation has rejected the price lower, and BTC has consequently failed to keep above the $100K mark. However, as long as the channel is not broken down, the cryptocurrency is likely to rise higher. This is especially true if the market climbs above the pattern’s higher boundary, which could lead to an aggressive bullish continuation above the $100K level. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Whale Ratio While the price chart demonstrates Bitcoin’s inability to stay above the $100K mark, the recent failure to continue higher could be driven by a number of things. Analyzing the Exchange Whale Ratio could help find the cause. The exchange whale ratio metric measures the activity of BTC whales by displaying the ratio of large deposits to exchanges to total deposits. As the chart shows, this metric has dropped significantly over the last few weeks, indicating that the whales are not selling their coins aggressively anymore. This could mean that the recent consolidation and halt in Bitcoin’s uptrend can be associated with a liquidation cascade and cooldown of the futures market rather than a shift in the spot market dynamics, which could have longer-term consequences.

37386008,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390680,1733675641,Is Altcoin Season Finally Here? Trader Predicts $8 Rally for $.125 Token Challenging Solana (SOL),"The post Is Altcoin Season Finally Here? Trader Predicts $8 Rally for $.125 Token Challenging Solana (SOL) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News At last, Altcoin season is here! The tide is changing as cryptocurrencies are beginning to gather momentum following a protracted period of Bitcoin supremacy. This is an exciting period for those who enjoy making gains with cryptocurrencies since altcoin seasons usually bring notable price swings and growth chances. Although tokens like Solana (SOL) are usually expected to lead the charge, a new token valued under $0.50 generates waves. According to a well-known trader, this cryptocurrency may challenge Solana’s gains and even soar to $8 by early 2025. That token is RXS, Rexas Finance . Is Altcoin Season at Last Here? Clear indicators of the altcoin season’s arrival abound in the cryptocurrency market. Following a tweezer top candle formation on the monthly chart, Bitcoin dominance—which gauges Bitcoin’s market cap about the whole crypto market—appears to have peaked. This trend last occurred during the beginning of the 2021 alt season, when altcoins surged to record highs as Bitcoin dominance was declining. Bitcoin supremacy is waning right now, which opens space for altcoins to gather. If history repeats itself, dominance might drop to 35–40% over the following ten months and cause major altcoin increases. Interestingly, even if Bitcoin’s hegemony wanes, its price keeps rising, so altcoins can outperform throughout the process. The Altcoin Season Index has crossed the crucial 75 levels, indicating that 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin, validating the start of the altcoin season. This statistic strongly implies that the altcoin season is formally underway and the market might see a general climb in other cryptocurrencies. Among the currencies meant for explosive expansion is Rexas Finance (RXS), a project with real-world relevance and presale success already making waves. Rexas Finance (RXS): An Unconventional Blockchain Player This altcoin season, Rexas Finance is likely to be a serious competitor. Launched on September 8, the platform seeks to tokenize actual assets, including real estate, art, and intellectual property, thereby transforming asset management. This invention helps investors create more inclusive, liquid, and efficient markets by trading and owning fractionalized assets. Since its start, Rexas Finance has attracted considerable interest. Its presale has generated millions of dollars by selling out several levels ahead of time. With the token valued at $0.125, Rexas Finance has earned a 316% return for early investors currently at Stage 9 of its presale. With 298,269,252 tokens sold out of 335,000,000, the project has, therefore, raised $21,783,941 out of a $26,375,000 objective. Based on its road map, Rexas Finance intends to launch at $0.20 and list on three main exchanges in early 2025. Once listed, analysts estimate the token’s price could rise to $8 as investors swarm to buy RXS, drawn by its market potential and usability. With an amazing 8,000% return, Rexas Finance would be positioned as a top-performance alternative coin. Rexas Finance (RXS) vs. Solana (SOL): A Challenging Rival Due in large part to its fast transactions and strong ecosystem supporting distributed finance and non-fungible tokens, Solana has long been a darling of altcoin investors. As of December 3, 2024, Solana is trading at $223, on route to an all-time high of $264. Forecasting a possible high of $319.57, analysts hope Solana gains from the larger market surge in 2025. Though Solana has great potential, Rexas Finance is a great obstacle to it. Solana’s expected rise from $223 to $319.57 marks a 43% increase; Rexas Finance’s expected climb from $0.125 to $8 offers an amazing 8,000%. For investors looking for maximum gains during the cryptocurrency season, RXS is, therefore a more profitable investment choice. Final Thought During the altcoin season, there are fresh chances for development, and Rexas Finance is becoming rather competitive. RXS has the potential to outperform existing tokens like Solana in the next months with its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization, successful presale, and ambitious development ambitions. Investors have a special chance to profit on initiatives like Rexas Finance as Bitcoin dominance keeps dropping and the altcoin market recovers. With an early 2025 price objective of $8, this under $0.50 token might very well be the breakout star of this altcoin season, giving early adopters unmatched returns.

In the bogus statement, the foundation “unexpected legal action” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “We have made the difficult decision to immediately cease all support towards the $ADA token to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements,” the foundation seemingly stated. See the hacker’s statement below.

In light of this unexpected legal action, we have made the difficult… — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) December 8, 2024 All ADA tokens will “consequently be burned,” community members were wrongfully told. Background on Cardano and Its CEO Hoskinson founded Cardano in 2017 and became a prominent figure in the crypto industry. The platform operates on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, known for its emphasis on scalability, sustainability, and security. Cardano has been widely regarded as a “third-generation” blockchain designed to overcome limitations in earlier networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The foundation’s perceived cessation of ADA support seemed to suggest it was prioritizing regulatory compliance, likely in hopes of mitigating further penalties.

The fact that specific allegations had not yet been disclosed was a glaring sign that the lawsuit was fake. Source: CoinGecko The fake lawsuit seemed legitimate at a glance, considering there has been no shortage of similar lawsuits against other blockchain projects and crypto-related companies. In 2024 alone, the SEC continued its enforcement efforts against crypto-related schemes, targeting fraudulent activities and unregistered offerings. Here are some notable cases: NovaTech Ltd. ($650 million fraud): The SEC charged NovaTech for running a multi-level marketing and crypto investment fraud, impacting over 200,000 investors globally. The scheme promised safe, profitable investments in crypto and foreign exchange markets but primarily operated as a Ponzi scheme. CryptoFX ($300 million Ponzi scheme): Seventeen individuals were charged for their roles in a fraudulent scheme targeting the Latino community. The scheme falsely promised high returns from crypto and forex investments but instead diverted funds to pay earlier investors and enrich organizers. Maverick Protocol : The SEC alleged that this decentralized finance (DeFi) platform offered unregistered securities. The charges highlighted the ongoing scrutiny of DeFi projects that may bypass traditional regulatory frameworks. Gemini Earn Program : The SEC sued Gemini for its Earn program, claiming the product was an unregistered securities offering. The case emphasized investor protections for crypto-lending products Also, the SEC has scrutinized Cardano in the past. In 2023, the agency included ADA in its lawsuits against Binance and Kraken, alleging that the token functioned as an unregistered security under U.S. securities laws. This classification placed ADA under the SEC’s regulatory scope, requiring adherence to broker-dealer and securities registration rules if upheld by courts​ ADA still ranks among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The coin currently boasts a market cap of more than $42.7 billion. X security to blame? Since Elon Musk’s acquisition of X (formerly Twitter), there has been growing concern about an increase in security breaches. High-profile incidents include the compromise of the SEC’s official X account earlier this year. Observers have raised alarms over the platform’s ability to protect user data and maintain account security and blamed Musk’s significant staff cuts, including those in the information security team. The platform’s struggles with security have persisted under Musk’s leadership, with critics noting that these breaches could have long-term implications for the platform’s credibility, especially as it hosts government agencies, corporations, and influential figures. These concerns are compounded by Musk’s previous legal troubles, including an SEC lawsuit over his influence on Dogecoin prices, which has only added to the platform’s instability.

With the move, the digital arts sustained a move that has been registering since the first week of October. Notably, the push is being led by Ethereum NFTs, with the move having a lasting effect on its price. The assets registered the best opening week in a while, leapfrogging November where it witnessed $181 million in sales volume. NFT volumes dipped slightly in March, with the bearish momentum continuing across months to reach September. In September, NFTs recorded a worse monthly volume that hasn’t been seen since 2021. However, the assets fortune changed in October, recovering from the bearish returns of the previous months. The momentum was also sustained in November, registering a huge $562 million sales volume. Ethereum ranks top in NFT sales Ethereum led the other blockchains in NFT sales over the last week, racking up $92 million. The surge signifies an increase of 44.69% from the previous week and was led by the Pudgy Penguins and CryptoPunks projects, with both posting strong performances across the week. CryptoSlam data shows that Pudgy Penguins recorded sales of $25 million during the week, signifying a 346% rise from the previous week. Top NFTs by weekly sales volume. Source: CryptoSlam According to DefiLlama , the floor price of the Ethereum-based NFT collection also increased drastically, moving from 13 ETH on November 30 to around 21 ETH on December 8. CryptoPunks came in second place in sales, with a weekly sale volume of $16.5 million. The price of the NFT collection rose to 44 ETH on December 4, before dropping slightly to 40 ETH, worth around $160,000 as of December 8. Bitcoin-based NFTs were also on show, following Ethereum NFTs in second place. Ethereum’s price rally above $4,000 The surge in the sales of Ethereum NFTs coincided with the Ether’s price breaking above the $4,000 mark. Ethereum achieved the remarkable feat, hitting a new price at $4,067 on Dec 6. ETH closed the first week of December with a 40% surge, making it the first time in 10 months. Although the upswing has been tied to the wider market rally influenced by Bitcoin, analysts think other things are at play. The first instance is the impressive demands that have trailed Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs ), with Bloomberg reporting it saw inflows of $428 million on Thursday alone. The surge in ETF demand underscores the wider perception of the product, and especially the huge belief in Ethereum as the Trump administration prepares to take the reins. Since the election, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin, seeing a huge 61% increase in its value. The appointment of Paul Atkins as the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman has also ignited optimism, owing to his pro-crypto stance. Finally, the market believes that the altseason is already here, with analysts pushing Ethereum to take over from Bitcoin. Analysts feel that since Bitcoin has hit $100k, it is time for Ethereum to show what it’s got. Although Ethereum is still below its all-time high at $4,878, traders can still take in profit from its present surge. The derivatives market has also seen increased ETH appeal, with open interests in Ether Futures contract on CME moving ahead of Bitcoin Futures. With most traders already satisfied with their investments in Bitcoin ETFs, analysts believe that they may look at Ethereum as a closely regulated substitute.

37386037,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51680,1733674487,Unique Lineup of 6 Cryptocurrencies That Will Build Generational Wealth for Investors in the Next 90 Days,"Over the years, the cryptocurrency market has been viewed as a place with plenty of opportunities for making returns that can transform one’s life. Nonetheless, it can get overwhelming to keep up with so many projects and to backtrack in searching for the most potentially successful ones. However, with a more active market structure in sight, developing altcoins has already proven to be the solution to overcome many firms’ wishes to become wealthy for generations to come. These developing tokens take advantage of the fact that, unlike regular big players such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which tend to yield lower but constant returns, other efficient tokens average none-steady returns combined with huge upside potential; they are innovators and utilitarians. Now, let’s explore why these tokens are a good addition to your investment portfolio. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance looks to change the status quo in the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs) by allowing its ecosystem access to physical assets such as real estate, commodities, and art through the blockchain. The project has sustained eight consecutive presale stages ahead of time, with a total amount raised to $22.325 million to date. In the 9th presale stage, the price of the RXS Tokens currently stands at $0.125, which is expected to increase to $0.15 in the next presale stage. This upsurge demonstrates investor trust regarding the vision of Rexas Finance as well as its ability to combine the traditional finance model with the blockchain technology model. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Recently launched, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is a token behind the Hype Curve protocol as a central limit order book that combines Web3 liquidity with the Hype mechanism. The token’s price has surged by over 200% even though it was not available on any centralized exchanges. Hype Curve’s growth has a strong daily trading volume, which gives a lot of potential for the price to continue to increase in the future. Presently, strong interest in HYPE is notable, with many investors looking to acquire it as an added asset in their investments. Sui (SUI) The Sui project is seen as an ideal decentralized network that provides low workloads and high speeds, enabling crypto gaming and dApp applications to thrive. A total of about $ 385.37 million has been raised, which may change the project’s operational price structure. Over the years, SUI has shown signs of an upward price movement after several token releases, and most modern technical indicators predict further appreciation in the coming days. Qubetics (TICS) Qubetics intends to introduce Real World Asset Tokenization (RWAT), a new solution that integrates physical assets with the blockchain. Currently, the project is carrying its 11th presale stage, which has raised about $4.2 million with over 500 active holders of the token and an active sale strength of over 261 million. Toward the completion of this presale, analysts anticipate that major returns will come once the project achieves a $15 mark. Aptos (APT) Aptos is also a Layer-1 chain that prioritizes user experience and broader reach. The project is estimated to be scheduled for a token release of about $134.4 million, which may affect its overall operational chances. Technical analysis depicts increasing demand in the market, and investors appear to be enthusiastic about Aptos’s future. Bonk (BONK) Bonk is Shumba’s favorite meme coin. The Solana-based project is reportedly aiming to burn an impressive 1 trillion tokens around the Christmas holidays. Such a move is meant to limit the supply, which may increase its worth. With some very strong support levels and a loyal investor base, BONK is being considered a speculative asset that could bring a quick windfall. Conclusion The world of cryptocurrencies provides numerous possibilities for investment. Rexas Finance (RXS) focuses on real-world assets in the blockchain and has a strong ecosystem with many growth perspectives. Other projects such as Qubetics, Hyperliquid, Sui, Aptos, and Bonk each have something special to offer, from meme power to scalability and the de-fi solution. In the coming days, these tokens will stand at the right intersection of innovation, use case, and ease of use, which makes them attractive investments for wealth-building across generations. Make sure you spread your investments properly, do the required due diligence, and capitalize on the opportunities provided by such exciting altcoins in the future.

Some notable meme coins have gained traction, and their price performance has hit new levels. Santiment, a market intelligence platform on X, shared a chart showing that meme coins are pumping again. However, due to their historic price achievement, most of the market attention looks fixed on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Whale Activity Fuels Memecoin Rally According to Santiment, leading memecoins have registered signs of “mini breakouts” over the last eight days. Santiment believes whale action could increase prices and trigger retail investors’ Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). 🐶🐸😺 Meme coins are quietly having more mini breakouts this weekend. For coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, Dogwifhat, and Bonk, the larger wallets could continue to pump market caps longer until retail FOMO returns. Once the crowd catches wind and get greedy, the larger wallets sell… pic.twitter.com/KD9OeqnaBe — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 8, 2024 For instance, meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF), and Bonk (BONK) are recording greedy signals on social media platforms. Of these, PEPE is dominating the chart. Given this greedy market condition, the price might suffer huge fluctuations if the whale holders decide to offload meme coins. For perspective, the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) meme coin experienced a huge decline last week, and its market cap plunged from $500 million to $60 million in 20 minutes after it launched. Although leading meme coins do not fit this pattern, they are not immune from such volatility due to FOMO, social media trends, and Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). Memecoin Market Cap Hits $134 Billion Due to the recent uptick in price among memecoins, there has been an upsurge in the total memecoin market capitalization. CoinMarketCap data shows that meme coins have reached an all-time high (ATH) of $134 billion.

But artificial intelligence is a big enough tailwind that it may not be the stocks only that benefit from it. Meme coins that promise exposure to AI stand to benefit just as much. That’s what makes iDEGEN an exciting pick for 2025. iDEGEN could benefit from rapid growth in AI Experts remain bullish on AI plays even though such tailwinds have catalysed a massive rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index to the 6,000 level in 2024. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management dubs artificial intelligence as big of a paradigm shift as electricity or the internet. That’s why McKinsey expects AI to be generating up to $23 trillion annually by 2040 – and with a position in iDEGEN, you stand to capitalise on this estimated upside. Why? Because iDEGEN uses artificial intelligence to learn from tweets and responses on X. Naturally, therefore, it is broadly being perceived as an AI play within the crypto space. You can learn more about iDEGEN and its native meme coin on this link . How much capital do you need to buy iDEGEN? The AI angle is reflected in the strong demand iDEGEN has been able to attract for its ongoing presale. Within a matter of weeks, its native meme coin has raised more than $3.0 million. Remember that early demand typically signals the future potential of an asset. More importantly, you don’t have to risk a lot of your money to build a position in iDEGEN. Is $10 all that you can spare at the moment? Great, you can buy more than 3,000 iDEGEN tokens with it. Imagine the kind of life-changing returns you could make out of it if it delivers the kind of explosive growth that meme coins are broadly known to deliver in their early stages. Click here to explore ways to invest in iDEGEN today. How is iDEGEN better than other meme coins? iDEGEN may be a more thrilling investment than its peers also because it has a one-up over other meme coins. While the majority of them rely more on the hype for price appreciation, iDEGEN derives its value from the demand itself. If investors loaded up on its meme coin for two straight sessions of 5 minutes each, the iDEGEN token will increase in price. Finally, the coming year is broadly expected to be a strong one for cryptocurrencies as Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins to lead the Securities & Exchange Commission – and Atkins is widely known for his pro-crypto stance. So, it looks like the stars couldn’t align better for iDEGEN. Interested in finding out more about it? Click here to visit the iDEGEN website now.

They posted a tween about an SEC lawsuit, claiming that the Foundation will cease its support for ADA. The false statement begins by explaining that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has continued with its war against crypto under the current regime by filing a lawsuit against the Cardano Foundation. Consequently, the team had made “the difficult decision to immediately cease all support towards the ADA token to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.” Such statements typically impact assets in the ever-volatile cryptocurrency market, but the swift reaction of X’s team and Charles Hoskinson seem to have protected ADA’s price. Cardano’s native token remains relatively still at almost $1.2 after a minor decline on a 24-hour scale. Hoskinson was quick to point out to his one million followers on X that the Foundation’s account had been hacked. There’s also a statement under the false post on X outlining the compromised account.

Gain Insights on OP Integration & Solana Price Analysis,"How can crypto fans grasp the updates on Optimism (OP) integration, trends in Solana price analysis, and the excitement among the top crypto performers? Optimism’s embrace by Kraken highlights its increasing importance, while Solana’s surge to $241 illustrates its endurance. However, for those chasing more than stability, BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a standout. Merging blockchain and DAG technology, this project sparked a frenzy with its massive presale, racking up $159 million through 26 batches and achieving a staggering 2,240% growth. The thrill intensifies with BlockDAG’s exclusive 5-tier bonus system, lavishing rewards like the BDAG250. Despite the spotlight on Optimism and Solana, BlockDAG’s unparalleled growth and potential render it an exhilarating pick in the current crypto scene. Optimism (OP) Integration Catalyzes Growth Optimism (OP) is making strides as a crucial Ethereum Layer 2 solution, aimed at enhancing scalability and cutting costs. Its recent surge in adoption, marked by Kraken’s launch of the new Layer 2 network “Ink” using Optimism’s solid framework, reflects its deepening impact. Supported by a substantial $42.5 million grant, this step fortifies Optimism’s role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, sparking curiosity among blockchain aficionados. Beyond Kraken, Optimism’s influence grows as Coinbase’s Base network adopts its fail-safe system for heightened security and decentralization. These advancements emphasize Optimism’s contribution to Ethereum’s scalability. With the OP token up by more than 9% lately, its ecosystem’s promise shines through. As more entities integrate Optimism (OP), it stands out as a key player for future DeFi breakthroughs. Solana Price Prediction 2025: What’s Ahead? Solana’s ascent to $241 has positioned it as a formidable force in the blockchain arena. Renowned for its rapid processing and low fees, Solana keeps drawing both mainstream and niche players. Its recent enhancements, including AI capabilities through ChatGPT and innovations like state compression, boost its functionality and widen its appeal. Analysts anticipate Solana might top $450 by 2025, propelled by these tech advancements and growing acceptance. Institutional support boosts the anticipation around Solana’s 2025 outlook. Key figures like Franklin Templeton and Société Générale are using Solana for tokenized ventures, reflecting trust in its capacity to scale. With initiatives like Grayscale’s spot Solana ETF, the platform is cementing its position in the blockchain domain. Solana continues to be vital for those monitoring dynamic blockchain platforms. Why BlockDAG Leads the Pack in Crypto Performance Why should you look at BlockDAG instead of other projects? Its presale achievements are remarkable, gathering over $159 million across 26 batches, with an initial price leap from $0.001 to $0.0234—a whopping 2,240% increase. This impressive growth isn’t just about numbers; it shows the real benefits for early participants, positioning BDAG as a top choice among crypto presale coins. The unique 5-tier bonus system of BlockDAG further enhances its appeal. By using the BDAG250 code, participants get a 150% bonus on their initial buy, with escalating rewards for further buys, reaching up to 170% and more. This strategy boosts the advantages of early and ongoing engagement, offering immediate and substantial benefits for participants. Technologically, BlockDAG merges blockchain with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture, ensuring scalability, speed, and affordability. These qualities make it a dependable option for high-usage scenarios, maintaining BDAG’s value and functionality as the ecosystem expands. Engaging with this platform means backing a technology that’s prepared for tomorrow’s demands. With a history of significant returns, a strategic bonus system, and robust infrastructure, BDAG presents a prime opportunity for those looking for the next big crypto asset. In the domain of top performers, BlockDAG emerges as a comprehensive choice for immediate and enduring value. The Bottom Line While updates on Optimism (OP) integration and forecasts for Solana’s prices draw attention to these blockchain endeavors, BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a leader among them. Celebrated for its groundbreaking presale, lucrative bonuses, and advanced technology, BlockDAG offers an appealing mix of short-term and lasting advantages. Though Optimism and Solana hold their merits, BlockDAG’s steady expansion and unique approach spotlight it as the superior option. For those pursuing a project with established success and promising prospects, BlockDAG is a standout asset, promising unmatched value in the bustling crypto market.

The sanctions, part of a joint effort with the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, aim to dismantle the network's activities. The network, allegedly operated by Ukrainian national George Rossi, was centered around the TGR Group, which reportedly provided services such as cash-to-crypto exchanges, prepaid card solutions, and assistance for Russian citizens to acquire property in the UK. OFAC has imposed sanctions on five individuals and four entities connected to these activities. TGR Group allegedly used Garantex OU, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange sanctioned by OFAC, to process USDT transactions. Garantex has faced accusations that it facilitated transactions linked to the Hydra dark market, a notorious hub for illicit online activity. Related News: Donald Trump's Appointed US Cryptocurrency Official Makes a Statement TGR Group’s operations span multiple jurisdictions, including Wyoming, where Pullman Global Solutions LLC, a company reportedly more than 50% owned by Latvian national Andrejs Bradens, is involved. Bradens is said to have ties to other TGR-affiliated entities, such as TGR Corporate Concierge LTD, a UK-based firm. Elena Chirkinyan, described as a close associate of Rossi, played a key role in the network. According to the Treasury’s findings, Chirkinyan was involved in transferring funds from RT (formerly Russia Today) to support the operations of a sanctioned Russian-language media outlet in the UK. She also allegedly facilitated cash-for-cryptocurrency exchanges where USDT was sent to cryptocurrency addresses in exchange for cash. Chirkinyan is also accused of helping Russian citizens buy property in the UK, further entrenching the network's financial influence. It was revealed that Tether froze approximately $8 million worth of assets connected to the network on the day the sanctions were announced. *This is not investment advice.

According to Bennett, Ethereum could get a quick sprint if ETH continues to flash strength in its Bitcoin pair (ETH/ BTC ) “Bullish on ETH while above this $3,950 area with a $5,000 target.

But let’s face it, we’ve all had that one “if only” moment. Take Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY)—a Solana meme coin that skyrocketed by over 5,399% in a single month. Those who snagged $CHILLGUY early are likely sipping margaritas while their portfolios glow green. But hey, missing out doesn’t mean game over. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the presale darling that’s already raised over $1.35m in just 10 days. Packed with a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a buzzing community, BTFD is here to turn the tables. Ready to seize this dip-fuelled opportunity? Keep reading, because this might just be your second shot at striking gold. Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): The Meme Coin That Got Away Launched on the Solana blockchain in November 2024, Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY) was an instant hit. Riding the meme wave, $CHILLGUY’s quirky charm and Solana’s low transaction fees propelled it to an all-time high of $0.66 on November 27. The token’s market cap soared to $401.61 million, leaving latecomers kicking themselves. The cherry on top? Its listing on KuCoin and MEXC bolstered accessibility and credibility, driving more demand. Why Missing $CHILLGUY Stings If you’d invested $1,200 in $CHILLGUY during its early days at $0.01, you’d now have over $79,200 in your pocket. But hindsight’s 20/20, right? The token’s creator has since teased further developments, from partnerships to potential staking features. However, with legal disputes surrounding the meme’s copyright, volatility could be around the corner. While $CHILLGUY is holding strong at $0.40, it’s clear the early birds cashed in big. Missed out? Don’t sweat it; history might just repeat itself in the form of BTFD Coin (BTFD). BTFD Coin: Your Ticket to Meme Coin Riches BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement.

This milestone, just $3 above the previous high set in March, signals a potential resurgence for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The price action has caught the attention of analysts and investors, particularly as Ethereum continues to outperform expectations in a market dominated by volatility and uncertainty. Related Reading: Dogecoin About To Enter Phase Of Explosive Growth – Charts Reveal Massive Breakout Key metrics from IntoTheBlock shared by analyst Ali Martinez shed light on the network’s activity, revealing a surge in large Ethereum transactions. Historically, such increases in transaction volume have been linked to significant price movements, suggesting that Ethereum’s current uptrend could have more room to run. These developments hint at growing interest from institutional players and high-net-worth investors, further solidifying Ethereum’s position as a market leader. The next few weeks promise to be pivotal as Ethereum approaches the year’s end. Will it sustain its momentum and close the year with a breakout above $4,100? Or will it face resistance and retrace? With on-chain activity and market sentiment aligning in Ethereum’s favor, all eyes are on its next move as traders and investors position themselves for what could be an exciting close to 2024. Ethereum Transactions Surge With Price Ethereum continues to dominate market discussions after pushing to new yearly highs on Friday. The cryptocurrency surged past $4,096, surpassing its previous peak set in March. This upward momentum has reignited investor interest, but Ethereum’s price isn’t the only thing on the rise—its network activity is booming as well. According to data by analyst Ali Martinez (IntoTheBlock), large Ethereum transactions are experiencing a significant uptick. Martinez highlights that weekly transaction volume has skyrocketed by over 300%, reaching an impressive $17.15 billion yesterday. This surge in network activity signals increased confidence among institutional players and high-net-worth investors, who often precede retail adoption during major bull runs. Such growth in transaction volume historically correlates with sustained upward price movements, suggesting Ethereum’s rally may not be over. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH appears well-positioned to continue setting new highs if these trends persist. Despite this optimism, ETH faces a key milestone ahead—its all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021, is still 20% away. While Ethereum’s recent breakout has invigorated bulls, analysts caution that reaching and sustaining prices near the ATH will require significant buy-side pressure and broader market strength. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Keep Buying – Price Holds Above Crucial Mark If the current trajectory holds, Ethereum could approach its ATH sooner than expected, further solidifying its status as the go-to blockchain for decentralized applications and financial innovation. For now, investors are closely monitoring Ethereum’s price action and network data to gauge whether this rally has the momentum to break new ground or if a pullback is imminent. ETH Pushing Above $4k Ethereum is currently trading at $3,960, showing resilience after reaching a local high of $4,096 just two days ago. This rally has brought Ethereum back into the spotlight, with investors eyeing key levels that could dictate its next move. A weekly close above the critical $4,000 mark would signal the highest weekly close for ETH since December 2021, a major milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Such a close would reinforce the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, potentially attracting more buy-side pressure and setting the stage for a continued rally toward its all-time high of $4,878. On the flip side, failure to achieve a weekly close above $3,880—its previous highest weekly close—could indicate waning momentum. In this scenario, Ethereum may enter a consolidation phase as traders take profits and the market digests recent gains. Consolidation below this level would likely keep ETH range-bound in the near term, with $3,880 and $4,000 acting as pivotal resistance levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Still In Consolidation – Analyst Expects $0,63 If We Get A Breakout The next few days will be crucial as ETH navigates this critical juncture.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

He predicts Bitcoin’s value could reach $100 trillion under this strategy. Saylor’s ideas have garnered support from figures like Cathie Wood and the growing interest in cryptocurrency reserves in the US. Michael Saylor has reignited the debate on Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. In an interview , Saylor argued that the United States should replace gold with Bitcoin in its reserves, stating that this move would enhance the country’s overall control of the global capital network. The MicroStrategy Chief believes Bitcoin can help the US strengthen its position and dominate global finance. He suggests the US government acquire 20-25% of all Bitcoin. Saylor predicts this move could lower gold’s value, forcing countries like Russia and China to sell their gold and assets to buy Bitcoin, ultimately driving capital back to the US. Replacing gold with bitcoin Michael Saylor predicts Bitcoin’s value could reach $100 trillion if the US adopts his strategy. This bold claim contrasts Bitcoin’s current market cap of under $2 trillion which is never going to happen. Despite skepticism, Saylor sees Bitcoin as a better store of value than gold. He even suggests the US sell its entire gold reserve to buy Bitcoin, establishing itself as the “World Reserve Capital Network.” Saylor’s views have gained support from Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Investment, who believes Bitcoin’s future is brighter than gold’s and could exceed its $17.6 trillion market cap. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has also referred to Bitcoin as “virtual gold.” Under Saylor’s leadership, MicroStrategy has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, owning over 402,000 BTC. This strategy has paid off, with the holdings now worth over $40 billion, showing significant unrealized profits. Saylor’s proposal for a national Bitcoin reserve is bold and aligns with growing discussions about cryptocurrency reserves in the US.

37381093,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624547,1733666633,Microsoft shareholders to make Bitcoin investment decision on December 10,"Microsoft shareholders are set to decide on the firm’s Bitcoin investment stance on December 10. The digital asset’s cruise to $100k has been fueled by support from the United States President-elect Donald Trump and Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk. However, Microsoft has yet to commit. The deadline for the decision will come later this week as stakeholders take a vote in a Tuesday meeting to decide. According to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microsoft stakeholders will determine if it will add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. However, the board members are against the proposal, noting that the firm already has several assets it can invest in as part of its broader strategy, which includes Bitcoin. The final decision will be available after the meeting. Microsoft’s board did not commit to the Bitcoin investment proposal Microsoft’s Bitcoin proposal, “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin,” was submitted to the National Center for Public Policy Research, a think tank that advocates for Bitcoin. According to the think tank, Bitcoin is the best hedge for individuals and entities against inflation. Despite the think tank’s endorsement, the company’s board of directors is not in line with adding the digital asset to its portfolio. According to them, the topic is a delicate one that is being carefully considered. The director’s decision echoes Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates, a vocal advocate against the asset. He is in league with those who think it is a speculative asset, highlighting its lack of intrinsic value. However, the upcoming vote represents a fighting chance for the wider crypto market. A positive verdict could further enhance Bitcoin’s reputation as an asset that appeals to individuals and traditional corporations. It will also underscore its growing role as a financial instrument among institutions. An important decision for the firm If Microsoft decides to reject the proposal , it could be making a public stance against the digital asset whose popularity and price are at all-time high levels. It would be choosing not to follow in the footsteps of Microstrategy and other companies that have dipped their feet in the Bitcoin water. Microstrategy currently holds the largest Bitcoin cache of any corporation, totaling about 402,000 BTC. The cache is valued at $40 billion, representing about 2% of the asset’s total supply. The Bitcoin topic has been a touchy subject over the last few years. While individuals and entities continue to champion the asset’s cause, others may never be convinced. For instance, one of Bitcoin’s biggest critics, Peter Schiff has always warned about the dangers of dabbling in the asset. Schiff shares in the sentiment of most people about the speculative nature of the asset, begging the financial market to consider other alternatives. While there are critics like Schiff, there are people who believe in the asset like Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki. Kiyosaki has been singing Bitcoin’s praises over the last few years, making outrageous predictions to show his full faith in the asset. While he concedes that traders should add Bitcoin to precious metals gold and silver, he has tipped Bitcoin to outperform them. Bitcoin recently hit $100k, repaying the faith that people like Kiyosaki have in the asset. On the other hand, Schiff caught heat for his past negative predictions about BTC never hitting the $100k milestone. Whales like Microstrategy and El Salvador have also publicly showcased their exponential gains from Bitcoin. El Salvador president Nayyib Bukele recently shared his country’s unrealized Bitcoin profits on X. Microstrategy has continued to pump more money toward purchasing Bitcoin regardless of its profit over the years to the dismay of critics.

37381860,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51604,1733666441,How High Could 1Fuel (OFT) Climb by 2025? Is $5 Within Reach?,"As we all know, the crypto bull market is approaching as BTC (Bitcoin) has entered price discovery. Many cryptocurrencies will moon, creating new all-time highs (ATHs), and lots of liquidity will enter the crypto market. There are many financial opportunities currently available in the crypto space, and 1Fuel is no exception. 1Fuel’ s presale is ongoing at $0.01 per token, and experts believe that this project has the potential to give early investors a minimum of 500% return on their investment and much more after its public listing. The future of crypto decentralized wallets There are lots of wallet options that can be used on decentralized exchanges (DEX), e.g., Exodus . Still, with the advent of multiple layer 1 protocols and blockchains, traders now struggle to organize their holdings on different chains. This problem is exactly what 1Fuel (OFT) aims to fix. 1Fuel provides a seamless, efficient, and secure way for traders to trade across blockchains without the need to open multiple wallets. 1Fuel, unlike Metamask and other crypto platforms, is not your typical DEX wallet. 1Fuel will offer its users 1Wallet with endless possibilities. This project will feature a peer-to-peer marketplace for users to trade digital assets with each other, crypto cards to replace traditional credit and debit cards, military-grade cold storage that stores digital assets offline and online, and lots more. Will 1Fuel the bull run in 2025? What to expect As stated earlier, 1Fuel is currently at Stage 1 of its presale. Presales usually offer the lowest prices for smart investors, and with the success of other crypto decentralized wallets like Metamask and Ledger , we can expect 1Fuel to get mass adoption as it solves one of the biggest problems in decentralized finance, which is the absence of seamless cross-chain transactions. This product will launch with all its core features in the 2nd quarter of 2025, and that is when the real fun will begin. With a successful launch and the bull run in 2025 being in play, you can expect the price of OFT to be way above its presale value, as history with Trust Wallet Token (TWT) has shown that innovative products attract investors and create demand. 1Fuel’s marketing strategy will also have a huge role to play in influencing price action and creating awareness that will be a driving force for mass adoption. 1Fuel is backed by an experienced team, which puts this project at the forefront of success. Is $5 a realistic target for OFT? Trading and investing are often games of risk management, where success depends on careful planning and strategic decision-making. The current price of OFT is $0.01, and for it to reach a target price of $5, it would require an extraordinary 49,900% growth. The crypto market is filled with endless possibilities, and a 49,900% growth is not impossible, but they remain highly speculative and come with no guarantees. Rather than focusing on a price target, taking profits as the price goes up is always the better alternative. This strategy ensures that investors safeguard their capital and reduce the chances of being caught as exit liquidity for others during market downturns. A $5 target for OFT is possible, particularly if the project achieves significant milestones, such as a well-received product launch similar to Phantom Wallet’s success. Such developments can boost investor confidence and drive demand, playing a role in pushing prices towards that goal. Conclusion: Should I invest in OFT? 1Fuel is currently offering a special opportunity that can benefit investors who capitalize on the presale. 1Fuel has positioned itself to change the decentralized financial ecosystem positively. By addressing a problem most people have with DeFi and introducing features currently unavailable in the crypto space, 1Fuel will stand out amongst its competitors like the Exodus wallet . Like with any other investment, potential rewards always come with risks. Traders and investors are always advised to apply proper risk management and never invest what they can afford to lose. For prospective investors, the presale offers a chance to enter at the ground level, where the potential for returns is higher. With proper diligence, 1Fuel could become a rewarding addition to your portfolio by 2025.

37380915,https://finbold.com/?p=217864,1733666439,"Here’s how much your $1,200 stimulus check would be worth in Bitcoin today","Four years ago, as the world grappled with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government issued $1,200 stimulus checks to eligible Americans under the CARES Act. While many recipients used these funds to cover immediate needs, others saw an opportunity for long-term investment—particularly in Bitcoin ( BTC ), which was trading at a fraction of its current value. Fast forward to 2024, Bitcoin has achieved a historic milestone , crossing the $100,000 mark amid robust interest from both institutional and retail investors . Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $99,866, reflecting a 7% weekly gain. On the monthly chart, the cryptocurrency has surged 31%. From relief to returns: How much would $1,200 invested in BTC be worth now? If you had invested the entirety of your $1,200 stimulus check in Bitcoin on April 15, 2020, when BTC was priced around $6,966, you would have acquired approximately 0.1723 BTC. Fast forward to today, with Bitcoin hovering near $99,773, that initial investment would now be worth a staggering $17,187—a return of nearly 1,387%. The first stimulus checks were part of a series of Economic Impact Payments aimed at alleviating financial stress during the pandemic. Subsequent rounds, such as the $600 check in December 2020, presented similar opportunities. Investing this second round in Bitcoin, when the cryptocurrency was trading at approximately $33,098, would have resulted in a portfolio worth $2,144 today—an impressive 257% increase. Meanwhile, American households are grappling with record-high debt, which surged to $17.9 trillion in Q3 2024, driven by mounting student loans, credit card balances, and auto loans, as reported by Finbold. Although income growth has slightly outpaced debt accumulation—reducing the debt-to-income ratio from 86% in 2019 to 82% in 2024—financial stress remains a significant concern for many families. The narrative, however, might have played out differently if most citizens had poured their stimulus payments into Bitcoin during the pandemic. The leading cryptocurrency’s exponential growth could have provided households with a substantial financial cushion. These returns highlight the asset’s potential to serve as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s market evolution Bitcoin’s meteoric rise over the past four years has been fueled by increasing adoption, institutional interest, and market developments such as the approval of spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) in the United States. Recent data highlights this momentum, with ETF inflows surpassing $2.7 billion in a single week, pushing Bitcoin prices to an all-time high of $103,630. Bitcoin ETF inflow. Source: Farside Investors Major players like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) and Fidelity have contributed to this surge, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) registering cumulative inflows of $34.4 billion since its January 2024 launch. This influx of institutional capital has elevated U.S. BTC-spot ETFs to the position of the largest Bitcoin holders , surpassing even Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated stash. Regulatory winds and the road ahead Political developments also favor Bitcoin’s trajectory. President-elect Donald Trump’s appointment of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, as SEC Chair has further bolstered market optimism. The U.S. government’s shifting stance on Bitcoin, including plans to designate it as a strategic reserve asset under President-elect Donald Trump, adds another layer of intrigue. Such moves, coupled with bullish ETF inflows, could drive Bitcoin prices toward $120,000. However, market risks remain, with potential oversupply concerns stemming from U.S. government transfers and Mt. Gox’s creditor reimbursements. For those who chose to invest their stimulus checks in Bitcoin, the returns have been extraordinary, far outpacing traditional asset classes. As Bitcoin continues to gain institutional traction and regulatory clarity, its role as a transformative financial asset appears increasingly solidified. Whether Bitcoin’s journey will lead it to $120,000—or face downward pressure from market oversupply—remains a key question for investors navigating this evolving landscape.

People are turning their attention to projects that boast innovation, community backing, and market presence. Coins such as Avalanche, PEPE, BlockDAG (BDAG), and Celestia are gaining attention, each with its own set of unique features and potential for growth. From advanced blockchain technologies to meme-based appeal and scalable solutions, these altcoins present varied avenues for significant gains. Let's delve into what makes these the top crypto coins and examine why they deserve attention for 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Premier Layer-1 Blockchain BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out by implementing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, significantly enhancing blockchain scalability and decentralization. Unlike traditional blockchains, which face bottlenecks, BlockDAG’s DAG structure processes multiple blocks simultaneously, mitigating congestion and enhancing speed and efficiency. Moreover, BlockDAG’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) system maintains network security and decentralization without sacrificing scalability. This breakthrough positions BlockDAG as a leading Layer-1 blockchain, making it a top contender for 2025. The project’s presale has been remarkably successful, garnering over $158.5 million across 26 presale batches, rapidly approaching its $600 million goal. The native coin, BDAG, has experienced a remarkable price increase from $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch, yielding an astounding 2240% ROI for early participants. This swift growth underscores strong market confidence and highlights BlockDAG as a notable opportunity in the crypto space. Further enhancing its appeal, BlockDAG has recently introduced a 5-tier bonus system accessible with the code BDAG250. This bonus system, integrated into its updated dashboard, brings gamification into its ecosystem to boost user engagement. Starting with a 150% bonus on the first purchase and increasing to 170% on the second, the system adds an element of excitement with “mystery boxes” as higher-level bonuses, unlocking further rewards with each purchase. This unique approach, combined with BlockDAG’s advanced technology and impressive presale achievements, marks it as a prime crypto coin for 2025. 2. Avalanche: Streamlined Blockchain for Gaming Avalanche is noted for its streamlined blockchain, excelling in fast transaction speeds and minimal latency. The Avalanche 9000 upgrade enhances functionality, easing chain launches, and lowering validator costs. Its adoption in blockchain gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) is expanding, with numerous projects leveraging its infrastructure. The platform is well-suited for various applications that demand quick and secure transactions. With increasing market interest, Avalanche's utility and continuous improvements render it a significant choice for blockchain-based solutions. 3. PEPE: The Meme Coin Phenomenon PEPE, a well-known meme coin, consistently makes waves in the meme coin sector.

37380082,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373860,1733665090,"ETF Recap: Record-Setting Week for Ethereum, Bitcoin Funds Amid Price Rallies","The 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the States continue to enjoy substantial investor demand following the presidential elections, with another week of multi-billion dollar net inflows. This time, the same can and will be said about the spot Ethereum ETFs, which finally emerge as attractive investment tools. BTC ETF Inflows Rockets The previous business week – the last of November – was somewhat shaky as the BTC-based financial vehicles were in the red on Monday and Tuesday, with outflows of $435.5 and $122.8, respectively. The week actually finished with more withdrawals, as Thursday was a national holiday. However, the trend changed in the past week. $353.6 million entered the funds on Monday, with BlackRock leading the pack once again. $676 million followed on Tuesday, $556.8 million on Wednesday, $766.7 million on Thursday, and $376.6 million on Friday. Consequently, the total net inflows for the five-day trading period stood at $2,729.7 billion. What’s particularly intriguing about this week was that almost all of those net inflows went into BlackRock’s IBIT. The world’s largest Bitcoin ETF, which made more history this week, attracted over $2.6 billion out of the total. Nate Geraci, ETF Store’s president, outlined IBIT’s dominance. “ETFs holding more btc than Satoshi is antithetical to btc’s ethos”… Imagine a world where investors will be able to take delivery of btc via IBIT shares they own (i.e. they can exchange IBIT for btc). It’s coming & will simply be next step down path towards full tokenization. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 7, 2024 These impressive numbers impacted the underlying asset’s price movements as well. BTC skyrocketed past $100,000 for the first time ever on Thursday and charted a new all-time high of over $100,350. ETH ETF Demand Is Finally Here The spot Ethereum ETFs struggled at first to attract any actual demand, but the landscape has changed completely in the past two weeks, with $1.4 billion entering the funds within that timeframe. Now 10 consecutive days of inflows into spot eth ETFs… $1.4bil total. Includes 2 best days since July launch. Advisors & institutional investors only beginning to sniff around here IMO. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 8, 2024 The record-setting day was on Thursday, with $428.5 million . $24.2 million on Monday, $132.6 million on Tuesday, $167.7 million on Wednesday, and $83.8 million on Friday made the total of $836.8 million for the week – the best since the funds’ inception in July. ETH’s price has also skyrocketed in the past several days, surging past $4,000 on Friday evening for the first time since March of this year. ETH is up by 8% since last Sunday.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-gay-musk-gaymusk-to-skyrocket-12000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-dogecoin-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

He likened Bitcoin’s evolution to the new generation’s digital gold: “It has evolved from a payment idea to a store of value, to digital gold.” Novogratz noted that Bitcoin has cemented its role as a store of value that fluctuates according to market sentiment: “It will go up when people want it. It will go down when people say we don’t need it.” Despite Bitcoin’s remarkable growth, Novogratz sounded the alarm about the current state of the market. “There is a frenzy of buying Bitcoin all over the world right now. Bitcoin is one of the first global assets,” he said. However, he warned about excessive leverage, noting that funding costs for long positions were “the widest he’s ever seen.” He warned that high leverage could lead to sharp corrections, saying it was important to remain disciplined: “There will be at least one or two sharp pullbacks that will test one’s emotions. When there is that much leverage in a system, it breaks it.” Related News: Binance Labs May Have Sold These Two Tokens After Altcoin Market Rise Novogratz encouraged traders to remain disciplined and take profits during Bitcoin’s rally. “Be sharp. Leverage is very high and basis spreads are the widest I’ve ever seen. Eventually, there will be pullbacks before it goes up even higher. Remember to take profits along the way,” he said. While Novogratz remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s outlook, he acknowledged the volatility inherent in a leveraged market. When asked whether the rally could continue throughout the year or into the next administration, he expressed cautious confidence: “Could it last until Trump’s inauguration? I think so.” *This is not investment advice.

37382269,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104236,1733664390,Expert Says Ripple and XRP Could Serve as Strategic Weapons for the US,"Anders suggests that the United States could leverage Ripple’s expertise in cross-border payments and influence over XRP to position itself as a major leader in the finance and crypto sectors. The popular digital asset researcher made the assertion in a recent X post , emphasizing that the U.S. government could leverage Ripple and XRP as strategic weapons. Trump Plans to Make US Crypto Capital of the World It should be recalled that during his campaign, Donald Trump promised to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. To achieve this goal, the U.S. President-Elect revealed a number of initiatives he would introduce once he became president. This includes establishing a national Bitcoin stockpile, appointing a Crypto Czar to advocate for fair and transparent regulation for the industry, and keeping anti-crypto lawmakers away from the asset. Although Trump has not been inaugurated, he has made major moves to fulfill his campaign promises, like appointing David O. Sacks as crypto czar. Ripple Is Strategically Important to the US With Trump’s inauguration scheduled for January 20, Anders suggested that Ripple is strategically important to the United States to elevate the country as the global leader in the finance and crypto sectors. He highlighted three major factors to back this claim. Ripple Payment Solution According to the expert, Ripple has developed a cutting-edge business-to-business (B2B) system for cross-border payments. The expert emphasized that Ripple, a U.S.-based company, controls this innovative payment solution, potentially giving the country an edge in the sector. RLUSD Upcoming Launch In addition, Anders suggested that Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin RLUSD could potentially boost USD adoption among global financial institutions. It bears mentioning that Ripple is currently awaiting regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch the stablecoin on Ethereum and XRP Ledger (XRPL) mainnets. Once launched, Standard Custody & Trust Company will issue the stablecoin on Ripple’s behalf to several exchanges for public use. Additionally, Ripple will integrate the stablecoin into its payment solutions, allowing its clients to use it alongside XRP for cross-border settlements. Ripple’s XRP Holdings Furthermore, Anders highlighted Ripple’s massive holding of XRP as another strategic weapon for the United States. According to the expert, Ripple holds around 45% of XRP’s total supply, positioning the U.S.-based company as the largest holder of XRP. He disclosed the importance of this feat by referencing one of Trump’s campaign promises, which involves supporting all U.S.-based crypto companies and tokens. Overall, the U.S. could leverage Ripple’s innovative payment solution, its XRP holdings, and its upcoming stablecoin as strategic weapons to maintain its leadership in the crypto and finance sectors.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/08/expert-says-ripple-and-xrp-could-serve-as-strategic-weapons-for-the-us/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-ripple-and-xrp-could-serve-as-strategic-weapons-for-the-us,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37380359,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/heres-how-much-1-dogecoin-doge-will-be-worth-if-it-reaches-ripples-xrp-market-cap,1733664056,Here's How Much 1 Dogecoin (DOGE) Will Be Worth if It Reaches Ripple’s (XRP) Market Cap,"With its recent increase of 159.76% over the past month, Dogecoin (DOGE) has become rather popular in the crypto market. With its price now at $0.4067 and market capitalization of $59.78 billion, this amazing expansion has made many investors today wonder whether Dogecoin can keep its increasing trend and achieve the XRP market capitalization. DOGE would be among the top-ranking cryptocurrencies based on such a milestone, but what would its price look like should this occur? Ripple’s (XRP) Performance Ripple's XRP has been another outstanding performer in the crypto markets after last month's 374% price rise. XRP is the number 3 cryptocurrency by market capitalization after ETH and BTC, with its market value of $138.38 billion and price of $2.45. The resignation of the SEC chair is partly responsible for this increase in XRP value since it greatly raised investor confidence after Ripple's protracted legal conflict with the agency. With its creative technology attracting financial institutions worldwide, Ripple has positioned itself as a pioneer in enabling cross-border payments. The latest price surge emphasizes the growing hope of XRP's capacity to confirm its market supremacy and expand its application. With such momentum, XRP's market capitalization establishes a high standard for other cryptocurrencies striving for comparable growth. Dogecoin’s Price if It Reaches XRP’s Market Cap Though first developed as a fun project, Dogecoin has shown its potential to remain relevant, surpassing many other altcoins under favorable market conditions. Analyzing the figures helps one project Dogecoin's value should it approach XRP's present market worth. The market cap of Dogecoin, at $59.78 billion, would have to increase 131.4% to meet the $138.38 billion value of XRP. For DOGE, this development would mean a considerable price rise. A 131.4% increase would drive Dogecoin's price to $0.9476 from its present price of $0.4067. This computation highlights the amazing possibility of expansion should Dogecoin reach this milestone since it assumes that the circulating quantity of DOGE will stay constant. Such a price explosion would confirm Dogecoin's ranking as the top cryptocurrency and give its owners significant gains. Given its beginnings as a meme coin, reaching XRP's market size would be a noteworthy accomplishment for Dogecoin. However, getting such a valuation would need constant progress, more acceptance, and good market conditions. Although this expansion is feasible, Dogecoin's capacity to remain relevant and increase its use will determine the path to reach XRP's market cap. While XRP and Dogecoin rule conversations, a new participant called Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly attracting interest. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Emerging Token to Surpass DOGE and XRP’s Market Cap Using its real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing technology, Rexas Finance is transforming asset management. The initiative lets investors tokenize intellectual property, commodities, and real estate, generating infinite investment prospects and liquidity. At $0.125 as of writing, Rexas Finance (RXS) has raised over $22.55 million and is in its 9th presale stage. With experts projecting its market capitalization could surpass those of Dogecoin and XRP, this outstanding success has positioned RXS as a possible leader in the crypto industry. Rexas Finance presents real-world value, unlike many tokens that rely on speculative trading, attracting investors looking for a long-term increase. Rexas Finance (RXS) has experienced more than a 4x price increase since its initial presale pricing. It is expected to list at $0.20, ensuring over a 2x return for present investors. Plans to list three top-tier exchanges equip RXS to leverage its increasing momentum. It is a strong competitor for exceeding the DOGE and XRP market caps because of its unique offer of letting users tokenize and invest in assets worldwide. In conclusion, should Dogecoin approach the market capitalization of Ripple, its price will soar to around $0.9476, a 131.4% increase from its present value. Although DOGE's possible expansion emphasizes its great upside, investors should also take note of newly presented prospects like Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance is positioned to participate significantly in the cryptocurrency market with its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization and robust presale performance, maybe surpassing DOGE and XRP.

The first week of December builds on this trajectory, with Ethereum dominating as the leading blockchain for digital collectibles. Ethereum’s NFT Dominance Ethereum recorded an impressive $92 million in NFT sales during the week, up 44.69% from the previous week. Key drivers of this surge include popular collections like Pudgy Penguins and CryptoPunks. Pudgy Penguins led the charge with $25 million in sales, representing a staggering 346% week-over-week increase. Its floor price also saw a significant jump, rising from 13 ETH on November 30 to 20.9 ETH (approximately $83,000) by December 8, according to DefiLlama data. CryptoPunks followed closely with $16.5 million in weekly sales. The iconic collection’s floor price briefly hit 44 ETH on December 4 before stabilizing at 40 ETH ($160,000) by December 8. Bitcoin-based NFTs also made a strong showing, securing the second spot with $43.8 million in sales. Meanwhile, blockchains like Solana, Immutable, Mythos Chain, Polygon, Cardano, and Flow collectively contributed $47 million in sales volume. ETH Price Breakout Sparks Optimism The resurgence in Ethereum-based NFTs coincides with a notable price breakout for Ether (ETH) . On December 6, ETH surged above $4,000, reaching a high of $4,067. Analysts believe this rally could signify the beginning of a new paradigm shift for Ethereum. One trader drew parallels to Ethereum’s historic 2016-2017 bull run, suggesting the asset could potentially climb as high as $15,000 in the near future. This bullish sentiment, coupled with rising NFT activity, paints an optimistic picture for Ethereum’s ecosystem heading into 2024.

37379233,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624526,1733663121,White House Crypto Czar David Sacks invested in Bitcoin over a decade ago,"David Sacks, a member of the PayPal Mafia and one of Silicon Valley’s most notable investors, bought Bitcoin in 2013 when it was trading for $130. That’s over a decade before his appointment by Donald Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar. With Bitcoin’s price now up over 76,000% since then, David’s foresight is impossible to ignore. Known for early stakes in companies like Meta, Airbnb, and SpaceX, David was already taking names in the tech world when he turned his attention to Bitcoin. Bitcoin, Solana, and David’s crypto vision David’s belief in Bitcoin wasn’t casual. Speaking to Anthony Pompliano, he explained why he saw Bitcoin as more than an investment. He compared the relationship between money and government to the historical bond between church and state. “The Church and state used to be intrinsically linked,” he said. “Now, we think about them being separate. Bitcoin, it’s sort of this sci-fi future where you could maybe have these two things decoupled.” David saw Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat inflation and censorship. However, Bitcoin isn’t the only crypto in his portfolio. David is also a major investor in Solana (SOL). Even after the chronicled FTX collapse in 2022 sent shockwaves through the crypto world, David held onto his SOL holdings. He has consistently championed Solana, even predicting it could one day surpass Ethereum. On the All-In podcast in 2021, he said, “There’s smart money in Silicon Valley betting on a flipping where Solana overtakes Ethereum as the preferred platform.” His involvement doesn’t stop there. David backs Multicoin Capital, a crypto investment firm, adding more weight to his reputation as a blockchain believer. This appointment as Crypto Czar aligns perfectly with his long-term advocacy for Bitcoin. Alongside David, Trump has nominated Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager, as Treasury Secretary. Bessent, like David, supports crypto as a tool for freedom. He has openly stated, “The crypto economy is here to stay.” AI players are a little uneased Meanwhile, David’s appointment has raised eyebrows, especially among those in the AI industry. He’s been a vocal critic of excessive government regulation in tech, advocating for open-source AI models and a self-regulating industry. But not everyone in the AI world is thrilled about his rise to power—Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, might have the most to worry about. David hasn’t held back his opinions on OpenAI. In October, he joined Mark Cuban on the All-In podcast to criticize OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, with Elon Musk as one of its early backers, putting in $50 million. However, under Altman’s leadership, the company created a for-profit arm to support its operations. Elon, now running his own AI company, xAI, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming the pivot went against the original mission. David sided with Elon, accusing OpenAI of misleading investors. He described the transition as a move from “nonprofit philanthropy to piranha, for-profit company.” Cuban echoed these concerns, saying, “When people screw over investors, it always comes back. Karma is a b*tch in business.” Despite the criticism, Altman publicly congratulated David on his appointment, a post that Elon reacted to with a sarcastic emoji.

But is the market prepared for this upswing? This $ETH breakout out of the triangle consolidation is very significant. Now #Ethereum only has to close this weekly candle bullish, and we may never revisit this sub $4,000 level again in this bull cycle. The impulse move from 2016-2017 is repeating. PT: $15,937 by May 2025 pic.twitter.com/dNzcO3mPe1 — venturefounder (@venturefounder) December 6, 2024 Institutional Interest Drives Optimism More institutions are becoming interested in Ethereum, which makes people more optimistic about its long-term prospects. Spot Bitcoin ETFs got a lot of attention at the beginning of the year, and now Ethereum-based funds are following suit. Notably, since the middle of November, spot Ether ETFs have gotten more than $1.3 billion in fresh inflows. The iShares Ethereum Trust from BlackRock has made the most returns, $500 million in just one week. Beyond just numbers, these investments show a rising trust in the Ethereum ecosystem. According to analysts, this institutional funding flow will pave the way for ETH’s anticipated meteoric rise. With institutional investors continuing to pour money into the cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s value proposition as a long-term investment appears stronger than ever. Technical Indicators And Forecast The recent weeks’ price behavior of Ethereum has also been rather favorable. Following a little setback, the altcoin has recovered, climbing 30% starting in November 18. With analysts underlining its resilience against market swings, it is trading at $3,686 right now, which is a solid figure. Technical markers of consolidation point to ETH getting ready for its next action. Moving averages show stability, hence the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays neutral. Forecasts show ETH perhaps rising by 43% in six months and 22% in three months, data from CoinCheckup shows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Days At The Top Numbered?

How Lightchain AI Could Impact Its Future,"Could we be staring at the next big crypto explosion? 🚀 Lightchain AI's pioneering AI-blockchain technology seems set to shape not just its own ecosystem but also disrupt the dynamics of decentralized finance (DeFi) as we know it. This might profoundly impact major players such as Uniswap (UNI). Let's dig deep into how Lightchain AI and Uniswap could create a paradigm shift in the DeFi landscape—and make some informed price predictions for UNI in 2025. The Lightchain AI Presale is already the talk of the blockchain town. Still early in its presale stage, you can join the future of AI-driven blockchain today and enjoy discounts before prices rise! Learn more here . Why Lightchain AI Has the World's Attention Lightchain AI is no ordinary blockchain project. It’s a technological marvel combining AI and blockchain to create solutions that go far beyond typical DeFi applications. What Makes Lightchain AI Revolutionary? Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike conventional consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoI rewards nodes for meaningful AI computations such as training models or processing data for decentralized utilities. Imagine turning computational power into sustainable revenue streams while securing the network!

Secure your tokens today! Uniswap’s Role in the Future of DeFi Uniswap has already cemented itself as a leader in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), enabling automated trading of DeFi tokens. But the game is evolving. With rising competition and innovative technologies like Lightchain AI on the horizon, how Uniswap adapts in 2025 will determine its trajectory. Uniswap’s Strengths in the Market Liquidity Pools: These have revolutionized trading by eliminating traditional order books, making swaps seamless and efficient. User-Friendly Interface: Uniswap is known for its simplicity, cementing its appeal among crypto newcomers and veterans alike. Smart Contract Efficiency: Its robust smart contracts allow for secure and fast transactions—something that could integrate harmoniously with Lightchain AI's AIVM in the future. The question is, can Uniswap leverage these strengths while adopting revolutionary AI-enhanced tools to stay relevant and grow? Lightchain AI + Uniswap = A DeFi Revolution? 🌐 Imagine a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap layered with AIVM-driven intelligence. Lightchain AI could help Uniswap optimize liquidity pools, conduct real-time market analysis, and even develop predictive models for asset performance. Here’s what the synergy between the two could mean for DeFi users and investors alike: AI-Enhanced Trading Strategies: With Lightchain AI’s real-time data analysis, traders could receive actionable insights directly within Uniswap’s interface. For instance, predicting token price movements could become easier and more accurate. Improved Liquidity Pool Efficiency: Lightchain’s PoI mechanism could complement Uniswap’s liquidity model by introducing AI-driven optimizations that maximize returns for liquidity providers. Sustainability: By reducing computational inefficiencies, AI integration could make decentralized operations more energy-efficient—a win-win for both the environment and profitability. This alignment isn’t just speculative; the natural technological fit between the two platforms makes this future scenario more plausible than you might think. UNI Price Predictions for 2025 Given Uniswap’s current price of $17.84, what could we expect for UNI if these technological advancements play out as anticipated? Using market trends, expert analysis, and potential macro developments, here’s a speculative weekly forecast for mid-2025 if Lightchain AI and Uniswap collaborations take flight: Week 1: UNI rallies to $28.00, driven by announcements of AI integrations. Week 2: Profit-taking stabilizes UNI at $25.50, reflecting increased trading activity on Uniswap.

37378399,https://square.htx.com/?p=41827,1733662072,HTX DAO Drives Innovation in Exchange Ecosystem with Proposals on “Multiple Farming” and Liquidity Burning,"In the competitive cryptocurrency market, innovation has emerged as a critical driver for the evolution of exchange ecosystems. Leading exchange HTX , through its decentralized governance framework, HTX DAO , has introduced groundbreaking proposals: the launch of a “Multiple Farming” model and the pivot from liquidity pledge to burning. These initiatives seek to enhance user engagement while advancing the DAO-driven governance of the exchange ecosystem. Transforming Liquidity Pledge into Burning for Long-Term $HTX Appreciation HTX DAO’s latest proposal replaces liquidity pledge with token burning to optimize $HTX’s tokenomics. Traditionally, liquidity pledges were used to incentivize liquidity providers, but this approach faced limitations: ● Dispersed Incentives: Assets allocation across multiple pools diluted the impact on token value. ● Short-Term Effect: This model often led to abrupt withdrawals once incentives ended, pressuring token prices. To address these challenges, HTX DAO executed a pivot to the token burning mechanism based on community options. Beginning in Q3 2024, portions of revenue initially allocated for liquidity pledge were diverted toward regular token burns. On October 15, 2024, HTX DAO announced the successful completion of its $HTX token burn for Q3 2024. In this quarter alone, 15,811,683,954,403 $HTX tokens, valued at approximately $21.25 million, were burned. Going forward, 50% of HTX’s quarterly revenues will be allocated to this burn mechanism, with the next burn scheduled for January 15, 2025. This initiative has already had positive results, including: ● Increased Scarcity: Reducing circulating supply enhances $HTX’s intrinsic value. $HTX reached a new all-time high in December. ● Long-Term Incentives: Token burns encourage long-term holding, bolstering stable ecosystem growth. ● Governance Transparency: The launch of the burning mechanism through community proposals demonstrates HTX DAO’s commitment to transparent and democratic governance. The successful implementation of this proposal highlights HTX DAO’s foresight in aligning $HTX’s tokenomics with sustainable ecosystem growth. “Multiple Farming”: A New Chapter of Efficient Yields HTX DAO’s ‘Multiple Farming’ proposal offers a new way to earn rewards, allowing users to earn from multiple sources with a single asset. This innovative model enables users to leverage a single asset for rewards across multiple projects. Key features include: ● Collaborative Rewards: Users can simultaneously receive returns from Earn products and airdrops. ● Smart Distribution: Transparent and dynamic reward distribution enhances the user experience. ● Ecosystem Synergy: Collaboration is strengthened between projects within the HTX DAO ecosystem, amplifying overall value. The first ‘Multiple Farming’ project is Launchpool, an improved version of PrimePool. This initiative bridges Launchpool with Earn products, enabling users to reap dual benefits. The first round of Launchpool runs from 12:00 (UTC), December 4 to 12:00 (UTC), December 18, 2024. Users can lock $HTX or subscribe to the $HTX Flexible Earn product to share 1,666,666 $MEMEFI and 729,710 $PCI. ● Collaborative Rewards: Users lock a single asset to earn yields from multiple projects. ● Product Integration: Launchpool connecting with Flexible Earn products broadens user earning options. ● Transparent Governance: HTX DAO-driven reward distribution boosts trust and participation. This approach offers users more ways to earn rewards and strengthens collaboration between projects. Through DAO governance, resources are shared and inter-project development is enabled. This approach attracts more high-quality projects to join the $HTX ecosystem, fostering participation in the innovation of farming models. Through these efforts, HTX DAO has opened a new chapter in the DAO-driven exchange governance, laying the groundwork for the realization of future proposals. Unlocking Future Potential in DAO-Driven Exchange Governance The success of the “Multiple Farming” proposal shows thatHTX DAO is committed to innovation. Looking ahead, HTX DAO plans to explore diverse applications of proposal-driven governance in the exchange ecosystem, including: ● Innovative Farming Models: Introducing cross-chain farming and yield optimization strategies to elevate user experience. ● Cross-Chain Collaborations: Facilitating deeper cooperation across blockchain ecosystems through DAO frameworks to increase market presence. ● User-Led Growth: Encouraging community members to submit proposals, boosting innovation and creativity. Through the implementation of the two proposals, HTX DAO has demonstrated the transformative potential of decentralized governance in optimizing exchange ecosystems. These initiatives not only deliver value to users but also set a governance benchmark for the cryptocurrency industry. HTX DAO is committed to advancing an open and inclusive ecosystem with the core of proposal governance to redefine the future of cryptocurrency exchanges. Through a blend of transparency, innovation, and community-driven growth, it aims to establish a leading decentralized governance framework. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

Pseudonymous crypto trader Inmortal tells his 220,900 followers on the social media platform X that he expects the top smart contract platform to hit new all-time highs with haste. “It took 27 days to go from $3,000 to $4,000. It will take only a few days to go from $4,000 to $5,000. ETH.” Looking at the trader’s chart, Inmortal expects Ethereum to shatter the $4,800 barrier. Source: Inmortal/X Ethereum is trading for $4,014 at time of writing, down about 18% from its all-time high of $4,848 which it hit in November of 2021. The strategist goes on to note that Ethereum in its Bitcoin pair (ETH/ BTC ) appears to have printed a cycle bottom after touching a support level following a lengthy downtrend. “Imagine being bearish after 1,300 days of downtrend. The same people who hate ETH now [are the] same people who hated [Solana] in 2022. Just my opinion.” Source: Inmortal/X ETH/BTC is valued at 0.03996 BTC ($4,003) at time of writing.

37377772,https://crypto.news/?p=14317267,1733661127,"JASMY, QNT, MEW: Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week","The crypto market just wrapped a highly bullish phase, with the global crypto market cap surging by $220 billion to reach a record-high valuation of $3.8 billion as of Sunday. This upward trend was largely driven by Bitcoin ( BTC ), which surpassed the $100,000 milestone. However, several altcoins also capitalized on the momentum, achieving massive gains. Following their noteworthy performances last week, here are our top cryptocurrency picks to keep an eye on this week: JASMY claims 2-year peak JasmyCoin ( JASMY ) was a major beneficiary of last week’s uptrend . It built on a momentum that began on Nov. 27 and closed the week with an impressive 69% gain. See below. JASMY 1D chart | Source: crypto.news Introduced by Jasmy Corporation for the Ethereum-based Jasmy platform, JASMY looks to combat concerns around data security. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20. The token soared by 27.49% on Dec. 3 — its largest intraday gain in nearly 10 months. Despite a slight pullback the next day, the asset engineered a more remarkable 45% rise on Dec. 5, eventually claiming a two-year peak of $0.0590. JASMY has so far dropped to retest $0.047. Its relative strength index (RSI) has also slumped to 68. The asset must retain $0.3912 to hedge against steeper drops. Below this, the next support rests on the 20-day MA at $0.03178. You might also like: Bitcoin remains volatile despite $103k milestone: Scaramucci QNT rallies 67% Quant ( QNT ) also began the week on a bullish note, riding on Bitcoin’s uptrend to record a substantial weekly gain of 67%. This marked one of its most bullish weekly performances this year. QNT 1D chart | Source: crypto.news QNT is the ERC-20 utility token of the Quant blockchain project, designed to bolster interoperability among different networks through its Overledger Network. The token has been one of the best performers in the ongoing bull run. Quant has been on an ascending channel since early November, with the bulls leveraging the lower trendline to defend a drop below $96 on Dec.1. As the bullish momentum wanes, QNT must hold above the Fibonacci 0.618 retracement at $126.3 to remain within the channel and sustain the uptrend. If the upsurge resumes, a push above $170.7 could trigger the start of a new explosive phase. Overledger connects blockchains and traditional systems without requiring infrastructure changes. It supports the creation of multi-chain applications (mDApps) for seamless interaction across networks. Targeted at sectors like finance, healthcare, and supply chain, Quant facilitates use cases such as cross-border payments, supply chain transparency, and digital identity management. With partnerships including Oracle and Hyperledger, Quant stands out for integrating blockchain with regulated industries. MEW consolidates below $0.01 Despite the prevalent uptrend in the market last week, cat in a dog’s world ( MEW ) largely consolidated. However, the meme coin managed a 2.5% weekly gain. MEW 1D chart | Source: crypto.news Launched in March, MEW is a cat-themed Solana-based meme coin , standing out in a market dominated by dog-themed tokens. It gained attention by burning 90% of its supply at launch. In May, the project also partnered with LOCUS Animation Studios to create a 3D animated series, further enriching its narrative and boosting its fanbase. Within hours of launch, MEW reportedly achieved $150 million in transaction value and attracted significant traction across the Solana ecosystem​ By Dec. 1, MEW began last week with an impressive 4.62% gain, but it all went downhill from there. The token collapsed 7.32% in two days, retesting the $0.0083 low, and then consolidating at $0.009 following a mild recovery. Its MACD is also flashing a bearish trend, requiring an intervention to flip bullish. This week, MEW would have to recover above the Pivot level at $0.010016 to turn its momentum bullish. Above this, the first resistance would rest at $0.01204, with a further roadblock at $0.01329. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

For more information, watch this video . Filecoin: Decentralising Data Storage Like Never Before Moving on to Filecoin, this decentralised storage network is one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto space. In a world where data is king, Filecoin offers a revolutionary solution that allows users to rent out unused storage space while ensuring their data is encrypted, secure, and accessible only to those they choose to share it with. This concept is particularly attractive for those who want more control over their digital assets and data privacy, and with the rising demand for secure cloud storage, Filecoin is in a prime position to capitalise. As part of the Web3 ecosystem, Filecoin decentralises the process of data storage, breaking free from the grip of centralised giants like Google and Amazon. Instead of relying on a single entity to store data, Filecoin creates a network of independent storage providers, giving users the power to store and manage their data as they see fit. As data continues to grow in importance and the need for more secure, private solutions becomes more urgent, Filecoin’s potential is only set to increase. Immutable X: Scaling NFTs with Zero Gas Fees Immutable X is leading the charge when it comes to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming. Unlike many blockchain platforms, Immutable X offers a scalable, high-throughput environment that allows users to trade NFTs with zero gas fees. This is a game-changer for NFT creators and collectors who have long been frustrated by the high costs of minting and trading NFTs on Ethereum. By using a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum, Immutable X combines the security and decentralisation of Ethereum with the scalability of a roll-up system. This makes it an ideal platform for gaming applications, marketplaces, and digital collectables. The ability to mint, buy, and sell NFTs without worrying about gas fees is a major draw for the growing NFT community. For those who see NFTs as the future of digital ownership and want to be part of a project that’s shaping that future, Immutable X is definitely one of the best coins to buy in December 2024. Final Words: Which One Should You Buy? So, with all that said, which of these coins should you be looking at for December 2024?

Analysts Debate Market Outlook,"The altcoin market has surged since Donald Trump’s presidential victory, but concerns are mounting over its sustainability. Felix Hartmann, managing partner at Hartmann Capital, cautioned in a December 7 X post that institutional investors may soon take profits, sparking a sharp market correction. Hartmann pointed to sky-high funding rates, some exceeding 100% annualized, and declining spot trading volumes as warning signs. He suggested that recent altcoin moves have been largely fueled by leveraged perpetual traders. “Once momentum tips, we’ll see some murder wicks,” he said, predicting a volatile downturn for overvalued assets. Historically, such corrections are not unprecedented. In late 2021, Solana (SOL) peaked at $248.36 but crashed 64% to $89 within two months. XRP suffered a similar fate , losing about 51% in the same period. Hartmann’s cautionary tone echoes these earlier shakeouts, with a warning that a repeat could be on the horizon. Bullish Traders Say Altcoin Season Is Just Starting Despite the grim forecast, some traders remain optimistic, arguing that altcoin season has only begun. Crypto analyst MilkyBull Crypto suggested in a December 6 X post that the current altcoin rally could last through March. Sensei, another prominent trader, backed the sentiment, declaring to his 72,900 followers, “Altseason has just started.” Key altcoins have posted remarkable gains since November 1, with Hedera (HBAR) up 99.31%, IOTA (IOTA) climbing 79.61%, and JasmyCoin (JASMY) surging 72.47%, according to CoinMarketCap. This momentum, coupled with a decline in Bitcoin dominance to 55.11% over the past 30 days, is fueling bullish sentiment among traders who view Bitcoin dominance as a key metric for altcoin cycles. Outlook Remains Divided However, rising funding rates for perpetual futures contracts could complicate the bullish case. Bulls are paying 4% to 6% monthly to maintain leveraged positions. While manageable during a strong rally, these costs could erode profits if prices falter, potentially triggering a sell-off. As altcoin investors weigh the bullish optimism against bearish caution, the market faces an inflection point. Whether this rally represents the early stages of a sustained altcoin season or the prelude to a sharp correction, one thing is clear: volatility will remain the defining feature of the crypto market in the weeks ahead.

37377302,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624537,1733659943,Iran greenlights crypto regulatory framework,"The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has approved a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry in the country. According to sources, the bank’s approval of the ‘Policy and Regulatory Framework for Cryptocurrencies’ puts it in the role of the industry’s regulator in the country, with the responsibility of regulating and balancing its oversight with economic development. The framework details providing licenses to brokers and crypto custodians, which will be overseen by the CBI. The bank will also ensure that these firms follow anti-money laundering (AML), crypto tax, and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) laws. According to the CBI’s governor, Mohammadreza Farzin, the bank will work with agencies like the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs to create an industry-friendly regulatory framework for the crypto sector. CBI governor details benefits of crypto to Iran According to the CBI governor, the country wants to use the crypto regulatory framework to leverage the potential of the assets in the space. Minister of Economic Affairs Abdolnasser Hemmati also echoed the same sentiments, noting that the government has no intention of stifling the asset’s potential. “Attempts to impose limitations have failed. Instead, we aim to manage their risks and capitalize on their benefits, including job creation and bypassing sanctions,” Hemmati said. Hemmati mentioned that instead of looking at the negative aspect, it is better to look into its impact on the economy. He also called for support as regulators make key moves to expand Iran’s digital economy. Hemmati also urged crypto stakeholders to create a unified association that will protect their interests while helping the country expand its digital footprints. He hailed the development as a positive one that will benefit the country and its residents who wish to embrace the new technology. Over the years, Iran has turned to Bitcoin and other digital assets in the face of sanctions from the United States. With the sanctions limiting its financial scope, the country has opened up to crypto mining, albeit under strictly regulated conditions. The country, according to several reports, sees mining as a way to generate income and turn its economic situation around for good. Iran has also tried to use crypto to settle international trade, bypassing sanctions. Iran has had to deal with regulating crypto and US sanctions The crypto industry in Iran has been under regulatory scrutiny as part of efforts to prevent illegal activities. Many consider the latest framework approved by the country’s government and central bank as a set toward integrating its financial system with others around the world. Iran made crypto mining legal in 2019, urging interested miners to register for licenses to operate. The government gave the miners stringent conditions, which included paying higher for electricity, providing different kinds of identifications, and selling most of their mined assets to the government. However, in December 2021, it asked miners to shut down operations, citing the adverse effects of their operations on the national grid during the chilly period. A few months later, the government reversed course and gave the green light for miners to resume their activities in September 2022. In 2022, Iran created a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry in an attempt to use the digital asset to bypass United States sanctions. At the time, the country was sanctioned by the United States due to its nuclear program in its capital city of Tehran. It made the announcement on August 29, weeks after the country approved the import of $10 million worth of cars using digital assets. While the previous rule focused on mining activities, this new rule gives the central bank the power to oversee other crypto activities.

According to the market intelligence platform Santiment, leading meme coins show signs of “mini breakouts.” These assets see notable spikes in their social activity over the last eight days. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1865621956399153273 Large meme coin holders would likely push the prices to create FOMO (fear of missing out) among retail investors to take profits potentially, per the Santiment X post. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Pepe ( PEPE ), dogwifhat ( WIF ) and Bonk ( BONK ) are seeing greedy signals on social platforms, with Pepe dominating the social dominance chart. The problem with greedy market conditions is that there is usually a high chance of a selloff by whales. At this point, meme coins are likely to see high price fluctuations. Last week, the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) meme coin witnessed a sharp plunge in its market cap — from $500 million to $60 million — within 20 minutes after its launch, crypto.news reported. While this is not the case with leading meme coins, they’re still highly vulnerable to social trends, FOMO and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt).

37376496,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373337,1733658902,Web3 Wonka: Bitcoin Investor Hides $2 Million in 5 Treasure Chests,"A Web3 enthusiast might say those very words about a blockchain smart contract. Jon Collins-Black, a lifelong fan of fantasy novels and games, has used a portion of his early Bitcoin investments, worth some $2 million at the average BTC price today, to fill five treasure chests hidden throughout the United States. Millionaire Bitcoin investor hides crypto prizes on the map The early Bitcoin-era cryptocurrency investor went to auctions to create the unique collection of loot. Moreover, he says the treasure boxes contain rare Pokémon cards, historical shipwreck artifacts, sports memorabilia, and gold and precious metals. “I was like a kid in a candy store,” he said. Collins-Black said he was inspired in part by the treasure hunt launched by US Air Force veteran and eccentric art collector Forrest Fenn. Like Collins-Black, the larger-than-life figure self-published a book to promote the treasure hunt in 2010, “The Thrill of the Chase: A Memoir.” That hunt was for a single trove and it contained gold nuggets, rare metal coins, and valuable jewelry and gemstones. How does hunting for Fenn’s treasure compare to Bitcoin mining/or buying BTC for a risk-reward profile? Any of the lucky treasure hunters who successfully find one of the treasure boxes may come up in the money profit-wise. That is—if they don’t overspend the value of the loot they find in order to locate it. Think of it like the SETI formula for the probability of finding intelligent life on other planets. Doing The Math His book has been available now in hardcover on Amazon since Nov. 2024 for $47.44. But it’s the time and energy spent hunting for the Collins-Black treasure that will really cost bounty hunters. It wasn’t until 2020 that a treasure hunter managed to solve the hunt and find the Forrest Fenn treasure. During the ten years since Fenn launched it, there were many unsuccessful attempts to find the gold and other prizes. From 2016 to 2020, five people even died in weird accidents while reportedly searching for the Fenn treasure. A treasure hunt of this nature is a lot of fun for the blockchain sector because the way it works is much like the Bitcoin core protocol that secures money on the network and manages transaction orders. In order to harness the cost of electricity to the publicly verifiable state of an entire decentralized ledger of accounts, Bitcoin requires BTC mining computers to guess a random number by checking guesses through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Like the treasure hunters, only one will find the correct number and win the Bitcoin reward. But when it does, the miner can use that reward to defray the costs of electricity and usually find a profit left over to keep. Assuming electricity costs of $0.05 per kWh, at the current mining hash rate of $390 terahashes per second—running $8.66 of electricity through a Bitcoin miner will produce an average mining revenue of $22.48, according to CoinWarz data accessed on Tuesday, Dec. 3. That’s a 59% marginal return on investment for each unit of electricity applied.

37378500,https://invezz.com/?p=2378566,1733658772,Ethereum price analysis: does ETH has more upside?,"Ethereum price held steady at the crucial resistance level at $4,000 as the sentiment in the crypto industry improved. ETH, the second-biggest crypto in the industry, was trading at $3,985 as traders remained optimistic. Ethereum price technical analysis The weekly chart shows that the ETH price has done well in the past few weeks. It has rallied in the last three consecutive weeks and is now sitting at its highest level since March this year. Ethereum has failed to move above this level three times since March this year, meaning that it has formed a triple-top pattern. In most periods, a triple-top is usually a risky pattern that leads to more downside. On the positive side, the coin has remained above the 50-week and the 100-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has also moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since June 2022. Ethereum has also moved above the middle line of the Andrew’s pitchfork tool. Therefore, there are rising odds that it will continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $4,856, which is about 22% above the current level. On the flip side, a drop below the support at $3,700 will invalidate the bullish view. It will be a signal that it may drop to the neckline of the triple-top at $2,000. ETH price chart | Source: TradingView ETH is seeing strong demand There are a few reasons why the ETH price may continue doing well in the near term. First, there are signs that it is seeing strong institutional demand. Data by SoSoValue shows that the cumulative total inflows in its spot ETFs has jumped to over $1.41 billion. It has had positive inflows in each day since November 2022, with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) seeing the most purchases. It now has over $5.9 billion in assets under management. The other big Ethereum funds are from companies like Grayscale, Fidelity, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton. The other potential catalyst for Ethereum price is that we are now in the altcoin season. Data shows that the altcoin season index has jumped to over 80, meaning that most altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the crypto fear and greed index has moved to the extreme greed zone, meaing that investors have embraced a risk-on sentiment. Again, Ethereum and other altcoins usually do well when there is greed in the market. Ethereum has strong fundamentals. It is the biggest chain for developers in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) industry, with over $78 billion in total value locked. Ethereum has the most stablecoins, totaling at over $106 billion. This is an important thing since stablecoins are some of the most crucial assets in the crypto industry. Further, it is the most active chain in the DEX industry. It handled DEX transactions worth over $24 billion in the last 7 days. Its DEX networks have over $12 billion in assets.

He continued: “ As this case shows, phishing and hacking have become increasingly sophisticated and can result in enormous losses. If something about the text or email you received or the website you’re viewing seems off, it probably is .” DDID networks protect against identity theft and data leaks Over 100 countries use national IDs, and many countries are exploring to operate decentralized digital identity (DDID) networks. Because identity impacts virtually every aspect of one’s life, from using online services, attending school, opening a financial account, voting in elections, obtaining medical services, buying property, securing employment, and getting concert/airline tickets. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum ( ETH ), at the Devcon 2024 event in Bangkok, pointed out that DDID networks are key to the global economy which is tokenizing, with “Ethereum [becoming] the world computer, an incredibly large and diverse on-chain economy, and an incredibly large and diverse global community…all at once.” Digital identity is one of the world’s most significant technology trends, with the total addressable market for reusable identity in 2026 estimated to be somewhere between $133B and $533B globally. Governments worldwide recognize the strategic advantages of transitioning from traditional physical identification to more adaptable digital ID systems that include reusable identity designed to keep data under the control of its owner, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and preventing identity theft. These systems allow individuals to securely control their personal data, storing it in a digital wallet on their own device and only sharing specific information with verified entities when needed, thus eliminating a central point of vulnerability where hackers could steal large amounts of data. As more governments adopt DDID networks, traditional document-based identity verification that is subject to identity theft and data leaks will move toward obsolescence.

Launched last year by China’s official identity management authority, RealDID is a national-level blockchain-based decentralized identifier system built by China’s state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN)’s Red Date Technology, which is a decentralized cloud infrastructure company. Source: Red Date Technology The RealDID system, which uses real-name verification for cryptographic keys for both online and offline interactions while ensuring zero personal identifiable information exposure, allows Hong Kong residents to enter Mainland China and Chinese residents to enter China without providing physical entry documents. RealIDID system is expected to issue 5 million IDs through 2024. “China RealDID represents a monumental shift in how government-issued digital identity is managed, and we are proud to lead its first application trials outside Mainland China,” said Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology. As he continued: “ This milestone lays a solid foundation for anonymous identity authentication and verification across two shores, reflecting the international potential of Chinese blockchain technology to safeguard user privacy without compromising compliance. ” Tim Bailey, the vice president of global business and operations for Red Date Technology, explained to me in an interview: “ China RealDIDs can be used across different platforms and services, enabling seamless identity verification across borders. Currently, China RealDID presents the only practical and cost-effective approach to achieving privacy-preserving identity authentication and verification, which can be a blueprint for worldwide adoption, where each country builds its own national DID system, fostering both domestic and cross-border anonymous identity data exchange .” Track #2 Anonymous registration on a regulated stablecoin wallet app and Track #3 Purchase of token-based financial products with built-in tax compliance were run by blockchain firms Flare, IDA, and Red Date Technology. Source: Red Date Technology Source: Red Date Technology Tim Bailey said: “These two use cases demonstrated the China RealDID system’s ability to verify identities across borders while maintaining anonymity in know your customer and tax compliance processes. Users could sign up for regulated stablecoin apps and purchase tokenized financial products, with identity verification through China’s RealDID platform, and without submitting passport or ID document information.” “The trial showed we can blend compliance with privacy,” said Hugo Philion, CEO of Flare Labs. “We are excited to lead the way in bringing decentralized solutions to new markets, particularly China , where the potential is unmatched.” Track #4: Anonymous “Travel Rule” compliance between financial institutions. Source: Red Date Technology Through RealDID the Travel Rule compliance between financial institutions for anonymous stablecoin transfers was implemented.” Tim added: “ These four trials each tackled a real-world scenario in privacy and identity verification using China RealDID. It demonstrated how a Chinese visitor to Hong Kong, by using their China RealDID instead of a physical travel permit, was able to leverage this encrypted identity—represented by a random string of numbers—to enter Hong Kong and complete KYC, tax compliance procedures for regulated digital asset financial services. During these four trials, the Chinese visitor’s identity remained fully anonymous and was protected against any data leaks or hackers, with only designated government authorities able to link the visitor’s DID to his or her real identity after going through legal due process. ” Read more: The inevitable future of the global financial system is tokenization | Opinion",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/decentralized-identifier-systems-are-key-to-the-future/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37376281.jpeg

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/shiba-loves-trump-shibtrump-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Here's the Latest Information,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by outgoing Chairman Gary Gensler, is reportedly preparing to reject multiple applications for Solana spot ETFs, potentially deferring their approval to the incoming administration under President-elect Donald Trump. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that at least two of the five potential issuers have been notified of the SEC’s potential rejection. Sources suggest the regulator is unwilling to approve any new cryptocurrency ETFs in the final months of the Biden administration. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas called Gensler’s stance a “parting gift” to the crypto industry. Another Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, James Seyffart, echoed that view, pointing to the SEC’s continued classification of Solana as a security or a securities offering as a significant hurdle. “If I were Gensler, I wouldn’t accept any of this. I would leave it to the next executive to sort out this mess,” he said. Despite regulatory uncertainty, institutional interest in Solana ETFs is growing, with major firms including Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital filing applications. Solana’s appeal stems from its high-speed and scalable blockchain, which should lead to significant user activity and ecosystem growth through 2024. Eliezer Ndinga, 21.co’s chief strategy officer, highlighted Solana’s growing institutional momentum: “Solana is sending a message that the smart money is coming this way.” SOL is up 160% year-to-date, further solidifying its position as a rising star in the crypto space. Looking ahead, analysts are predicting a significant shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation under President-elect Trump. New SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, a known advocate of digital asset innovation, is expected to bring a more cohesive stance to the agency. Related News: Binance Labs May Have Sold These Two Tokens After Altcoin Market Rise Trump’s pro-crypto regulatory team, which includes Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, points to a potential green light for crypto-focused financial products. Analysts like Seyffart believe that Solana ETF approval is a matter of “when, not if” under the new administration. Gary Gensler’s term as SEC Chairman ends on Jan. 20, and crypto market participants will be closely watching how the new administration handles the Solana ETF applications. Bloomberg’s Balchunas expects issuers to refile under Paul Atkins’ leadership if Gensler blocks approvals before he leaves office. *This is not investment advice.

37378321,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318010,1733657508,Telegram CEO Pavel Durov Questioned in Paris Over Alleged Role in Illegal Activities,"Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, reportedly appeared in a Paris court on December 6 for his first formal questioning related to allegations that the messaging platform facilitated criminal activities. The session, held at 10 a.m. CET, saw Durov accompanied by his lawyers, David-Olivier Kaminski and Christophe Ingrain, according to an anonymous source cited by Agence France-Presse (AFP) . The inquiry focused on claims that Telegram was used to conduct illicit transactions. Durov Could Face Up to 10 Years in Prison Durov’s legal troubles began on August 24, when he was briefly detained at Le Bourget Airport in Paris. He was released after posting a $6 million bail but remains barred from leaving France until March 2025. French prosecutors officially filed preliminary charges against him on August 28, accusing Telegram of serving as a platform for illegal activities. If convicted, Durov could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of €500,000 ($550,000). The Paris prosecutor’s office (Parquet de Paris) stated that the investigation into Telegram began in February 2024. It escalated to a formal judicial inquiry in July, weeks before Durov’s arrest. Telegram founder Pavel Durov was questioned for the first time on the merits in a Paris court as part of the case against him, (via France Presse) Durov said that he ""trusts the French justice system,"" but did not comment further on the progress of the case or the charges… pic.twitter.com/49irRwNGKL — Vatnik Lobo (@LordDracula91) December 7, 2024 In another development, sources told The Wall Street Journal that Durov’s phone was reportedly hacked in 2017, a year before his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. The case has sparked concerns within the tech and cryptocurrency communities. Telegram’s Crypto Holdings Surge to $1.3 Billion Telegram has emerged as a major player in the cryptocurrency market, with its crypto holdings skyrocketing to $1.3 billion in the first half of 2024 from $400 million at the end of 2023. As reported, the company’s gains in crypto holdings, revenue from Toncoin sales, and a terminated exclusivity deal with Toncoin have significantly bolstered its finances. According to the disclosures, the platform’s cryptocurrency holdings tripled in value during the first half of 2024, reaching $1.3 billion. This growth is majorly attributed to Telegram selling $353 million worth of digital assets in the first six months of 2024. The company further monetized Toncoin by securing a $225 million exclusivity deal that made the cryptocurrency the sole method for small businesses to purchase ads on its platform. In October, Telegram revealed that it is set to establish a local office in Kazakhstan. The decision, announced by the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations, and Aerospace Industry, came amid efforts to improve communication with local authorities and manage platform content more effectively. Minister Zhaslan Madiyev said that Telegram’s physical presence in Kazakhstan would be an “important step to increase control” and oversight of content on the platform. Since Durov’s arrest, Telegram has implemented several measures to address these concerns, including sharing user information , such as IP addresses and phone numbers, with authorities when necessary. The platform has also made significant updates to its search engine, removing problematic content and using artificial intelligence to detect and block illicit material.

Regulatory developments included Trump's pro-crypto appointments and the Czech Republic's tax reforms, alongside major business moves like Grayscale's Solana ETF filing and Binance's DeFi push. Bitcoin Bitcoin ($BTC) is currently holding above $95,000 , and its imminent breakout of a short-term triangle could be up or down. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has just bought another $1.5 billion BTC, and the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also chipped in on Monday with $ 4.22 billion in BTC. From a high of over $98,000 on Monday, the $BTC price sank to a low of $93,600 on Tuesday. However, the bulls stepped in and buoyed the price back up to $96,700. Bitcoin broke through the $100,000 psychological barrier on December 5, allowing it to achieve a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. According to blockchain firm Arkham Intelligence, the United States government has moved $1.9 billion worth of seized Bitcoin (BTC) to Coinbase Prime. Altcoins Amid the highly volatile crypto landscape that includes Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), a new Ethereum DeFi coin stands out with its advanced hybrid trading platform, providing an ideal blend of decentralized and centralized exchange features. A new Ethereum-based token, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), is capturing attention, with analysts predicting it could follow Bitcoin's parabolic trajectory in the coming years. With its revolutionary innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain Protocol AI is working on combining blockchain and AI. 22-year-old internet sensation known for her viral ""Hawk Tuah"" TikTok video, Haliey Welch, is facing criticism after her memecoin $HAWK crashed 91% post-launch amid allegations of insider trading and poor management. Business Joining a competitive race amid Solana’s significant market growth, Grayscale Investments has filed with the SEC to convert its Solana Trust into a spot ETF on NYSE Arca. Web3 Backed, Chainlink, Sonic, and Fortlake Asset Management announced a partnership to tokenize Fortlake's Sigma Opportunities Fund, marking a significant milestone in taking traditional financial assets to the blockchain. Binance is making a bold move into decentralized finance (DeFi) with the launch of its On-Chain Yields program , set to debut on December 9. Camino Network is joining forces with e-money provider Monerium to advance on-chain payments in the travel industry by bringing Monerium and its popular EURe, the on-chain euro, to the Camino Network, allowing users to execute transactions for travel businesses. The EOS blockchain has taken a significant step toward building institutional engagement by partnering with Ceffu, the institutional custody arm of Binance. Regulation The Czech Republic is working on advancing legislation to simplify crypto tax obligations and abolish capital gains tax on Bitcoin (BTC) held for at least three years starting in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump has picked former PayPal COO David Sacks as his White House AI and Crypto Czar, which is a significant step towards overhauling US policy towards crypto. President-elect Trump has appointed Paul Atkins as SEC Chair in a likely shift toward clearer and more crypto-friendly regulatory policies, contrasting sharply with Gary Gensler's enforcement-driven tenure.

However, venture capitalist Felix Hartmann, managing partner at Hartmann Capital, has suggested that the current rally may be short-lived. “Considering alt season tapped out for now,” he wrote in a December 7 post on X . Institutional Investors and Project Teams Continue to Take Profits He highlighted increasing profit-taking by institutional investors and project teams as a potential turning point for the market. Hartmann explained that funding rates for most altcoins are now exceeding 100% annualized, with recent price surges driven largely by perpetual traders amid dwindling spot volumes. “Traders may stay irrational, but we are at the point where teams and VCs start clipping more aggressively.” He warned that when momentum shifts, the market could witness dramatic sell-offs, or “murder wicks,” causing sharp price declines.

Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Hedera (HBAR) surged 99.31%, IOTA gained 79.61%, and JasmyCoin (JASMY) climbed 72.47%. However, Hartmann’s concerns echo past cycles where rapid gains were followed by steep corrections, as seen with Solana and XRP in late 2021. Not all traders share Hartmann’s bearish outlook. Pseudonymous trader MilkyBull Crypto suggested that the altcoin season may last until March, describing the recent rally as only the beginning. Another trader, Sensei, expressed similar optimism to his 72,900 X followers, claiming, “Altseason has just started.” Bitcoin dominance, a key metric for gauging altcoin season, has dropped 7.88% over the past month to 55.11% , according to TradingView. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data shows that funding rates for perpetual futures are rising, with bulls paying 4%–6% monthly to maintain leveraged positions. What is Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s historic surge past the $100,000 milestone has captivated the cryptocurrency market, but Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at YouHodler, remains cautious. In a recent statement shared with Cryptonews.com, Gorev predicted that the price may see only moderate growth beyond this level before a significant correction takes hold. “The cryptocurrency market is very fond of round numbers, and the price often unfolds in such cases.” “Also note that monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual futures and options contracts are expected to expire in two weeks,” he added. Gorev emphasized that Bitcoin’s price dynamics are influenced by key market cycles, including the expiration of futures and options contracts. With monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual contracts set to expire in two weeks, traders should brace for heightened volatility. Adding to this cautious outlook, Gorev highlighted Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 index, which is approaching what he describes as the “overheating phase.” As the broader financial market shows signs of strain, the likelihood of Bitcoin experiencing a significant price correction increases. Divergences in price charts and a rising USD exchange rate further support this view, indicating that the current rally may be running out of momentum. “The price increase may still continue, but not significantly,” he concluded.

Known for her strong stance against cryptocurrencies, Crenshaw’s potential reappointment has drawn criticism from prominent voices in the crypto industry. Crenshaw, who has served as an SEC commissioner since August 2020, has been a vocal opponent of crypto-related developments. Crenshaw Opposed the Approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs She was one of two commissioners who opposed the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024. Following the decision to greenlight these ETFs, Crenshaw described the move as “unsound and ahistorical.” Critics within the crypto community have been vocal about their dissatisfaction. Emilie Choi, President and COO of Coinbase, labeled Crenshaw as “anti-crypto” in a December 7 post on X, citing her resistance to Bitcoin ETFs. Caroline Crenshaw is anti-crypto.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart also weighed in, stating Crenshaw is even more “vehemently anti-crypto” than SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Seyffart highlighted Crenshaw’s dissenting letter on Bitcoin ETFs, noting that another opposing commissioner, Jaime Lizárraga, did not endorse her stance. “Just read through her dissent letter on the Bitcoin ETF approvals back in January (The other dem commissioner, Lizárraga, didn’t even join her on that letter),” he said.

Trump Elects Pro-Crypto Paul Atkins as Next SEC Chair As Cryptonews reported earlier , President-elect Donald Trump is considering selecting Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Atkins, who previously served under SEC chairs Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt, is “crypto savvy” and has a “deep understanding of the inner workings of the agency.” Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, has regularly vowed to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework upon returning to the Oval Office. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. A coalition of seven U.S. states has come together to challenge the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation of cryptocurrency. The states have filed an amicus brief, led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, arguing that the SEC’s attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies constitutes a “power grab” that would stifle innovation, harm the crypto industry, and exceed the agency’s authority. The coalition includes Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, with Oklahoma becoming the latest state to join. Meanwhile, last week, the SEC filed a lawsuit against investment firm Touzi Capital, accusing it of defrauding investors and misrepresenting the liquidity and profitability of its crypto asset mining fund.

As Bitcoin hits new highs, its ownership dynamics have shifted, largely due to regulatory changes, depicting a diverse range of stakeholders, from early miners to major companies and individuals. At the moment, Bitcoin boasts a market cap of $1.97 trillion, with 19.79 million BTC already in circulation—nearing the maximum supply of 21 million, pointing to the digital asset’s growing scarcity.

This interest and optimism, stemming from Donald Trump’s re-election and the anticipated rollout of crypto-friendly policies, propelled Bitcoin to its current six-figure valuation. Once Trump officially resumes office, the market will focus on potential changes to the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings. Trump has vowed to spearhead the inclusion of Bitcoin as part of the strategic reserve. This potential shift could involve a commitment to retaining, rather than selling, the Bitcoin currently held by government authorities. Looking ahead, analysts believe institutional investors are likely to help sustain Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. In this regard, Finbold reported that Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin hitting $200,000 by 2025, driven by institutional demand. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was battling resistance at the $100,000 level, trading at $99,009—a 0.7% decline in the last 24 hours. However, in the weekly timeframe, BTC is up 4.7%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding its next price movement, prominent cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe offered a mixed outlook in a December 7 X post . On the bullish side, Poppe noted that Bitcoin’s uptrend remains intact. If it successfully breaks through the $102,000 resistance, the next target is a new high of $110,000. However, investors need to be cautious, as losing the current uptrend could trigger a major Bitcoin price correction. As per the analyst, such a correction has the potential to impact the broader crypto market and trigger an altcoin rally. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s outlook remains bullish, particularly with the asset trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ). However, attention should remain on its interaction with the long-term support level at $95,000. A drop below this spot could spell trouble for the digital asset.

Crenshaw, who has been a prominent skeptic of cryptocurrency, has faced backlash from key players in the digital asset industry. Notably, Crenshaw was one of two commissioners who opposed the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. Her stance has drawn sharp criticism from industry leaders. Coinbase president and COO Emilie Choi voiced her frustration on December 7, stating, “Caroline Crenshaw is anti-crypto. She even embarrassingly opposed Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC has to change.” Alexander Grieve, VP of government affairs at crypto investment firm Paradigm, accused Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown of forcing through Crenshaw’s renomination. He described it as “one last gift for crypto on the way out the door.” A History of Opposition to Bitcoin ETFs Crenshaw’s dissent against Bitcoin ETFs has become a focal point for her critics. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted her vehement opposition, noting that even Jaime Lizárraga, another dissenting commissioner, did not align with her on the matter. Seyffart pointed to Crenshaw’s January dissent letter, describing her arguments as more extreme than those of outgoing SEC chair Gary Gensler. Crenshaw’s criticism of the SEC’s decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs in January reflected her belief that the move was “unsound and ahistorical.” Her stance has fueled concerns within the crypto industry about the potential implications of her renomination for the future of digital asset regulation. WSPN CEO Austin Campbell went further, accusing Crenshaw of undermining the rule of law. He referenced her decision to oppose BTC ETFs even after a federal court ordered their approval. Campbell reminded Democrats of her controversial vote, emphasizing its legal and ethical implications. A Shift in SEC Leadership Looms The renomination debate comes amid broader changes at the SEC. Current SEC chair Gary Gensler, another polarizing figure in the crypto space, will step down on Jan. 20, 2025. His anticipated replacement, Paul Atkins, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump , has been received positively by crypto advocates. While Crenshaw’s potential renomination signals continuity in the SEC’s hardline stance on crypto, the industry hopes that new leadership will usher in more balanced regulatory approaches. The upcoming vote will be a key indicator of the direction the SEC might take in its oversight of digital assets.

37375147,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624515,1733656081,Fed decides to go ahead with December rate cut – but it’s not actually good news,"The Federal Reserve will almost certainly slash interest rates at its December meeting. Friday’s jobs report sealed the deal, offering the Fed enough breathing room to act without looking reckless. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 227,000 in November, blowing past expectations, while unemployment inched up to 4.2%. Markets barely blinked, with CME Group now pricing in a 90% likelihood of a cut. But here’s the thing: this isn’t the good news it might seem. Critics are already piling on, accusing the Fed of setting the stage for risky speculation. Inflation is still alive and kicking, wages are climbing, and some say financial conditions have become too loose. Meanwhile, the central bank faces tough questions about just how far it can push without throwing the economy off balance. Why the timing looks shaky Economists are split, and the skeptics are loud. Chris Rupkey, an economist, argued the Fed doesn’t need to meddle, especially when jobs are plentiful. He called the central bank’s strategy “increasingly unwise” and warned that inflation hasn’t been tamed. The numbers back him up. Core inflation , measured by the Fed’s favorite yardstick, ticked up to 2.8% in October. That’s far above the Fed’s 2% target. Wage growth isn’t helping either. At 4%, it’s significantly higher than pre-pandemic norms. Jason Furman, a former Obama administration economist, isn’t buying the Fed’s optimism either. He pointed out that the pace of wage growth aligns more with 3.5% inflation, not the 2% the Fed wants. “This is another data point in the no-landing scenario,” Furman said. He predicts more rate cuts will follow, but only after unemployment climbs further. Financial conditions are looser than they look Fed officials like to call their 4.5%-4.75% interest rate “restrictive,” but financial conditions tell a different story. Stocks are up, bond yields are down, and mortgage rates have dipped. By the Fed’s own metrics, financial conditions are now at their loosest since January. This raises a crucial question: Is the Fed cutting rates in an already loose environment, and if so, what happens next? Jerome Powell , the Fed’s chair, has been bullish on the U.S. economy. He recently called it “the envy of the developed world,” suggesting there’s enough cushion to recalibrate policy slowly. But not everyone on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) shares his enthusiasm. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack wants to pump the brakes. Speaking Friday, she said she needs more evidence that inflation is heading toward the Fed’s 2% goal. Hammack has been vocal about slowing the pace of rate cuts, and her comments suggest the Fed might pause after December. If the December cut goes through, it will mark a full percentage point drop since September. That’s a lot of easing in a short time. Hammack believes the Fed is approaching the so-called neutral rate—the level that neither boosts nor restricts economic growth . She thinks it’s time to reassess. “It makes sense to slow the pace of rate reductions,” she said. The clock is ticking. Once these numbers are in, the Fed enters a quiet period, meaning no policy addresses until the meeting concludes.

The Dombivli resident fell for the scam after the high-yield return on investment promised by the criminals enticed him. According to reports, the 33-year-old Indian native of Thane district subsequently reported to the police upon realizing that he had been scammed. Reports said the Indian national, whose identity remains undisclosed, was contacted via his mobile phone. The other phone number was an international number posing as a representative of a lucrative crypto investment company. The police said that the caller spent time convincing the man to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets, promising high-yield returns in a short time. Indian man falls for fake crypto investment scheme According to reports, the first contact was initiated days earlier before the man started to transfer money to the caller. He began transferring funds on November 8, and the criminal continued to influence him to make more investments before he stopped on December 3. While he trusted the criminal’s assurances, he sent funds totaling over $25,000 in local currency during the period. Things turned sour when the victim wanted to take out his earnings. According to sources, the representative stopped picking up his phone calls and stopped giving him updates on his investments after he signified his intention. Following the disappointment, the victim has since reported to the police, who have formally acknowledged his complaint. His complaint has been registered under the Information Technology Act, the regulation that covers these sorts of criminal offenses. Although the police are yet to give any major update on the issue, an official noted that investigations are already underway. He mentioned that moves are being made to track the international number to determine its origin. This would lead the police to identify the individuals or group associated with the criminal activities. Meanwhile, the official is confident that the case will be wrapped up, and that the victim will recover his funds. The surge in crypto investment scams in the industry According to sources, the police have always warned the general public on the need for caution before making investments. The authorities have urged the people to verify the legitimacy of any platform before sending funds to invest in products. India has also seen its share of increased crypto frauds , with criminals exploiting the lack of regulation to carry out their evil acts. Sources mentioned that the victims are always contacted using phishing emails, fake high yield platforms, and cold calls. This case also showcases the growing trend of criminal activities in the wider crypto industry. While the crypto sector promises innovation in the financial landscape, the activities of these bad actors are some of the few things disrupting wide-range adoption. For example, in this case, unsuspecting users are lured with the promise of high yields . In the spirit of not wanting to miss out on profits, most will invest without background checks, leading to them being scammed. Meanwhile, the police have urged residents to be cautious and stay vigilant. Residents are also asked to report all suspicious activities, messages, emails, and phone calls they may see. They also advised residents to see people with knowledge in the financial investment landscape, as they will guide them to make the right choices. While the police continue investigating the case, the officials noted that further details will be communicated soon.

This price rally follows an unprecedented surge in Ethereum Spot ETF inflows, which hit a record $428 million on December 5 as investors continue to anticipate crypto-positive regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. Related Reading: Dogecoin Days At The Top Numbered? Cardano Set To Take Over — Analyst Interestingly, this bullish momentum has seen the Ethereum price play out an interesting motion on its price chart. Particularly, Ethereum has broken above a massive triangle on the weekly timeframe chart, which points to an incoming price rally. $10,000 Target In Sight As Bull Run Builds Up Steam According to technical analysis posted on social media platform X by crypto analyst Captain Faibik, the recent Ethereum price rally has seen the cryptocurrency breaking out of the upper trendline of a triangle formation. This breakout is particularly significant, as it is out of a triangular formation that has been in play for three years. As shown by the ETHUSDT weekly timeframe chart below, the triangular pattern has been in play since the Ethereum price reached its current all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021. This pattern has been highlighted by a series of lower highs and higher lows, which have seen the Ethereum price trading in an increasingly tightening range. However, in light of the recent breakout to the upper end, Captain Faibik declared that Ethereum’s long-anticipated 2024-2025 bull run has “officially started.” In terms of a price target, the analyst highlighted a run towards $10,000, which would see the Ethereum price breaking into new all-time highs. On-Chain Data Points To New All-Time High The bullish momentum for Ethereum is supported by strong on-chain metrics, particularly a notable rise in large transactions. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the volume of transactions worth $100,000 or more has increased by over 300% in the past week, reaching a cummulative $86.15 billion in the past seven days and $17.15 billion in the last 24 hours. This surge in high-value transactions indicates growing participation from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, further bolstering Ethereum’s price outlook to $10,000. Additionally, Ethereum’s profitability metrics highlight favorable conditions for further growth. As crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out, there is nothing preventing the Ethereum price from reaching new all-time highs. As it stands, the only minor resistance level ahead is at $4,540. Regardless, with the $3,560 demand zone acting as a strong support level, Ethereum’s trajectory appears firmly tilted toward the bulls.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK.

The total value of the digital asset market rose by almost 9% to $2.54 trillion in October. Bitcoin ETPs saw their Assets Under Management (AUM) increase to $83.2 billion, while Ethereum ETPs rose by 1.4% to $10.3 billion. ETPs' AUM has risen by 102.9% year-on-year, outpacing the underlying cryptocurrency growth. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a type of ETP with stricter regulations, made the most notable contribution to this result. They have accumulated net inflows of more than $24 billion since launching in January 2024. The perpetual appeal of exchange-traded products Spot Bitcoin ETFs purport improved liquidity and price efficiency for investors, as well as more convenient access to the flagship crypto compared to other means of trading in spot markets. Bitcoin holdings are also an opportunity to diversify portfolios due to Bitcoin's spectacular rise, having recently broken past $100,000. The fees are also much lower. Expense ratios on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Bitcoin futures ETFs ranged from 0.95% to 2%, in addition to expenses generated from replacing expiring futures contracts. By comparison, the fees for the spot Bitcoin ETFs were 0.2-0.5% at launch. Grayscale's converted Bitcoin ETF was the costliest at 1.5% but still lower than non-ETP alternatives. After significant regulatory hurdles, the SEC approved Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. Grayscale is a prominent player who spent years growing a trust holding ether worth more than $9 billion. That trust was converted to an ether ETF in July 2024. The next evolution of crypto investment products Solana is emerging as the next iteration in niche investment products. Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Canary Capital, and 21shares have all announced plans to launch spot Solana ETFs. However, Solana ETFs won't launch this year in all likelihood, with hopes deferring to 2025. The US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed to at least two candidates that their applications would be rejected. Its crypto-unfriendly chairman, Gary Gensler, is likely to step down after Donald Trump takes office. ""Grayscale's recent application to convert its Solana Trust into an ETF could signal the next major evolution in crypto investment products,"" confirms Iliya Kalchev, Nexo Dispatch Analyst. ""As the market buzzes with speculation on which asset might follow Bitcoin and Ethereum into the ETF spotlight, Solana emerges as a uniquely compelling contender. Solana's burgeoning popularity makes it a natural candidate for such a transition. Known for its high-speed, low-cost transactions and vibrant ecosystem, Solana has fostered a vast, passionate community that's driving real-world adoption."" What's going to be different once Solana ETFs launch? Bitcoin ETFs have a combined AUM of over $49 billion , with ether ETFs lagging behind ($7.3 billion). This disparity reflects Bitcoin's more extended history in the ETF space, broader institutional acceptance, and its status as a ""store of value"" compared to Ethereum. Despite the gap, Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction, particularly following the 2024 launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, which allow direct tracking of ether's price. Leading products include the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, with over $4.86 billion in AUM. What would the prospects of Solana ETFs be once the SEC approves them? Solana's price hit an all-time high of $262 on November 22, but experts believe this is just the beginning. The world's fourth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap reached this record just three years after breaking its previous one, leading UK bank Standard Chartered to predict it would approach $700 by the end of 2025. The optimistic predictions come against the backdrop of bullish macroeconomic factors. Solana handled transactions worth over $40 billion in mid-November after a weekly record of $17.5 billion in March. It's not only high speed and efficiency fueling the surge. Soaring interest in memecoins should definitely not be underestimated. The number of active Solana users has risen by over 1,500% since January, with new daily addresses increasing elevenfold over the same period. Beyond riding the coattails of crypto ETFs' historical successes, a Solana ETF could bring additional momentum as the go-to blockchain for memecoin projects, as Mr. Kalchev is quick to point out: ""Solana's community has carved out an entirely new niche within the ecosystem: the memecoin hype. Unlike other blockchains, where memecoins are often seen as fringe projects, Solana has cultivated an environment where these playful assets thrive. This trend has not only spurred increased activity on the network but has arguably turned memecoins into an asset class of their own, representing the hottest phenomenon in crypto after Bitcoin itself."" The question practically begs itself: ""Could it be memecoins that have propelled Solana into the ETF conversation? Arguably so. And if Grayscale's application is approved, it could provide a fresh, accessible gateway for institutional and retail investors to tap into Solana's growing ecosystem and, by extension, the broader crypto market. It's the most inclusive market cycle we've ever seen."" A Solana ETF would gauge market sentiment and blockchain innovation Solana ETFs would be unique in their ability to measure sentiment and innovation simultaneously. ""A Solana ETF would serve as a twofold barometer: one that measures investor sentiment towards crypto at large, and another that gauges interest in Solana as a cornerstone of blockchain innovation. From the memecoin mania to its broader appeal as a fast, scalable blockchain, Solana encapsulates the spirit of the current market cycle,"" Mr. Kalchev concludes.

From payments to smart contracts, blockchain tech is bringing efficiency, transparency, and innovation to industries worldwide. If you’re eyeing the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, it’s all about projects that solve real-world problems. Enter Qubetics , Cronos, and Internet Computer Protocol. These three are doing more than just riding the crypto wave—they’re making waves in how companies manage assets, payments, and data. Let’s unpack how Qubetics is revolutionizing supply chain logistics, while Cronos and ICP offer unique advantages in their own right. Qubetics ($TICS): Streamlining Payments and Logistics Supply chains are the backbone of global trade, but they’re notoriously messy—think delayed payments, lost shipments, and complex international transactions. Qubetics is stepping in to clean up the mess with its No KYC, non-custodial, multi-chain wallet . Designed for simplicity and security, this wallet is perfect for businesses that want to embrace crypto without the usual headaches. Imagine you’re running an e-commerce company. Your suppliers are overseas, and they want payment in crypto. Qubetics’ smart contract conversion automatically turns crypto into fiat at the point of sale , protecting both parties from market volatility. No more worrying about fluctuating Bitcoin prices eating into your profits. The wallet also integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making it incredibly easy to use. Whether you’re handling payments on an iPhone, Android, or desktop, Qubetics ensures transactions are as smooth as butter. It’s like PayPal for crypto—but better, because there’s no middleman taking a cut. Here’s why now is the time to invest: Qubetics is in Presale Phase 11, with 1 $TICS token priced at $0.0282. Over $4.8M has been raised, with 280M tokens sold to 7,200+ holders. With a 10% price increase every week and a final phase hike of 20%, early investors could see a jaw-dropping 900% ROI post-launch. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Qubetics is a no-brainer for both businesses and individual investors. Cronos (CRO): Building the Blockchain Ecosystem Cronos, the blockchain platform backed by Crypto.com, is all about creating an ecosystem that supports DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions. While it’s best known for powering Crypto.com’s payment system, Cronos has been making big moves in supply chain management, too. What sets Cronos apart? Its interoperability. Cronos is built on the Cosmos SDK, allowing it to communicate seamlessly with other blockchains. This is a game-changer for supply chains, where different systems often need to exchange data. Imagine tracking a shipment from factory to warehouse to retail store—all powered by Cronos’ decentralized infrastructure. Cronos also shines in the DeFi space, offering low fees and fast transaction speeds. Businesses can use CRO to settle payments, stake tokens, or even participate in decentralized insurance pools. And with Crypto.com’s massive marketing push, Cronos is quickly gaining traction as a top-tier blockchain platform. Price-wise, CRO has been holding strong, with analysts predicting steady growth as adoption increases. If you’re looking for a crypto that combines enterprise readiness with retail appeal, Cronos is easily one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): Decentralizing the Internet The Internet Computer Protocol is like the rebel of the crypto world, aiming to decentralize the internet itself. While traditional supply chains rely on centralized systems that can be slow and costly, ICP offers a decentralized alternative that’s faster, cheaper, and more secure. How does it work? ICP allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that run directly on the blockchain, eliminating the need for traditional cloud services. For supply chains, this means better data transparency and fewer middlemen. Imagine tracking inventory in real-time or verifying supplier contracts without needing a third-party service. One of ICP’s latest upgrades focuses on scalability, making it more appealing for large enterprises. Its network can handle massive amounts of data, making it ideal for industries like logistics and manufacturing. Whether it’s tracking goods or ensuring compliance, ICP is showing that blockchain can handle the heavy lifting. While ICP’s price has been somewhat volatile, its long-term potential is undeniable. As more companies look to decentralize their operations, ICP is well-positioned to become a key player.

The crypto veteran tells his 312,000 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the inauguration day of President-elect Donald Trump will be a sell-on-news event. But Burniske clarifies that his expected correction on January 20th will likely not mark the end of the crypto bull market. “Dream the post-election dream now, shakedown after. Inauguration makes most sense as reality can never match the dream. But that shakedown won’t be the end, though it will scare paper hands into believing it is.” In November of 2022 just as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto were carving a cycle bottom, Burniske predicted that the total market cap of digital assets would soar to $10 trillion this cycle. But now, the investor says that his massive price target will likely not be hit, at least in this cycle. “People won’t like me saying this, but if $10 trillion is the round number target, then we likely fall short of it this cycle. It was a good rallying cry from a capitulation bottom and will prove directionally correct this cycle, only to be exceeded with time. That said, as we enter a period of increasing frenzy, where dreams grow larger by the day, and bull market geniuses abound, it’s important to be realistic. For example, $100,000 and $10,000 calls for BTC and ETH were everywhere in 2021, and we capped out at ~$70,000 and ~$5,000 respectively back then, with BTC only now reaching that target – lesson in there… Sure HODL (hold on for dear life) some coin forever, but also take profits in frenzies and live your life. Time is more precious than even BTC . Never aim for perfection, or you’ll always miss.” At time of writing the total crypto market cap stands at $3.865 trillion.

The milestone not only cements Pepe’s place among the top-tier tokens but also underscores its growing influence in the memecoin ecosystem. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals a 16.8% surge in PEPE’s value over the past 24 hours, contributing to a 26% gain over the past week. This meteoric rise, which began with a market cap of just $591 million at the start of 2024, represents an extraordinary 18x growth within the year. UNI, by contrast, stands at a market cap of around $10.6 billion, making Pepe’s climb even more significant. Historic Rally to New Heights Pepe, which launched in 2023 as an homage to Matt Furie’s iconic cartoon frog, has no intrinsic value or utility beyond being a speculative asset. Despite its whimsical origins, it has become a major player in the memecoin market , rivaling established names like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Since its inception, PEPE has delivered gains exceeding 7,000%, driven largely by retail interest and speculative trading. The memecoin’s current surge is part of a larger rally that began in September 2024 after months of price stagnation. Pepe recorded a 30% weekly gain in late September, setting the stage for its November breakout. The rally, marked by renewed investor enthusiasm, pushed the token past its previous all-time high before achieving its latest milestone. What Lies Ahead for Pepe? Binance.US played a pivotal role in amplifying PEPE’s momentum by listing the token on December 5, further validating its place in the current market cycle dominated by memecoins. The listing coincides with a broader trend of renewed interest in memecoins, making them one of the defining narratives of the ongoing crypto market revival. While PEPE’s meteoric rise highlights the speculative nature of memecoins, it also raises questions about sustainability. With no inherent utility, the token’s future remains tied to market sentiment and speculative fervor. Nevertheless, surpassing Uniswap’s UNI in market cap underscores how rapidly shifting investor priorities can disrupt even the most established players in the crypto space.

37382267,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104242,1733652303,Researcher Explains How High-Priced XRP Could Bring Significant Benefits to Ripple and the Broader Ecosystem,"A recent tweet from digital asset researcher Anderson suggests that a high-priced XRP could have wide-reaching advantages for Ripple and the overall XRP ecosystem. Anderson outlined several key areas where a surge in XRP’s price could be transformative. First, he noted that a higher price for XRP would attract more attention to the cryptocurrency. As people discuss its rise, follow headlines and research top-performing assets, more individuals will learn about XRP, potentially leading to increased interest from investors and developers.Attracting Builders to the XRPL EcosystemFurthermore, he argued that a surge in XRP's value could also draw more developers and builders to the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Anderson points out that higher prices inspire more innovation and participation, which could drive new projects and services on the ledger.Enhanced Partnership Opportunities for RippleReflecting on the 2017 price surge, Anderson recalls Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's statement that banks began reaching out to Ripple as the value of XRP exploded. For context, in the 2017/2018 market, XRP soared by over 75,000%. Anderson believes a similar price jump today could strengthen Ripple’s standing in the eyes of financial institutions, making it easier to secure new partnerships and enhance the company’s credibility.Moreover, Ripple stands to benefit directly from a higher XRP price due to the substantial amount of XRP it holds. Notably, Ripple holds 42.86 billion in XRP in both escrow and spendable balance. At the current price of XRP, this portfolio is worth over $104.6 billion.In a scenario where XRP’s value expands to $15, the value of Ripple’s holdings will exceed half a trillion dollars. Essentially, as the price increases, Ripple’s financial position strengthens, allowing the company to expand its influence across various markets.Wider Business Adoption of XRPBeyond Ripple’s operations, a higher XRP price could prompt more businesses—both directly and indirectly linked to Ripple—to implement XRP in their services. This wider adoption could further solidify XRP’s position in the market as a utility token for various financial applications.Improved Liquidity and Efficient TransfersMeanwhile, one of the most significant advantages of a high-priced XRP is its impact on liquidity. As liquidity increases, XRP becomes more efficient as a bridge asset for global financial transfers. This particularly benefits Ripple’s payment service, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL, now Ripple Payments).Anderson explained that the spread between buy and sell orders tightens with higher liquidity, making transfers cheaper and more stable.Furthermore, Anderson compared XRP’s liquidity to currency pairs in Forex markets. In highly liquid markets, conversion rates are better for large and small transactions. Similarly, with increased liquidity, XRP’s efficiency as a bridge asset would improve, lowering the cost and volatility of all ODL transfers making it an even more attractive solution for cross-border payments.In conclusion, Anderson emphasizes that a higher-priced XRP could create a ripple effect throughout the crypto and financial industries. It would benefit holders, Ripple, businesses, developers, and users by enhancing liquidity, increasing adoption, and driving new partnerships.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/08/researcher-explains-how-high-priced-xrp-could-bring-significant-benefits-to-ripple-and-the-broader-ecosystem/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=researcher-explains-how-high-priced-xrp-could-bring-significant-benefits-to-ripple-and-the-broader-ecosystem,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The financial foundation will be provided by Creditcoin, the satellite internet access by Spacecoin, decentralized computing by Sui and decentralized storage by Walrus. The alliance hopes that the initiative will help address issues such as unreliable internet access and lack of financial services in some regions of the world. Spacecoin hopes to bring the service to those areas through its upcoming satellite network. According to a recent announcement , Spacecoin aims to launch its first satellite — CTC-0 — on Dec. 21. Spacecoin founder Tae Oh highlighted that this is the first in a long series of anticipated launches aiming to provide 5G coverage worldwide: “The Internet is one of the most crucial modern inventions that has revolutionized every aspect of human life – from how we get our information to how we access finance, education, and healthcare. Yet billions remain disconnected from this promise. At Spacecoin, we are committed to change that and this launch is the first step towards universal internet access.” Creditcoin is a layer one blockchain aiming to connect borrowers and lenders in emerging markets that already powers a service employing the Central Bank of Nigeria’s eNaira digital currency. This service will power the financial services through decentralized financial institutions.

The statements come at a time when digital assets continue to grow steadily, with interest in both cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as stablecoins. The Treasury Department acknowledged in its report that digital assets are growing rapidly, but noted that this growth is coming from a relatively small base. The report said, “Digital assets have witnessed rapid growth, albeit from a small base.” However, according to the report, the market value of cryptocurrencies remains low compared to traditional financial and real assets. According to the Treasury, adoption of digital assets across households and industries is primarily for investment purposes, with speculative interest playing a major role in market expansion. The Treasury Department noted Bitcoin’s evolving role in the financial ecosystem, noting that Bitcoin has emerged as a store of value similar to gold. “Bitcoin’s primary use case appears to be as a store of value, or ‘digital gold,’ in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi),” the report said. Related News: Binance Labs May Have Sold These Two Tokens After Altcoin Market Rise While Bitcoin has garnered attention as a speculative asset, its appeal as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty continues to grow and has been compared to traditional safe-haven assets like gold.

37371170,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27663,1733649600,Telegram Founder Pavel Durov Questioned in Paris Court for First Time,"For the first time, Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, appeared in a Paris court on December 6 in a pivotal moment for a legal case that accuses Telegram of having enabled criminal activities. At 10 am CET, the hearing took place, with Durov present along with his lawyers, David-Olivier Kaminski and Christophe Ingrain. According to a source cited by Agence France-Presse (AFP), the questioning revolved around claims that Telegram was used for illicit transactions. Background of the Case Troubles for Durov started on August 24 when he was arrested at Le Bourget airport in Paris. While he was released with a bail of $6 million, the founder of Telegram has been restricted to France until March 2025. The office of the prosecutor in Paris announced preliminary charges on August 28 against Durov, saying that he had operated a platform that, in some instances, conducted illegal activities. The core of the case is a judicial inquiry launched in July 2024. If convicted, Durov faces a prison sentence of as long as 10 years and a fine of €500,000. The development has spotlighted the tension between regulatory enforcement and the operational scope of privacy-focused platforms like Telegram. Web3 and Privacy Concerns The charges against Durov have sparked a large debate within the Web3 and cryptocurrency communities. Privacy advocates and industry leaders have compared Durov’s situation to that of Alexey Pertsev, a developer of Tornado Cash, who was charged with enabling illicit activities using technology. This raises serious red flags with regards to government overreach and digital privacy,” said Nikolay Denisenko, chief technology officer of Brighty, a financial app. Vyara Savova, senior policy lead at the European Crypto Initiative, also spoke to the risks in targeting developers of privacy-preserving technologies as an uncomfortable trend. The case has raised concerns about an erosion of privacy protections against growing government scrutiny and has been seen to portend potential setbacks for both decentralized and encrypted platforms. Industry Implications In its fight against Durov, the eventual verdict on France’s allegations keeps the attention of the modern tech world. The verdict not only decides the fate of Telegram but might also set the precedent of how privacy-focused platforms should work under governmental policy and regulation frameworks. According to the advocates, it can hamper innovation and work against the very fundamentals that govern Web3 technologies, with a bias toward individual privacy and decentralization. This sets up a tension between privacy and oversight that positions the Web3 industry at a crossroads, with evolving legal and ethical challenges.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/telegram-founder-pavel-durov-questioned-in-paris/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

After struggling to keep pace with other meme coins in recent months, SHIB is now showing signs of a significant breakout. Shiba Inu’s Downtrend Nears an End Technical analyst “The Krypto King” recently announced on X that Shiba Inu’s prolonged downtrend, which began in late 2021, is coming to a close. He emphasized that SHIB is breaking out of its three-year bearish phase, potentially setting the stage for a substantial price surge. According to the analyst’s projections, SHIB could see at least 178% gains, adding approximately $0.00005602 to its market price. If this prediction materializes, SHIB could reach its all-time high of $0.00008645, last seen during its historic bull run. $SHIB Is breaking out of a 4-year downtrend The next stop will be ATH pic.twitter.com/skquLN9MwI — The Krypto King (@thekryptoking_) December 1, 2024 Recent Price Movements Shiba Inu’s price movement in December has been notably stronger than in previous months. On the day of “The Krypto King’s” forecast, SHIB traded at a low of $0.0000267 but later surged by 24% to $0.000038. Despite a brief pullback to $0.000027, the token quickly reclaimed the $0.00003 range. Currently trading at $0.00003206, SHIB has posted a 10% weekly gain, making it the top-performing meme coin in the market. In comparison, competitors such as Dogecoin, PEPE, FLOKI, and BONK reported modest weekly increases of less than 4%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Anticipated Market Moves Market watchers widely believe that SHIB is gearing up for a major price movement. Some analysts link this expectation to Ethereum’s recent breakout past the $4,000 mark, which could trigger positive momentum across the broader crypto market. Commentator “JD Updates” suggested that Ethereum’s strong performance might inspire a similar surge in SHIB’s value. Many traders are optimistic that the meme token could follow Ethereum’s lead as bullish sentiment builds. Path to a New All-Time High To sustain its upward trajectory, the token must overcome critical resistance levels. Analysts like Shib Spain believe surpassing the $0.000033 threshold would signal a significant bullish breakout. SHIB previously faced rejection at this level on December 1, underscoring its importance in the token’s price action. Overall, the growing consensus among analysts points to a promising outlook for Shiba Inu . As the broader crypto market continues to heat up, SHIB could be on the verge of reclaiming its place among the top-performing digital assets.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/shiba-loves-trump-shibtrump-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The altcoins registered impressive gains on Saturday evening, including a new multi-year peak for DOGE, but have retraced as well. BTC Beneath $100K The primary cryptocurrency’s impressive surge following Trump’s landslide victory in the US elections pushed the asset from under $70,000 to almost $100,000 within a few weeks. However, it couldn’t penetrate into six-digit territory for a while as the bears managed to defend it. This finally transpired last Thursday when BTC went into a price discovery mode above $100,000 and tapped a fresh all-time high of almost $104,000. What followed was a sudden and violent rejection that drove it south by over ten grand in hours to $92,000 on most exchanges. After it flushed out a large number of leveraged positions, BTC went on the offensive once again and jumped to $102,000 on Friday evening. However, it has been unable to sustain that level and has lost a few grand since then. It even slipped beneath $100,000 earlier today, where it currently stands. Its market cap is just over $1.960 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts has calmed at 51.4%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 8.12.2024.

PEPE, for example, skyrocketed by 20% at one point and painted a fresh all-time high of its own at over $0.000026 before correcting slightly. Dogecoin also jumped high and neared $0.5 for the first time in three and a half years. SHIB is well in the green today amid some dispute about whether it could lose its position to PEPE by the end of the year. XRP was heading south for a few days straight but has bounced back with a 4.5% surge to trade above $2.5 now. The rest of the larger-cap alts are much less volatile. The total crypto market cap has retraced by around $40 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.820 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Ethereum Ethereum , launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, has changed the blockchain world with its pioneering Proof-of-Stake mechanism and smart contract capabilities. Unlike traditional blockchains, Ethereum supports decentralized applications (dApps) that power a vast ecosystem, including finance, gaming, and more. Innovations like Layer 2 solutions—such as Arbitrum and Polygon—enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs, making the network more efficient. The introduction of ERC-20 tokens set a standard for creating new tokens used for governance, utility, and value storage within various applications. Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake with “The Merge” in 2022 marked a significant milestone, reducing energy consumption and setting the stage for future scalability improvements like sharding. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s potential continues to grow as it strives to address scalability and cost issues. The upcoming sharding phase aims to increase transaction throughput, making the network more accessible and efficient. In the current market cycle, Ethereum stands out not just for its technological advancements but also for its resilience and adaptability. While other cryptocurrencies face challenges, Ethereum’s strong developer community and continuous upgrades keep it at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Market trends suggest that Ethereum remains a vital asset in the crypto space, serving as collateral, rewarding stakers, and facilitating countless transactions. Its trajectory indicates a promising future, making it an attractive option for those interested in the evolution of decentralized technologies. Dogecoin Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s scarcity, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Starting as a joke, it quickly gained a following, showing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared, fueled by online buzz and endorsements from Elon Musk. It entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value over $50 billion. Is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology is simple, similar to early cryptocurrencies but without a supply limit. This means it’s less about scarcity and more about usage and community support. While some see it as a fun entry into crypto, others are cautious due to its meme origins and volatility. Compared to coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features like smart contracts. Yet, its strong community keeps it popular. In the current market, if you’re drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. XRP XRP is a cryptocurrency that sets itself apart with speed and low cost. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it was created to be a digitally native, programmable currency that’s open and borderless. Unlike traditional systems, XRP operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. You don’t need a bank account to use it, which opens up possibilities for people everywhere. Launched by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company that was gifted 80 billion XRP, uses it to improve network liquidity and supports the ecosystem by releasing supply in a controlled manner. In the current market cycle, XRP shows potential due to its focus on fast and low-cost cross-border payments. While other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained attention, XRP’s unique approach to facilitating seamless transfers across various currencies makes it stand out. Recent trends suggest that there is growing interest in efficient payment solutions, and XRP could play a key role in that space. Its resistance to censorship and counterfeiting adds to its appeal. For investors looking at the evolving crypto market, XRP presents an interesting option to consider. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike its predecessor, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, opening up possibilities in the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Launched by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain credibility, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin’s donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB’s place on Ethereum allows it to support smart contracts and decentralized apps. This led to ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. The team also plans an NFT platform and a governance system using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These features give SHIB real utility beyond being a meme. In the current market, where investors seek coins with real-world uses, SHIB’s technology and growth plans make it attractive. While sharing Dogecoin’s meme appeal, SHIB’s Ethereum foundation could give it an edge in the long run. Conclusion ETH, DOGE, XRP, and SHIB have potential, but XYZVerse combines sports and memes for massive growth, offering early adopters community-driven success and aiming to outperform top tokens.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As BTC surpasses $100K, investors eye new coins. Cutoshi trends as a major ETH whale makes a big investment post-Memefi. As BTC pushes past the long-awaited 100k mark, investors are searching the markets for the next coins to buy. After the Memefi project, Cutoshi was trending on X, a big ETH whale made a substantial investment. Smart money looks for low-cap coins with high ROI potential Bitcoin is stealing the headlines again today, with the total crypto market cap up to $3.8T, a 123% increase since the start of the year. Bitcoin leads the way for digital assets, however, Ethereum is where the focus is going to be when altcoin season gets going. Ethereum’s smart contracts make DeFi possible, in a way that Bitcoin was never intended to do. For many smart whales and investors, this presents a buying opportunity, as crypto’s second-biggest coin is unlikely to stay undervalued for long and the resulting gains will be bigger in percentage terms than coins that have already mooned. That’s the logic behind the Ethereum whale, who just put $10k into Cutoshi. Pick a new but utility-packed coin that investors are talking about at a low market cap and wait as the price increases throughout the presale. You might also like: DOGE in huge demand, Cutoshi trends globally as Popcat meets resistance Cutoshi trending again on X In the US Although Bitcoin is on the news today, yesterday the keyword “CUTOSHI” was in the top trending spots on X for several hours, making this the third time for the meme and DeFi coin, in the span of one month. Source: Trends24 This achievement proves that the coin is gaining community attention, something helpful for any coin and essential for a project that is partly about memes. The ERC-20 token and project is a great example of the power of Ethereum, mixing the fun of memes with the usefulness of DeFi. Cutoshi hits X trending list for the third time this month Cutoshi’s recent meme competition attracted a lot of investor attention; the coin also recently sold out of stage 3, going up by 20% and up by a total of 106% since the launch of the presale. For a coin that’s less than 2 months old, that’s impressive, and with six more stages to go before the coin launches on the Ethereum blockchain, there’s a lot more room for growth. Cutoshi is inspired by the Chinese Lucky Cat, with a DeFi perspective. The project is introducing people to the concept of farming via quests, and their plans include a cross-chain DEX, a learning academy, NFTs for trading discounts and more. Essentially, the idea is to make using DeFi as easy as possible for the beginner, while also offering advanced guidance for seasoned traders and a fair price with low slippage on swaps in the Cutoshi DEX. With BTC at an all-time high, the future of the markets looks good. If Cutoshi keeps delivering on their roadmap, $10k in CUTO could end up as life-changing money.

Although Bitcoin’s march to $100,000 may not indicate an early entry point, VirtualBacon predicts it will eventually hit $200,000, citing past price cycles. However, the expert cautions that investors should be prepared for 20% to 30% corrections, but he remains confident about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Related Reading: XRP Price Marks $2.13 And $2.92 As Primary Fibonacci Levels, What Happens When Wave 2 Begins? Regarding the present bull run’s longevity, VirtualBacon alludes to previous cycles that show major price increases often last 6 to 10 months. He observes that previous bull runs often peaked 6 to 10 months after important milestones, such as Bitcoin’s halving events. VirtualBacon also drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s latest breakthrough of the $100,000 milestone and its initial breach of the $10,000 level in 2017, which resulted in a quick doubling of the price within 20 days. If history repeats itself, the analyst believes that the Bitcoin price might skyrocket to $200,000. However, if the price consolidates around $100,000, it could signal a sustained bull run, which would be beneficial to altcoins. Ethereum: A ‘No-Brainer Investment’ While the euphoria surrounding Bitcoin’s surge above $100,000 is apparent, VirtualBacon emphasizes that the real potential are in altcoins. He believes that when Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins will certainly take center stage. Ethereum (ETH), in particular, is outperforming Bitcoin, predicting an upcoming altcoin season. During past cycles, Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin by a factor of 2.5. If Bitcoin reaches $200,000, VirtualBacon predicts that Ethereum may grow to $15,000, indicating a fourfold increase. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Ethereum Golden Cross As ETH Surges Past $4,000 – Is Altseason In Sight? Interestingly, VirtualBacon considers Ethereum a “no-brainer investment” at this time, citing its “significant undervaluation” and ability to generate at least a 3x return, with realistic price targets ranging from $10,000 to $12,000. Finally, VirtualBacon advised monitoring Bitcoin’s performance in relation to its 200-day exponential moving average. He expects the bull market to continue until late 2025, creating several possibilities for wise investments. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market, BTC, was trading at $99,670, up 3.2% on the week. Over longer time frames, Bitcoin still shows significant gains of over 31% and 129% on a monthly and year-to-date basis, respectively.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB’s profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These features contribute to its potential in the crypto space, making it a notable project in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency created in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional digital currencies. Featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo, it was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin’s value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and exceeding $50 billion in total value. This growth was propelled by social media influence and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s open-source technology and strong community support contribute to its potential. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and investor sentiment. Conclusion While SHIB and DOGE have less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a token for those pursuing excellence and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential massive returns during this bull run, DOGEN follows the success of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It builds a community of leaders, providing real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

37370099,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51654,1733644537,"Expert Outlines Key XRP Entry Points, Predicts $6 to $8 Price Range","A well-known market analyst has identified favorable entry points for XRP investors while projecting significant price targets amid an expected market uptrend. XRP has gained momentum in recent weeks, attracting renewed investor interest following its strong market performance since early November. Identifying Key Entry Levels Market analyst EGRAG recently outlined crucial entry points for XRP investors, emphasizing that the asset still holds long-term growth potential despite recent market pullbacks. He highlighted several strategic price levels where investors might consider accumulating XRP. EGRAG recalled urging investors to buy XRP before its latest price surge when it traded below $1. He maintains that the current market phase continues to offer attractive investment opportunities. In his analysis, he pointed to $2.00 as a significant buying level amid ongoing market volatility. Additionally, the $1.60 to $1.70 range was identified as another potential accumulation zone, particularly if XRP experiences a price correction due to a rounding top pattern. He further noted that if XRP dips to $1.20, he plans to reinvest all profits into the asset, demonstrating strong confidence in its long-term potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to EGRAG, a successful breakout from the rounding top formation could push XRP beyond the $3.50 to $3.80 range, setting the stage for a rally targeting $6 to $8 in the short term. RSI Pattern Signals Potential for Further Gains EGRAG also examined XRP’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), identifying a familiar pattern that could signal more upside potential. Historical RSI data reveals a recurring trend during past bull runs characterized by two distinct peaks. The first peak typically precedes a sharp RSI decline, followed by a second peak marking the bull run’s final high. According to EGRAG, XRP has only reached its first peak in the current cycle, suggesting that a second, more substantial upward movement could be forthcoming. He projected that the current bull cycle could extend into late 2025, with a possible peak around mid-March 2025. This forecast aligns with the anticipated wave 5 cycle top, reinforcing the possibility of higher XRP prices in the coming months. By focusing on well-defined entry points and monitoring historical RSI patterns, investors may find promising opportunities as XRP’s market cycle unfolds.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK.

ChatGPT Answers,"TL:DR; PEPE continues to make the headlines as it broke its November all-time high yesterday and charted a fresh one following a 20% daily surge. Although it has closed the gap with Shiba Inu in terms of market cap, it’s still pretty significant. However, the question arises of whether it can become the second-biggest in its niche. PEPE vs SHIB CryptoPotato reported yesterday PEPE’s impressive run. After a few weeks of sideways trading and even retracements from its November 13 peak , the meme coin went on an impressive run that resulted in tapping a new high of over $0.000026. Although it has lost some traction since then, PEPE is still well above $0.000025, and its market cap is just shy of $11 billion. This is still far from SHIB’s $19 billion, but PEPE has continuously outperformed in the past month with gains of 135% compared to Shiba Inu’s more modest 70%. This has led the community to speculate on whether it is a question of when and not if PEPE will surpass SHIB and become the second-largest meme coin by market cap. there is no timeline where $pepe doesn’t flip shib this cycle. global pepe recognition and mindshare is too big, absolutely inevitable imo. pic.twitter.com/EzZU9IE2oE — Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) November 17, 2024 During its surge on Saturday, PEPE also managed to outplace SHIB in terms of trading volume, and by a significant margin, according to on-chain data. $PEPE is now the 5th most traded cryptocurrency, excluding stablecoins, with an almost 3x larger 24-hour volume than $SHIB . pic.twitter.com/NgBL6QIoC0 — Chandler Bing (@chandlerbingpl) December 7, 2024 What Does ChatGPT Say? While the community is highly bullish now for PEPE, perhaps driven by the hype from the latest ATH, we decided to ask the popular AI chatbot about its opinion on the matter. It admitted that PEPE has “demonstrated significant growth potential in 2024,” adding that it has “frequently outperformed Shiba Inu (SHIB) in various timeframes.” It noted that PEPE has attracted substantial whale activity and high trading volumes, but Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, including the Layer-2 network , “provides it with more tangible utility than PEPE, which primarily relies on community momentum and market hype.” Consequently, ChatGPT concluded that such a flippening is ‘unlikely,’ at least in this timeframe. “While analysts expect strong gains for PEPE, Shiba Inu’s entrenched position as a larger and more established meme coin makes a complete flip unlikely in the short term unless a significant shift occurs in their respective ecosystems.” The post Can PEPE Surpass Shiba Inu by 2024’s End?

Make Up for Lost Time with BTFD Coin,"If you were one of the crypto enthusiasts who missed the Book of Meme ICO, you probably feel a little like someone who walked out of a party just as the DJ dropped the hottest track of the year. You know, the one that everyone will be talking about for months. But here’s the good news: it’s not too late to turn things around. If you missed the Book of Meme launch, BTFD Coin is here to give you a second chance at getting in on something big—and trust me, you don’t want to let this one slip through your fingers. Instead of wondering “what could have been,” why not shift your focus to BTFD Coin? This meme coin isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan project. With a presale that’s absolutely killing it, BTFD Coin is the next big thing—and the perfect second chance you’ve been waiting for. Book of Meme: An Awesome ICO When Book of Meme first hit the market, it caused a major stir in the meme coin space. The ICO was a resounding success, where the presale alone raised 50% of its current allocation (think along the lines of 34 billion BOME tokens!) The community surrounding Book of Meme grew rapidly, with thousands of followers across various social media platforms within the first month of launch. Its promise of creating a unique platform dedicated to meme culture and providing engaging experiences for users helped build significant hype. However, even with its early success, the token faced challenges in maintaining its value post-ICO. Despite these hurdles, Book of Meme continues to develop its platform and remains a notable presence in the meme coin space. BTFD Coin: A Second Chance You Won’t Want to Miss If there’s one thing that BTFD Coin has in its favour, it’s timing. Coming in strong after the dust settled from Book of Meme’s rollercoaster, BTFD Coin has been a breath of fresh air for investors who are ready to make a fresh start. The presale is currently in full swing, and the figures are looking great. With over $1.35 raised and 29 billion coins sold, BTFD Coin is off to an impressive start. At a current price of $0.000064, BTFD Coin is still in its early stages, meaning you can still get in at a very affordable price before the coin hits the open market. And here’s the best part: the coin has a solid community backing, with over 3,100 Bulls already holding their tokens. It’s not just a meme coin with hype—it’s a meme coin with staying power. Whether it’s the high staking rewards (with an APY that could make your bank account jealous), the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, or the growing global community, BTFD Coin is putting in the work to ensure that it’s not just another meme coin destined to disappear. If you’re feeling the FOMO after Book of Meme’s ICO, now’s the time to strike while the iron is hot. The current price of $0.000064 per coin is a bargain, and early investors are already starting to see the value in being part of something that’s showing real promise. What $800 Could Do for You So, let’s talk investment. You’ve got $800 to throw into BTFD Coin, and you’re wondering what kind of return you could expect. Well, based on the current presale price of $0.000064, your $800 would buy you 12.5 million BTFD coins. Now, if the price hits $0.0006 (which is a realistic projection considering the presale performance), you could potentially turn that $800 into $7,500. That’s a potential return of 837.5%. Not bad, right? This investment example isn’t just some pipe dream. With BTFD Coin’s presale success, we’re seeing some solid growth potential. Of course, no investment is a guarantee, but the signs are there that BTFD Coin could provide some seriously high rewards for those who get in early. Final Thoughts: Time for You to Finally Shine If you missed out on Book of Meme’s ICO, now’s your chance to turn that regret into something worthwhile. BTFD Coin is offering a second chance to get in on a meme coin that has real potential and serious community backing. With a presale that’s already making waves, a price that’s still incredibly affordable, and rewards that could seriously fatten your wallet, this is one opportunity you don’t want to miss. So go ahead—grab your BTFD Coin and make up for lost time. The second chance is here, and it’s got your name written all over it.

Here’s why,"Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Egrag Crypto recently shared an intriguing technical analysis, speculating about a potential explosive price movement for XRP. His post titled, “The 3 Mountains: And So It Begins,” suggests that XRP might be approaching a critical breakout phase, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. The “Three Mountains” Theory Egrag Crypto’s analysis revolves around a chart illustrating three prominent macro triangle patterns, named the “three mountains.” According to his interpretation, these patterns may signal impending bullish momentum for XRP. In technical analysis, triangle formations often indicate periods of consolidation before a significant price move. If XRP breaks out of these formations, it could trigger a substantial rally. He added, “What if the 3 mountains represent the three massive macro triangle ranges? What if we’re on the verge of #XRP’s most explosive phase yet?” His optimistic outlook has resonated with many within the XRP community, reinforcing long-held bullish expectations. #XRP – The 3 Mountains: And So It Begins What if the 3 mountains represent the three massive macro triangle ranges?

These events could influence the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, especially for XRP, considering its protracted legal battle with the SEC. Many analysts believe a more favorable regulatory framework could unlock new investment inflows into the crypto market.

While technical analysis alone cannot guarantee future price movements, Egrag Crypto’s perspective underscores the growing anticipation surrounding XRP’s future. The potential convergence of technical indicators and macroeconomic events could set the stage for significant market activity. As ChatGPT previously stated in an XRP price prediction , “Market dynamics in the cryptocurrency sector are often influenced by a blend of technical analysis, market sentiment, and macroeconomic events.” If these factors align as anticipated, XRP could be poised for one of its most impactful market phases.

37382266,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104240,1733641765,"Analyst Identifies Timeline for Dogecoin to Begin Its Next Leg, Targets $3.8 to $4","A market analyst has set a potential timeline for Dogecoin to begin its next leg up, setting ambitious price targets. Dogecoin (DOGE) has entered an important phase following its impressive rally earlier in November, which saw prices soar to a multi-year peak of $0.48 on Nov. 23. The crypto asset has since experienced a pullback amid a broader market correction.As Dogecoin now consolidates around $0.45, analysts believe the meme coin is currently building momentum to begin its next uptrend. With bullish momentum building, these analysts expect the next leg up to push DOGE to unprecedented highs.Dogecoin Golden Pocket Targets $4Lead Dogecoin analyst Kevin recently highlighted historical trends around Dogecoin’s price behavior. He drew parallels to earlier cycles and observed that after its initial major rally, Dogecoin consolidated for 24 days before embarking on another upward move. https://twitter.com/Kev_Capital_TA/status/1864110830947631236According to the analyst, if the current cycle follows a similar trajectory, he anticipates the next leg of the rally to begin by the end of this week. He projects a path toward the “macro golden pocket,” which he estimates to be between $3.80 and $4.00. However, Kevin tempered his optimism by acknowledging the ambitious nature of this prediction but maintained that achieving a new ATH by the end of December remains feasible.DOGE Symmetrical Triangle and Bull PennantMeanwhile, market analyst Captain Faibik is also extremely bullish on Dogecoin. In his latest report , he confirmed that Dogecoin has continued to move within a symmetrical triangle pattern since early November. Interestingly, data from his 4-hour chart suggests that he expects a breakout from this pattern to trigger a massive 55% rally, comparable to previous upsurges. If this scenario unfolds, Dogecoin could reach a new multi-year peak of $0.70 in the short term. Dogecoin 4H Chart Captain Faibik Also, Trader Tardigrade, another market watcher, sees bullish potential for Dogecoin , calling attention to a bullish pennant pattern on the charts. https://twitter.com/TATrader_Alan/status/1864935061415694740As Dogecoin approaches the edge of this formation, he predicts an imminent breakout. Tardigrade’s target for the rally is $1.35, a position above the $1 psychological mark. At press time, Dogecoin trades for $0.45, up 4.75% over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/08/analyst-identifies-timeline-for-dogecoin-to-begin-its-next-leg-targets-3-8-to-4/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-identifies-timeline-for-dogecoin-to-begin-its-next-leg-targets-3-8-to-4,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency created in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional digital currencies. Featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo, it was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin’s value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and exceeding $50 billion in total value. This growth was propelled by social media influence and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s open-source technology and strong community support contribute to its potential. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and investor sentiment. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB’s profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These features contribute to its potential in the crypto space, making it a notable project in the current market cycle. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, it offers security and resistance to censorship or counterfeiting, and does not require a bank account for settlements. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for development and liquidity support. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., placed 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across currencies, making it suitable for global financial transactions. Its features make it a significant player in the current market landscape. Cardano’s ADA: A Sustainable and Scalable Cryptocurrency Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which enhances energy efficiency compared to proof-of-work systems. The platform is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts, improving scalability and transaction speed. In 2021, Cardano introduced native tokens that offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. With its focus on sustainability and scalability, ADA has significant potential in the cryptocurrency market. Its innovative technology makes it an important player in the current market cycle. Conclusion As global barriers ease, the crypto market is set for unprecedented growth. While tokens like DOGE, SHIB, XRP, and ADA may see modest short-term gains, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN promises significant growth and real benefits, building a community of leaders and following the path of previous successful tokens.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With SEC clarity, XRP leads the bull cycle as DTX Exchange eyes gains with a feature tied to XRP’s ETF potential. With regulatory clarity from the SEC, XRP is leading this bull cycle, reigniting investor confidence in long-term investments. Meanwhile, market attention is turning to DTX Exchange as it launches a new feature poised to capitalize on XRP’s probable ETF launch. As institutional and retail investors evaluate these opportunities, the crypto market’s focus highlights a potential shift toward platforms that combine innovation with regulatory approval, signaling new frontrunners in the race for dominance. You might also like: DTX Exchange bound for rally, draws in Cardano and Hedera holders Ripple’s XRP balances hype and history in current rally In one month, XRP accumulated more than $130 billion in market cap to become the 4th largest cryptocurrency. Currently trading above $2.30, XRP is up 37% this week, driven by optimism surrounding Ripple’s planned RLUSD stablecoin and potential XRP ETF approval. There’s also the expansion of cross-border payment in partnership with the NYDFS. Despite bullish momentum and predictions of reaching new all-time highs, XRP faces skepticism. Analysts warn of volatility and note Ripple’s significant reserves of 38.9 billion tokens, raising concerns about market supply. Recent price consolidation, including a 2.9% dip in the past 24 hours, suggests profit-taking and waning short-term momentum. Experts are divided: some foresee further surges due to ecosystem growth, while others anticipate a pullback below $0.60, citing XRP’s history of sharp declines, such as its 75% drop post-2021 peak. Nevertheless, market sentiment remains largely bullish as XRP continues to lead this bull cycle. At the press time, XRP is trading above its moving averages with a “buy” signal on its momentum indicator. DTX Exchange Capitalizes on ETF buzz with new features DTX Exchange is the latest example of a unique approach to decentralized finance, poised to disrupt the ETF market. By introducing tokenized ETFs, traders gain access to fractional ownership of various assets, spanning from stocks and commodities to cryptocurrencies. This lowers the entry barrier for retail traders, finally letting them enter the markets reserved for institutional investors. The distributed liquidity pools on the platform also guarantee the best execution of trades, tighter spreads, and smooth price discovery. Global access is another advantage since DTX Exchange operates without the geographic or regulatory restrictions seen in traditional platforms. Blockchain transparency ensures real-time tracking of ETF components, fostering trust and security among users. Moreover, traders can use up to 1,000x leverage and leverage advanced on-chain analytics to inform their trading decisions. Retail investors are encouraged with tools and educational material to stand squarely with institutions in the markets. DTX Exchange blends the best of DeFi accessibility with the stability of traditional ETFs to provide a next-generation gateway into the markets. Currently, one DTX token is sold for $0.12 in the sixth stage of its ongoing presale. Early DTX holders have access to premium features like enhanced analytics and priority customer support. Interested investors who get in now can join a growing DeFi ecosystem that has already raised nearly $10 million and is rumored to be the dark horse of the next cycle.

37365520,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658807,1733639432,"Ethereum Price Climbs To $4,000 Amid Historic ETF Inflows: Will It Break Previous Records?","In a significant market development, Ethereum (ETH) has surpassed the $4,000 mark for the first time in over ten months, closing the first week of December with a remarkable 40% surge in the weekly time frame. This upswing has been closely tied to a broader rally in the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin (BTC), which recently reached new all-time highs. Ethereum Surges 61% As ETF Demand Grows According to Bloomberg, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States experienced unprecedented demand, recording a daily inflow of $428 million on Thursday alone. This surge in investment interest reflects a growing confidence in Ethereum, particularly following Donald Trump’s election victory on November 5, which ignited a bullish sentiment across the crypto landscape. Since then, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin, boasting a staggering 61% increase in value. Related Reading: Trump’s Crypto Czar David Sacks Is Super Bullish For Solana: Here’s Why The appointment of Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has further bolstered enthusiasm for Ethereum. Atkins, a proponent of pro-crypto regulation and a member of the advisory board for the advocacy group Token Alliance, is seen as a positive force for the crypto industry. Bloomberg suggests that under his leadership, the restrictions preventing investors from earning yield on staked Ether through ETFs could be reconsidered, enhancing the appeal of these investment vehicles. Altcoin Season In Full Swing Nick Forster, founder of the crypto trading platform Derive.xyz, noted, “Now that Bitcoin has hit $100,000, it appears that investors are seeking the next opportunity.” Forster highlighted that Ethereum remains significantly below its all-time high of $4,878 reached in November 2021, prompting many investors to shift their focus and explore the potential for gains in altcoins like ETH. The increasing interest in Ethereum is also evident in the derivatives market, where open interest in Ether futures contracts on CME Group Inc. has reached record levels, significantly outpacing the growth in Bitcoin futures. Le Shi, managing director at market-making firm Auros, remarked that US institutions tend to favor regulated investment vehicles, resulting in a higher concentration of activity in CME Ether futures and ETH ETFs. Additionally, the founders of Glassnode—Yan Allemann, Jan Happel, and Rafael Schutlze-Kraft—have pointed to the resilience of altcoins amid Bitcoin’s recent volatility.

Shiba Inu Could Delete Two Zeros To Hit $0.0017 in 2026 A leading on-chain metrics and price prediction company, Gov Capital , has made a unique price forecast for Shiba Inu, suggesting it could hit the $0.0017 target in 2026. This will be two years from now, making it a long-term target. Additionally, if SHIBA Inu hits $0.0017, it will be an uptick in its ROI of around 5,600%. This bullish Shiba Inu prediction comes as the SHIB token is gearing up for a significant rally. Shiba Inu bulls aim for a 2020 and 2021 repeat of the rally in which the token’s price surged by over 85 million percent, printing life-changing gains. If this rally repeats in 2025 and 2026, present-day Shiba Inu investors could lock in millions. Technical indicators , including the RSI at 63, support bullish momentum, as the meme coin has maintained a bullish outlook since early November. According to SHIB KNIGHT , the coin has prepared for a significant breakout. This could see it surpass its critical resistance level of $0.0000348 while aiming for higher gains in 2025. Pepe Price Analysis Pepe coin, one of the most traded meme coins, continues to record impressive gains, with a weekly surge of over 7%. The Pepe token also hovers between the $0.000017 and $0.000020 region while trading above the 200-day simple moving average. This suggests a robust Pepe price performance over the long term, reinforcing a bullish sentiment around the token. Moreover, Pepe’s market indicators reflect optimism. The Fear and Greed Index 84 signals extreme greed, as Pepe price prediction sentiments are bullish. The RSI , at 69, suggests building buying pressure that could lead to a significant price breakout. Pepe coin has recorded 17 green days over the past month, adding to its positive performance. A continuous upward momentum might see Pepe’s price target at $0.000035 in the short term, with support around the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. Its listing on major exchange platforms such as Upbit and Robinhood could provide Pepe with increased capital and broader audience access, leading to further gains in its price.

37365540,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390667,1733639373,Shiba Inu Price Prediction Today,"The post Shiba Inu Price Prediction Today appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News An analyst has predicted that Shiba Inu could surge by 178%, potentially returning to its all-time high. In October 2021, Shiba Inu hit its peak price of 0.000048845. To reach that level again, Shiba Inu would need to rise by 178%. The technical analysis suggests this is a possibility, as the market conditions are starting to improve. Majority of the top 10 cryptocurrencies have drifted into the green zone and Bitcoin is once again trading above the $100k level. Current Resistance Levels According to analyst Austin Hilton , the altcoin needs to break through a major resistance level of 0.00004033. Right now, Shiba Inu is trading at 0.00003247 and is up by more than six percent in the last 24 hours. Once this resistance is broken, the analyst believes we’ll see a significant price increase. The Three-Year Down Cycle Shiba Inu has been in a downtrend for about three years, but that’s changing. The market conditions are improving, and with new leadership and pro-crypto policies in place, the crypto market is heading into a new phase starting in January. This could trigger one of the biggest bull runs for crypto, and Shiba Inu, as a top meme coin, is positioned to benefit. Shiba Inu’s Market Position Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are the leading meme coins, with market caps of $18 billion and $66 billion, respectively. The meme coin sector is worth over $130 billion, a significant part of the $3.67 trillion global crypto market. This shows the potential for growth in Shiba Inu’s market cap. Breakout Pattern Shiba Inu tends to consolidate and then break out, as seen in previous charts. After consolidation, the coin often experiences significant price movements. For example, there was a 60% gain in just eight days during one breakout. With more capital entering the crypto market, similar movements could occur.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-today/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37366078,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51647,1733639238,XRP Trillion-Dollar Coin Idea: Expert Reveals Why He Will Never Sell XRP,"In a recent tweet , crypto analyst Egrag Crypto raised a thought-provoking idea about the potential use of XRP, the digital asset majorly distributed by Ripple, as a solution for the U.S. national debt. This notion touches on a broader concept, the so-called “trillion-dollar coin” idea, and suggests that XRP might be pivotal in addressing U.S. financial challenges. While the idea may sound far-fetched at first, it’s worth examining the details and implications that Egrag Crypto points to, particularly the influence of key players in the U.S. administration and the potential for a shift in the nation’s financial system. The Trillion-Dollar Coin Concept The concept of a trillion-dollar coin emerged during the 2011 U.S. debt ceiling crisis when the government faced the possibility of defaulting on its obligations. The idea proposed by Carlos Mucha, also known as “Beowulf,” was rooted in a 1997 law that allowed the U.S. Treasury to mint platinum coins of any value. This idea gained traction among economists like Paul Krugman and Rohan Grey, who explored its potential as a solution to bypass the debt ceiling and avoid default. However, despite its legal feasibility, the trillion-dollar coin was never minted, as it was considered an impractical and controversial solution. Egrag Crypto’s Proposal: XRP as the U.S. Debt Solution In his tweet, Egrag Crypto proposes an alternative to the trillion-dollar coin by suggesting that XRP could be used to settle U.S. national debt. According to this hypothesis, the remaining XRP in escrow, controlled by Ripple, could be used to address the nation’s financial obligations. XRP has a significant reserve of tokens locked in escrow , designed to gradually release a set amount of XRP into circulation over time. Egrag Crypto speculates that the U.S. government could access this escrow under a “force majeure” situation, bypassing standard procedures in extraordinary circumstances to utilize XRP for the country’s financial needs. This idea hinges on the belief that the U.S. government could revalue XRP and use it to pay down debt, leveraging the asset’s growing value in global markets. The proposal presents an alternative to traditional financial tools such as printing money or issuing debt. In this framework, XRP could become the cornerstone of a new economic strategy, addressing national debt and broader financial instability. The Influence of the PayPal Mafia Egrag Crypto also points to the growing influence of the “PayPal Mafia”—a group of influential tech entrepreneurs and investors who were integral to the founding of PayPal. Members of this group, including figures like Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, and Elon Musk , have gone on to shape the landscape of modern technology and finance. Their increasing influence on U.S. administration and financial policy raises questions about their potential role in promoting cryptocurrency adoption and integrating digital assets into mainstream financial systems. The involvement of these individuals could signal a shift toward crypto-based solutions, including the potential use of XRP to address longstanding financial issues. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Escrow and the “Force Majeure” Scenario One of the more intriguing elements of Egrag Crypto’s theory is the possibility of a “force majeure” status that would allow the U.S. government to take control of the XRP escrow . This concept is grounded in the idea that in extreme situations, such as a national financial emergency, the government could step in and alter or take control of assets otherwise out of its reach. In this case, XRP could be revalued and leveraged for purposes beyond its current role in Ripple’s ecosystem. While such an action would likely face legal and political challenges, it presents an interesting scenario in which the government could rapidly deploy a significant cryptocurrency reserve to solve pressing financial problems. Egrag Crypto’s tweet presents a speculative, yet intriguing scenario about the potential role of XRP in addressing U.S. national debt. While using cryptocurrency to settle the country’s financial obligations remains untested and controversial, the growing influence of tech entrepreneurs and the evolving landscape of digital assets make it a topic worth considering.

37365502,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/bitcoin-btc-toys-with-100k-and-memecoin-husky-inu-hinu-presale-hits-new-fundraising-goals,1733639211,Bitcoin (BTC) Toys with $100K and Memecoin Husky Inu (HINU) Presale Hits New Fundraising Goals,"The altcoin market has exploded after Bitcoin (BTC) broke through its vital $100,000 level. As the world’s leading cryptocurrency continues to test this level, altcoins are surging to record highs. BTC remains the undisputed leader of the crypto world and maintains its reputation as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC is the go-to choice for institutional investors, and spot BTC ETFs witness record inflows. While BTC asserts its position as the top investment choice, many altcoins have surpassed its profit potential. Despite BTC reaching a new ATH of $103,900 earlier this week, its dominance is declining, and investors are turning their attention to smaller assets, signalling the start of the altcoin season. Let’s delve into some of the top altcoins to own as Bitcoin makes these historic gains. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin by market cap and is the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $68.4 billion. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $354 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters and has long endorsed Dogecoin . Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” DOGE is expected to surge after DeFi Technologies introduced Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. The ETP will allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning the asset. Amid Dogecoin’s increasing popularity and momentum, the token managed to flip luxury car maker Porsche’s market cap. With a market cap exceeding $68 billion , Dogecoin surpassed Porsche’s $56.1 billion market capitalization. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) PNUT , inspired by a pet squirrel named Peanut that was euthanized by New York authorities against its owner’s wishes, has become a viral sensation, causing an unprecedented social media frenzy amid the election. The memecoin was listed on Binance in November and has skyrocketed since. PNUT gained over 1,325% in the month and is up over 32% in the past week. PNUT’s rally came after tech mogul Elon Musk referenced Peanut’s death in a post on X (formerly Twitter). PNUT’s rally resulted in it entering the top 100 altcoins, and it is now the 89th largest crypto with a market cap of over $1.5 billion. Bonk (BONK) Bonk (BONK), like other memecoins, has exploded in popularity thanks to its strong community backing and viral potential. Initially seen as a mere speculative token, Bonk (BONK) has surprised many by delivering significant returns to early investors. Much like Pepe (PEPE) before it, Bonk (BONK) is capitalizing on the memecoin phenomenon, where projects with robust community support can achieve meteoric gains. While Bonk's (BONK) success is mainly tied to social media hype and community engagement, it offers high-risk, high-reward opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on short-term gains. BONK has gained over 106% in the past month and is poised for immense growth in the upcoming alt season. Husky Inu (HINU) As BTC trades at a whopping $99,600 and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $610,000, completing its third presale round. 🚀 A huge THANK YOU to all our $HINU holders! Stage 3 is officially complete, and the price has increased significantly. We’re now aiming for even bigger targets and greater success. As 1Q 2025 approaches, so does our highly anticipated launch. Stay tuned for the exciting… pic.twitter.com/zuP8T1IxTD — Husky Inu (@huskyinureal) December 5, 2024 Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/shiba-loves-trump-shibtrump-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37366077,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51549,1733637659,"DOGEN Presale Raises Nearly $3 Million, Crossing Midpoint Amid Meme Coin Frenzy","The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a resurgence in interest for meme tokens, with the sector’s market capitalization climbing to $142 billion following an 82% increase over the past month. Daily trading volumes in the space have also risen steadily, averaging $46 billion, driven by heightened community engagement and broader market momentum. Market Leaders Gain Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to lead the meme token category with a market capitalization of $66.39 billion. The token has recorded a 10% gain in the last 24 hours and a weekly increase of 11.7%, supported by a $15.06 billion trading volume. DOGE’s first-mover advantage and integration into payment systems have helped maintain its dominance. Shiba Inu (SHIB), valued at $18.87 billion, posted a 7.7% daily increase and 25.7% growth over the past week. SHIB’s expansion into decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, alongside its Shibarium layer-2 scaling network, has bolstered investor sentiment. Pepe (PEPE), another community-driven meme coin, saw its market cap rise to $9.33 billion with a 7.9% daily and 12.7% weekly gain. Its success is attributed to a combination of speculative trading and robust community support. DOGEN Enters the Scene With Explosive Growth DOGEN , a Solana-based meme token, is gaining traction in its presale phase, boasting a 300% increase in price from $0.0003 at Stage 1 to $0.0011 currently. With Stage 8 of the presale underway, a further 18% price hike is anticipated as the project nears its target of $5.5 million. The presale has already crossed the midpoint, raising almost $3 million and marking DOGEN as a noteworthy entrant in the expanding meme coin market. DOGEN’s presale strategy has been designed to encourage significant price appreciation, with the token projected to reach $0.0019 by the final stage—a nearly sixfold increase from its starting price. This positions DOGEN as an attractive option for early adopters seeking high-growth opportunities in the meme token sector. The DOGEN presale won’t last forever. Seize this limited opportunity to invest in the future of meme coins DOGEN Builds a Community-Driven Ecosystem with Robust Rewards for Holders Central to DOGEN’s strategy is its focus on community engagement and rewards, targeting investors who are bold, visionary, and ready to capitalize on emerging opportunities. DOGEN positions itself as more than a meme coin—it aims to create a dynamic ecosystem where early adopters are rewarded and actively involved in the token’s growth. Holders of DOGEN can look forward to a range of incentives designed to enhance value and encourage participation: – Airdrop Rewards: Early supporters receive bonus DOGEN tokens, fostering loyalty among initial investors. – Referral Bonuses: Users can grow the community by bringing in others and earning USDT rewards for their efforts. – Multi-Level Referral Program: Participants can earn up to 20% of Golden Points from token purchases by their referrals, with 7% rewards from direct referrals, 2% from second-level referrals, and 1% from third-level connections. – Staking Opportunities: Token holders can stake their DOGEN to generate passive income, aligning long-term investment strategies with the token’s growth trajectory. – Exclusive Activities: DOGEN holders will gain access to special events, campaigns, and other initiatives designed to keep engagement high and offer additional value. Act now to take advantage of DOGEN’s multi-level rewards and staking opportunities DOGEN’s community-driven model ensures that early adopters are treated as integral stakeholders, with benefits that grow alongside the project. Regular updates and announcements are shared through DOGEN’s official channels on X and Telegram , keeping the community informed and involved. This multifaceted approach underscores DOGEN’s commitment to building a sustainable, rewarding ecosystem for its investors while driving long-term growth and market relevance. A Bold Roadmap with Transparency at Its Core DOGEN’s strategic roadmap underscores its ambition to move beyond the typical meme coin narrative and establish itself as a transformative force in crypto space. Central to this vision is the DogeTap app, designed to transition DOGEN from a meme token to a utility-focused asset with real-world applications. When combined with staking options that enable passive income generation, DOGEN positions itself as a compelling choice for investors seeking growth-oriented opportunities. Unlike many meme coins that fade as initial hype subsides, DOGEN prioritizes long-term sustainability through a foundation of trust and transparency. The project has successfully undergone rigorous audits by leading blockchain security firms, SpyWolf and SmartState , reinforcing its credibility and commitment to security. Positioned for Long-Term Success DOGEN’s rise signals a shift in the meme token landscape, as it combines speculative appeal with a forward-looking strategy. Its emphasis on transparency, community rewards, and product development distinguishes it from competitors that often rely solely on viral popularity. As the presale progresses, DOGEN’s mix of strategic planning and robust community engagement positions it as a standout project within the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. For investors eyeing the next big opportunity on the Solana blockchain, DOGEN offers both immediate potential and a long-term growth story.

37366076,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51642,1733637135,XRP to $8 and $11? Top Analyst Reveals Key Dates and Projections,"An influential market analyst has outlined projections for XRP’s price trajectory, identifying potential milestones at $8.1 and $11 within the current market cycle. The forecast leverages historical patterns associated with Bitcoin halving events to provide a timeline for these targets. Recent XRP Performance and Market Correction XRP recently achieved a significant milestone, surging to $2.9 on December 3—its highest level in seven years. This milestone followed an extended bullish run but was short-lived as the asset faced a sharp retracement. Over the past three days, XRP has dropped by over 18%, partially driven by Bitcoin’s correction from its record-breaking $100,000 price level. Despite this downturn, Master Kenobi, a prominent analyst, emphasized that XRP’s upward journey remains intact. By examining historical trends in XRP’s performance relative to Bitcoin halving events, Kenobi has predicted that the asset could reach $11 during this cycle. Initial Rally and Current Pullback Kenobi observed that during previous cycles, XRP experienced significant rallies approximately 224 days after Bitcoin’s halving. In the current cycle, however, the rally began earlier, around 204 days post-halving, and culminated in XRP’s rise to $2.9. The analyst noted that historical price trends often involve a correction following an initial parabolic movement. For this cycle, the pullback began on December 3 and has since pushed XRP into the lower $2 range. Kenobi projects that this phase could drive the asset’s price down to $1.39, which he identified as a critical support zone. According to him, this level could serve as a launchpad for a subsequent rally, allowing market participants to prepare for the next upward momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The projection for a Second Rally to $8.1 Kenobi anticipates that once XRP stabilizes at lower levels, it will enter a fresh rally. Based on his analysis, the asset could surpass $8.1 by late February 2025, drawing parallels with the 2017 bull market rather than the most recent cycle. He attributed this to XRP’s tendency to mirror older patterns under specific conditions. The six-year white trendline, identified as a crucial resistance point, is expected to play a pivotal role in this rally. According to Kenobi, XRP’s interaction with this trendline could trigger price movements that align with historical trends, propelling the asset to new highs. If XRP achieves this $8.1 milestone , its market capitalization will rise to $461.7 billion, setting a new record. Kenobi highlighted that this valuation aligns with historical precedents, noting, “Ethereum reached a $548 billion market cap during its previous peak,” suggesting that similar levels for XRP are achievable. Potential for a Final Surge to $11 Following the anticipated peak at $8.1, Kenobi predicts an extended consolidation phase that could last several months. This period, he explained, is crucial for stabilizing the market and preparing for the next price movement. Approximately 200 days after this consolidation phase begins, XRP could experience its final rally in this cycle, potentially reaching $11 by mid-October 2025. If this projection materializes, XRP’s market capitalization will approach $627 billion, marking a significant achievement. However, Kenobi cautioned that broader market conditions would heavily influence this outcome. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.40, reflecting a 6.14% increase from its recent lows as the market shows signs of recovery following the recent correction.

37366183,https://invezz.com/?p=2378440,1733636656,"Crypto price predictions: Pepe, Floki, and Dogwifhat","Meme coins performed well during the weekend as most investors bought them amid the ongoing greed sentiment. Pepe price was up by over 20%, while other popular ones like Floki, Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Popcat rose by double digits. So, will these coins continue doing well in the coming weeks? Pepe price forecast Pepe, the third-biggest meme coin in the industry, had a great performance this weekend as it made a strong bullish breakout. It jumped to a high of $0.00002685, a record high. Moving to that level was important because it crossed the important resistance level at $0.00002567, its highest level on November 14. It invalidated the double-top pattern that was forming, and whose neckline was at $0.00001730. That price was a few points above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Pepe has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Also, oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have all pointed upwards. It also formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish sign. Therefore, the coin’s path of least resistance is bullish, with the next point to watch being $0.000035. The stop-loss of this trade will be at the 23.6% retracement level at $0.0000210. PEPE chart by TradingView Floki price analysis The daily chart shows that the FLOKI token has done well in the past few weeks. After bottoming at $0.00009857 in August, the coin has rallied to $0.00026, its highest level since November 23. Floki has bounced back above the key support at $0.00021, its highest swing on July 22 and the neckline of a double-top pattern at $0.0002880. It has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) crossed each other. A golden cross is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. Also, the MACD and the RSI have all pointed upwards. The coin is also a few points below the 23.6% retracement point. Therefore, in this case, more gains will be confirmed if the coin rallies above the key resistance level at $0.00028, the upper side of the double-top. Such a move will lead to more gains to $0.0003478. Dogwifhat price analysis WIF, the biggest meme coin in Solana ecosystem, has done well this year as it jumped by over 4,200% from its lowest point in January. This growth has pushed its market cap to over $3.8 billion. Dogwifhat price jumped to a high of $4 on Saturday as the meme coin season gained steam. It has moved above the key support levels at $2.87 (upper side of the cup and handle). WIF price has moved above the Ichimoku cloud indicator, while all oscillators have pointed upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the next point at $4.73, its highest level in November.

37363802,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107765,1733636052,"Crypto Market Cap Unlikely to Hit $10 Trillion This Cycle, Says Analyst","Prominent crypto analyst Chris Burniske , former head of crypto at ARK Invest and managing partner at Placeholder , believes that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is unlikely to reach $10 trillion during the current market cycle. Burniske’s analysis comes as the total crypto market cap stands at approximately $3.48 trillion , according to TradingView data . Chris Burniske’s Perspective on Market Realities 1. Caution Amid Frenzy Burniske emphasized the importance of maintaining a realistic outlook as the market enters a period of increasing enthusiasm: “As we enter a period of increasing frenzy, it’s important to be realistic.” 2. Lessons from 2021 Predictions Burniske reminded investors of overly ambitious price targets set during the last bull cycle: BTC: Calls for $100,000 in 2021, only achieved recently. ETH: Calls for $10,000, which remain unmet. These examples underscore the potential for inflated expectations during bullish phases. Key Market Insights 1. Current Market Cap The total cryptocurrency market cap is around $3.48 trillion . While substantial, this is far below the $10 trillion target . 2. Historical Trends Past market cycles have shown significant growth, but reaching $10 trillion would require exponential gains in a short timeframe. Burniske’s Advice to Investors 1. Balance Between Holding and Profit-Taking Burniske urged investors to adopt a balanced approach: “Sure, hodl some coin forever, but also take profits in frenzies and live your life.” 2. Value of Time Over Wealth Burniske highlighted the importance of prioritizing personal well-being and time over relentless accumulation: “Time is more precious than even $BTC.” Factors Limiting a $10 Trillion Market Cap 1. Market Saturation With a growing number of crypto projects, capital is more distributed, reducing the likelihood of dramatic growth across the board. 2. Regulatory Challenges Global scrutiny and regulatory barriers can hinder rapid market expansion. 3. Macroeconomic Conditions Economic uncertainties and interest rate policies could dampen investment enthusiasm in risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Opportunities Despite Limitations 1. Continued Growth Potential Despite the unlikely $10 trillion target, the crypto market has demonstrated robust growth and innovation, particularly in areas like DeFi , NFTs , and Web3 . 2. Room for Realistic Gains Even incremental growth in the market cap represents significant opportunities for investors. Conclusion While the $10 trillion market cap may be out of reach this cycle, Chris Burniske’s insights remind investors to stay grounded and avoid over-optimistic expectations. The crypto market’s current value of $3.48 trillion reflects its significant progress and potential for steady growth. As the industry continues to mature, balancing long-term holds with strategic profit-taking remains a prudent approach.

37364171,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51627,1733635843,Ethereum ETFs See Record $428M In Inflows As This New Altcoin Reaches A New High,"Ethereum finally silenced its critics with a recent surge in price and ETF inflows. Let’s find out what is behind this reversal in fortunes and investigate whether the Ethereum-based GambleFi protocol Rollblock ($RBLK) represents a better buy at these levels, as experts predict incredible 50x moves ahead… Ethereum ($ETH) Sees A Bullish Reversal As ETF Flows Ramp Up Ethereum finally turned the corner after months of disappointing chop, adding over 8.6% this week to reach $3.88k. This rounds off an incredible monthly candle for Ethereum, which currently stands at a 60% gain for this largest smart contract chain. The Ethereum market cap has now grown to $468.8 billion, consolidating its place behind Bitcoin as the biggest altcoin. It is also currently the only cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin to have its own dedicated spot ETF on Wall Street. While inflows into these funds were disappointing throughout the summer, recently they have begun to increase rapidly, with recent inflows adding $428 million and counting. This is an incredibly bullish sign and reflects the vast appetite for Ethereum among institutional buyers. Ethereum has been pumping recently, although its current elevated price is still 19% below its all time high. The next move for Ethereum will need to target the elusive $4k level to break out from here. Recently, Ethereum whale wallets with at least 1,000 ETH rose sharply from 5.52k to 5.59k, suggesting that large whales have been accumulating quietly for some time. Rollblock ($RBLK) Presale Blazing A Trail For Gaming Transparency Rollblock ( $RBLK ) is one of the leading presale projects on the Ethereum chain and has been attracting tens of thousands of investors recently with the strength of its potential to disrupt the enormous online gambling industry. This sector is valued at over $450 billion and growing by the year, which means that Rollblock has an enormous addressable market to tap into with its blockchain-backed betting. With a fully functioning casino platform already live and generating masses of revenue, the Rollblock offer is an enticing one. Rollblock has a varied offering of over 7,000 casino classics, from poker to roulette and many exclusive new games to explore. Recently, its sports betting feature went live to great acclaim, allowing sports pundits to place bets on a massive range of international tournaments. $RBLK is set for stratospheric growth this year as the Rollblock revenue-sharing scheme will ensure a deflationary token supply going forward. Each week, the platform will take a significant portion of its operating profits and use them to buy up $RBLK tokens in huge numbers. 60% of these buys will be immediately destroyed to reduce the supply, with the remaining tokens forming a pool of staking rewards. Stage 9 coins are already selling rapidly at the presale discount of $0.041 and look set for further price hikes in the weeks ahead.

37364170,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51639,1733635783,PEPE Whale Who Turned $74 Into $6.16M Has Made Its Final Move,"A notable development in the cryptocurrency market has emerged as a PEPE whale, who turned $74 into $6.16 million, recently made a significant move after two years of inactivity. Over the past 13 days, the whale deposited its remaining 284.71 billion PEPE tokens into the Kraken exchange, drawing considerable attention from the crypto community. This activity coincides with a heightened interest in PEPE, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency based on the iconic “Pepe the Frog” meme. JUST IN: A $PEPE whale who turned $74 into $6.16M has made its final move. After 2 years of inactivity, the whale deposited its remaining 284.71B $PEPE into Kraken over the past 13 days. pic.twitter.com/RwSwoFgWgZ — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) December 5, 2024 A recent Coinbase announcement , the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, says the token is now available for trading. The exchange marked this milestone with a succinct tweet: “Wen? Now. PEPE is available for trading.” The listing on Coinbase represents a pivotal moment for PEPE, which has experienced rapid adoption since its creation earlier this year. Alongside Coinbase, Robinhood, a platform known for its accessibility to retail investors, has also added PEPE to its trading offerings. These dual listings have significantly increased the token’s accessibility and visibility, attracting a mix of retail traders and institutional investors to the market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Impact of Whale Activity on the Market The whale’s movement of PEPE tokens to Kraken raises questions about potential selling pressure on the market. Historically, substantial deposits by large holders often precede periods of increased volatility, as the tokens may be sold, introducing liquidity and potentially affecting the asset’s price. However, the broader context of PEPE’s recent listings on major platforms could offset such pressure by driving demand. The timing of the whale’s deposits suggests strategic intent, aligning with the recent surge in interest and trading volumes for PEPE. These movements have added to speculation about the token’s future price trajectory and market stability, given its history of dramatic price fluctuations. Meme Coins Gain Momentum The rise of PEPE reflects the growing popularity of meme coins, a category of cryptocurrencies often driven by community engagement and internet culture rather than traditional utility. Despite their speculative nature, meme coins like PEPE have captured a significant share of market attention, especially with the backing of mainstream exchanges such as Coinbase and Robinhood . Both platforms have contributed to a notable increase in PEPE’s trading volumes, with the token gaining a broader user base and enhanced liquidity. The listings also underscore a shift in the perception of meme coins, as they become more integrated into the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

37364169,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51637,1733634388,Ripple CLO Predicts Ripple Will Become Most Trusted Source For Enterprise Support. Here’s when,"Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer at Ripple, recently expressed optimism about the future of the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, provided regulatory clarity is achieved. In a video shared by crypto enthusiast JackTheRippler on X, Alderoty emphasized Ripple’s readiness to become the leading provider of enterprise crypto solutions in the United States once the regulatory “cloud” over the industry dissipates. “When this regulatory cloud is lifted, and we get some policy clarity in the U.S., we will then be the most trusted source for enterprise support for crypto solutions in the U.S.,” Alderoty stated. His comments underscore the significance of a clear and consistent regulatory framework for fostering innovation and ensuring trust in the cryptocurrency sector. The Challenge of Regulatory Ambiguity The lack of regulatory clarity has long been a point of contention within the U.S. cryptocurrency industry. For years, industry participants have criticized the absence of well-defined policies, arguing that the current approach stifles innovation and deters investment. This sentiment was echoed by an X user, Marcus, in response to Alderoty’s remarks. “Stuart Alderoty is 100% right. The Crypto Industry has been operating under an unregulated cloud since its inception,” Marcus commented . He highlighted the complexity of categorizing digital assets like NFTs, which function differently from traditional financial instruments. Marcus argued that inconsistent classifications and potential loopholes in regulatory frameworks complicate enforcement, further underscoring the need for comprehensive legislation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Legal Battle: A Turning Point? Ripple has been at the forefront of the regulatory debate, primarily due to its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s lawsuit, initiated in December 2020, accuses Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through its sale of XRP. Ripple has maintained that XRP is not a security and has called for clearer guidelines to govern the classification and regulation of digital assets. Alderoty’s recent comments align with Ripple’s broader narrative of advocating for regulatory clarity. The company’s legal team has repeatedly argued that ambiguity in U.S. regulations hampers Ripple and the wider industry, leaving businesses and investors uncertain about compliance requirements. The Potential for U.S. Leadership Alderoty’s confidence in Ripple’s ability to lead the U.S. market for enterprise crypto solutions stems from the company’s global track record. Ripple has established itself as a pioneer in blockchain-based payment solutions, focusing on fostering efficiency and transparency in cross-border transactions . Regulatory clarity in the U.S. would enable Ripple and similar companies to expand their operations domestically, unlocking new opportunities for growth and innovation. The implications extend beyond Ripple. Clear policies could position the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, attracting talent and capital while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity.

37362688,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659005,1733634038,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Releases Bullish End Of Year Forecast Despite Failure At $100,000","The Bitcoin price seems to be facing somewhat of a price failure since it crossed above the $100,000 price level. In the few hours after crossing above this psychological threshold, the Bitcoin price faced rejection and corrected until it reached $94,000. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself However, this correction does not necessarily signal a bleak outlook for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, especially as investor sentiment continues to hover in the extreme greed zone. According to technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still open to climbing well above $100,000 by the end of December 2024. Record Bitcoin Liquidations Shake The Market Bitcoin’s broader market dynamics and investor sentiment suggest that Bitcoin’s failure at $100,000 could be a temporary pause rather than a long-term reversal. Interestingly, a detailed analysis posted on the TradingView platform supports this outlook and offers a bold prediction for the year’s end. The analysis highlighted December 5, 2024, as a historic day for cryptocurrency liquidations. Total liquidations reached a staggering $1.1 billion, surpassing the previous record of $950 million set on August 5, 2024. The breakdown included $820 million in liquidated long positions and $280 million in liquidated short positions. Although price data from Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko shows a bottom around $93,600, the Bitcoin price dipped to $89,000–$90,000 depending on the exchange. According to the analysis, such a dramatic move is described as a “helicopter” on the BTCUSDT chart, and it reflects a cooling-off period due to overheating from all technical indicators. Despite the correction and crazy liquidations, the analyst maintained that Bitcoin’s uptrend remains intact. This is because the Fear and Greed Index, a popular sentiment indicator, remained in the “greed” zone at 71 despite Bitcoin’s sharp drop. At the time of writing, the Fear and Greed Index has increased to the “extreme greed” zone at 82, suggesting that market participants are still optimistic about Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Bold Year-End Price Prediction Interestingly, the altcoin market barely reacted to the Bitcoin price reaction, which also creates the possibility of another wave downwards before a broader market recovery. The analyst outlined a scenario for the Bitcoin price probably going on another decline and break below $90,000. The forecast suggests Bitcoin could drop further to the $84,000–$85,000 range before rallying to $110,000. Adding to the bullish narrative is the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is scheduled to take place on December 18. Market expectations point to a 0.25% rate cut by the Federal Reserve, a move that could inject further momentum into Bitcoin’s price recovery much like the September and November rate cuts.

Particularly, addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have increased their collective holdings by 20,000 BTC in the past 24 hours, valued at $2 billion.

Interestingly, the analysis indicates that, as XRP soared from Nov. 5, it already achieved four major targets previously set by the analyst.https://twitter.com/Cryptobilbuwoo0/status/1863829790765297668These targets include $0.64, which XRP breached on Nov. 12, and $0.915, which gave way on Nov. 16. Notably, XRP successfully claimed the $1.13 target on Nov. 17, and further went on to reach the $1.612 target on Nov. 23. Cryptobilbuwoo anticipates further upward momentum, identifying $3.3 as the next target. Beyond this, he has presented two targets of $6.15 and $26.6 with even more ambitious targets stretching as high as $589. According to him, $6.15 and $26.6 are the two profit-taking targets.Data from his chart shows that the parabolic structure suggests a continuation of the upward trend, indicating strong buy-side momentum. However, XRP must maintain the $2 price level to sustain the bullish push.Indicators Suggest Rally Remains IntactMeanwhile, Levi, another prominent analyst, presented a comparison between XRP and Tesla’s stock. He noted that Tesla traded sideways for seven years before skyrocketing after resolving an SEC lawsuit. Levi argued that XRP exhibits a similar trajectory, having been “suppressed” for seven years due to its ongoing regulatory challenges with the SEC. Several other industry pundits also hold this sentiment . XRP and Tesla Stock Comparison | Levi According to Levi, XRP could sustain its uptrend, potentially reaching new all-time highs. The analyst noted the importance of patience, suggesting that long-term holders could reap substantial rewards as the market unfolds. Also, market commentator Harry revealed that XRP has yet to retest its monthly breakout levels, which remain important support zones. Currently, XRP is trading between its 2017 weekly and monthly all-time highs. https://twitter.com/HaraldoXRP/status/1865192337841734138Harry confirmed the importance of mounting buy-side pressure and a consolidation pattern forming a flag. If the flag breaks to the upside, he predicts a sharp rally to new heights.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

This was somewhat expected, given Trump’s pro-bitcoin stance during his campaign as he appeared at the annual BTC conference in the States and even paid for a burger with the asset. Although several altcoins registered impressive gains within the same timeframe, bitcoin’s dominance shot up to nearly 60% on CoinGecko and well above that number on other resources like CoinMarketCap and TradingView. Now, though, the landscape seems to be changing even though BTC flew past $100,000 earlier this week and painted a fresh all-time high of over $103,500. The first major signs of altcoin season became clear this week, with altcoins reclaiming a significant share of the overall market dominance pic.twitter.com/S5PeAcnbq6 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 6, 2024 The community has long speculated about the start of a new altcoin season – a time period in which alternative coins are registering massive gains, especially compared to BTC. These periods, usually lasting a few months, come after a noteworthy surge from bitcoin itself. The declining BTC market dominance in the past week is among the strongest indicators that alts’ time has arrived. Perhaps this is most evident in ETH’s performance. The largest altcoin was somewhat sluggish after the elections and increased in a modest fashion from around $2,600 to $3,000, where it stood for a while. However, it began to increase in value more substantially in the past ten days or so and jumped above $4,000 for the first time since March on Friday evening. Consequently, it caught up to other massive gainers during this cycle, such as XRP, DOGE, XLM, HBAR, and many more. In fact, CoinGecko’s data shows that BTC is near the bottom in terms of the biggest gainers in the past month from the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Its ‘modest’ increase of 32% is far away from the leaders like HBAR (612%), XLM (403%), XRP (350%), ALGO (309%), IOTA (307%), SAND (250%), etc. Many industry experts have speculated about the environment around this cycle’s altcoin season. Earlier this month, CryptoQuant’s CEO said the altseason will be a lot different than previous ones, as only a handful of assets will exceed the expectations.

According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, Bitcoin is forming a new pattern in the short term that we should keep an eye on. Here’s a breakdown of his analysis: Bitcoin’s Bullish Market Overview The analyst said that Bitcoin is clearly still in a bull market. The weekly RSI is signaling a strong bullish trend, which has led to major bull runs in the past. The MACD is also showing bullish signs, similar to last year when it predicted a major rally that lasted for months. Based on these indicators, it’s likely that the bull market could continue into 2025. Resistance and Price Targets for Bitcoin Currently, Bitcoin is facing resistance level at around $102,000, which is the 1618 Fibonacci extension level. If Bitcoin can break above this, we could see a move towards $113,000. The next key price target is $113,000, but it’s still a while before Bitcoin might reach $300,000, which could take a few more years and possibly the next bull market. For support, Bitcoin is holding at around $89,000. Short-term, the price is consolidating around $100,000, and we might see sideways movement for a while as the market cools off. Bitcoin is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, with support around $99,000 and resistance around $102,000. A breakout above $102,000 could push the price towards $108,000, while a break below support could lead to a move down to around $93,000. Bitcoin Liquidity Heat Map The Bitcoin liquidation heat map shows significant liquidity building around $104,000 to $105,000. If Bitcoin breaks above this level, we could see a short squeeze, pushing the price higher. There are also other liquidity levels between $102,000 and $105,000, which could play a role in future price action. Bitcoin Dominance Drops, Altcoin Season Begins The Bitcoin dominance chart is showing a decline, currently at around 55%, after breaking a key support level at 57%.

XRP is currently holding above the 2021 high, which was around $1.96. The price recently broke above this key level and has not dropped back below it yet. Current Wave Structure: In terms of market structure , XRP is likely in the fourth wave of a larger third wave within an ongoing bullish cycle. The recent pullback has followed a three-wave pattern, and this is seen as a correction that should lead into a fifth wave that could push the price into the $5 to $10 range. While it’s possible the price could move slightly higher, this remains the most reasonable expectation for now, but it may change as more data becomes available. Support and Resistance Levels: Looking at support, the critical range lies between $1.50 and $1.79. As long as the price stays above this support area, the bullish scenario remains valid. In terms of resistance, the next levels to watch are $2.60, $2.73, and $2.81. These levels could act as potential points where the price may face selling pressure if the upward trend continues. Price Action and Expectations: At the moment, XRP is likely experiencing a correction within the larger uptrend, which is part of the fourth wave. This wave is expected to complete before the price moves higher. If the price breaks below the $2.38 and $2.17 levels, this would suggest that a downside move is incoming. However, there is strong support around the 2021 high, which should help stabilize the price. Even though the market is currently in a temporary correction, there’s no sign of a crash. Corrections can sometimes be significant in the crypto market, but they are a normal part of the cycle, especially during bullish phases.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-8/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

With the bulls maintaining their grip on this critical support level, speculation is rising about whether this could be the calm before a bullish storm. As market sentiment remains optimistic, this analysis examines UNI’s current price action by evaluating technical indicators to determine if it can gather enough momentum for a breakout rally. Could this period of stabilization set the stage for further upside? Let’s explore the technical setup and market dynamics that are shaping this crucial moment for Uniswap. Analyzing Uniswap Consolidation Phase And Market Signals UNI’s price on the 4-hour chart shows signs of upside momentum as it eyes a potential breakout toward the critical $20 resistance level. Holding above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) strengthens the bullish case, indicating growing confidence among buyers. This positioning highlights UNI’s capacity to push higher and sustain its upward trajectory, provided key resistance levels are cleared. Additionally, an examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable climb, with the indicator reaching the 72% threshold after rebounding from a recent low of 69%. This sharp increase reflects a robust surge in bullish momentum, as intensified buying pressure has propelled the RSI into overbought territory. Such a shift indicates a significant change in market sentiment, signaling heightened confidence among traders and investors. Related Reading: Uniswap Processes Over $2 Trillion On Ethereum: UNI Bull Run Inevitable? The move into overbought levels suggests that demand for Uniswap has surged, often indicative of potential near-term price growth. However, the elevated RSI also calls for caution, as it may hint at a correction period or a minor pullback before the uptrend resumes. UNI’s Path Forward: Momentum Builds Above $17 Uniswap’s price has firmly stabilized above the $17 level, demonstrating a shift in market dynamics as upbeat momentum starts to gain traction. This crucial support zone provides a solid base for further upward movement, with technical indicators pointing to growing buying pressure. If the bulls can sustain this uptrend, a breakout toward higher resistance levels, such as $20, may be imminent. Related Reading: Uniswap: Market Swing Yields 12% Gains – Can UNI Sustain The Momentum? However, traders should closely monitor market conditions, as a failure to sustain the current bullish momentum could lead to a correction or pullback, causing the price to drop toward the $17 support level. If Uniswap fails to hold above this key level, a break below $17 could signal a deeper decline, with the next possible support zones being the 100-day SMA and the $11.8 level. Such a scenario would indicate weakening market sentiment and an extended drop could set the stage for additional bearish pressure.

37359992,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623811,1733628600,Ethereum Whales Signal a Major Shift: Why This DeFi Blockchain Is Gaining Momentum,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) world is abuzz with a new development—Ethereum whales are signaling a massive shift that could shape the future of blockchain innovation. While Ethereum has remained the leading force in DeFi, its growth and adoption are creating ripples, attracting attention from some of the biggest players in the space. What’s driving this momentum? And how could it impact your next move in crypto investments? We’ll break down the growing interest in Ethereum’s ecosystem, its implications for DeFi enthusiasts, and explore how this evolution ties into groundbreaking tech like the Lightchain Protocol AI . The Role Ethereum Plays in DeFi Growth Ethereum has long been the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. Its ability to execute smart contracts, support dApps (decentralized applications), and foster innovation has consistently made it a top pick for investors. What truly sets Ethereum apart and attracts “whales”—wealthy individuals or large entities controlling significant volumes of crypto—is its multi-functionality. More than 70% of DeFi projects are built on Ethereum, ranging from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to lending platforms like Aave and Compound. The result? Ethereum’s ecosystem isn’t just growing; it’s revolutionizing traditional finance by offering borderless, programmable money. But Ethereum’s dominance is about more than convenience—it’s also about trust. Investors know that Ethereum is here to stay. With Ethereum whales increasing their holdings, a signal of confidence in the platform, the blockchain cements its relevance in a space that’s constantly evolving. Why Are Ethereum Whales Accumulating? 1. Stability Amid Volatility Crypto markets are known for their volatility, but Ethereum offers a relatively stable asset due to its widespread adoption. The Ethereum Merge, which transitioned the network to Proof of Stake (PoS), reduced energy consumption by over 99%. This aligned Ethereum with ESG (environmental, social, and governance) priorities, making it a safer bet for long-term holders. 2. The Rise of Layer-2 Solutions Whales also see potential in Ethereum’s Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. These upgrades drastically lower gas fees and transaction times, making Ethereum-based applications faster and more affordable. The boom in Layer-2 adoption has injected new life into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative. 3. The Development of Ethereum 2.0 The promised enhancements of Ethereum 2.0—like lower fees, increased speed, and even better network security—are another catalyst. Smart investors don’t want to wait on the sidelines while the platform transforms into an even more powerful decentralized network armed with scalability and sustainability. Ethereum vs. Competition What’s pushing Ethereum above its competitors in the DeFi race? While blockchains like Solana and BNB Chain offer high throughput and lower costs, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage and ecosystem depth remain unmatched. Furthermore, innovations like the development of Ethereum’s zk-Rollups (zero-knowledge proof technology) and compatibility with other blockchain ecosystems ensure it retains a competitive lead. Ethereum whales recognize that projects leveraging these technologies are laying the foundation for mainstream blockchain adoption. What This Means for Investors Ethereum’s growing momentum is a wake-up call for the crypto-curious and seasoned investors alike. For smaller investors, following whale movements offers unique insights into strategic investments. When whales invest in Ethereum, it creates a ripple effect, inspiring confidence across the market. This is not only about holding ETH—it’s also an invitation to dig into Ethereum-powered opportunities such as DeFi applications, staking, and exploring Web3 innovations. Each application represents a platform for investors to diversify and grow alongside Ethereum. Exciting Synergies with Technological Evolution The growth of Ethereum also aligns seamlessly with innovations like the Lightchain Protocol AI —a trailblazing platform revolutionizing the blockchain and AI landscape. Why Consider Lightchain AI? Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms, Lightchain rewards nodes for valuable AI computations. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): This groundbreaking computational layer directly integrates AI into blockchain infrastructures, elevating Ethereum’s use cases even further. Decentralized Governance: Lightchain merges blockchain functionality with community-driven governance, empowering investors with transparent, equitable decision-making. With ventures like Lightchain revolutionizing AI-powered decentralized applications, Ethereum ecosystems will continue to evolve, providing greater flexibility for developers and users alike. Worth noting, Lightchain Protocol AI tokens are currently in presale —meaning early adopters are uniquely positioned to benefit. What’s Next for Crypto Enthusiasts? The signals are clear—Ethereum whales are making intentional moves, and the shift in momentum highlights the incredible capabilities of this DeFi blockchain. Whether you’re a first-time investor or a seasoned pro navigating Web3, Ethereum offers endless opportunities to participate, profit, and innovate. But why stop at Ethereum? Platforms like Lightchain are bridging blockchain and artificial intelligence, creating synergies that will define the next phase of DeFi.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field.

BTFD Coin’s New Presale Is the Best Meme Coin Opportunity You Can’t Afford to Miss,"If you thought meme coins were just a passing fad, think again. From Dogecoin’s mainstream breakthrough to Shiba Inu’s viral success, these coins have become a cornerstone of the crypto world. Why? Because they offer more than just laughs—they deliver serious opportunities for high returns. Over the years, meme coins have evolved from simple internet jokes to full-blown financial movements with loyal communities, innovative ecosystems, and staggering ROI potential. One name that’s making waves right now is BTFD Coin (BTFD) . It’s not just a meme—it’s a mindset. BTFD coin speaks directly to crypto enthusiasts who thrive on market dips and love making bold plays. With its explosive presale already breaking records, BTFD is taking the meme coin frenzy to a whole new level. And for those who missed out on Goatseus Maximus, BTFD Coin is the ultimate redemption story waiting to be written. Meme coins like Goatseus Maximus proved that quirky branding and a strong community can create waves in the crypto space. But with BTFD’s innovative features and skyrocketing presale numbers, it’s clear that this coin isn’t just following the meme coin trend—it’s redefining it. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins BTFD Coin isn’t here to play—it’s here to dominate. Sure, the name might get a chuckle, but behind the meme lies a serious investment opportunity that’s got crypto enthusiasts buzzing. The presale has already raised over $1.35, with 29 billion coins sold and counting. Currently priced at $0.000064 in Stage 8, BTFD is set to list at $0.0006 when it hits the exchanges. That’s a massive opportunity for anyone looking to cash in early. What makes BTFD Coin stand out in a sea of meme coins? Let’s start with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game . Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD is building a fully interactive gaming experience where players can earn $BTFD tokens just by having fun. Imagine gaming not just for entertainment but for financial growth. That’s a game-changer, and it’s one of the reasons BTFD is being touted as the best ongoing meme coin presale to join now. Then there’s staking, which is perfect for those who want to earn while holding. With an impressive APY, BTFD Coin rewards its holders for staying loyal. Staking isn’t just about earning more—it’s about being part of the Bulls Squad, a thriving community that’s already 3,100 members strong and growing by the day. But let’s get real about the numbers because that’s where things get spicy. Imagine you’d invested $4,000 during Stage 5 of the presale when BTFD was priced at $0.00005. That would’ve snagged you 80 million tokens. Fast forward to its exchange listing at $0.0006, and your initial investment could skyrocket to $48,000. That’s the kind of upside that makes BTFD the ultimate play in today’s meme coin market. BTFD isn’t just another coin; it’s a movement that blends fun, finance, and community like never before. And with the presale heating up, now’s the time to grab your piece of the action. Goatseus Maximus: A Meme Coin with Legendary Status If you’ve been following meme coins, you’ve probably heard of Goatseus Maximus. With its bold branding and larger-than-life persona, this coin managed to carve out its place in the meme coin hall of fame. Goatseus Maximus tapped into the mythical vibe, building a loyal following of investors who believed in its epic potential. Goatseus Maximus wasn’t just a meme—it was a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts who love a good underdog story. Its community was tight-knit, its branding was unforgettable, and its early gains were jaw-dropping. For a while, it seemed like Goatseus Maximus was unstoppable. But as with many meme coins, the hype eventually cooled off. While Goatseus Maximus remains a fan favorite, its ecosystem didn’t evolve in the way investors hoped. With newer projects like BTFD Coin bringing more features, utility, and innovation to the table, Goatseus Maximus feels more like a nostalgic icon than a cutting-edge opportunity. That said, Goatseus Maximus is proof that meme coins aren’t just about the money—they’re about the culture, the community, and the thrill of being part of something bigger. If you missed the Goatseus Maximus train, don’t sweat it. There’s always another chance to strike gold, and BTFD Coin is offering exactly that. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Explosive Presale Meme coins have redefined what it means to invest in crypto. They’re fun, they’re bold, and when you play your cards right, they’re incredibly rewarding. Goatseus Maximus showed us the power of a strong community and creative branding, but BTFD Coin is taking things to the next level with its P2E game, staking rewards, and record-breaking presale numbers. With over $1.35 already raised and more than 29 billion coins sold, BTFD Coin is the best ongoing meme coin presale to join now. The presale price is rising fast, and the listing price of $0.0006 promises significant returns for early investors. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto trader or just dipping your toes into the market, BTFD Coin is the kind of opportunity you don’t want to miss. So what are you waiting for? Join the Bulls Squad today and claim your stake in the next big thing in crypto. Sign up with your email, grab your BTFD tokens, and get ready to ride this rocket to the moon.

With traditional investments becoming old news for Millennials and Gen Z, savvy investors are turning to top-tier crypto projects to secure their financial futures. If you’ve been on the hunt for the best coins to invest in now, you’re in the right place. The market is packed with innovative projects pushing the boundaries of blockchain tech. Among them, Qubetics is making waves with its presale success, Polkadot is cementing its status as a staple in the crypto ecosystem, and SEI is driving decentralised finance (DeFi) innovation like a pro. So, which one should you bet your chips on? Let’s break it down. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Aggregation If you haven’t heard about Qubetics yet, it’s time to get with the programme. Dubbed the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is rewriting the rulebook with its multi-functional ecosystem designed to make Web3 tools accessible to everyone. And let’s be honest—nobody likes juggling ten different platforms just to keep up with the blockchain. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for developers. Imagine this: You’re a coder creating smart contracts, and instead of wasting hours figuring out which chain to deploy them on, QubeQode IDE lets you do it all in one place. It’s the ultimate shortcut. For example, a small business could deploy a tokenised rewards programme on Ethereum and Polygon without breaking a sweat. For more on how QubeQode IDE works, watch this video . The project doesn’t stop there. Qubetics is also diving into Real World Asset Tokenization, which is fancy talk for turning tangible assets like real estate or art into blockchain tokens. This isn’t just geeky tech—it’s the future of making investing in high-value assets easier for everyday people. Think of being able to own a piece of a skyscraper in Manhattan or a Picasso painting without needing millions in the bank. But wait, there’s more. Qubetics offers a Decentralized VPN, ideal for privacy-conscious individuals or businesses tired of snooping eyes. Picture freelancers securely connecting with international clients or gamers avoiding bandwidth throttling during heated online matches. And let’s not sleep on its Multi-Chain Wallet, which makes managing assets across multiple blockchains feel as easy as Venmoing your roommate for pizza. With its presale already raising over $4.8 million, selling more than 280 million tokens to 7,200 holders, and analysts predicting major surges in $TICS value, Qubetics is the crypto equivalent of a ticket to Coachella before the lineup drops. Currently priced at $0.0282 in its 11th stage, this is one opportunity you don’t want to miss before the price jumps again. For more insights, watch this video . Polkadot: The OG of Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot has been on the scene for a while, and let’s just say it’s not going anywhere. Known for its trailblazing tech in blockchain interoperability, Polkadot acts like a translator at the UN, connecting blockchains so they can finally speak the same language. This makes it a go-to for developers and investors who are tired of siloed networks. Polkadot’s unique parachain model allows multiple blockchains to operate simultaneously, offering scalability and speed. It’s like turning a single-lane highway into a multi-lane freeway—no more traffic jams. This tech is why Polkadot consistently ranks among the best coins to invest in now for both long-term hodlers and day traders. Investors love Polkadot for its staying power. Over the years, it’s not just survived crypto winters—it’s thrived. Think of it as the dependable, all-terrain vehicle of crypto. Whether you’re looking to dip your toes into DeFi or explore NFT markets, Polkadot has you covered. Its robust ecosystem supports hundreds of projects, from decentralised apps (dApps) to cross-chain DeFi protocols. For Millennials and Gen Z, Polkadot isn’t just about tech—it’s about vibes. It’s seen as the reliable yet innovative option, offering strong potential returns while keeping its risks in check. If you’re searching for a coin that’s already proven its worth but still has room to grow, Polkadot should definitely be on your radar. SEI: Redefining DeFi with High-Speed Innovation If Polkadot is the old guard, SEI is the scrappy newcomer making all the right moves. SEI Network is carving its niche in DeFi with a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for decentralised finance applications. Think of SEI as a luxury sports car in a world of sedans—it’s sleek, fast, and designed for performance. What sets SEI apart is its order-book model, which is built directly into the blockchain. This unique feature makes trading as seamless as swiping right on your dating app. The speed? Unmatched. SEI can process thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for high-frequency traders and liquidity providers. Since its launch, SEI has gained a cult following among DeFi enthusiasts, and it’s easy to see why. With traditional financial systems becoming less appealing to younger generations, SEI offers a decentralised alternative that’s as efficient as it is innovative. Projects built on SEI range from derivatives trading platforms to yield farming protocols, proving that it’s more than just hype. For crypto investors who believe DeFi is the future (and let’s be real, who doesn’t?), SEI is a no-brainer. Its focus on creating a seamless user experience and fostering developer-friendly tools makes it one of the best coins to invest in now. Conclusion: Make Your Move Before It’s Too Late So, there you have it: three crypto heavyweights making waves in 2024. Whether you’re intrigued by Qubetics’ all-in-one Web3 solutions, Polkadot’s battle-tested blockchain tech, or SEI’s DeFi innovations, the opportunities are endless. But here’s the kicker—crypto doesn’t wait for anyone. The best moves are made early, and the window to grab a piece of these projects at their current value won’t stay open forever. Ready to dive in?

However, Santiment states these mining wallets have now transferred out 85,503 BTC, valued at $8.56 billion, over the last 48 hours, which represents the largest drop in miner balances since late February prior to Bitcoin’s surge to $73,000. Generally, increased outflows from miners could indicate a bearish shift in price momentum. However, the team at Santiment postulates the recent BTC offload should be considered a net-neutral signal with no inking on Bitcoin’s price movement. This notion is based on Bitcoin miner balances showing a weak correlation with price for the majority of 2024. Moreover, non-mining whales and sharks continue to accumulate Bitcoin signaling confidence among investors in the asset’s profitability despite miner activity. Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently provided some update on this accumulation trend stating that BTC whales have acquired 20,000 BTC, valued at $2 billion, over the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the constant decline in miner balances remains an important concern for Bitcoin investors. Aside from an ability to induce a bearish sentiment, miners transferring out BTC may draw speculations over mining profitability, which is critical to sustaining the Bitcoin network.

This breakout in PEPE follows a prolonged consolidation phase lasting more than three weeks. PEPE Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, PEPE has broken out of a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern, closing a strong daily candle above the pole of the pattern. However, this breakout has shifted the overall sentiment among traders and investors. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that PEPE could soar by 45% to reach the $0.000036 level in the coming days. However, this price prediction is entirely based on the pattern breakout. Additionally, this breakout has propelled PEPE to a new all-time high, and it is expected to continue its upward rally, potentially setting another record. On the positive side, PEPE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61, which is below the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that PEPE has sufficient room to rise significantly in the coming days. Bullish On-Chain Metrics Following this breakout, traders’ and whales’ interest and confidence in the meme coin have skyrocketed, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Massive PEPE Outflow PEPE’s spot inflow/outflow data reveals that exchanges have experienced a significant outflow of $9.10 million since the breakout. In the cryptocurrency context, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses for long-term holding. Outflows from exchanges often indicate potential buying opportunities, reduce the likelihood of a price decline, and suggest the possibility of an upside rally. Rising Open Interest In addition to the interest from whales and institutions, traders’ participation has surged since the meme coin broke out of its bullish pattern. According to the data, PEPE’s open interest (OI) has increased by 40%, indicating heightened trader activity and the formation of new positions. Current Price Momentum At press time, PEPE is trading near $0.000025 and has experienced a price surge of over 16% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 110%, reflecting heightened participation from traders and investors driven by the recent breakout.",POSITIVE,PEPE,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pepe-price-predication-for-december-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Binance rolled out trading services for the interoperability protocol Across ( ACX ) and the Solana ( SOL )-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Orca ( ORCA ). The native tokens of both platforms witnessed massive gains on Friday, with ACX surging by nearly 88% and ORCA jumping by almost 80%. Those represented the largest gains of any top 1,000 tokens by market cap that day, according to CoinGecko . Across aims to be a “new paradigm in cross-chain experiences” and is powered by cross-chain intents, which are types of orders where users specify outcomes instead of execution paths. Meanwhile, Orca aims to offer “the most user-friendly environment for traders and LPs (liquidity providers) of varying experience levels.” Binance will attach seed tags to both assets, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. The platform requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens. ACX, the 244th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $1.07 at time of writing. OCRA, the 282nd-ranked asset, is trading at $6.98.

According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s short-term price action may now enter a phase of consolidation and “choppy” movements. “The 14-day Choppiness Index is in an early zone showing corrective moves during consolidation,” wrote CryptoQuant contributor Percival in a blog post on Dec. 6. The Choppiness Index (CI) measures market conditions on a scale of 0-100. Higher values indicate more erratic or “choppy” price action, while lower values suggest trending movements. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s daily CI was at 56.7, its highest level since mid-August, suggesting ongoing consolidation after the recent price swings. “One thing to take into account is the time factor of consolidation. In the 2020/2021 cycles, there were 20 days of downtime, and in the consolidation since March, the average decline was ~20 days,” Percival explained. “The greater the consolidation, the greater the rise.” While this period of cooling off may frustrate Bitcoin bulls, analysts predict that longer consolidation could lead to a stronger breakout. Potential BTC Targets: $110,000 and Beyond Looking ahead, CryptoQuant highlights potential price targets for Bitcoin once the consolidation ends. Percival suggests that key resistance levels will emerge at $110,000 and $120,000, based on market psychology and the realized price of short-term holders (STHs). “The first level will be $110K (+1.5 standard deviations), a considerable profit zone for STH,” he noted. “As traders connect to psychological numbers, $120K has a very impactful psychological and emotional charge, and being a value within +2 standard deviations makes this floor a deeper consolidation camp.” Bitcoin’s next major move remains to be seen, but patient bulls could be rewarded with significant price gains.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-faces-choppy-price-movements-amid-consolidation-with-110000-in-target/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK.

37354098,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659011,1733617820,"Ethereum Price Breakout: Charting The Uncertain Part Of ETH To $18,000","Crypto analyst BallaJi has provided insights into how the Ethereum price breakout could happen and even raised the possibility of ETH reaching $18,000. Ethereum currently boasts a bullish outlook, having recently broken above $4,000 for the first time since March of this year. How The Ethereum Price Could Reach $18,000 In a TradingView post, BallaJi predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $18,000. The crypto analyst explained that based on logarithmic projections, the measured move of this HVF could send Ethereum to the target. He provided a caveat, stating that the price rally to the target might not happen in 2025. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price At $100,000 Is A ‘Dangerous Zone’, Predicts Massive Crash However, he is confident that if this bullish pattern is completed, then the Ethereum price could reach this $18,000 price target later on this decade. A rally to this price target would give Ethereum a market cap of around $2 trillion based on its circulating supply of 120.44 million ETH. Meanwhile, BallaJi highlighted three logarithmic targets on the chart, with $18,000 being the third and last target. The first and second targets are at $3,818 and $6,236 respectively. In an update on the trade setup, the crypto analyst noted that the Ethereum price has reached, broken, and retested the first target at $3,818. With the trade now active, BallaJi provided insights into how the Ethereum price could continue this upward trend using linear measured moves. The accompanying chart he shared showed that the next linear target is at $5,193; a rally to that target would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for ETH, with its current ATH at $4,800. Meanwhile, the next linear target is at $7,299. BallaJi’s chart showed that the Ethereum price should hit these price targets by next year. A rally to the $7,299 target could then pave the way for ETH to reach $18,000, although the analyst already warned that it might not happen in 2025. Countdown To New ATH Has Begun In an X post, crypto analyst Justin Bennett stated that the countdown to a new ATH for the Ethereum price has begun. According to the analyst, ETH could rally quickly above $5,000 as it breaks several levels this week. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the quick rally above $5,000 could lead Ethereum to hit $6,300. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Analysis: Ascending Triangle On 2-Hour Chart Shows DOGE Is Still Very Bullish Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also predicted that an Ethereum price rally to $5,000 is imminent. He stated that ETH’s market structure mirrors BTC’s from a few weeks ago. He remarked that the $5,000 target is just the minimum as he believes that Ethereum will likely go higher.

With meme coins taking the crypto world by storm, it’s no surprise they’ve become the favourite alternative to traditional investments. From wild speculation to genuine utility, projects like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Sudeng (HIPPO) have set the standard, and now BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, shaking up the scene with its explosive presale. Jumping into stage 8 of its presale, BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin launches. Having already raised over $1.35 million in under ten days, with 29 billion coins sold to 3,100 holders, it’s no exaggeration to say this is one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in this week. With utilities like staking rewards and a bold Play2Earn game, BTFD Coin offers more than just a shot at the moon—it’s a full-blown movement. BTFD Coin: A Bullish Movement in the Making BTFD isn’t just another crypto; it’s a lifestyle, a mindset, and a rallying cry for those ready to seize the dip. With roots in Ethereum’s secure and scalable blockchain, BTFD promises decentralisation, liquidity, and a chance for all traders—newbies and veterans alike—to enter at prime prices. Breaking Down the Numbers In its seventh presale stage, BTFD Coin is selling for $0.000064. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, nearly half—48%—is allocated for the presale. By the 10th stage, the price is projected to climb to $0.0006, presenting an unparalleled entry point. Play2Earn Game & Staking Rewards One of BTFD’s most exciting features is its upcoming Play2Earn game. Launching in phase 8, the game transforms crypto engagement into an immersive experience, letting players earn tokens while competing in a vibrant digital world. Add staking rewards into the mix, boasting an impressive 90% APY, and you’ve got a coin that not only entertains but builds wealth for the long haul. Why Meme Coins Matter Meme coins thrive on community-driven momentum. Think of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu—what started as jokes quickly turned into a cultural phenomena. BTFD leverages this power, uniting dip-buyers in a bold movement that’s already turning heads in the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Meme Coin Powerhouse Dogwifhat is more than a quirky name; it’s a community-driven project that has earned its place as one of the go-to investments in the meme coin space. Launched on Solana, WIF capitalises on low transaction fees and high-speed processing to attract a devoted following. WIF isn’t just surviving the meme coin frenzy; it’s thriving. With 53% green days in the past month, Dogwifhat has become a beacon of stability in a volatile market. Its Fear & Greed Index consistently sits in “Extreme Greed,” highlighting strong investor confidence. Dogwifhat is known for its meme-heavy branding and its ability to foster a sense of belonging among its holders. Social media buzz and gamified features keep its community engaged, ensuring WIF’s place as a long-term contender in the crypto space. Sudeng (HIPPO): The Meme Coin With a Purpose Inspired by Thailand’s beloved baby pygmy hippo, Moo Deng, Sudeng (HIPPO) combines the whimsy of meme coins with a real-world mission. Built on the Sui blockchain, it supports wildlife conservation efforts, making it a coin with a conscience. Sudeng’s explosive 90% surge following its Binance futures listing is a testament to its staying power. By blending meme culture with philanthropic causes, HIPPO taps into a unique niche, offering investors both emotional and financial returns. HIPPO thrives on a vibrant community that rallies around its mascot and mission. From themed campaigns to international collaborations, Sudeng’s strategy shows how meme coins can transcend the digital world, creating real-world impact. Conclusion Based on the current market dynamics, it’s clear that meme coins are here to stay. Whether it’s the stability and growth of Dogwifhat, the philanthropic charm of Sudeng, or the bold ambition of BTFD Coin, each offers unique opportunities for investors. However, BTFD Coin’s presale is where the real excitement lies. With over $1.35 million raised, 29 billion coins sold, and features like staking rewards and a Play2Earn game, it stands out as one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in this week.

37354548,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51630,1733616012,Ethereum Whales Diversify Into PropiChain as Cardano (ADA) Falls Behind in Q4 Gains,"The cryptocurrency market continues to experience significant upward momentum as Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) prices surge and other tokens reach all-time highs. Looking for more 1000x calls, it’s only fair that Ethereum (ETH) and other crypto whales are investing in new opportunities that will multiply their portfolio. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA), once an investor favorite, has faced challenges and underperformance in Q4. As a result, investors are turning their attention elsewhere. One coin gaining significant attention is PropiChain , a token that aims to revolutionize the real estate investment industry by storm. It tokenizes real-world assets, enabling fractional property ownership and management. Let’s see why PropiChain (PCHAIN) is becoming the preferred choice for smart investors. The Current Overview of Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is not a newcomer to the crypto landscape. It broke into the space in 2017. With its promise of solving cryptocurrency issues involving scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance, Cardano (ADA) quickly rose to the limelight. It did so well that by May 2021, the coin had reached a market cap of $77 billion , ranking among the highest-performing cryptocurrencies . However, recent trends show that Cardano (ADA), despite its ambitious promises, has yet to deliver key features, leaving some investors exploring newer opportunities. A cryptocurrency that once traded at an all-time high of $3.099 currently sells for $1.203 and has a market cap of $42.64B . In the last 24 hours alone, Cardano (ADA) has experienced a significant drop of over 4.4%. Of course, this could be due to Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) whales selling off ahead of the next big thing. If Cardano (ADA) continues to surge and hits the all-time high (ATH) of $3.099, investors can expect an ROI of about 220%. However, PropiChain offers a more promising solution. It promises an ROI of over 10,000x and practical real estate investment opportunities. Can Ethereum Hold the Momentum? The market has been looking bullish for holders of Ethereum (ETH) as the coin continues to target new resistance levels. Ethereum (ETH) currently trades at $3790 , and the market seems primed. As more investors get in on the pump, Ethereum (ETH) is expected to continue to trade at even higher prices. However, even with this bullish forecast, Ethereum investors are increasingly exploring tokens with tangible utility.
