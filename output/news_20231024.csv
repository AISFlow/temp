Latest News: Sam Bankman-Fried Will Take the Stand in His Own Defense  The DOJ also said it now only intends to call a single witness when the trial resumes Thursday, and asked Judge Lewis Kaplan to require the defense team to begin presenting its case right after.  The court had previously agreed to let the defense start after lunch on Thursday, when the DOJ expected to call two or three witnesses, including an FTX customer and investor. The defense has proposed six witnesses to start its case, the filing said. The DOJ filing did not name any of the potential defense witnesses, and it's still unclear whether Bankman-Fried himself will testify.  A Monday filing previously said the defense intended to call PF2 Securities employee Joseph Pimbley as an expert witness on financial flows.  The filing also suggested the defense may have a short case, though it's unclear whether the defense actually expects to rest early or is just saying it may.  ""In addition, the Government respectfully requests that if the defense rests on Thursday or Friday morning, that the Court hold a charge conference on Friday afternoon, so that the parties can proceed to closing arguments on Monday morning,"" the filing said.  A separate filing from the defense pushed back on one of the DOJ's proposed jury instructions, ""because it presupposes an intent to steal from customers, which Mr. Bankman-Fried did not possess.""  In a late Tuesday filing, the DOJ pushed back against the defense letter, saying the wording choices Bankman-Fried's team requested were confusing or might be inaccurate on the issues.

19333934,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557378,1698188420,"This Pattern Points To $10,000+ Ethereum Price, But When?","This week, Bitcoin and other altcoins livened up the crypto market, potentially lifting up Ethereum price and saving it from further collapse. With ETH now moving away from the bottom trend line of a massive long-term price pattern, the next possible target is the upper trend line of the same pattern. That target points to $10,000 per Ether, but how long might it take to reach the lofty price objective? Ethereum Rising Wedge Targets $10,000 Or More For almost its entire history of price action, ETHUSD has been filling out what appears to be a massive rising wedge pattern. Such patterns are predominantly bearish, breaking down roughly 60% of the time. That leaves 40% of the time that these patterns break upward. Descriptions of the pattern reveal that wedges are notoriously prone to false breakouts and/or false breakdowns, where price violates one trend line, only to reverse and target the other. Related Reading: Failed Bullish Pattern Could Send Ethereum Sub-$1000 In the latest case, however, Ethereum is holding the bottom line. This makes the next logical target the upper trend line, with at least some probability that it can break upward still. The trend line, happens to be located at around $10,000 per ETH currently and rises with each passing day. When ETHUSD touches the upper trend line is still up for question, but considering the length of past rallies lasting anywhere between six months to a year, it may be less of a wait than many expect. Is $10,000 per ETH next? | ETHUSD on TradingView.com Is This The Beginning Or End of ETH? Ever wonder why a rising wedge pattern can break upward if it is a bearish pattern? In Elliott Wave Principle, wedges fall into the diagonal family of patterns. Diagonals can be leading or ending, expanding on contracting. A leading diagonal kicks off a sustained move. It’s wedge-like appearance is deceiving as traders expect the pattern to break down, yet instead it breaks upward. In contrast, an ending diagonal finishes off a sustained move. In this case, the bearish breakdown that should be expected in a rising wedge plays out. Related Reading: Ethereum News Catalyst Could Trigger Triangle Breakout To $4,000 Ethereum is potentially in a massive diagonal pattern, not the rising wedge that it appears. What we also don’t know is if this is the beginning of a larger sustained move and a leading diagonal, or the end of the largest altcoin’s dominance capped off by an ending diagonal. Both patterns form in a five-wave pattern. Unlike standard Elliott Wave patterns, diagonals have unique rules. For example, wave 1 must be the longest, wave 4 must enter wave 1 territory, and wave 5 is the shortest of the waves. Since this is the last wave and potentially the shortest of them all, the touch of the upper trend line could be on the way soon. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

19332140,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557333,1698184802,Bitcoin: On-Chain Tracker Points Out Interesting Difference Between Current And Past Rallies,"The current Bitcoin rally has taken most of the crypto space by surprise after going from under $27,000 to $35,000 in less than two weeks. As prices continue to fly, on-chain data tracker Santiment has revealed something different between the current Bitcoin rally and its previous rallies above $30,000. Altcoins Refuse To Fall Behind Bitcoin In the report that was posted on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment revealed that altcoins have changed their usual routine for when the Bitcoin price is surging. For instance, when Bitcoin had rallied to $30,000 in April and July of this year, altcoins had taken a back seat, allowing BTC to enjoy the shine. Related Reading: Economist Peter Schiff Raises Concerns About Spot Bitcoin ETFs This time around, the rally has been just as prominent in altcoins as it has been in Bitcoin, and in some cases, even outshining BTC’s price trajectory. Some of these altcoins that have shown teeth this time include Chainlink’s LINK, Polygon’s MATIC, Aptos’s APT, AAVE, and UIP. All of these altcoins have defied the established trend with their prices surging double-digits in a short time. Source: Santiment on X Not only are these altcoins seeing a lot of success at a time when Bitcoin would be the only one rallying, but they have also managed to decouple completely from the leading cryptocurrency. According to Santiment, all of the named altcoins “are all seeing their best performing decouplings of 2023.” Meme Coins Show Their Prowess As the crypto market rally has progressed through some of its most bullish stages, other altcoins such as meme coins have begun to also show a lot of promise. The usual culprits such as PEPE saw double-digit gains as well, with ELON rallying up to 57%. Additionally, $BITCOIN also saw a $36 rise in one week. Source: Santiment on X PEPE has continued to surge as well and is up 34.55% in the last day, bringing its weekly gains to 51.49%. The meme coin’s run has seen it emerge as a top gainer, also trending alongside the likes of Bitcoin (BTC) and Chainlink (LINK). Related Reading: Solana Remains Institutional Investor Darling As Inflows Continue Another altcoin that stands out is Troller’s TRB. The coin rose around 750% in a 3-month period to emerge as one of the winners of the rallies. It also saw large transactions from unique whale addresses, suggesting a very high level of interest in the altcoin from investors. Source: Santiment on X In all, this rally is completely different from the previous rallies recorded this year in that the whole market seems to be pulling up together. This is interesting because rallies like these are usually seen in bull markets, with 2021 serving as a perfect example.

42392224,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg35zv,1698183159,Crypto-Fan Tom Emmer's Rise and Fall in the U.S. House Speaker Race Was Extremely Quick,"Friend-to-crypto U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) was the Republican nominee for speaker of the House of Representatives for a single afternoon before reportedly giving up under opposition pressure within his party.  House Republicans are having an epic, no-holds-barred political showdown with themselves, and the abortive campaign of Emmer demonstrates that they've now burned through the most obvious candidates. And there are implications for the crypto industry.  Emmer was specifically targeted by former President Donald Trump, who posted Tuesday that voting for him would be a ""tragic mistake."" Meanwhile, a perilous deadline approaches on Nov. 17 when the federal government is set to shutter from a lack of funding.  After firing Speaker Kevin McCarty (R-Calif.) earlier this month, the House was transitioned to the temporary hands of Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and another strong advocate for crypto regulation. So, McHenry is not spending his time focusing on committee matters such as moving his panel's crypto bills – one on stablecoins and another on market structure – to floor votes as the year wanes.  Despite Emmer's very brief appearance on the speaker stage, no name is entirely removed from the speaker discussion. As Republicans have more and more trouble raising a candidate who can win a near-unanimous 217 of the 221 available GOP votes, the possibility of a deal with Democrats remains one option.

MicroStrategy has returned on a profitable trajectory after a prolonged period of market downturn and losses suffered by companies with cryptocurrency holdings. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Surge Just a month ago, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries made a strategic move by increasing their BTC holdings. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company, co-founded by renowned investor Michael Saylor, added 5,455 BTC to their portfolio, valued at $147 million. Related Reading: Cardano Passes Crucial Update As ADA Price Prepares For 65% Rally As of the time of writing, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings stand at a staggering 158,245 BTC, with a total valuation of approximately $4.68 billion. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable upswing, breaking through a long consolidation phase above $27,000 and reaching a new 2023 high. With a significant surge of 12.2%, BTC peaked at $35,300. This surge has unlocked substantial unrealized profits for MicroStrategy. According to Lookonchain, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings have generated an estimated unrealized profit of around $746 million. With BTC’s skyrocketing price, MicroStrategy’s strategic accumulation of 28,560 BTC since May 2022, at an average price of $25,707, has proven profitable. MicroStrategy’s success in capitalizing on the recent price surge of Bitcoin highlights the company’s strategic approach and belief in the long-term value of the cryptocurrency. By significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings, MicroStrategy has positioned itself to benefit from BTC’s continued growth and adoption. BTC Bears Crushed As $300 Million In Shorts Liquidated The cryptocurrency market witnessed a stunning surge, resulting in a staggering $100 billion addition to its total market capitalization within a single day. This rapid ascent also triggered a wave of liquidations amounting to over $400 million, with shorts accounting for a significant portion of the losses. With BTC experiencing a 12% price increase, this led to the liquidation of more than $180 million in short positions out of a total of $222 million in BTC liquidations. Related Reading: Ethereum End Of Month Challenge: Can ETH Reach $2,000 Amid $21 Billion DeFi TVL? Ethereum (ETH) traders also saw a significant loss of $60 million, with $44 million coming from those anticipating a price drop, according to data from CoinGlass. Most of these liquidations, totaling $317 million, occurred within the last 12 hours, with short sellers accounting for a substantial 76% ($241 million) of the total losses. Concurrently, trading volumes for the top three cryptocurrencies on the derivatives market witnessed significant growth. Bitcoin’s volume experienced a remarkable 221% surge, while Ethereum and XRP saw a 108% increase in trading activity. As a result, approximately 95,000 traders faced liquidation during this period of intense market volatility. Scott Melker, an investor and host of a cryptocurrency podcast, commented on the situation, stating: Bitcoin bears have been left reeling as the market witnessed an extraordinary rally, resulting in massive liquidations of short positions. This surge has caught many traders off guard, leading to substantial losses in a short period.

The AI cryptocurrency at one point hit 14% higher intraday. The move could be the start of something special, according to a “golden” signal in Fetch.ai. FET Soars 14% As Golden Cross Triggers FET is up 14% today as cryptocurrencies across the board see significant gains led by Bitcoin (BTC) this week. Even before the big move, the AI coin had opened this weekly trading session forming a golden cross of the 50-week and 200-week moving averages. A golden cross occurs when a short term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average from below. This is a buy signal in trend-following technical systems and suggests that a new trend is potentially blossoming. A death cross is the opposite sell signal. While the signal in and of itself is bullish based on the performance of trend-following systems, FET could be showing itself as a crypto market leader by being among the first coins to form such a golden cross. Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin are still death crossed, for example. Even recent market stars Chainlink (LINK) and Solana (SOL) haven’t formed a golden cross on the weekly timeframe. The golden cross has formed | FETUSD on TradingView.com Can Fetch Recapture AI Hype? There’s no denying fetch.ai’s latest double-digit price surge has brought fresh excitement and validation to the project. The startup’s vision of an AI-powered decentralized machine economy clearly resonates with many crypto investors. Furthermore, hype around AI leftover from Nvidia’s epic rally could find its way further into Fetch.ai. FETUSD rallied by more than 2380% starting from October 2020 through April 2021. In late 2022, Fetch.ai did another 900% following the release of ChatGPT and other big AI projects. What might this next rally result in for return on investment, if it continues higher? Former all-time highs reside around $1.20, which could be the next logical target if price exceeds $0.60, which was the 2023 peak so far. Beyond that, FET would enter price discover and there is no telling how high it could go. But with only two months left in 2023, the $0.60 peak might stand as the record, with FET not able to break above it until 2024. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

The cryptocurrency is heading towards its next resistance level with a high chance of Related Reading: XRP 10% Rally Strengthens Case For $0.55 Breakout As of this writing, the XRP price trades at $0.57, with a 9% increase in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency recorded a 16% spike in the previous seven days and closely followed Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price action, which recorded a 22% and 16% profit over the same period. XRP Price On Its Way To Next Critical Level According to an XRP trader on social media platform X, the token’s price exceeded the critical resistance level of $0.528. The analyst claims that there is a high chance that the XRP will rise close to $0.60 in the short term. In that sense, the trader believes that $0.66 will operate as the next critical resistance level based on the chart below. The analyst compared the current XRP price with the 2017 bull run. The chart shows that during the 2017 run, XRP closed above the weekly Ichimoku Cloud, a level used to gauge critical resistance and support levels. Once the token broke above that level, it could quickly fall into new highs and price discovery. The analyst stated the following about the XRP price and its potential to continue its run: This is not a warning or financial advice, but I would like to share it with you and emphasize how close we are after this weekly close. It seems the weekly Ichimoku close will be above the clouds, and it only happened before the 2017 run and 2021. When it happens, it happens. Be Ready. Crypto Market Poised For Further Highs A report from Bitfinex Alpha corroborates the market susceptibility to “new narratives.” In particular, the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US. As the XRP price and the market continue to rip higher, volatility in the sector is likely to remain high. As seen on the chart below, the crypto has been inching higher and higher with each volatility event (the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF was the most recent. Related Reading: Cardano Passes Crucial Update As ADA Price Prepares For 65% Rally In addition, the crypto research firm points to an increase in on-chain activity, which has historically supported higher prices for the sector: On-chain activity also continues to support the conclusion that higher volatility is here to stay and that it will grow in the coming months. Our analysis of Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB), which track the age of coins when they’re spent, and in particular the “age bands” of UTXOs that are most active, we can discern which group of investors is predominantly influencing market changes. For instance, if the UTXOs aged between three and five years show significant activity, it implies that investors who have held their positions for that time span are the primary movers in the market at that juncture.

The quick nature of this surge saw tens of thousands of crypto traders caught in the crossfire as over $400 million was liquidated in one day. More Than 95,000 Crypto Traders Lose Their Positions According to data from Coinglass, the crypto liquidation volumes ramped up quickly following the Bitcoin price surge. The platform reports that almost 95,000 traders were liquidated, with short traders bearing the brunt of these liquidation trends. Related Reading: This Shibarium Milestone Could Rocket Shiba Inu To August Highs Of the $400 million liquidated in the 24-hour period, short traders accounted for 75.83 which came out to $303 million.

BTC liquidations cross $222 million | Source: Coinglass The single largest liquidation order took place on the BTCUSDT pair on the Binance crypto exchange. This trader lost an eye-popping $9.98 million when their position was liquidated. In the same vein, Binance has also seen the highest liquidation volumes of all crypto exchanges with $133.88 million. Bitcoin accounts for the overwhelming majority of liquidation volumes at $222.93 million. Ethereum comes second with $59.93 million in liquidation volumes. Solana clinched the third place with $10.35 million. But interestingly, Trellor (TRB), a low-cap altcoin that just made it into the top 200, snagged 4th place with $9.40 million in liquidations. The altcoin has been one of the most impressive performers through the market action as well, rising from a range of $50 to $96 before retracing. Bitcoin Shows Strength Although Bitcoin has since retraced from its 2023 high of $35,000, the leading cryptocurrency continues to show dominance. Daily trading volumes have already risen above $46 billion, which means that investors are coming back into the cryptocurrency en masse. This suggests a willingness to purchase Bitcoin at higher prices and this will continue to prop up its price. Since buyers currently outnumber sellers in this market, it is more likely that the Bitcoin retracement is only temporary and a restart of the price surge can send BTC above $36,000 next. Related Reading: Solana Remains Institutional Investor Darling As Inflows Continue Also, BlackRock’s ETF listing on the DTCC remains very fresh and is still providing fuel for the rally. This will likely continue for another couple of hours before exhaustion kicks in and leaves ample time for Bitcoin to regain its footing for another surge.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Haven’t Given In To The Allure Of Profit-Taking Yet In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the BTC long-term holders have reacted to the latest rally in the asset towards the $35,000 level. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to those investors who have held onto their coins since at least 155 days ago. Statistically, the longer a holder keeps their coins still, the less likely they become to move them at any point. Related Reading: Economist Peter Schiff Raises Concerns About Spot Bitcoin ETFs Thus, since the LTHs have been holding their coins for a significant amount, they generally tend to remain quiet in the future. Throughout history, this cohort has shown this conviction regardless of whatever is going on in the market, whether FUD from crashes or FOMO from rallies. Because of this, the times that the LTHs participate in selling can be ones to watch for, as they show that the market has pushed even these diamond hands towards selling. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the supply held by the Bitcoin LTHs throughout the history of the cryptocurrency: The value of the metric seems to have going up in recent months | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 43, 2023 As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH supply has increased recently and has set a new ATH of about 14.9 million BTC. This suggests that a net amount of the supply has continued to mature past the 155-day threshold despite the sharp rally that the asset has enjoyed. From the chart, it’s visible that at some point during major historical rallies, these LTHs have usually participated in at least a bit of net selling as some members of the cohort look to harvest their gains. Interestingly, that hasn’t happened with this rally so far. In the chart, Glassnode has also attached the data for another metric: the amount of the LTH supply being held at some loss. It would appear that 29.6% of the supply owned by these HODLers (about 4.28 million BTC) is currently carrying a net unrealized loss. The on-chain analytics firm notes that this is quite a high value considering the significant uptrend that Bitcoin has seen since the lows in 2022. Such indicator values have rather been seen during the deep bear market phases historically (except the March 2020 spike, which occurred because of the sudden COVID crash). Related Reading: All Clear For $40,000? Bitcoin Shows Little On-Chain Resistance Ahead “This suggests that the LTH cohort may be a more hardened and firm-handed cohort compared to prior cycles,” explains the report.

19323142,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556800,1698166824,Solana Barrels Close To $32: Critical Levels Traders Should Watch,"Solana (SOL) has recently surged to a crucial price level, setting the stage for a pivotal moment that will shape its foreseeable future. This cryptocurrency’s price trajectory is now at a crossroads, as it eases off the recent bullish breakout that captured the attention of investors worldwide. Trading at $31.40 on CoinGecko, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 0.6% gain over the last 24 hours, accompanied by an impressive seven-day rally of 28.6%. Despite this promising trajectory, several key resistance and support levels are shaping the future of SOL. While the $30 mark remains a vital resistance level for SOL, the cryptocurrency is also facing significant barriers at the $25 and $35 thresholds. Historically, $25 has proven to be both a support and resistance level, potentially offering a safety net for any immediate downward movements. Conversely, breaching the $35 threshold could signify a major breakthrough for SOL, propelling it to new highs and solidifying its bullish course in the market. Related Reading: XRP 10% Rally Strengthens Case For $0.55 Breakout SOL price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Analyzing SOL’s Technical Patterns Amidst these price fluctuations, the emergence of the “golden cross” pattern on SOL’s price chart has captured the attention of market analysts and investors alike. In technical analysis, the golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, indicating a potential bullish trend. Its presence within SOL’s current price movements signals an optimistic outlook, with the potential for sustained upward momentum. Despite the optimistic indicators, recent developments within the Solana ecosystem have cast a shadow on SOL’s potential trajectory. News of Marinade Finance, the largest protocol on the Solana network, halting operations for users in the United Kingdom due to compliance concerns has reverberated throughout the cryptocurrency community. The move reflects the protocol’s commitment to adhere to the regulatory framework outlined by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This development has introduced an element of caution and potential volatility into SOL’s otherwise promising market performance. Related Reading: The Dogecoin Advance: A Double-Digit Boost In The Cards? SOL market cap currently at $13.278 billion. Chart: TradingView.com RSI Reinforces The Bullish Narrative Further fortifying the bullish sentiment surrounding SOL is the surging Relative Strength Index (RSI). Currently on the rise, SOL’s RSI indicates robust buying pressure within the market. While an RSI above 70 is generally considered overbought, and one below 30 is deemed oversold, the current upward trajectory suggests a strong investor sentiment favoring continued upward movement for SOL in the near term. As Solana stands at this critical juncture, investors and analysts are closely monitoring both the technical indicators and the regulatory landscape to gauge its future performance in the increasingly dynamic cryptocurrency market.

That's unlike gold, a competing store of value to bitcoin, where miners amp up production as prices rise, said Brody. ""The issuance rate [of bitcoin] is set,"" he added. ""We might discover that pricing in bitcoin is more inelastic"" than other types of assets.

With HPC services failing to wow, HUT is still a viable Bitcoin proxy. Until the US Bitcoin merger is finalized, there may be better Bitcoin proxy bets in the public equity markets. But BTC looks strong and HUT should do well as long as BTC is moving higher. It has been a bit of a reset year for Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ). Historically a crypto mining pure play, more recently, Hut 8 has branched into high performance computing, or HPC, services. The company has dealt with a variety of challenges to its mining operations over the last 18 months. 3-year trend (BitInfoCharts) In addition to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining profitability collapsing following the late 2021 BTC price high, Hut was also somewhat reliant on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) mining up until ""the merge"" in September 2022, and energy-related issues at its North Bay facility. Crypto winter has been particularly brutal on the BTC mining space and it has resulted in bankruptcies and consolidation. As HUT investors still wait on an official closing of the company's merger with US Bitcoin, I think it's worth looking at how Hut 8's BTC stack has evolved in the four months since I last covered HUT for Seeking Alpha. Hut 8 Mining - Production vs Stack Author generated image (Hut 8) Given the challenges mentioned above, it may not be a surprise to see the degree to which HUT's monthly BTC production has fallen. For much of 2022, HUT was producing over 300 BTC per month. That figure has been under 200 for 10 consecutive months and nearly fell below 100 in August. For quite some time I've been of the opinion that the main selling point for going long Hut 8 is the enormous BTC stack that the company holds for a business of its size. HODLS as of 9/30/23 BTC Treasury Total HODL Value Market Cap Treasury/MC Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 7,327 $252,437,131 $2,226,365,268 11.34% Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 13,726 $472,901,878 $2,203,322,403 21.46% Hut 8 Mining 9,366 $322,686,798 $509,380,354 63.35% Bitfarms ( BITF ) 703 $24,220,459 $453,623,210 5.34% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 2,240 $77,174,720 $768,815,494 10.04% Source: Company filings, author calculations at $34.7k BTC price As of article submission, the price of a Bitcoin is $34.7k. Using that figure and the reported BTC holdings for each company at the end of September, Hut's current market capitalization is 63.4% backed by the Bitcoin on the balance sheet. That is by far the largest BTC treasury to market cap backing of any public Bitcoin mining stock and the next closest is Marathon Digital at 21.5%. However, what had previously been an entirely unencumbered Bitcoin stack now has a bit more complexity. Author generated graphic (Hut 8) Earlier this year when Hut 8 announced the planned merger, the company disclosed that it would potentially start selling BTC from its HODL stack to fund operations. Rather than continuing to dilute shareholders to raise capital, Hut has instead decided to utilize liquid assets on the balance sheet when necessary. I think this has been the right call. But it should be noted that only 78% of Hut's HODL stack is currently unencumbered. Beyond that, we've seen more of that stack being utilized over the last two months. And if the previous four months are any indication, we may see even less BTC in the unencumbered category in the company's October production update. That's a purely a guess on my part, but until this merger is finalized, Hut's monthly production doesn't appear to be strong enough at current BTC prices. Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Q2-23 TTM Cost of Revenues $33,000,000 $33,600,000 $18,700,000 $18,000,000 $103,300,000 Total Opex $8,000,000 $8,300,000 $5,400,000 $7,900,000 $29,600,000 BTC Mined 982 698 475 399 2554 Breakeven Price $41,752 $60,029 $50,737 $64,912 $52,036 Sources: Seeking Alpha, Hut 8, Author's calculations Utilizing cost of revenue and total opex against the company's mined BTC over the last four quarters, I see a company that has one of the higher breakeven BTC prices in the sector at just under $65k per coin in Q2. It's Still All About Bitcoin Even though Hut 8 is attempting to build out an HPC services business, we've yet to see that segment really take off for the company. In fact, in Hut's Q2 earnings filing we actually saw HPC revenue decline sequentially both in aggregate and as a percentage of total revenue: Q2-22 Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Q2-23 Total Revenue $43,845 $31,671 $21,833 $19,021 $19,183 HPC Revenue $4,711 $4,403 $4,487 $4,495 $4,192 HPC % of Total 10.70% 13.90% 20.60% 23.60% 21.85% Source: Hut 8, 000s of CAD At least for now, Hut 8 is still primarily a Bitcoin proxy company. So as Bitcoin goes, so too will Hut go in my personal opinion. Pertaining to BTC specifically, there are a lot of positive signs and potential catalysts. If we learned anything from the Cointelegraph debacle earlier this month , it's that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is definitely not priced in yet. BTC Daily (TradingView) Beyond the notion that positive news hasn't yet been priced in to Bitcoin, it could also be argued that negative news has been priced in already. The NY attorney general is suing Gemini, Digital Currency Group, and Genesis for alleged fraud. We continue to see potential issues at top crypto exchange Binance and crypto has been in political crosshairs following carnage in the middle east. Yet Bitcoin hasn't batted an eye to any of this bad publicity. For me, there's a signal there. Risks It's important to keep in mind that the block reward halving is now just 6 months away. When the block reward is halved, it will essentially mean the BTC-denominated revenue from mining will be cut in half. This a major concern for every public Bitcoin miner and may position these companies as better trading vehicles than actual investments for the time being. Transaction fees as a percentage of the block reward haven't lived up to the potential that we saw back in May with the emergence of Ordinals and BRC-20 token swaps. We also don't yet have an official closing of Hut's merger with US Bitcoin and I see longing HUT shares as a bit of an unnecessary gamble until that deal is finalized. Summary There are certainly interesting aspects of Hut 8 that I think warrant some attention. Like other crypto mining entities in the public markets, Hut 8 is trying to get traction in HPC services. To this point, I'd argue that revenue growth story has been bordering on non-existent. However, as we approach the Bitcoin halving, I am of the opinion that we are now at the point were taking some speculative shots on public miners makes sense. But until the merger is completed, Hut's story is less clear than some of its peers. From where I sit, the major selling point today for HUT is still the large stack and given the declining number of unencumbered BTC, I'm less excited about HUT compared to other companies that are growing unencumbered holdings while maintaining significantly larger operations. All that said, I'm actually going to upgrade HUT from a ""hold"" to a ""buy"" simply because I think we've seen the cycle bottom for BTC and I believe Hut shares will rally with the sector.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4642939-hut-8-mining-caution-warranted-upgrading-to-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19322332.jpeg

BITO offers exposure to bitcoin-linked returns through futures contracts and has closely tracked spot bitcoin performance. Price action suggests bullish momentum for both spot bitcoin and BITO, with potential upside targets and long-term support levels. I outline key price levels to watch on BITO's chart ahead of what's often been a bullish seasonal stretch. Rumors are swirling that at long last a spot bitcoin ETF is on the way. Will that leave the Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) in the dust? Maybe not totally, but surely retail investors and advisors seeking to own the cryptocurrency for their clients would find a spot fund more appealing - particularly if a large issuer such as BlackRock can enter the space with a low-cost product. While there are few details about what issuer will take the lead in crafting a spot bitcoin ETF, and there have been no definitive words from the SEC about its potential approval, bitcoin has surged to fresh 2023 highs. I have a buy rating on BITO. I see the fund as having marginally less appeal if and when a spot bitcoin ETP hits the market, but the technical chart of bitcoin looks strong. Moreover, I acknowledge that rising US government budget deficits and heightened volatility in both the stock and bond markets could be tailwinds as we enter what is often a bullish seasonal stretch for crypto. BITO's YTD Total Return Is Close to Bitcoin's Through Oct 23 Stockcharts.com According to ProShares , BITO offers a way to gain exposure to bitcoin-linked returns with the liquidity and transparency of an ETF. It aims to produce returns that correspond to bitcoin. Importantly for prospective investors, BITO invests in bitcoin futures and does not invest directly in bitcoin. There is no guarantee that returns will correspond to bitcoin. The ETF is the world's largest and first US bitcoin-linked ETF and has closely tracked the performance of spot bitcoin since its inception. BITO remains a moderate-sized ETF with total assets under management of about $1 billion (given the recent upside move in bitcoin futures). The annual expense ratio is high, however, at 0.95%. Liquidity is strong with this fund - the average daily volume is more than 8 million shares and ProShares lists the median 30-day bid/ask spread at seven basis points. Share price momentum is very high right now after the major advance in crypto over the last few months. BITO also pays monthly distributions given its Treasury securities holdings, though the payouts vary greatly from month to month. Risk can be high though given volatility in crypto. A possible upside catalyst over the coming years could be massive annual budget deficits at home, though that is widely known in the marketplace. $2 Trillion FY 2023 US Government Budget Deficit Bloomberg Concerns Rising Regarding the Government's Ability To Repay Its Debt Holger Zschaepitz Dollar's Uptrend Breaking? Zero Hedge BITO acts somewhat like a typical commodity ETF in that it holds near-dated futures contracts. Currently, BITO's composition includes 48% of its futures stake in bitcoin futures expiring in October and 52% in November futures. It also holds collateral in Treasury securities. BITO Holdings: Oct & Nov Bitcoin Futures ProShares The issuer constantly must roll out to later-dated contracts, creating an added risk for investors compared to owning spot bitcoin. When bitcoin futures' term structure is in backwardation - a situation in which near-dated contracts are priced higher than later-dated contracts - the fund benefits from buying relatively cheaper futures. The opposite, contango, is bearish. Currently, the term structure is about flat, so the risk is neutral. Bitcoin Future Term Structure CME Group The Technical Take Momentum is extremely high with spot bitcoin right now. Notice in the chart below that the cryptocurrency broke through key resistance just under $32,000 in recent days. I see a bullish upside measured move target to near $39,000 based on the previous $7,000 range. Also take a look at the volume profile on the left side of the chart - while the mid-$30k zone has been a battleground between the bulls and bears, there actually wasn't much volume traded there, so I don't think it will be a major area of possible selling. Bitcoin is nicely above its flat 200-day moving average (which should soon inflect higher) while former resistance at $32,000 becomes new support with longer-term support near $25,000. $48,000 could be a future area of possible profit-taking on a bigger late-year rise. Bitcoin: Upside Breakout, Targeting $39k Stockcharts.com Seasonally, bitcoin tends to perform well in October when averaging all years since 2014 . Bullish trends persist through November and December, too. So, this is a bullish factor to consider. Very Bullish Bitcoin Seasonality Stockcharts.com As for BITO, the chart is less impressive, though the YTD total return is quite comparable to bitcoin. As I write, BITO is near $17.50 in the premarket, so that leaves the $18.39 April peak as resistance. A rally above that could lead to an eventual gap fill near $23 from its downward move in May of 2022. BITO's 200-day moving average is upward-sloping, which is positive, and there is a solid uptrend in its RSI momentum indicator at the top of the graph. Overall, BITO's technicals are not quite as sanguine as spot bitcoin, but a rally through the Q2 high would be encouraging while the $12 to $12.80 area is long-term support. Overall, I am bullish on the near-term technical situation with bitcoin, so that would mean more upside to come in BITO. BITO: Possible $23 Upside Target, $18.40 Near-Term Resistance Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on BITO. While I would find more appeal in a liquid and low-cost spot bitcoin ETF, BITO has paced well with spot bitcoin so far in 2023 on a total return basis.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4642928-bito-more-upside-ahead-as-investors-await-spot-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19322139.jpeg

When the service was first discussed publicly several months ago, some people said the product undermines Ledger's stated commitment to privacy and security.  Read more: Ledger Bats Back Criticism of New Wallet Recovery Service  Recover, which provides a backup for users' recovery seed phrase, is now available on Ledger's most popular wallet Nano X, CEO Pascal Gauthier wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday.  Seed phrases are a random string of 12 or 24 words that a user must remember should he or she need to regain access to a crypto wallet, meaning the digital assets therein would be unrecoverable should the user forget these words or lose their written record of them.  Crypto wallet makers therefore offer various means of backing up seed phrases, but Ledger's proved controversial when it was first announced in May. Recover involves users' private keys being encrypted, duplicated and divided into three pieces that are held with three different parties: Ledger, crypto security firm Coincover and an independent backup service provider.  Gauthier's announcement of this optional, paid-for service was met with a fresh round of snark from X users this week, restating claims that Ledger is asking customers to pay to make their private key more vulnerable.  Ledger's CEO has maintained, however, that this service is meeting demand from users who want to know that their crypto holdings are not at the mercy of them remembering a random string of words.

42392248,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3GFv,1698163597,Decentralization on a Spectrum: How Fully On-chain Games Are the Future of Web3 Gaming,"These days, Web3 games are looking more and more like Web2 games. The graphics are way cooler than we knew back in 2021; the gameplay loops aren’t just about grinding; and, as every founder has reiterated ad nauseam, the games are more fun. Onboarding processes have also been streamlined; dumbing them down to the point that most games don’t even require players to connect a wallet, let alone buy or borrow an NFT to get started, and an increasing number of Web3 games are accessible via Web2 distribution platforms such as Google Play, AppStore and the Epic Games Store. Many are making the blockchain stuff opt-in, so players needn’t worry if they just want to play and have fun without all the responsibility that goes along with being a digital asset owner. Even the words — Web3, NFTs, crypto and blockchain — have been deleted from their websites, their pitch decks and press releases.  Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.  This has been widely applauded as a step in the right direction toward mainstream adoption, particularly for Web3 investors eyeing a slice of the $334 billion market for traditional video games. Especially, amid the bear market, when the number of active wallets only continues to shrink, if founders of Web3 games want to grow their player base they must tailor their products to appeal to people outside the blockchain bubble. That’s why we’ve seen a large part of the Web3 gaming industry stop promoting the benefits of blockchain and NFTs to adopt a new mantra instead: just make a great game. But in doing so, Web3 games are merely positioning themselves to compete amongst the much bigger, much more competitive Web2 market — while neglecting what makes Web3 games special in the first place.  Fully on-chain vs partly  One obscure corner of the gaming ecosystem that has shown the courage to put the Web3 back in Web3 games is: fully on-chain games. As the name suggests, these games use the blockchain as an alternative to a centralized game server and put every aspect of the game on-chain, including assets, logic, state and storage. When the game logic is on-chain — that is, the set of rules and instructions that control how a video game behaves and responds to player actions — this opens up endless possibilities for permissionless interoperability and composability. Once they are deployed, they are community-owned, censorship resistant, autonomous of their original creator, and anyone can build on top of them (which is also why they are also often called Autonomous Worlds).  By making games trustless, open-source and composable, with the game’s state always immutable and transparent on the blockchain, we are not simply augmenting traditional video games with select Web3 features but completely reimagining how they are built. This means we can invent new game loops and mechanics to come up with entirely new gaming experiences.  The reality, however, is that the idea of putting an entire game on a blockchain is probably enough to trigger an aneurysm for a traditional game developer. Blockchains are notoriously bad at speed, scalability and storage — all the things that make for a smooth, seamless video game experience. As such, in their current form, fully on-chain games really only work as turn-based games that require fewer player actions, like grand strategy, simulation, and board games, or games that are centered around one simple game loop; think Flappy Bird or Pac-Man.  Additionally, with a fee associated with each blockchain transaction, the cost to play a fully on-chain game stacks up since every player action is a transaction in itself. Add to this the dreadful user experience (UX) you’d expect of most crypto-native applications, and an onboarding process that feels a bit like pulling teeth, and it’s no surprise that very few people are actually playing these games.  With blockchain posing so many challenges for designers, developers and players alike, it’s understandable why so many Web3 projects are implementing only select parts of their game on-chain. Usually, anything that’s freely tradeable on Web3 exchanges and marketplaces, like utility and governance tokens as well as NFT game assets, goes on-chain. The rest stays off-chain, which makes games much easier to design and build, at least, in the traditional sense.  I understand the temptation to go this route, but it’s reflective of once-bullish Web3 founders losing faith in the strong form of blockchain technology. The problem is: these weakly on-chain games are surrendering to the convenience of web2 centralization at the expense of embracing the uniqueness that blockchain can bring. Alternatively, by making full decentralization non-negotiable, fully on-chain games are more likely to help us answer the question: what makes a great Web3 game?  Currently, there are a few key benefits we can point to when talking about the value that Web3 brings to games, including digital asset ownership, open and permissionless marketplaces, interoperability, transparency, provable scarcity, and community building. But earlier this year, Philip La, a former product manager for Axie Infinity and Pokémon Go, delivered his assessment of these and other purported benefits, grading their performance on an A to F scale. With results ranging from D at worst to B+ at best, it was a thoroughly mediocre report card. Even real-money gameplay only got a B, which is bound to raise eyebrows since much of the original value proposition for Web3 games was for players to make money off of them.  Rather than getting so hung up on blockchain’s failings, we need to identify where it can score an A+  Love or hate it, we’ve never seen another blockchain gaming adoption craze like play-to-earn (P2E). In its heyday, Axie was raking in more protocol revenue than Ethereum, Bitcoin, and the next 11 top-ranking dapps combined. Its predecessor, CryptoKitties, was so popular that the Ethereum blockchain buckled beneath it. Back then, astronomical gas fees were the norm. Strategic players would wake at 2 a.m. to process their transactions, staying up for hours while they waited for their confirmations. Of course, this was only after they’d jumped through all the usual hoops: setting up MetaMask, learning the difference between hot and cold wallets, getting to know the ins-and-outs of Uniswap, figuring out how to on/off ramp, and possibly getting scammed in the process. Despite the headache, people loved it.  When CryptoKitties and Axie first launched, they looked very similar to the way that fully on-chain games look now: wildly experimental, ridiculously niche, unabashedly crypto-centric, and horrendously clunky to use, with very few users, and yet, they went on to spur the development of an entirely new industry. Today, they are enshrined within blockchain adoption lore as the kooky catalysts that led millions more noobs to get into crypto. And soon, thanks to recent technical advancements, the onboarding friction associated with those early games will be nothing but an inside joke between OGs.  Even in the past year, developer tooling has vastly improved, Layer 2s are making transactions faster and cheaper, account abstraction is allowing for more flexible wallet authentication and recovery, and session keys make it so MetaMask doesn’t keep popping up every damn minute. Rather than reverting to Web2 infrastructure, these innovations improve ease of use without sacrificing blockchain’s true ethos of decentralization.  The improvements in efficiency will come – we should be confident of that. And ultimately, in the future, Web3 games will be a mix of on and off-chain elements, depending on game design. But what’s the point in doing Web3 in games at all, if it’s seen to be so mediocre in terms of what value it brings?  Rather than getting so hung up on blockchain’s failings, we need to identify where it can score an A+ before we rush to bundle it under the hood. In the short term, I applaud those game builders that are leaning into blockchain for blockchain’s sake, and the investors who are funding them — not just with money — but time and space to tinker freely without stressing about growth. This is where the new ideas will come from, our industry’s R&D sector, and all future Web3 games will benefit. Of course, traditional gamers will complain that fully on-chain games aren’t just better versions of what they already know. So what? As Henry Ford famously put it: ask a customer what they want and they would’ve said faster horses.  Massive thanks to David Z.

19321265,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556771,1698163216,Chainlink (LINK) Surge Far From Done As Crypto Analyst Predicts Rise To $15,"Chainlink (LINK) is one of the altcoins that have enjoyed a massive resurgence in recent days alongside the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. The token rose to as high as $10 on October 23 and seems to have established support at that level. Following this, some crypto analysts have gone on to analyze whether or not it can sustain this momentum. Can The Chainlink Rally Be Sustained? In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto analyst Felix drew up an analysis of LINK’s price movement on the charts, noting that the token could see “further price movement, especially if it claims above the critical 500+ day resistance at >$9.6.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Lists Reasons Why Cardano (ADA) Will Not Do Well In The Bull Market Source: X He also seemed to suggest that a period of whale accumulation may have led to this price surge as over $9.92 million worth of LINK tokens were sent out of exchanges to wallets when it was still trading at around $7.26. LINK has risen by over 33% since then. Source: IntoTheBlock Felix highlighted the fact that the Chainlink ecosystem was displaying impressive on-chain strength at the moment, which ultimately leads one to question whether or not the rally can be sustained. LINK’s Figures Are On The Rise As Felix pointed out, LINK’s price seems to be experiencing an ‘up-only’ trend currently, and all other metrics are not left behind as the ecosystem is also seeing an increase in the number of active and new addresses. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the number of active addresses on the Chainlink network is steadily rising alongside the price increase. In the last 7 days, the network has seen an increase of over 112% in the number of active addresses on the network. Meanwhile, there has also been an increase of over 190% in the number of new addresses on the network. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bullish Bitcoin Price Rally To $41,000, Here’s When As expected, the number of transactions on the network has also risen during this period, with Chainlink recording a 7-day high of over 12,000 transactions on October 23. Consequently, the trading volume is up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. There is also reason to believe that this momentum might be far from over, as fundamentals seem to be contributing to the bullish sentiment. If so, there is more good news ahead for the Bulls and Chainlink community as the Chainlink Staking v0.2 is set to launch before the year runs out. Many believe that LINK maximalists are going to continue to accumulate ahead of the launch. In reaction to an X post about an impending launch of the Staking v0.2, one crypto analyst boldly asserted that LINK could rise to as high as $15 later this year.

42392252,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3Gkh,1698162890,Regulatory Clarity Won’t Bring an End to Crypto Risk,"Like a ship emerging through the fog, the outlines of regulatory clarity are becoming visible in many different parts of the world, even though the United States isn’t one of them. From Japan to Dubai to the EU, the rules and regulatory models for cryptocurrencies, digitized real world assets and stablecoins are taking shape.  Paul Brody is Global Blockchain Leader for EY (Ernst & Young) and the author of ""Ethereum for Business: A Plain-English Guide to the Use Cases that Generate Returns from Asset Management to Payments to Supply Chains.""  The future is one where it will be possible to legally issue all kinds of digital assets, and that legal and regulatory structure will reduce risks and unleash a torrent of investment in the space. So pack your sunscreen, the blockchain summer is coming.  It’s worth, at this moment, contemplating what the limits of regulatory clarity will bring. Let’s just start with something simple like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory clarity will certainly reduce or largely eliminate the risk of crypto exchanges absconding with your digital assets. It will also eliminate the possibility that people will buy an asset one day only to find it is illegal and illiquid the next day.  Regulatory clarity will also give people more confidence in stablecoins, knowing they are backed by actual currency or government bonds and overseen by banking or securities regulators. It’s notable already that many stablecoins are backed one-for-one by currency, and actually have a lower risk profile than a traditional bank deposit, which can be re-loaned out to other people. Europe’s incoming MiCA regulations implement similar rules for a wide range of asset-backed coins, not just currency, but oil, gold and other commodities as well.  What regulation can’t do  What regulation cannot do is protect people from making bad investment decisions. And the opportunity to do so in a world of digital assets is nearly unlimited. Take something basic like cryptocurrencies. The premise of a digital asset like Bitcoin is that it functions like gold, only better. The supply is limited in total, and the release process is governed by an algorithm.  What isn’t limited is the number of bitcoin clones and variations out there. There are literally thousands of them. Most of them are likely, in time, to become worthless. How can consumers differentiate between all these competing claims and what responsibility, if any, do regulators have to prevent people investing money in dead-ends?  Beyond cryptocurrencies, there is a whole category of digital tokens that seem to function like shares in companies. These are often sold as “utility tokens,” which can be used in a new protocol, and function like payments, but they also function like an investment and are often pitched to buyers as investments that will go up in value.  There are several protocols in circulation that have full-time management teams and generate transaction fees that are intended (eventually) to pay for those management teams and, potentially, offer dividends to the token holders. Token-holders can even table management proposals and vote on them. That certainly looks and sounds like the way that many companies or business partnerships operate.  To be clear, there is nothing wrong with this. Quite the contrary: I’m immensely excited about the kinds of innovation that is going to be funded and scaled up by these protocols.  These company-like structures, complete with ecosystem tokens, are being used to fund and pay for a whole wave of new digital products and services. Some of them are just fun, but others are ambitious efforts to re-imagine how we manage computing, storage and even real-world assets. There is huge upside for the firms and people involved. Token sales that fund these initiatives are a form of crowdfunding and if startups can do this off-chain (and they can), there’s no reason they should not be able to do so in a well-regulated on-chain market.  What we do need to be honest about is the level of risk involved. There’s a reason why people are not generally allowed to buy shares in brand-new companies unless it’s clear they can comfortably afford to lose their money: it’s very risky.  More than 90% of all new startups fail. At EY, we found an even higher failure rate for the protocols and organizations built on the first wave of ICOs in 2017 and 2018. Many ICO and crypto investors have lost a great deal of money over the years on high-risk deals, often without ever understanding the protocols being proposed.  Historically in the U.S. and other countries, investing in startups has been restricted to higher net-worth individuals and professional investors who are thought to either fully understand the risks, or at least have enough money that losing some of it isn’t ruinous. There is strong academic evidence that ordinary consumers who try to play this game do badly. The average retail investor does a worse job of picking stocks than a random number generator. Just because risks are disclosed doesn’t mean they are understood.  With all that risk, there are significant opportunities. Not just for companies that want to raise money, or investors that want to invest, but also for a whole ecosystem of regulated advice and asset curation to grow up. This could be the single biggest opportunity for traditional finance firms that are used to already curating from the vast world of investment opportunities for their clients.

42392257,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3Gux,1698162400,"Coinbase, Bitcoin Miners Extend Gains as BTC Surges on BlackRock ETF Hopes","Shares crypto-related companies surged for a second straight day after bitcoin [BTC] traded above $34,000, fueled by hopes that a spot-price exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the largest cryptocurrency may finally be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Stocks of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) – which held more than 158,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet – and crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY) all rose more than 14% on Tuesday at press time.  Bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI), which are more exposed to price movements of the digital currencies, added more than 15%.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq equity indexes were also in the positive, snapping a five-day losing streak.  The rally in the crypto-linked stocks was driven by bitcoin's sudden surge on Monday, which saw the price climbing all the way to $35,000. The optimism started after the proposed BlackRock ETF showed up on the website of Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC) – a key U.S. market utility that processes all securities transactions – with the ticker $IBTC.  Read more: A Wild Few Minutes Drive Bitcoin Above $35,000 as ETF Excitement Starts to Thaw the Crypto Winter  The optimism surrounding a potential spot bitcoin ETF was started earlier this year when giants of traditional finance (TradFi) like BlackRock filed for spot ETF with the SEC.  If one is approved, the asset managers will need to buy, own and store the digital assets for their clients, similar to a physically backed gold ETF, potentially boosting the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies and the whole sector.  ""Authorised participants will have to buy bitcoin [if a spot ETF gets approved] in order to create shares for an eventual ETF, which will result in significant flows to buy an increasingly illiquid supply of bitcoin,"" said CoinShares head of research James Butterfill.  If bitcoin's rally extends as far as $40,000, there will be a significant shift in investors' outlook for bitcoin, Butterfill said. ""Market participants would be in full anticipation of it being 'mainstreamed' and accepted as a major asset class (like existing ones such as gold etc.).""  However, he cautioned that given the volatile nature of the digital currency, the price could quickly move the other way if there is any negative news regarding the timeline of the approval.  ""Any detriment to the early ‘24 timeline for Spot ETFs could have a negative impact on prices and we could be trading in the high 20s again. Although, given recent events, this scenario seems increasingly unlikely.""

Mastercard pointed out in a presentation deck that having a payments card helps wallet providers increase the number of active users and build loyalty and other revenue streams while giving cardholders the opportunity to spend their crypto balance in a frictionless way.  But wallet firms face significant demands on resources when introducing a card in a new region, which is where Mastercard and its issuance partners come in. The 57-year-old payments technology firm also said it is evaluating “new models for global issuance using stablecoin on chain settlement” and “inexpensive fast chains,” according to the deck.  “Mastercard is bringing its trusted and transparent approach to the digital assets space through a range of innovative products and solutions – including the Mastercard Multi-Token Network, Crypto Credential, CBDC Partner Program, and new card programs that connect Web2 and Web3,"" a Mastercard spokesperson said via email.  Large credit card networks are moving ahead with crypto despite tough market conditions and regulatory uncertainty in places like the U.S. Earlier this year, Mastercard made clear its Engage program will focus on bringing new crypto card programs to market. Visa, meanwhile, has been working with stablecoin USDC and the Solana blockchain for cross-border payments and exploring ways to smooth out wrinkles like paying Ethereum gas fees.  Mastercard will release a set of franchise standards, or rules for partner firms, to ensure consumer protection, price competition and transaction monitoring requirements, according to the deck. The company’s acquisition of CipherTrace back in 2021 means the blockchain analytics specialist is on hand to provide monitoring services.  Once the proposed standards are validated, the next step would be to issue a card targeting the EU or U.K. as a first market, Mastercard said in its presentation deck.  “Users want a simple solution – seamless transactions without pre-funding, without spending crypto and without having to deal with taxes,” it said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/24/mastercard-plans-web3-collaborations-with-self-custody-wallet-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f86042323a5c703a22a85752f0f70ee4be9bbc96-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Growing recognition of Bitcoin as a store of value and its role as digital gold supports a positive long-term outlook. We expect the momentum to continue and see room for higher prices into 2024. While much of the market has been fixated on record volatility in bonds and renewed weakness in stocks, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has staged a spectacular rally in recent weeks and is now up nearly 100% this year. This current momentum with BTC once again trading above $33,000 has evolved despite U.S. Dollar strength, rising interest rates, and the broader risk aversion which would otherwise be seen as bearish headwinds. In our view, the setup right now is the most bullish we've seen since we covered the "" gold standard of cryptocurrencies "" back in January when BTC climbed above $20,000. We expect more upside with a sense that this latest breakout is just getting started. The following points highlight what we believe to be the key catalysts that can drive the next leg higher into 2024. Renewed bullish momentum. Implications of looming approval of a first-of-its-kind spot market ETF. Growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate alternative asset. Technical breakout to the highest level since May 2022. Reversal of Dollar strength and pullback in rates as a new macro tailwind. Seeking Alpha The Upcoming Bitcoin ETF A large part of this latest Bitcoin optimism centers on the expectation of a looming approval for a spot market bitcoin exchange-traded fund. To be clear, while no final announcement has been made, all indicators are pointing that the SEC will finally greenlight what has long been at the top of Bitcoin enthusiasts' bucket list. The latest development is an industry listing for the ""BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust with a pending ticker symbol of IBTC as an important step before trading officially begins. Other ETF sponsors include VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, ARK Invest, Bitwise, and Invesco all have similar applications. The expectation is that the SEC may move forward with a handful of the applications at the same time to avoid the appearance of favoring one particular fund while giving investors more options. The Importance of a BTC ETF Access to owning Bitcoin has never been a problem including countless exchanges like Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) and even through larger FinTech platforms like Block, Inc. ( SQ ) or PayPal Holdings, Inc. ( PYPL ). Bitcoin futures contracts have been actively traded since 2017. Numerous existing funds do just fine at tracking Bitcoin like the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ), with exposure to BTC futures, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) with its closed-end fund model. That being said, there are key aspects of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that make it different. The first part is the concept of a regulated custodian responsible for holding the underlying asset. In contrast to the futures-based strategy, a spot market ETF will hold underlying Bitcoins corresponding to the asset value of the fund. This means that investor demand for the ETFs will translate directly into the sponsor building and underlying positions. This also differs from existing closed-end funds like GBTC which holds a certain amount of Bitcoin while the asset value could trade at a large premium or discount to the underlying holdings. The result here offers key advantages to the ETF model. Increased transparency with daily holdings information. Enhanced investor protections through the regulatory framework. Greater liquidity share creation process. Flexibility to be used in a broader range of retirement accounts. In our view, the importance of a spot market ETF in the U.S. is that it works as a proverbial stamp of approval by the market's main regulator that Bitcoin is a credible investment option. For all the naysayers who have been predicting the demise of Bitcoin at nearly every turn over the past decade, the potential availability of an ETF confirms that this market segment is here to stay. A Legitimate Alternative Asset What we like about Bitcoin is the idea that it can mean several different things to different people, each with a viable bullish interpretation. At one extreme, Bitcoin can be seen as a ""monetary revolution"" capable of replacing all other currencies as a viable payment system and medium of exchange. For us, we take a more grounded approach to recognize Bitcoin as the benchmark for all other cryptocurrencies, holding its place as digital gold. In many ways, the aspect that the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million units within the blockchain source code makes it even better than metal as a finite resource. What we know is that Bitcoin has performed well as a store of value particularly in the environment of macro uncertainty and the apparent failure of the centralized monetary systems. The outlook for higher prices is based on the understanding that it's being traded against an unlimited supply of fiat currencies. ARK Invest Battle-tested through the market events over the past several years, Bitcoin has earned its place as a unique and distinct asset class alongside traditional asset classes like equities, bonds, and cash along with alternative asset classes covering commodities, precious metals, art, real estate, etc. This upcoming introduction of a spot market ETF forces investors who may have been on the sidelines to give Bitcoin a second look. A move by individual and institutional investors alike to allocate just a fraction of investable capital into Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio strategy could be a major tailwind for prices. Research from "" ARK Invest "" highlights that Bitcoin, within the broader category of crypto assets, remains relatively tiny in terms of market capitalization next to other asset classes. The latest data suggests that Bitcoin's total value is around $700 billion, which is just a fraction of the $12 trillion value of Gold. The group concludes that crypto assets could represent a $25 trillion market value by 2030 including the potential for innovations like smart contracts and other blockchain technologies. Using the addressable market of various use cases for Bitcoin between corporate balance sheet holdings, allocations into investment channels, and gold's market cap as a reference point; Ark believes Bitcoin's price can approach $700k by 2030 as its base case. ARK Invest What's Next For BTC? It's clear to us that the market is trading higher in a sort of anticipation of the launch of a Bitcoin ETF. Going back to the current market value of Bitcoin around $700 billion, the potential that an ETF quickly amasses several billion dollars in assets under management would be impressive but otherwise represent only a marginal direct impact on the total Bitcoin price. At the same time, we believe it would be a mistake to assume this rally will just unravel when the final approval goes through. What we believe is happening is a bigger move signaling the underlying strength of Bitcoin within its long-term potential. In this case, Bitcoin has shined as a store of value when comparatively ""nothing"" appears safe in the context of the current macro volatility. Even with cash offering +5% returns, the appreciation of Bitcoin implies the market is assigning a higher premium eyeing its role outside the traditional monetary system. So while Bitcoin has rallied in 2023 alongside U.S. Dollar strength and rising bond yields, we believe a reversal in both those trends could set the stage for the next leg higher in Bitcoin as a new catalyst. This would be driven as real rates reverse lower, possibly as a result of inflation expectations trending lower confirming a view that the Fed is done with rate hikes. Finviz BTC Price Target 2024 We're very bullish on Bitcoin but plan on taking it one step at a time. Getting back above $33k as an 18-month high is an important milestone and we see $50k as the next major price target into 2024. Considering that the 2022 low was a market capitulation, we don't see much in terms of technical resistance on the upside in the near term. In terms of risks, some unforeseen setbacks where a Bitcoin ETF does not get approved or some other regulatory roadblock would likely add to volatility and open the door for a deeper selloff. As long as BTC holds the $30k level as a key area of psychological support, the bulls will stay in control.

Bitcoin Shows Little On-Chain Resistance Ahead","Bitcoin might have an easy path toward the $40,000 mark as on-chain data suggests there isn’t much resistance ahead. Bitcoin Levels Ahead Are Thin With Addresses Right Now According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, there isn’t any exceptionally large resistance ahead for BTC. In on-chain analysis, resistance and support levels are defined on the basis of whether a large number of investors have bought their coins at the price levels or not. The reason behind this is that the holders often show some reaction to the spot price retesting their cost basis (that is, their acquisition price). Whether they react by selling or buying could depend on which side the price is retesting their cost basis from. When the spot value retests an investor’s cost basis from below, that is, when said investor had been in loss previously, the holder may react by selling their coins. This is because they might fear that Bitcoin would go down again, so exiting at break-even would sound like the ideal option. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mania: EY Insider Reveals Demand From Wall Street Titans, $40,000 Soon? On the other hand, the opposite type of retest may lead to the investor accumulating more, as they may think that since these same price levels turned out to be profitable earlier, they would do so again in the future. Such buying and selling are insignificant on smaller scales, but if a large number of investors have their cost basis inside a particular price range, then the range could act as support or resistance for the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows how the different Bitcoin price ranges look like on the basis of the concentration of investors who bought at them: Looks like the ranges ahead aren't that thick | Source: IntoTheBlock As displayed above, the price ranges after the current one doesn’t host the cost basis of that many investors. This implies that these prices shouldn’t offer too much resistance to the cryptocurrency, should a retest of them happen. The range that’s thickest with investors currently is the one above $38,200, meaning that it would potentially be the trickiest to clear on the way to $40,000. This range, too, however, isn’t that much in terms of investor concentration when compared to the price levels Bitcoin has already cleared. From the graph, it’s visible that the levels under $31,000 are especially rich with addresses. Thus, if the cryptocurrency observes a retrace towards them, it should potentially find some strong support. IntoTheBlock also notes that with the latest rally, about 80% of the investors have now come into a state of profit, which is the highest level that the metric has seen since the bull market peak back in 2021.

The listing of the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation may have sparked the breakout. Factors such as China's stimulus and the upcoming halving are also bullish for Bitcoin. Bitcoin could reach $100,000 in the next bull cycle. Thesis Summary Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has shattered through the $30,000 level and is up 20% in the last five days, reaching close to $35,000 as I write this. We have had big news in the last few weeks regarding a Bitcoin ETF, and on Monday, BlackRock listed the iShares Bitcoin Trust on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. This may have very well sparked the breakout. We also have some other ""fundamental"" factors which are very bullish for Bitcoin, including the China stimulus and the upcoming halving. From a technical perspective, it's only normal that a breakout above $30K would spark new YTD highs. In my last article on Bitcoin , I did say I was expecting a deeper pull-back, but with the recent moves, we could be taking a more direct route up. I present both a bullish and ""less immediately bullish"" scenario for Bitcoin in this article. Bitcoin is Back Without wanting to jump the gun, it's hard not to get excited about Bitcoin following this latest rally. Many technical and fundamental factors seem to be lining up, and a new BTC bull market could be imminent. In the last few weeks, we have been inching closer and closer to a BTC ETF, which has helped ignite the Bitcoin price. As I wrote about last week , the SEC did not appeal the court ruling on GBTC's ETF application. This could be interpreted as a sign that the SEC might actually be ready to approve Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin's price began to react, rallying as markets opened last Monday. If this wasn't already a clear sign of what's to come, today, BlackRock listed the iShares Bitcoin Trust on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. What does this mean exactly? By registering in the DTCC, BlackRock is prepping the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which already has a ticker, IBTC, for launch. A DTCC subsidiary - National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) - has a process for clearing ETFs that includes ""the ability to review…the ETF's portfolio constituents, which is also used to automate the creation and redemption of ETF shares and their subsequent settlement,"" according to the company. Source: Yahoo Finance On top of that, Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg also noted that following BlackRock's amendment to its ETF filing on October 18th, the company has even specified a date for the fund to be seeded, i.e., funded. The filing also contained language that seed creation baskets were to be purchased in October ""subject to conditions"" but did not specify a date or amount. Source: Blockworks I'm not sure what other investors and the SEC think, but BlackRock's actions signal that they are pretty confident in their ETF being approved. Adding even more wood to the fire, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is now turning a profit on its Bitcoin holdings, and the company has said that it will be purchasing more Bitcoin in the coming months. Perfect Timing The timing for the Bitcoin ETF, in my opinion, could not be better. We have a lot of factors coming together that could push Bitcoin into a full-blown bull market. China's Also Back This one has gone unnoticed by many, but it's important. China is injecting record stimulus. PBOC liquidity injections (Bloomberg) The Chinese economy has been struggling, and the PBoC has been loosening monetary policy over the last few months. As these liquidity injections make their way through the system, a lot of other assets will benefit, and Bitcoin perhaps the most. In fact, this is a dynamic I talked about back in February when markets and Bitcoin began to rally on the back of a trillion-dollar increase in global liquidity . The Bitcoin Cycle BTC Long-term chart (TradingView) Anyone who follows Bitcoin knows that the price seems to react quite strongly to the halving. Typically, we see Bitcoin enter a bull market following the halving. The bear market ensues, and then we get a distribution phase as we approach the next halving. We have been in a distribution phase for the last few months, and the next halving is now estimated to be 171 days away. Based on history, this suggests that a bull market could be close, if not already upon us. Flight To Safety Lastly, I propose another reason why Bitcoin could be rallying. The recent rise in rates has taken a toll on stocks, and the recent release of bank earnings has, once again, brought the issues of bank health and unrealized losses to the forefront. Could Bitcoin be acting as a ""safe haven"", much like it did back in March? BTC and KRE (TradingView) The above chart shows the Bitcoin price in orange and the KRE in red/green. It seems like Bitcoin has a nasty habit of rallying when the financial system struggles. Technical Analysis With the latest rally, it seems like a bull run to new all-time highs could begin. Bitcoin TA (Author's work) Arguably, we completed wave 1 when we rallied into $30,000 back in June. Since then, we have been correcting in wave 2, and with the break above the previous high, we can now confirm that an initial impulse in wave 3 has begun. Based on the length of our large degree wave 1, wave 3 could take us into the $77.000 region, which is the 1.618 ext, and the final bull market for Bitcoin could end with new all-time highs just above $100.000. With that said, it's worth mentioning that this would mean that Bitcoin is playing out a bit differently than in previous cycles. As I mentioned in my last article, Bitcoin has sold off just ahead of the halving in previous cycles. BTC previous halving (Author's work) This is what happened in 2020, though arguably, this was aided by the COVID situation. In any case, I don't think we are necessarily out of the woods yet. I could also conceive of a more immediately bearish scenario where Bitcoin has yet to complete a deeper sell-off. BTC bear case (Author's work) I could also make the case that Bitcoin is still working on a much larger impulse, which would end around the $40,000 level. This would be a lot more bullish in the long-term, as it would project us even higher in the long term, but it would mean that after rallying to $40,000, Bitcoin could sell off in a wave 2, and retrace back into the $25,000 range. The $40,000 area is also a critical volume level, so this will be an important hurdle for Bitcoin. Final Thoughts All in all, I remain cautiously bullish on Bitcoin. While I would have preferred to see a deeper pull-back, and I believe we could still see one later on, this doesn't affect my long-term outlook and conviction. Bitcoin is setting up for a big rally; that seems clear to me. Institutions will start buying, liquidity dynamics could be turning, and the halving is nearing.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4642874-bitcoin-back-from-the-dead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png

Grayscale's GBTC may also be in line to be approved as a spot ETF in the U.S. after its legal fight with the SEC over the rejection of Grayscale's application to convert the trust into an ETF was ruled in the investment firm's favor.

""So we are launching a regulated digital market to handle these regulated tokenized assets.""  The target audience for the new exchange will be professional investors and institutions, he said.

Market analysts are optimistic about Ethereum’s potential breakout before October ends, with buy orders anticipated to fuel a substantial 12.25% surge, propelling the price to $1,958. In addition, investors have steadfastly held onto their investments in DeFi assets within the Ethereum ecosystem, demonstrating unwavering confidence even in the face of the enduring crypto market challenges. Despite the tumultuous nature of the crypto market, these investors remain committed to the potential and promise of DeFi, believing in its ability to revolutionize traditional financial systems. As per insights provided by DefiLlama, these assets collectively represent an impressive total value locked at $21.27 billion, reflecting the substantial trust and financial commitment placed in the Ethereum DeFi landscape by the investor community. This data solidifies its position as a cornerstone of the broader crypto financial landscape. Ethereum TVL. Source: DeFiLlama As traders eagerly await this upswing, trading volume is projected to witness a notable spike, reflecting growing investor interest in securing exposure to Ether beyond the current resistance levels. Reinforcing the positive outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 75, indicating that Ethereum’s upward trajectory is poised to persist. Nevertheless, caution prevails as oversold conditions may trigger profit-taking among traders keen on safeguarding their capital. This dual sentiment of optimism and caution sets the stage for a crucial juncture in Ethereum’s price action. Related Reading: The Dogecoin Advance: A Double-Digit Boost In The Cards? ETH Signs Of Struggle Amidst A Resistance A separate analytical report underscores Ethereum’s recurring struggle with a key resistance level, evident from the persistent price fluctuations converging around this threshold. Historical data points to the ramifications of prolonged resistance, often resulting in sharp price retracements. For Ethereum, this could imply a more pronounced market correction, particularly considering the broader market dynamics currently at play. Investors and traders are advised to closely monitor these resistance levels, which could significantly impact short-term market sentiment and price movements.

What Traders Should Know ETH market cap currently trading at $218.356 Billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Unveiling Ethereum: Low Network Activity Underlying Ethereum’s price fluctuations, an alarming trend emerges concerning the platform’s subdued network activity. Despite its reputation as a thriving ecosystem for decentralized applications, the recent dip in on-chain operations raises concerns about waning interest or a potential shift of focus towards alternative blockchain platforms. An active network isn’t solely reliant on transaction volumes; it signifies ongoing development, upgrades, and the launch of new projects. The recent decline in network activity suggests a potential lull in these critical endeavors, prompting market participants to reevaluate the long-term sustainability of Ethereum’s dominance within the blockchain space. ETH seven-day price action.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, Ethereum’s future trajectory is intricately linked to its ability to address these challenges and uphold its position as a leading blockchain platform, vital for the broader ecosystem’s growth and stability.

19316086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556772,1698152419,Economist Peter Schiff Raises Concerns About Spot Bitcoin ETFs,"The possibility of spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the US SEC has caused excitement in the crypto space as investors gear up for a Bitcoin bullish trend. However, not all voices are convinced of the innovative changes of Bitcoin ETFs, as a prominent economist has cautioned about the potential risks associated with Bitcoin ETFs Schiff Says Bitcoin ETF Selling Risks Ahead Chief Economist and Bitcoin critic, Peter Schiff has aired his concerns about Spot Bitcoin ETFs public in an X (formerly Twitter) post released on Monday. Schiff stated that the crypto market is presently filled with many speculators who are purchasing Bitcoin, in the hopes of capitalizing on the potential influx of investors following the possible approval of spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bullish Bitcoin Price Rally To $41,000, Here’s When In his counter-narrative statement, Schiff revealed that there may be significantly more sellers than buyers of Bitcoin who are also eagerly waiting for Bitcoin ETFs to become a reality. This narrative may become an issue for many Bitcoin investors, because if Bitcoin holders decide to take advantage of the soaring prices and sell their reserved Bitcoin, it may lead to a sudden and sharp correction. “Speculators are buying Bitcoin now because they think other speculators are waiting to buy a Bitcoin ETF. They will soon discover that there are far more speculators waiting to sell than waiting to buy,” Schiff stated. The remarks made by Schiff have sparked opposing arguments and views within the crypto community. Many people see a positive impact on Bitcoin price pushing investors to buy more Bitcoin following the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. “The average number of people that own crypto globally is estimated to be around 420 million, which represents about 5% of the world’s population. Which can also mean 5% speculators waiting to sell and 95% speculators still haven’t entered,” crypto community member, Jeysuhn stated. BTC price surge as spot bitcoin etf sentiment grows | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Lawyer Foresees ETF Approval By Year’s End A pro-XRP lawyer and blockchain enthusiast, John E Deaton took to X on Monday to disclose his insights on the present situation concerning the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC. Deaton predicted that the US SEC would approve spot Bitcoin ETFs before the end of 2023 or at least before the end of Q1 2024. The lawyer stated that the US SEC is currently compiling more information to put forward a different reason for denying Bitcoin ETFs.

42392255,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3H05,1698149917,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin at $34.5K on ETF Excitement,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  After briefly pushing past $35,000 toward the end of the U.S. trading day on Monday, bitcoin has consolidated to levels around $34,500. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has gained 12% over the past 24 hours. Analysts are attributing the sudden jump to BlackRock listing its bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. database with the ticker $IBTC. Blackrock also updated its filings with the SEC, indicating a readiness to seed the ETF starting from October 2023. “This proactive approach from Blackrock suggests their preparedness to initiate trading promptly upon receiving approval from the SEC, further substantiating the optimistic sentiment surrounding an impending approval,” said Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia, in a morning note. The cryptocurrency was back at levels last seen in May 2022, before the Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, Genesis and FTX debacles turned the mood so sour that BTC approached $15,000.  Binance lost its head of U.K. operations last month, continuing a stream of high-level execs heading for the door at the world's largest crypto exchange. Jonathan Farnell, who served as head of Binance U.K. and CEO of its payment service Bifinity (which was disbanded in August) left the firm in September, according to his LinkedIn profile. ""We'd like to thank Jonathan for his contributions and wish him all the best on his next challenge,"" Binance said in an emailed statement. Farnell joined Binance in May 2021, and the following year he became CEO of Eqonex, the holding company of crypto custodian Digivault, under the terms of a loan agreement that gave Binance the right to appoint a CEO from within Bifinity.  Bearish bets on bitcoin (BTC) have cost traders over $178 million in the past 24 hours as prices soared past a critical resistance level. Data shows bitcoin-tracked futures accounted for nearly 50% of the total $400 million in crypto liquidations over Monday, with ether futures seeing $50 million in liquidations over long and short positions. Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Chart of The Day  The fear and greed index, a method used to track investor sentiment, is reading ""greed"" for the first time since mid-July.  Readings above 60 indicate market sentiment has moved into the ""greed"" stage, while those below 40 indicate ""fear.""  The indicator moved from ""neutral"" to ""greed"" after bitcoin reached a 16-month high on Monday.

After a stake pool operator (SPO) poll and thorough deliberations by the Parameters Committee, the foundation decided to update the network to enhance both its competitiveness and user experience. The Cardando Foundation stated via X (formerly Twitter): “As a result of the Stake Pool Operator [SPO]-Poll and a subsequent evaluation by the Parameters Committee, the Cardano Foundation has successfully submitted a transaction on the Cardano mainnet to lower the minPoolCost parameter from 340 to 170 ADA.” This development has been welcomed with a mix of anticipation and strategy from different sections of the Cardano community. Cardano staking pool “Stake with Pride” was quick to pivot in line with the new parameters, remarking: The Cardano min Pool Cost fee has been dropped to 170 ADA from 340. SPOs can drop their fees starting epoch 445 on October 27th. They further pledged to optimize their policies with the recent modifications, firmly anchoring their “minPoolCost to 170 permanently, and Margin to 0% temporarily, as market dynamics are assessed. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Lists Reasons Why Cardano (ADA) Will Not Do Well In The Bull Market The minPoolCost parameter, as explained in a Cardano Foundation blog post from September 13, had twofold objectives since its inception with the Shelley launch in 2020. The primary two goals were to act as a defense against Sybil attacks and to guarantee pool operators a floor income to sustain their server operations. The Cardano Foundation elaborated, “By potentially halving minPoolCost we don’t enforce but allow the operators to reduce their ‘floor’ income.” The strategic change is anticipated to shift market dynamics favorably for smaller pool operators, providing them with a more level playing field. Cardano (ADA) Price Poised For A 65% Rally? The Cardano price has seen a strong uptrend in the past few hours, in line with the overall crypto market. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.282, up 6.5% over the past 24 hours. The 1-day chart of ADA shows that ADA was able to break out of its 6-month downtrend (black line) this past Sunday. On April 15, ADA marked its high for the year at over $0.46, since then the Cardano price has been on the decline. Related Reading: Cardano’s Uncertain Path: Analyst Predicts Plunge, But What’s Next For ADA? As a result of the breakout momentum, ADA was able to overcome the important 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.277. Remarkably, the price has already withstood a retest and established it as new support on the lower time frames. Should ADA manage a daily close above this price level today, the outlook for the Cardano price could turn further bullish. As then, ADA would have to face arguably the most important resistance at the moment, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA, blue line), at $0.299. The price indicator is often referred to as the “bull line”. Accordingly, a breach could maneuver ADA back into bullish territory. ADA last failed to complete a daily close above the 200-day EMA in mid-July. If a breakout into bullish territory succeeds, the next targets would be the Fibonacci retracement level of 0.382 at $0.313, 0.5 at $0.341, 0.618 at $0.370, and 0.786 at $0.411. The pinnacle target remains the annual peak of $0.463, suggesting a prospective ascent of 65% from its present value. In this context, it is important to mention that ADA has underperformed compared to other altcoins so far this year. For example: While Solana (SOL) is currently trading just below its high for the year and Ether (ETH) is only 15% away from a new high for the year, ADA is still 39% below this level. On the one hand, this shows the existing potential, and on the other hand, it shows that ADA has not been one of traders’ favorite altcoins so far in 2023. Whether a rise above the 200-day EMA can change this remains to be seen.

However, the cryptocurrency faces a formidable hurdle at the $0.55 resistance level, a barrier that has thwarted multiple attempts at a substantial recovery over the past couple of months. The question on everyone’s mind: can XRP overcome this crucial obstacle? In recent months, the XRP price has exhibited a sideways trend, primarily oscillating between the horizontal levels of $0.55 and $0.458. While the daily chart reveals significant price fluctuations, traders have struggled to make any substantial progress in either direction, reflecting a market plagued by indecisiveness. Source: Coingecko As of the most recent data, XRP’s price on CoinGecko stands at $0.5396, reflecting a 3.1% rally in the past 24 hours and nearly 10% surge over the last seven days. These gains have stoked anticipation among investors, but the $0.55 resistance continues to cast a shadow. Related Reading: The Dogecoin Advance: A Double-Digit Boost In The Cards? XRP Bullish Indicators XRP traders have established a trading range spanning from $0.47 to $0.54, with the $0.51 midpoint proving to be a pivotal level. This price point has functioned as both support and resistance on multiple occasions, enhancing the range’s credibility. Investors keenly watch for any movements within this range as a potential signal for XRP’s next course of action. XRP seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko A glimmer of hope for XRP supporters comes from several bullish indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above the neutral 50 threshold, indicating that bullish momentum is gathering strength. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) echoes this sentiment, signaling a significant uptrend in progress as the Average Directional Index (ADX) surges past the 20 mark. In the futures market, XRP’s spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) saw a downtrend from Oct. 20-22, even as prices shot higher. While this may have been worrisome for the bulls, the CVD has exhibited a rebound in recent hours. Simultaneously, the Open Interest and the price have trended higher, underscoring a robust bullish sentiment in the near term. Related Reading: Can Solana Sustain Its Recent Rally? What Traders Should Know XRP market cap currently at $28.769 billion. Chart: TradingView.com A Glimpse Into The Future The critical question that XRP investors must grapple with is whether the cryptocurrency can successfully breach the $0.55 resistance. A breakthrough at this level would serve as a solid foundation for extending the current rally. Nonetheless, caution is advised as traders should seek a daily candle close above this level before committing funds. In the event of a successful breakout, XRP could potentially target the $0.60 level, offering the possibility of a 16% gain. As XRP navigates the precarious waters of resistance and support, market participants remain on edge, eagerly anticipating the next chapter in this cryptocurrency’s journey.

The popular frog-themed memecoin is now trading at a two-month high as the burn quells concerns over the team's token holdings. The team now holds 3.79 trillion tokens ($3.72 million), which would have minimal impact if sold on the open market as 24-hour trading volume has surged to $397 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

""Uses for the remaining 3.79T tokens attributed to the original team CEX multi-sig wallet for strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities are currently being explored.""  The decision to burn tokens came after a handful of rogue pepe developers executed a series of unexpected transfers out of the project's multisignature wallet, effectively stealing millions of dollars worth of pepe, as alleged by a team member.  The tokens burned equate to 1.6% of the memecoin's total supply.  The rise in PEPE coincided with bitcoin rallying to a 17-month high of $35,000, fueled by optimism around the potential approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).

The cryptocurrency is up by 3.63% in the past 24 hours and 5.79% in a seven-day timeframe. However, a larger timescale reveals a different picture, as the value of the cryptocurrency has dropped by 49% since reaching its yearly high of 0.00001471 on February 5. Nevertheless, positive momentum could be building up at the moment, particularly with Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium attaining a new milestone. Shibarium Reaches 1.3 Million Mined Blocks Shibarium was created to provide lower gas fees and faster transaction times for Shiba Inu. As a result, the Layer-2 scaling solution has been well accepted by the Shiba Inu community since it launched, despite having a few hiccups after its early stages. Data from Shibariumscan revealed that Shibarium recently surpassed 1.3 million blocks mined and a total transaction of 3.574 million. Related Reading: Solana Remains Institutional Investor Darling As Inflows Continue The 1.3 million block milestone in such a short time shows the sheer capability and adaption of Shibarium. Each block has an average processing time of 5.0 seconds, demonstrating its efficiency and speed. In comparison, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has a block creation time of 10 minutes. Potential Price Impact For SHIB? Past news around Shibarium has always positively affected the price of SHIB. Each new milestone and benchmark reached in developing Shibarium generates excitement and drives up the price of SHIB. Rumors surrounding its launch in August propelled SHIB to $0.00001137, although it has since lost most of those gains. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000007484, and it appears to be on the verge of a price breakout that could retest its August highs. This would mean a 43% spike from its current price. According to data from DeFi aggregator DeFiLlama, the total TVL in Shibarium is now at $770,562. While this is low compared to its TVL of $1.47 million in late August, the new milestone and Shibarium’s continued adoption could also push up the TVL in the next few days.

This will ensure the health of the privacy ecosystem but it will also advance the Web3 industry as a whole, providing mentorship and funding during this difficult macroeconomic climate,” Halpin said.  The program will open for applications in November, and the initial focus for applications will be crypto wallets, remote procedure calls (RPCs) and essential resources, tools, infrastructure and initiatives that benefit the broader ecosystem and are available to the public as open-source projects.

Pimbley's testimony looks to address similar financial concerns, although he seems to be more focused on allegations from various FTX insiders about the line of credit to Alameda and the size of funds the trading firm actually took from FTX.  Some diagrams in Pimbley’s disclosure statement also suggest he may speak to FTX's actual balances.  Whether the jury finds this testimony compelling enough to cast reasonable doubt on Bankman-Fried's alleged guilt remains to be seen.  While Pimbley may be able to poke logical holes in some details and allegations illustrated by the DOJ’s witnesses so far, it'll be difficult to overcome the emotional impact of Bankman-Fried's closest friends and former colleagues getting on the stand and saying they committed crimes with him.  What we’re expecting  Court is on break for another two days. However, defense lawyers have a deadline today to tell prosecutors and the court who their first few witnesses may be – at least those who may testify on Thursday, assuming the defense does indeed choose to bring a case. This list – like the prosecutors' list of witnesses – may not be immediately released to the public.  CoinDesk asked a spokesperson for Bankman-Fried how many witnesses might testify but received no response by press time.  Of course, the big mystery is whether Bankman-Fried himself will testify, and as we wrote in yesterday's newsletter, pretty much everyone seems to think he probably will.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/24/the-sam-bankman-fried-trial-one-expert-witness,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392247,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3GL3,1698141483,Binance Again Seeks to Nix ‘Incendiary’ CFTC Suit,"Binance renewed its push to fend off charges from U.S. commodity regulators on Monday, as the world’s biggest crypto exchange faces increasing heat from enforcers.  The exchange says the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is trying to police the world by taking action against a company, which on paper has sought to avoid U.S. business.  “The CFTC relies on new and broad arguments that would allow it to regulate any activity in cryptocurrency (or other assets) related to a derivatives product anywhere on the globe,” said a filing made by Binance in an Illinois court late Monday.  “U.S. law governs domestically but does not control the world. Congress did not make the CFTC the world’s derivatives police,” Binance’s filing said, adding that the agency’s complaint “resorts to incendiary language” against Binance and Zhao.  In March, the CFTC charged Binance with knowingly offering unregistered crypto derivatives. In a subsequent Sept. 22 filing, the agency said Zhao had “deliberately targeted” the U.S. market and that, in any case, U.S. commodities law explicitly governs foreign conduct.  “Binance has at all times embraced a wink-and-nod corporate ethos toward getting U.S. customers through ‘creative means’,” the September filing said, citing industry events such as a Binance-hosted Grammy party in Las Vegas.  “Binance and Zhao’s fetish for secrecy and refusal to comply with regulatory requirements have made Binance a haven for dark net users, criminals and terrorists that wish to move their assets around the globe,” the regulator’s filing added.  Binance says its U.S. domestic business is handled by a separate entity, Binance.US. Both companies are also seeking to toss a suit from another federal regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and there have also been rumors of a probe by the Department of Justice.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/24/binance-again-seeks-to-nix-incendiary-cftc-suit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28864b4031f4e99c0b047c2557050e7890e04ea4-1582x890.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price surged briefly above $35,000 early Tuesday before retreating. The move was likely led by demand ahead of a possible ETF approval, coupled with $178 million in short liquidations – which may have added to buying pressure as traders covered losing positions with bitcoin purchases.  Total market capitalization rose 8% to reach levels not seen since mid-August. Bitcoin dominance – a ratio of the token’s capitalization compared with the rest of the market – crossed 50%, suggesting general demand for the sector.  Ethereum gas fees spiked 400%, indicative of riskier on-chain token trading gaining traction among traders, with lesser-known HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (which trades with a BITCOIN ticker) and SPX6900 (SPX) tokens surging as much as 40%.  Meanwhile, gains in tokens of layer 1 blockchains Solana [SOL] and Aptos [APT] seemed to slow after a nearly 30% rally over the past week, ending concerns of a supply overhang leading to sell-offs across both tokens. A bullish outlook for the tokens remains intact among some traders.  “Both projects are excellent representatives of the current Layer-1 public chains,” James Wo, founder and CEO of crypto fund DFG, said in a message to CoinDesk. ""Aptos is a representative of an emerging public chain with advanced underlying technology and a strong mass base, while Solana has a successful commercialization operation, has accumulated a rich ecosystem and a large number of users, and has long been undervalued due to its connection to the FTX collapse.”  “As time passes and it becomes clearer that FTX's assets are frozen, the positive news in the sector is having an increasing impact on SOL,” Wo said.  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX was an early investor in Solana and regularly receives a significant volume of SOL unlocked according to a planned vesting schedule. It held over $1.16 billion worth of the tokens as of September, according to a court filing.  However, the FTX bankruptcy estate recently staked 5.5 million SOL, worth $122 million at the time, earlier this month, quelling bearish concerns.  MINA spiked as much as 70%, seemingly as Upbit, South Korean largest crypto exchange, listed the tokens. Upbit surpassed centralized exchanges Coinbase and OKX in terms of trading volume for the first time in July, according to a report by CCData.

Jonathan Farnell, who served as head of Binance U.K. and CEO of its payment service Bifinity (which was disbanded in August) left the firm in September, according to his LinkedIn profile.  ""We'd like to thank Jonathan for his contributions and wish him all the best on his next challenge,"" Binance said in an emailed statement.  Farnell joined Binance in May 2021, and the following year, he took up the position of CEO of Eqonex, the holding company of crypto custodian Digivault as per the terms of a loan agreement, which gave Binance the right to appoint a CEO from within Bifinity.  Bifinity was looking to acquire Eqonex at the time, but it fell through, and Eqonex entered voluntary liquidation in November 2022.  Farnell appeared to serve as Eqonex CEO concurrently with his employ at Binance, according to his LinkedIn profile.  Binance has suffered a number of high-profile departures in recent months, most recently losing Global Product Lead Mayur Kamat earlier this month.

They now look ready to break out higher and transition into uptrends. Bitcoin is trading at key pivotal levels against the USD, against the SPY, and against Gold. I am closely watching price action here. From a broader perspective, the strength in cryptocurrencies and gold, coupled with weakness in financials, suggests an increasing loss in confidence in the banking sector. Cryptocurrencies and related stocks have stayed dormant for months, with sentiment taking a big hit from the FTX saga back in November 2022. Markets tend to bottom when news is the worst, things are the most bleak, and at a time when it is the most difficult to put money in. So far, the FTX low has marked the bottom for cryptocurrencies, and after close to a year of basing and consolidation, they look ready to breakout and transition into uptrends. Looking at the weekly chart of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) below, we may observe a series of higher lows since the FTX saga. While there has yet to be a spectacular high-momentum breakout, Bitcoin is now trading right at the key 31-32k pivot, which marks the crucial July 2021 swing low. Weekly Chart: Bitcoin TradingView I think Bitcoin is gathering energy for a powerful breakout through this area. If the breakout materialises, then there is a strong chance Bitcoin would be transitioning to an uptrend. Zooming into the daily chart of Bitcoin, we can see that Bitcoin had built a mini multi-week base recently and broke above the 28k pivot on 16 October. This was on the back of rumours that the SEC was set to approve the launch of Bitcoin-related ETFs. Though the breakout faded when BlackRock denied the plausibility of these rumours , prices still held above the 28k pivot. Daily Chart: Bitcoin TradingView On 20 October, JP Morgan stated the SEC was indeed likely to approve the Bitcoin ETFs in the coming months , which led to a surge higher in Bitcoin, thus confirming the breakout above the 28k pivot. Fueled by this positive catalyst, Bitcoin is now making a run for the 31-32k pivot, which will be a more difficult but rewarding test. If the breakout materialises, it is likely to pave the way for a move to the psychological 40k level. There are a few charts I am watching closely to confirm if cryptocurrencies are ready to embark on a bull run. For starters, it is imperative that the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio spikes higher. Now, it is still on a steep downtrend. An uptrending ratio would indicate that altcoins are outperforming the safe, stable Bitcoin. It is akin to healthy market breadth where the Russell 2000 ( IWM ) outperforms the S&P 500 ( SPY ). Daily Chart: Ethereum to Bitcoin Ratio TradingView Secondly, I am watching to see if Bitcoin can break out against the SPY. Below is the weekly chart of the Bitcoin to SPY ratio, which is also testing a key pivot. If Bitcoin outperforms equities, I want to be involved in cryptocurrencies. Weekly Chart: Bitcoin to SPY Ratio TradingView Lastly, I am also watching the Bitcoin to Gold ( GLD ) ratio. This ratio is also testing a pivotal area, similar to Bitcoin against SPY. Breakout successfully, and that would be another big positive for cryptocurrencies. Weekly Chart: Bitcoin to Gold Ratio TradingView From a broader perspective, the recent strength in cryptocurrencies and precious metals, coupled with persistent weakness in financials, might be signaling an increased loss in confidence in the banking sector. I wrote on 14 October here that gold was poised to break out higher. So far, the signs are good, and gold is making a very strong push towards the $2,000 pivot. Weekly Chart: Gold TradingView Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLF ) looks very fragile. Prices appear to be building out a descending wedge pattern, characterised by lower highs and a flat support at $31.50. This key support looks likely to be tested, and a break below is likely to pave the way for much lower prices. Weekly Chart: XLF TradingView Regional banks ( KRE ) continue to be plagued by a huge overhanging head and shoulders pattern. The struggles from back in March 2023 appear to be adversely affecting the sector still, and KRE looks likely to take out its May swing lows. Weekly Chart: KRE TradingView All in all, the strength in cryptocurrencies and gold, coupled with weakness in Financials, appear to be painting a bleak picture for the banking sector. I want to refrain from hastily drawing too many conclusions and will focus on the price action at hand. At the moment, I think the long cryptocurrencies trade looks attractive from a risk-reward perspective. I am long Bitcoin, and will likely add to my position if it can break the 31k pivot. My target is the 40k level at least.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4642807-bitcoin-at-a-major-breakout-point-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19308815.jpeg

Ethereum gas fees spiked from 9 gwei to over 45 gwei in the same period, indicating strong block demand. Gwei is a small unit of ether (ETH) equal to one-billionth of an ETH.  Gas refers to the fees Ethereum users pay to ensure their transactions are included in the earliest block by network validators. These validators are incentivized to include transactions that pay the highest fees instead of a first-come-first-serve basis – meaning fees on popular tokens can often run to thousands of dollars.  Some of this year’s most popular meme coins, such as pepecoin (PEPE), zoomed as much as 40% in the past 24 hours, showing signs of an on-chain trading frenzy. Elsewhere, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (which trades with a BITCOIN ticker) rose 39%, while SPX6900 (SPX) jumped as much as 25%.  The tickers of these tokens mimic bitcoin and the U.S. stock index S&P500 but have a combined market capitalization of over $120 million – showing the strong draw that jokes have in some parts of the crypto market.

CoinShares data shows that a portion of the momentum observed can be attributed to an increasing expectation for the authorization of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States. The aggregate value of assets under management (AuM) has experienced a notable surge, reaching $33 billion, denoting a 15% growth rate since the beginning of September.

This influx was specifically directed towards investment products related to Bitcoin. As a result, the cumulative inflows for Bitcoin products during the current year have reached a total of $315 million. Solana experienced an additional infusion of $15.5 million during the previous week, resulting in a cumulative inflow of $74 million for the year. This notable performance positions Solana as the leading alternative cryptocurrency thus far in the current year. Source: Coinshares On the other hand, and amidst persisting concerns, Ethereum faced a challenging week as it observed a significant outflow of $7.4 million. Notably, Ethereum was the only altcoin to encounter a decline in its financial performance during this period. Other altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB) saw small inflows of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, pointed out that the inflows observed in the previous week have not yet achieved the same magnitude as those witnessed earlier this year when BlackRock initially submitted an application for a Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin slightly below the $34K level today. Chart: TradingView.com Butterfill said: “While the most recent inflows are likely linked to excitement over a spot Bitcoin ETF launch in the U.S., they are relatively low in comparison to the initial inflows following BlackRock’s announcement in June.” Navigating The Digital Asset Landscape: Trends And Caution Digital assets are becoming more and more popular, and many people are investing in them.

19306266,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556703,1698132627,God Candle Coming For XRP Price? Crypto Analyst Reveals His Target,"The XRP price has experienced a strong upswing along with the entire crypto market in the past few hours. XRP has temporarily risen by more than 5%, approaching a crucial resistance zone that if broken could trigger a strong and impulsive “god candle”. Renowned crypto analyst Egrag unveiled his latest technical analysis on XRP’s price trajectory, sparking excitement within the crypto community. Using the 3-day XRP/USDT price chart, Egrag brings attention to several pivotal moments and trends.”XRP Gods Candle, it is coming, tweeted Egrag. The “Berlin Wall” Of Resistance For XRP Price In his analysis, Egrag likened the XRP’s resistance level to the infamous ‘Berlin Wall’, describing the resistance as both formidable and tantalizingly close to a breakdown. “Fast forward to today, and XRP is still chipping away at what can only be described as its own ‘Berlin Wall’ of resistance. With each small pinch, this formidable barrier inches closer to its inevitable collapse,” stated Egrag. Related Reading: Mid-Term XRP Price Targets Revealed By Crypto Analyst The “Berlin Wall” at $0.5574 served as a strong support from May 2021 to May 2022. Egrag’s chart shows two critical moments when the price level served as important support. However, in early May 2022, the XRP price fell below this support level. After that, XRP was rejected at the Berlin Wall in two key moments. After the summary judgment in the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the wall was overcome only for a short time, despite the first God candle. Within 4 weeks, the price fell back below the price level. Now, however, the wall seems to be crumbling and resistance is getting lower, Egrag believes. The analyst highlights the potential upside of this impending breakout: “The potential breakthrough looming on the horizon promises to be nothing short of spectacular. My expectations are set on XRP’s forthcoming move, which I anticipate falling within the impressive range of $1.10 to $1.40.” Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Surge Amid Heightened Whale Accumulation Egrag also emphasized the emergence of a distinct ‘W’ pattern in XRP’s price action over the past 2+ months. This pattern is historically significant, often linked to trend reversals and strong price momentum. “Now, let’s take a closer look at the current technical analysis. It’s apparent that XRP is in the process of forming a distinct ‘W’ pattern,” Egrag noted, suggesting a bullish outlook, “This pattern suggests a measured move to approximately $0.65.” The Rebounce Furthermore, the $0.65 mark isn’t just a random figure in Egrag’s analysis. A successful move past this resistance can set the stage for a bullish trend, and a short-term retest of the $0.55 to $0.58 cents range. Egrag highlights the importance of this level, stating, “Our next significant milestone is around 65 cents, and a successful breach at this level would indicate a bullish trend.” The climax of Egrag’s prediction centers around the potential for a “Rebounce” — a term he employs to describe a swift and robust bounce in the price of XRP. Should this Rebounce materialize, Egrag is optimistic about the coin reaching the $1.10 to $1.40 range. Concluding his update with a message to the ardent followers of XRP, Egrag affirmed, “XRP Army STAY STEADY, Our moment in the spotlight is drawing near, and your unwavering commitment will soon be rewarded.” At press time, XRP was trading at $0.5422 and was rejected on the first attempt at the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level ($0.5539).

The jump in bitcoin prices came as a ticker registration bumped hopes of an oncoming spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval.  Data shows bitcoin-tracked futures accounted for nearly 50% of the total $400 million in crypto liquidations over Monday, with ether futures only seeing $50 million in liquidations over long and short positions.  Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Crypto exchanges Binance, Huobi and OKX saw liquidations worth $50 million each, suggesting a large amount of leverage used on those platforms. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance, with an order value of $10 million.  Bitcoin prices spiked 12%, surging to a high of $35,200 before retreating on Tuesday morning. The huge move was likely driven by relatively lower volumes and outsized demand – adding tens of billions of dollars to market capitalization in a few hours.  Crypto communities and analysts attributed the move to the ticker registration of Blackrock's spot bitcoin ETF – which remains under consideration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Such expectations have boosted hopes of a bullish revival of the crypto market, which has been in a general lull over the past several months.  “Bitcoin has also been encouraged by possible ETF approval and an increasing number of ETF submissions by leading companies,” shared Lucy Hu, senior trader at Metalpha, in a message last week. “(With the) Bitcoin ETF approval and halving event in April, the crypto market could kickstart a very robust bull market,” Hu added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/24/bitcoin-bears-lose-178m-as-prices-break-past-34k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/142132f031dc61af9afc4214d4ddcf4afcfcfc3f-4272x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419363,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELlt,1698125212,Bitcoin in ‘Anti-Gravity’ Phase as ETF Approval Nears Finish Line,"After briefly pushing past $35,000 towards the end of the U.S. trading day, before dropping back down, bitcoin (BTC) is continuing its march back towards $35,000, up 12% as Asia opens.  CoinDesk Indicies data shows that bitcoin is now trading above $34,000, with the Bitcoin Trend Indicator showing a “significant uptrend” as the long-awaited bitcoin ETF inches closer to reality.  In a note, Bernstein attributes the rally – which pushed bitcoin past a critical resistance point of $31,000 – to BlackRock listing its bitcoin ETF on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database with the ticker $IBTC.  “Bitcoin is in an ‘anti-gravity’ phase and could hit $75,000 in the coming months,” Woo Network’s Jack Tan said to CoinDesk in a note. “The sudden spike is just a preview of what will happen if ETFs actually get approved. A lot of this expected impact on the BTC price has already been priced in since the $25,000 level (back in February), as the GBTC discount had been narrowing to 16% as of last Friday’s close.”  Tan also noted that altcoins are trading more in line with tech stocks as they don’t have the flight to safety mechanism of bitcoin, and he expects them to underperform bitcoin and ether – the latter of which will “eventually catch up with bitcoin.”  “Bitcoin has been the recipient of most of these positive catalysts, and BTC dominance is now the highest it has been since early 2021, with the bellwether digital asset grabbing market share from ETH and stablecoins,” added David Lo, Bybit’s head of financial products in a Telegram message. “However, there may be some selling pressure on the horizon for GBTC as the discount gap narrows; there may be some who bought at the lows of 40% discount looking to sell into these prices.”  Quinn Thompson, Maple Finance’s Head of Capital Markets and Growth, believes that bitcoin is emerging as the modern equivalent of gold, serving as a refuge for investors during economic uncertainties, echoing BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s description of the recent crypto rally as a “flight to quality” amid global challenges.  “Fink’s ‘flight to quality’ comment mirrors Paul Tudor Jones’ recent remarks as well. 20 years ago, gold served this purpose, but now it's bitcoin. And he’s appropriately reading the tea leaves,” Thompson said during a recent CoinDesk TV interview. “He wouldn’t be publicly voicing these opinions if the SEC was going to deny his ETF application.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | WOO,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/24/bitcoin-in-anti-gravity-phase-as-etf-approval-nears-finish-line,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/413abe79c366782251095cd77ffaf2306b957fe3-2190x1369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19298560,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556676,1698117650,"Bitcoin Price Crosses $35,000, Here’s Why","The Bitcoin price barreled past the $35,000 level on multiple exchanges about an hour ago and has continued to maintain impressive bullish momentum. The reason for the surge is once again tied back to the anticipation around a potential approval of the BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF and the expectations of it triggering a bull market. BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Listing Surfaces The Bitcoin price rally was triggered by an image that has been circulated many times on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) showing that the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker IBTC. Source: X Usually, a listing on the DTCC is taken as a step for ETFs that are ready for approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, BlackRock, which is the largest asset management company in the world, reportedly told the regulator that it plans to seed its Spot Bitcoin ETF in October. So the asset manager looks to be readying for an October launch as well. Related Reading: ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood Reveals Why Bitcoin Will Reach $1.48 Million As Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas explains, “Seeding an ETF is when initial funding is provided (typically) by a bank or broker dealer used to purchase a few creation units (in this case bitcoin) in exchange for ETF shares which can be traded in open market on Day One.” It should be noted that just because an ETF is listed on the DTCC does not mean that it will gain immediate approval. Some ETFs will sit on the DTCC for months or years at a time before gaining approval to trade, while some simply never launch. However, given BlackRock’s influence, expectations are the company is doing this in preparation for approval. BTC price crosses $35,000 briefly | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Following The Bitcoin Price Growth Trend The Bitcoin price increase has been mostly an ‘up-only’ trend with some pits and stops along the way. In the last 24 hours, the digital asset is already up over 14% with other metrics following swiftly behind such as market cap and daily trading volume. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume jumped over 257% since the rally began, currently sitting at $44.7 billion. Likewise, the Bitcoin open interest has seen a 6.36% increase across all exchanges, bringing total open interest to $15.05 billion at the time of writing. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Getting Ready To Explode: Analyst Presents 16,500% Blowout The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has also jumped to a six-month high, flashing a very greedy 66. This means that investors are more willing to jump into the digital asset and the evidence of this is in its rising daily trading volumes, as mentioned above. The Bitcoin price has since retraced from the $35,000 level but continues to trade just above $34,500 where the bulls seem to have established support. A successful retest of the $35,000 resistance would set the Bitcoin price on a path to $40,000.

42419359,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELin,1698108858,Sam Bankman-Fried Proposes Financial Expert as Witness to Rebut DOJ Testimony,"Sam Bankman-Fried's defense team named Joseph Pimbley as their sole proposed expert witness in the FTX founder's ongoing criminal case.  Pimbley, a member of litigation consulting firm PF2, will respond to testimony from former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and developer Adam Yedidia, and former FTX Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang and Head of Engineering Nishad Singh, the defense said in a Monday court filing.  ""Pimbley will testify to his opinion, based on data extracted from FTX’s database, that: (i) usage by Alameda Research of its line of credit fluctuated between approximately $1 billion and $3 billion between October 2021 and September of 2022 and decreased for a substantial portion of June 2022; and (ii) the majority of balances for non-Alameda, non-FTX users (i.e., accounts excluding Alameda’s accounts and FTX’s own accounts) are concentrated in just four coins (USD, BTC, ETH, and USDT) relative to the hundreds of coins defined within the FTX database, and more than 75% of non-Alameda, non-FTX balances arise from accounts that have spot margin enabled, spot margin lending enabled, or show futures activity,"" the filing said.  In a disclosure statement, Pimbley said he ""extracted data"" about how much of FTX's line of credit Alameda actually used, the balances in all accounts based on FTX's Amazon Web Services database (organized by the type of cryptocurrency it was denominated in) and other information. His disclosure also includes his database queries and some charts and diagrams tied to his work on the case.  Pimbley, one of seven potential experts named in the defense’s original pitch for witnesses earlier this year, was initially rejected by Judge Lewis Kaplan, the Southern District of New York official overseeing the case. The judge allowed the defense to renominate four of the prospects as witnesses if they shared more specifics about what they would testify to.  While Pimbley is the sole proposed expert witness, this does not mean he's the only witness who may testify in Bankman-Fried's defense. Other witnesses may testify if they have a direct role or connection with FTX. The defense has not yet said if Bankman-Fried himself will testify.  Read all of CoinDesk's coverage here.  Prosecutors trying Bankman-Fried's case told the court they expect to rest shortly after the trial resumes on Oct. 26.

42419365,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUELnx,1698106121,"A Wild Few Minutes Drive Bitcoin Above $35,000 as ETF Excitement Starts to Thaw the Crypto Winter","It was exciting enough for crypto observers when bitcoin [BTC] topped $31,000 on Monday.  And then its price went straight up. Late in the day, bitcoin took out $32,000, then $33,000, then $34,000 and finally $35,000 in just a few minutes. Perpetual contracts listed on Binance's exchange almost topped $36,000.  The original cryptocurrency was back at levels last seen in May 2022, before the Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, Genesis and FTX debacles turned the mood so sour that BTC approached $15,000 and the very survival of the industry was, to some, called into question.  But the mood has improved markedly, fueled largely by prospects that bitcoin ETFs – which promoters say will make it dramatically easier to buy BTC, potentially hugely broadening the pool of potential investors – are on the way.  Read more: Bitcoin Tops $35K, Hitting 16-Month High; Options Positioning Suggests Price Has Further to Run  Grayscale (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group) runs the biggest exchange-traded bitcoin product at the moment, but it's structured as a trust, which has shortcomings. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected its attempt to turn the product into a more-appealing ETF, but a court recently blasted that rejection and the SEC isn't appealing, boosting the odds Grayscale will get itself an ETF.  And BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is high on bitcoin's prospects and has its own bitcoin ETF application in at the SEC – as do other conventional financial firms. ""We're hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto,"" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently told Fox Business.  Fink put crypto in rarified company during the interview, saying it will be another haven asset for investors, similar to U.S. Treasuries or gold. ""I believe crypto will play that type of role as a flight-to-quality,"" he told Fox Business.  The BlackRock ETF has just showed up on the website of Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. – a key market utility in the U.S. that processes all securities transactions. A normally boring page showed the prospective security with a unique ID number known as a CUSIP, something all manner of stocks, bonds and other assets get. Its appearance on that page doesn't mean the ETF has been approved, but the fact that BlackRock has gone this far in its prep work certainly indicates optimism.  ""All part of the process of bringing ETF to market,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas posted on X.  In the hour around the rapid late-Monday BTC surge, more than $167 million in derivative positions were liquidated, adding to the daily total of $344 million, according to CoinGlass. Open interest, a metric that records the notional value of all derivatives positions, failed to keep pace with bitcoin's rise, dropping from a peak of $10.5 billion to $9.4 billion as a result of liquidations, short positions being stopped out and those in long positions taking profits.  There is also an emerging narrative pointed out in Galaxy Digital's latest market report about the options market. At around $32,500, ""options dealers will need to purchase almost $20 million of BTC for every 1% move up to stay delta neutral,"" the report said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Nick Baker, Oliver Knight",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/24/a-wild-few-minutes-drives-bitcoin-above-35000-as-etf-excitement-starts-to-thaw-the-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/badb16de99a07602fe75a1a18e53844356190eb9-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
