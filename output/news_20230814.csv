16049969,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547239,1692054016,"Bitcoin Price Supported By Thin $40 Million Bid Pool, But For How Long?","In the ongoing market turbulence on higher timeframes, Bitcoin (BTC) is at a crucial juncture as a great consolidation phase persists. Research and analysis firm Material Indicators closely monitored the recent weekly candle close/open, paying particular attention to two key factors: the trend line and the 21-day, 21-week, and 21-month moving averages (MA) – all of which are currently influential in shaping market dynamics. Uncertainty And Potential Turning Point For Bitcoin The opening of the weekly candle below the trend line triggered a “subsequent nosedive,” amplifying concerns. While the 21-week and 21-month moving averages continue to serve as robust support, the 21-day MA has faced a rigorous seven-day testing period, according to the firm’s analysis. Notably, the tight correlation of the 21-MA across three distinct time frames is rare, indicating that the market is at a critical inflection point. Despite the compressed volatility witnessed in recent days, the price action observed over the past 24 hours exemplifies the market’s attempt to shake out weak hands. According to Material Indicators, given the complexity of the current price action, it is prudent to zoom out and gain a broader perspective. Both Trend Precognition algorithms identified these moves on the four-hour chart, emphasizing the significance of adopting a comprehensive outlook. Moreover, according to Materials, the order book reveals a concerning trend in bid liquidity, with less than $40 million holding the price up. The absence of substantial liquidity below this level raises fundamental worries. However, it also suggests that there may not be sufficient sentiment to drive prices significantly lower – at least not yet. Related Reading: XRP Volume Jolt: How Did The $3 Billion Surge Impact Price Action? In addition, Material Indicators highlights that the examination of liquidity movements within the order book over the past month paints a picture of continued price volatility with a potential upward bias. However, the lack of volume raises concerns about the market’s overall health. Despite a $13 million buy wall at $27,900, the bottom of the channel at $28,300 remains a critical threshold for BTC to extend its current trend. The firm claims: … the bottom of the channel at $28.3k remains my line in the sand for BTC to extend the trend, and I maintain that we must see weekly candles printing above the 100-Week MA to even consider a bull breakout. BCT Faces Renewed Pressure Amid Strengthening US Dollar As Bitcoin enters a new week of trading, market participants closely monitor the potential impact of the strengthening US Dollar Index ($DXY) on the world’s leading cryptocurrency. According to Yan Alleman, co-founder of blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, recent developments suggest that BTC may face renewed pressure due to the upward momentum of the $DXY. Alleman highlights that the $DXY’s renewed strength could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the value of the US Dollar and the price of BTC, meaning that when the dollar strengthens, Bitcoin often faces headwinds. However, options pricing indicates a bullish sentiment for Bitcoin in the coming month. Options are financial derivatives that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin. The pricing of options contracts suggests an expectation of a bullish move shortly. This aligns with the technical analysis indicating potential upside for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? Analyzing the potential price movements, Alleman notes that it would require nearly twice as much selling pressure to push Bitcoin down to the low $28,000 range compared to the buying pressure needed to surpass the $30,000 level. This observation suggests that there may be greater support and buying interest at higher price levels, making a sustained drop less likely. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,500, reflecting a marginal 0.4% increase over the past 24 hours.

The shift in focus from tea distribution to its blockchain business has led to selling off its key revenue-generating business line and raising funds through direct offering. While its balance sheet still looks good, high and potentially rising expenses for its non-revenue generating blockchain business and a non-compliance notice from NASDAQ make it unattractive right now. China's speciality tea distributor and soon to be blockchain business, Bit Brother ( BTB ) has had an awful 2023 at the stock markets, with a share price decline of 94.5%. It's in the middle of a complete overhaul of its business, so volatility is not surprising. But it's not good for its stock price either. Here I look at what's going on with the company, its share price and what could come next for it at the stock markets. Total transformation The company was earlier called Urban Tea, which is a reflection of its tea business conducted under two lines of business. The first was the distribution of dark tea and the other was its tea chain shops. But in 2019, the company decided to foray into blockchain development and cryptocurrency mining, leaving its past identity behind. This is reflected in the fact that it disposed of its tea distribution business last year, which brought in 92% of its revenues. It's now planning to a range of cryptocurrency products and services like a service centre for mining virtual currencies, a currency trading platform and a crypto wallet. Why has the price crashed? The stock price started the year on the right note, but it saw a sharp fall in mid-January, around the time it raised capital through a registered direct offering. At its peak in 2023, Bit Brother's share price was at USD 11.5, but within a week it had fallen to less than a fifth of that level. Source: Seeking Alpha The company's offering was made at a price of USD 4.5 per share, which was way lower than the average of USD 10.5 the stock had traded at in January up to the announcement of the offering. Investors were clearly not happy, potentially seeing it as a sign of weakness in the company's ability to meet its funding needs, resulting in the share price decline. Challenged financials If they had any doubts about the company's current challenges, they were likely removed with the release of its results for the first half of the current financial year ending December 2022 (H1 FY23, the company's financial year runs from July-June), in March this year. With a big chunk of its business sold off, the company's no longer making the kind of revenues it did up to 2021. This is of course part of its transformation. But as yet, its ""Blockchain business"", as it terms the new business in its financial statements, it's not earning any revenue either. So the only source of revenue right now is the tea chain shops business. This is reflected in its revenues, which saw a sharp decline of 51.5% year-on-year (YoY). Segment wise financial snapshot (Source: Bit Brother) At the same time, the blockchain business already accounts for 37% of its operating expenses for the six months ending December 2022. This has resulted in a 1.5x increase in its net loss for the period. Non-compliance notice The stock price, which had so far been trading comfortably above USD 1, fell fast after the results, opening up another challenge for Bit Brother. With the price at sub-USD 1 levels for over 30 days, it received a non-compliance notification from NASDAQ, where it's listed. It has until November 13 to become compliant now, which would require its price to be above USD 1 for 10 consecutive days. Dire as this sounds, the fact is that Bit Brother has been down this road before. It got such a notice in 2021 too, but a reverse stock split in December 2022 later, it regained compliance. Until May 2023, that is. It has since entered into another direct offering in July, at an even lower price of USD 0.25 per share, which is half the current share price. Needless to say, this impacted the price too. Supporting growth This is not a sustainable way for any publicly listed company to continue, of course. But while it builds up its blockchain business, there is some comfort to be found in its healthy balance sheet. At the time it first raised capital through a direct offering, the company said it intends to use the proceeds to ""fund the development and commercialisation of our projects and the growth of our business, primarily working capital, and for general corporate purposes."". A look at the company's balance sheet up to FY22, however, reveals that it was already in good shape. It had a working capital ratio of a huge 42.5x. This working capital, at USD 45.6 million, is enough to fund its operating expenses for the next four years, if these expenses stay at the same level. It's also notable that Bit Brother barely has any debt on its books as well. Source: Bit Brother Also, it can help that on its own, the tea chains business has done very well, with a 512% increase in revenues in H1 FY23. The segment also showed a healthy gross profit margin of almost 42%, though the company was in the past and remains loss making on an operating basis. I would speculate that this business too would be sold in the foreseeable future for the complete transformation of the company. The risks The transformation can't be taken for granted, though. The future of cryptocurrencies is riddled with challenges, the key among them being regulatory ones. The People's Bank of China has already r egulated the usage of these currencies, and it's conceivable that there could be a flat out ban on them. Also, if for whatever reason the company is unable to undertake a reverse stock split, it will get delisted. What next? It's clear that now is then not a good time to buy the stock. There's too much change in the offing, and too little clarity about its future right now. The company's balance sheet looks good, as does the growth of its existing tea business. But the blockchain business is yet to commence operations, and in the meantime requires a lot of expenses. It doesn't help that Bit Brother's share price keeps dropping below the compliance floor for extended periods. There's really nothing to hold on to right now here. I'm going with a Sell rating",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ICO | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4628324-bit-brother-complete-transformation-but-road-ahead-unclear?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16046982.jpeg

The events surrounding the deployer’s recent actions have left both the coin’s value and its reputation teetering on the edge. BALD Deployers Send Funds To Kraken Exchange Blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain has revealed that the deployer of the BALD token has executed audacious moves, bridging a staggering 7,000 ETH ($12.9 million) out of the Coinbase Layer 2 network, Base. Of the 7,000 ETH that has been sent to the Ethereum network, the deployer sent 2,100 ETH ($3.87 million) in two different transactions to the Kraken crypto exchange, for purposes that can only be for selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin-Friendly Javier Milei Wins Presidential Primaries In Argentina Following this, the BALD deployer currently holds 4,902 ETH in their balance on the Ethereum blockchain, worth over $9 million at current prices. The wallet’s tokens holdings also remain significant, sitting at $1.115 million at the time of this writing. The recent transactions have now dredged up speculations about who the BALD deployer might be. On-chain investigator ZachXBT previously lent his expertise to the investigations, with findings pointing toward an X (formerly Twitter) user who goes by the username @milkyway16eth due to a previous transaction between the deployer wallet and Milkyway’s wallet. However, there is yet to be any concrete proof if Milkyway is actually the brains behind the rug. A Rollercoaster For Investors The BALD meme coin started making the rounds on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after being launched on Base. The coin which was named after Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong’s bald head rose rapidly, climbing more than 289,000% in less than two days. This growth rate served as an attraction for investors, who bridged quickly to the ETH blockchain to invest in the token. It continued to rise, crossing a $70 million market amid the euphoria. However, this would end up being short-lived. Related Reading: More Selling? Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase On August 1, the BALD deployer pulled liquidity from the token, making off with 10,705 ETH ($20 million at the time). The coin’s price declined rapidly after this, although the official X account for BALD continued to deny that it was a rug pull. Although BALD continues to trade on the Base network, it has been unable to reclaim its past glory. Its price is down over 90% from its all-time high and recorded 18% losses in the last 24 hours alone, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Maker Large Holders Have Continued To Expand Their Holdings Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, inflows to the wallets of the large MKR investors have been taking place for a while now. The “large holders” here refer to those investors who hold at least 0.1% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. In Maker’s case, this value would equal about $1.2 million. Thus, the only holders who would clear these criteria would be the sharks and whales, the largest entities on the network. These investors generally hold some influence in the market, as they can move many tokens at once. Thus, the behavior of this cohort could be worth watching, as it may reveal answers about where the asset might be heading next. One way to track the behavior of these humongous holders is through the “netflow” metric, which measures the net amount of MKR that these large investors are adding into or moving out of their combined holdings right now. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that a net number of coins is entering into the supply of these investors currently, suggesting that they are participating in buying. On the other hand, negative values could imply that this group may be selling as its members are transferring a net amount of the asset away from their wallets. Related Reading: SHIB, PEPE, APE Gain Against Bitcoin, Santiment Explains What This Means Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Maker large holders netflow over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been positive in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X The above graph shows that the Maker large holders’ netflow has been almost entirely positive during the past few months. There were a few dips into the negative territory, but the net outflows weren’t significant in scale then. In the past few weeks, there haven’t been any drops below the zero mark, suggesting that the large holders have only continued accumulating more MKR recently. Something to note here is that a positive netflow doesn’t mean that there isn’t any selling taking place at all. Instead, it simply suggests that the accumulation is enough to cancel any distribution. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? In the past couple of months, the cryptocurrency has seen an overall uptrend, which could be a consequence of the net buying these investors have been participating in. Since this month has started, though, the asset has declined. Nonetheless, as the netflows have only remained positive throughout this decline, the large holders have been buying regardless. This conviction from these large holders can naturally be a positive sign for Maker, as the asset could potentially continue its rally soon.

16043945,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547250,1692041153,Michael Burry’s Massive $1.6 Billion Short: Is A $DXY Collapse The Catalyst For A Crypto Bloodbath?,"Michael Burry, renowned investor, and hedge fund manager, has once again made headlines with his significant short position in the traditional market, which could impact the nascent crypto industry if his bet is to materialize. Burry, known for accurately predicting the subprime mortgage crisis, recently went mega-short with over $1.6 billion in S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) puts. These indexes often record a high correlation with the crypto market as they attract similar investors. Burry’s $1.6 Billion Short Signals Potential Implications For Crypto Market Burry’s track record as an astute investor lends weight to his latest bet. By predicting and profiting from the subprime mortgage crisis, he gained a reputation as an investor capable of identifying market trends before they unfold. It is important to consider that Burry has established himself as a prognosticator who is often ahead of the curve and is willing to wait for the anticipated market changes to come to fruition. Related Reading: HBAR Token Spikes 16% In One Day, Can Bulls Sustain the Momentum? On this matter, Yan Alleman, co-founder of Glassnode, has supported Burry’s approach, suggesting that while the short-term effects may not be immediately evident, the long-term payoff is likely to be significant. Alleman also highlighted the potential impact of the US Dollar Index (DXY) on the cryptocurrency market, specifically Bitcoin. According to Alleman, the recent renewed strength of the DXY could exert pressure on Bitcoin. The DXY measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies. On The Verge Of A Final Leg Up? As Burry predicts, a drop in the DXY could result in a significant surge in crypto assets, including Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. This surge would represent a final leg up before a presumed deep correction across financial markets. While the correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin has been subject to debate, the potential consequences of Burry’s short position on the market cannot be ignored. If his prediction were to come true, it could trigger a domino effect, leading to a substantial downturn in traditional markets and a subsequent surge in crypto assets. Nevertheless, the implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in such a scenario are twofold. On the one hand, Bitcoin has often been hailed as a digital store of value and a hedge against traditional market downturns. Burry’s short position on the market could reinforce this narrative, attracting more investors to Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency market’s extreme volatility could magnify the potential crypto bloodbath if Burry’s bet materialized. A sudden surge in selling pressure for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, coupled with a widespread market correction, could result in a sharp decline in the crypto market, causing substantial losses for investors who entered the market at its peak. Related Reading: Winds Of Change: Bitcoin Miner Riot Sees Substantial Increase In BTC Holdings As the market unfolds in the coming weeks and months, all eyes will be on Michael Burry’s $1.6 billion short position and its potential impact on traditional markets and crypto.

Coinbase is taking advantage of the market's discount pricing of its bonds, executing bond repurchases at a discount on both its 2026 convertible notes and its 2031 senior notes. Q2 earnings show improvements in cost control, with a reduction in operating expenses driven by reduced headcount, G&A, and technology and development expenses. Coinbase will have increased custodial fee revenue from its surveillance sharing agreements with the 7 pending Bitcoin ETF applications, if approved. Selling puts may be an ideal entry strategy due to high premiums and implied volatility on COIN options. Coinbase Rapidly Growing but Trading at Just 5.5x 2021 Earnings, or 4.4x 2021 Earnings when Adjusting for Underlying Asset Value Coinbase ( COIN ) is a rapidly growing cryptocurrency exchange that generates revenue through transaction fees, subscription fees, custodial fees, and interest income on customer deposits.

With Coinbase now trading at $80 per share, there is now an opportunity to purchase Coinbase shares at 5.5x 2021 earnings. Additionally, Coinbase has a strong balance sheet with a net asset value of $16.24 per share. Subtracting out the underlying net asset value, the business is trading for just 4.4x 2021 earnings.

Q2 Earnings Show Continuing Improvements in Cost Control Despite record profits in 2021, Coinbase allowed operating costs to balloon to an unsustainable level of $4.76B, up 481% from 2020 operating expenses of $868.5M. Operating expenses increased once again in 2022, by 24% up to $5.9B. Results in Q1 and Q2 of 2023 show that Coinbase is increasing its financial discipline and cutting costs, with annualized H1 2023 costs at $3.35B, down 43% from 2022. 2020 2021 2022 H1 2023 Annualized Operating Expenses $868.5M $4.76B $5.9B $3.35B YoY Change +481% +24% -43% Source: Coinbase SEC Filings and Shareholder Letter Q2 earnings showed an improvement on Q1 of 2023, with a 13% Quarter-over-quarter reduction in operating expenses from $896.4M to $781.5M. Drivers of improvement include Technology & Development expenses, down by $288.5M on a quarterly basis since Q2' 22, representing a $1.15B decrease on an annualized basis. General & Administrative expenses are also down by $211.2M on a quarterly basis since Q2' 22, representing a $844.8M on an annualized basis. This is in light of a decrease in operational bloat via layoffs, with full-time employees down 31.5% from 4,977 in Q2'22 to 3,406 in Q2'23. Coinbase Shareholder Letter If Coinbase can maintain this level of financial discipline going into the next bull market, it can likely blow past its 2021 earnings if/when trading volume picks back up. Cryptocurrency Bull Market Forecasted to Return 2024-2025 based on 12-Year Pattern As outlined in my previous Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) article , Bitcoin has followed very clear 4-year cycles throughout its 12-year history, with 3 years up followed by 1 year down. These returns are displayed below. Bitcoin Returns by Calendar Year Year Return 2011 1467% 2012 187% 2013 5870% 2014 -61% 2015 35% 2016 124% 2017 1338% 2018 -73% 2019 94% 2020 302% 2021 60% 2022 -64% 2023 YTD 75% Source: Bankrate Bitcoin Price History If this pattern continues, we would expect the Bitcoin bull run to pick up in 2024 and 2025. This would likely correspond with an increase in trading volume, transaction fees, and earnings for Coinbase, along with an increase in value in their cryptocurrency held for investment.

16043207,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547199,1692039610,"HBAR Token Spikes 16% In One Day, Can Bulls Sustain the Momentum?","HBAR has soared with momentum after the US Federal Reserve adopted the Hedera Hashgraph-based Dropp micropayments platform. According to the announcement, Dropp is now on the list of service providers on Fed’s FedNow instant payment system. Following this news, HBAR’s market sentiment improved, causing a rapid price surge that propelled the token from $ 0.0561 to $0.06544. This represents an over 16% increase in the last 24 hours. However, HBAR price has crossed the overbought region, raising questions about how long the current rally can last. FedNow Adds Hedera Hashgraph-Powered Dropp To Its List Of Service Providers On July 20, the US Federal Reserve launched the FedNow instant payment system. This payment system allows banks and credit unions to transfer money for customers any time, any day, instantly. However, according to the latest development, FedNow adopted Dropp, a micropayment platform built on Hedera as a service provider. Dropp allows users to use micropayments for small-valued transactions in USD Coin (USDC), HBAR, and US dollars. Related Reading: SHIB, PEPE, APE Gain Against Bitcoin, Santiment Explains What This Means Adopting Dropp as a FedNow service provider implies that banks and other financial service providers can use the micropayment platform for real-time payments. This feat marks a milestone for Hedera as FedNow indirectly supports the token, granting the Hedera blockchain support from traditional finance companies. Similarly, Hedera is already benefiting from this partnership as its price has increased by over 16% in the last 24 hours. Also, Hedera garnered massive investor attention in the past week due to increased partnerships, such as South Korean automobile companies Kia and Hyundai, which have adopted Hedera’s infrastructure to track vehicle carbon emissions. HBAR Price Outlook; How Long Can The Bulls Hold? HBAR soared over 16% within a few hours after the FedNow support announcement. That brought the token’s seven-day price increase to nearly 17%. In addition, HBAR’s valuation is now 25% higher than its price 30 days ago. HBAR trades at $0.065, with a day high of $0.06625 and a low of $0.05046. One remarkable thing about HBAR’s performance is the massive surge in trading volume, which signifies increased network activity and investor interest. As of the time of writing, HBAR has recorded an over 1,219% surge in 24-hour trading volume, after securing its position as the highest-gaining cryptocurrency today. According to the daily chart, HBAR trades above two key support levels at $0.063035 and $0.06005. Moreover, the bulls have formed green bars above the support levels as they vie to push HBAR to higher highs. The Relative Strength Index is at 72. But while this signifies increased buying pressure, the sideways movement of the RSI graph suggests a weakening trend. So HBAR buyers have reached saturation and are probably about to lose momentum. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Golden Cross – How Will Prices React? Additionally, the faded green histogram bars show the buying demand for HBAR tokens has dwindled slightly. If this continues, the HBAR rally could stall, allowing the bears to push prices downward.

16043260,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4628273-paypal-and-payments-the-future?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1692039594,PayPal And Payments: The Future,"Summary PayPal aims to launch its own stablecoin, backed by U.S. Treasury bills, to expand the role of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. The entry of PayPal into the stablecoin market is seen as an opportunity to reverse the declining value of stablecoins and to build the payments system of the future. PayPal's move follows initiatives from financial establishment players to engage in the crypto industry and seek regulatory approval for a new crypto exchange. PayPal's efforts are certainly worthy of watching. The goal of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was to become the ""money"" of the world. It would serve as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Bitcoin has mostly succeeded as a store of value. As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies have not had much success. Enter PayPal (PYPL-USD). This past week, PayPal announced that it would launch its own stablecoin. PayPal, a worldwide leader in the area of payment systems, now wants to use blockchain technology to expand the role of the cryptocurrency world to be an efficient medium of exchange as well as a major supplier as a store of value. PayPal wants to use blockchain technology to provide the world with a state-of-the-art payment mechanism. PayPal's effort, known as PayPal USD (PY-USD), will back its stablecoin with U.S. Treasury bills. PayPal's tokens, however, can only be used within the PayPal ecosystem. ""PayPal has an existing consumer base, it's trying to reverse into the crypto market by monetizing its user base,"" argues Tom Keatinge , founding director of the Center for Financial Crime and Security Studies at UK think-tank RUSI. But, and this is very important, this may be the only real way to get to a cryptocurrency format that really functions. PayPal seems to have a very realistic approach to making the crypto-scene work. Historically, There Have Been Problems Recent history is very clear on this point. Since, ""Stablecoins are as vital to crypto markets and are akin to chips at casinos: they allow traders to move in and out of between easily, into wallets rather than lots of traceable accounts,"" writes Scott Chipolina in the Financial Times . ""Unfortunately they are also fundamentally tied to sectors of the crypto market that have underperformed all year."" ""According to research provider CCData, the circulating value of crypto's dollar-pegged tokens has fallen to $125 billion, down from $188 billion in March last year."" ""The decline not only represents the sector's lowest market cap since August 2021, but stablecoins are on trend to record 17 consecutive months of declines."" The entry of PayPal at this time is seen as the move to break this fall. And, according to Michael Casey, writing for CoinDesk , ""…in the grand scheme of things, PayPal is in a far stronger position politically than"" other attempts have been, hence giving PayPal a real chance to do something that will succeed. Furthermore, ""Just as importantly, PayPal's move follows a slew of initiatives from financial establishment players to prod policymakers to support their own engagement in the crypto industry."" ""Meanwhile, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel are jointly seeking regulatory approval for a new crypto exchange."" ""These institutions do their homework in Washington before going down paths like this, as does PayPal."" And, they are coming from another place. PayPal and these others are not just ""libertarian"" visionaries that are trying to introduce a new philosophy, a new ideal, to the system. The question is, can the PayPal approach get around the concerns that have built up in the investment community and in the world of regulation? My feeling is that they have a much better chance of getting through the jungle than do many of the others that have made efforts in the recent past. The Historical Scene The PayPal effort will continue. The PayPal effort is just one part of the innovative spread of information. The effort is not going to stop. There may be more months of financial decline to the whole market effort, but my guess is that the fall of value in the marketplace will be over in six months or a little longer. To me, the major problem that the cryptocurrency world faces is that the original presentation of cryptocurrencies was primarily of ""theoretical"" intent. The world of cryptocurrencies was a world seen to be fully free of governmental connection and fully free of market imperfections. The original world of cryptocurrencies was a world of libertarian dreams. No wonder that one of the immediate responses was from Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, Chase & Co., who dismissed the effort almost from the start. Now we have people like the author George Gilder, in his very new book ""Life After Capitalism"" (Regnery Gateway, 2023), arguing for a monetary system whose foundation is the Bitcoin. Mr. Gilder has moved from a love for a monetary system that is based upon gold, to one that is based on a rigidly constructed cryptocurrency system. How we get there is another story… one not yet written. Where We Are Now Investors must now keep their eyes closely focused upon the efforts being made by PayPal. Many analysts really seem to believe that PayPal has a real chance to make the crypto world a reality. I still have many doubts about cryptocurrencies. To me, it is still built upon idealistic dreams. But, let's give it a chance. We cannot guess the outcome yet. We have no real idea of what the new financial world is going to look like except that in one way or another it is going to be digitally conceived. Let's see what happens.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | PYUSD,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4628273-paypal-and-payments-the-future?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16043260.jpeg

16041490,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547201,1692036047,Here’s Why This Former SEC Lawyer Thinks A Spot Bitcoin ETF Isn’t Coming,"Recent comments from former SEC Attorney John Reed Stark have further dampened optimism about the regulator approving any of the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Looking More Unlikely The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has continuously denied applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, and Stark has suggested that this trend isn’t going to change anytime soon as the SEC will likely deny all the pending applications due to several “compelling reasons.” While aligning his opinion with that of Better Markets, Stark stated that the arguments laid forward in the nonprofit’s letters to the SEC “brilliantly” highlighted why the SEC would not approve any of these applications. Related Reading: Want A Bitcoin Spot ETF? Then Prove BTC Is Not Manipulated, Says SEC Better Markets had, in two separate letters (here and here) dated August 8, laid out arguments why the SEC should reject the proposed rule changes by the Cboe BZX Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market “to list and trade shares in Spot bitcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETP).” According to them, the Spot Bitcoin market is known to show inflated trading volumes due to illicit practices like market manipulation and wash trading. They argue that the markets are highly concentrated and Bitcoin’s network is maintained by a “select group of individuals and entities.” All this makes any proposed Spot Bitcoin ETP susceptible to manipulation by “bad actors” and puts investors and the public interest at risk. In their applications, these exchanges stated that CME Bitcoin futures, a regulated market of significant size, could provide the necessary data and insights relating to any fraud and manipulation in the Spot Bitcoin ETF market. Additionally, they had entered into a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase as an extra measure to prevent fraud and market manipulation. However, Better Market has labeled these measures as “wholly inadequate.” They argue that the CME Bitcoin futures market is not a “regulated market of significant size” and the surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase is insufficient to prevent market manipulation. BTC remains weak as market awaits SEC decision | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Is Crypto Regulation Now Political? Stark believes that the “crypto-regulatory tides could shift exponentially” once the US 2024 elections take place. He noted the political divide regarding crypto and how this has also played out in the SEC’s clampdown on the crypto industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin-Friendly Javier Milei Wins Presidential Primaries In Argentina The SEC has been known to come on hard at several crypto firms, including two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of securities violations. However, Stark predicts that the SEC will abandon this crypto-enforcement effort and focus more on mostly fraud cases should a Republican get elected as President next year. Although the elections are slated for November 2024 (long after the SEC might have decided on the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications), Stark has forecasted that a GOP-led administration could bring about the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF.

Dropp is a pay-by-bank alternative to credit card payments which allows merchants to accept small-value purchases digitally without large transaction fees, according to FedNow’s press release. Dropp allows micropayments in Hedera’s HBAR, the U.S. dollar and Circle’s USDC.  Today’s action brings the move higher in HBAR to nearly 50% since mid-June and the token’s market cap to more than $2.1 billion.  Hedera Hashgraph describes itself as a uniquely structured blockchain compared to other chains due to its usage of hashgraph consensus. Hedera is the only public distributed ledger that uses this, according to the company, which notes that Hashgraph achieves 10,000+ transactions per second and low-latency finality in seconds.  According to a report by Messari, Hadera’s average daily active accounts have grown 288% year-to-date, jumping from 3,500 to 13,500 by Q2 2023. In terms of average daily creation of new accounts, there was a 340% surge over that same period, said Messari. The main driver behind the uptick in activity in Q2 was propelled by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with the main driver of NFT activity being Karateka, a Web3 game built by GameOn leveraging the IP of Karate Combat. The report noted that last year’s activity was primarily driven by DeFi.  Hedera has seen a number of updates over the past few months, FreshSupplyCo (FSCO), a platform that tokenizes assets across the agrifood supply chain, integrated Hedera into its payment trigger API which was previously used on the discontinued private Mastercard Provenance blockchain.

42392706,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAPkf,1692034648,Neal Stephenson's Metaverse Vision Is One Step Closer as Lamina1 Blockchain Launches Betanet,"Metaverse focused blockchain Lamina1 has launched its betanet and Hub for developers and creators.  Lamina1 CEO Rebecca Barkin told CoinDesk that they are ""not far"" from mainnet launch and aiming to put out a product that can be used more broadly and publicly by early next year.  Lamina1, the metaverse-focused layer-1 blockchain co-founded by science-fiction writer Neal Stephenson and early Bitcoin investor Peter Vessenes, has launched its betanet and Hub for creators to design the building blocks of a future open metaverse.  Stephenson coined the term metaverse in 1992 in his novel ""Snow Crash,"" which envisioned a cyberpunk future where the digital and physical worlds are intertwined. But in recent years, the so-called ""metaverse"" has materialized into fragmented virtual worlds that are not yet interoperable with one another.  In a recent interview with Fast Company, Stephenson described the pitfalls of Web2 and his current vision for the metaverse, which would stem from a ""spatial organization"" that ties digital spaces together.  ""The idea that we’re working on [the metaverse] with Lamina1 feels to me like it’s kind of more foundational; it’s not one particular interpretation or product – it’s kind of a base layer of functionality that anyone ought to be able to use to build experiences,"" he told the outlet.  Today, Lamina1 has expanded on Stephenson's vision by launching its betanet blockchain alongside its new Hub for Web3 builders and developers, simplifying the Web3 wallet experience and onboarding process. During the betanet period, partners, world-builders, validators and developers can trial aspects of the network and tinker with its toolkit. Lamina1 says that the goal of betanet is to allow builders to create the scaffolding for an open metaverse ""in a more persistent and stable environment"" in the lead-up to its upcoming mainnet launch.  Lamina1 CEO Rebecca Barkin, a former executive at augmented reality firm Magic Leap, told CoinDesk that betanet is an ""evolution"" of its testnet, which went live in January of this year and had over 47,000 participants experience their burgeoning metaverse concept.  ""Our aim is not to be simply another [layer 1] or [layer 2] that further fragments a complicated landscape, but to provide a community of content creators with the easiest path to developing high-quality content,"" she said.  Creating a metaverse hub  The latest updates are focused on improving the Lamina1 user experience by streamlining onboarding processes that strip away cumbersome language and processes. The platform now features a simpler authentication process to help users create new blockchain wallets without needing to preserve their private keys, while the Hub serves as a dashboard for a user's profile, transaction history and as a tool for discovering new experiences built on Lamina1.  Users will also soon be able to send, receive and upload digital items like music and 3D objects, and can use those items to build on-chain experiences in a more stable and realistic environment. Over the next six months, Barkin said Lamina1 would roll out new features like an L1 name service, the ability to save and manage contacts, specialized subnets, decentralized storage for digital items and digital identity customization.  The company is also taking steps to ensure that its infrastructure is carbon negative through a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and by building a process for new nodes that requires them to purchase and retire carbon credits before validating any of their subnets.  ""When we were assessing the right architecture for our partners, we loved what Avalanche had built, so we started there,"" she explained. ""Ultimately, we want to offer a foundation that promises to keep operational costs and gas fees more stable and predictable, has fewer security vulnerabilities, a more experience-oriented interface, and benefits from interoperability and fluid movement of identity and value being built right into the ecosystem.""  In addition, the company, which was founded in June 2022 with initial funding from tech giants like Reid Hoffman, Rony Abovitz and Matthew Roszak, is committed to its core values of interoperability and data ownership. Barkin said that people should have ""privacy and prosperity"" as they move through online spaces; control over their identities, personal data and assets; get paid fairly for their creations; and interact with each other in ways that ""shouldn’t destroy the planet, the fabric of society or the livelihood of others.""  While there's no defined date for the Lamina1 mainnet launch, Barkin said they are ""not far"" and are aiming to put out a product that can be used broadly and publicly by early next year.  ""At a minimum, before we launch, we want to ensure we can deliver on usability, stability, identity, game engine integration, and a few key dev tools. And we’re committed to solving the issue of enforceable royalties – [intellectual property] protection, transparency, and better economics are the promises that will bring high-quality creators into the mix, so we must address it,"" she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/14/neal-stephensons-metaverse-vision-is-one-step-closer-as-lamina1-blockchain-launches-betanet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe375dbec39b2c92aee33730de9a7c5071787a01-1921x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16039743,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547160,1692032407,"Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth?","Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 rollup developed by crypto exchange Coinbase, is already making a name for itself in the market. The blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has been on a rapid rise over the last few weeks, rising triple-digits in just the last two weeks alone. So the question now is, what’s driving the TVL growth? Meme Coins, Rugs, And Newcomers Unlike other Layer 2 networks, Base seemed to have gotten its big break with the growing trend of meme coins being launched on the network. The most notable of these was the BALD meme coin which went from less than $100,000 in market cap to over $50 million in a matter of days. As the popularity of BALD ramped up, so did the popularity of Base and decentralized finance (DeFi) traders clamored to bridge to the blockchain. Related Reading: Regulatory Pressure Mounts On Worldcoin, Can WLD Price Recover? The rug deployer rugged the project not long after, making off with over $9 million in liquidity. Following this, there were speculations of former FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried Nverbeing the mastermind behind BALD, although nothing came from these accusations. However, instead of the blockchain’s first big project rugging being a deterrent, it seems to have had the opposite effect. More developers have moved to launch their projects on the blockchain seeing the potential. This includes the likes of SushiSwap, Uniswap, and Compound, among others, which have all provided support for the Base network. New projects such as Alien Base, SwapBased, and Krav have also been gaining ground with their TVL growing rapidly during this time as well. So for Base, it has been able to turn a negative situation into a positive one. Base Joining The Layer 2 Blockchain Race In the last two weeks, the Base TVL has grown from $13 million to more than $130 million, data from DefiLlama shows. This represents an almost 900% increase in TVL during this time, making it the fastest-growing Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain in terms of TVL. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Chances Of Revival Grow Slimmer, Here’s Why Base’s rapid growth has already put it in the race with other Layer 2s. However, when put in comparison against other established Layer 2 networks, Base still has a long way to go. It is currently the 5th-largest Layer 2 in terms of TVL, lagging well behind the likes of Arbitrum, Polygon, and Avalanche. Nevertheless, Base’s bull case continues to grow with over $203 million already bridged to the blockchain and daily active users sitting above 100,000 over the last four days.

42392717,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAQUp,1692030321,Crypto’s Theater Is Becoming More Surreal,"You know times are interesting in crypto when some of the most enthusiastic founders and developers are wholeheartedly agreeing with criticism. At EthCC, the community-led Ethereum conference held in Paris, France this year, I gave a speech titled “Crypto is a Theater Right Now,” breaking down the many ways decentralized finance and other crypto efforts have gone awry. A version of the talk reposted on Twitter also seems to have struck a nerve.  Camila Russo is the founder of The Defiant and author of ""The Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum.""  In short, I’m seeing people in crypto putting on a show. A facade. And after 10 years in the industry, first covering crypto for Bloomberg, writing The Infinite Machine, then founding The Defiant, it’s left me wondering if the magic is still here.  Through all the booms and busts I always stood adamant that the hype would ultimately fade and ""real"" use cases would prevail, like Argentines seeking financial freedom, which is what originally drew me in the space.  But it doesn’t seem like we’re further along on that front. In some ways, the theater has gotten more surreal.  Of course, much happened during the recent bull market beginning in 2020 and the resulting bearish turn that’s followed us into 2023 that has moved the space forward and should be celebrated.  Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) helped organize individuals across the world towards working towards the same goal. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) inspired a new wave of users to be excited about owning digital property. Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake, a massive undertaking that showcased the possibilities of decentralized development. Layer 2s started actually delivering on a more scalable blockchain infrastructure and real world assets (RWA) emerged as a potential bridge to non-speculative use cases.  But at the same time the failings of DeFi and Web3 have become more and more apparent, with different forms of theater emerging: decentralization theater, governance theater, community theater, all surrounded by a game of TVL musical chairs.  Immutable, really?  Developers are portraying so-called decentralized apps as immutable protocols, removing intermediaries and controlled fairly via pre-written rules embedded in smart contracts. They’re said to be unstoppable and censorship-resistant. That is the whole point of blockchains after all.  But, in reality, most DeFi projects can be controlled, censored and stopped by a bunch of dudes in a room. Whether it's via control of the project's admin keys or because a handful of people control all the validators or nodes. The vast majority of DeFi projects retain the ability to enter “God Mode” and unilaterally make changes to the protocol.  Decentralization theater matters because it reduces censorship-resistance, and also gives leverage to regulators or police enforcers to coerce developers into making changes, revealing information, or simply shutting the thing down. How can people trust that this can be a feasible infrastructure for the future of finance, how can institutions trust they can move trillions of dollars in the system, if it can be arbitrarily changed?  Also, when DAOs and Anon Founders are really a facade for centralized teams, it puts user funds at risk because individuals can be hacked or they can steal the project funds themselves.  Likewise, crypto’s governance systems are also theater. Another promise of Web3 was that users would be owners of the internet; of the applications they interact with and the financial services they use. They'd be able to have a say on how things are run, and on what decisions are made and this would be done through holding the protocols’ native tokens .  The truth is that most people are buying governance tokens because they treat them as a proxy to owning a stock in a protocol or Dapp. Data shows the vast majority of holders don't care about governance — very few actually participate in it — they care about making money. Projects often perpetuate this trend by treating governance tokens as part of their marketing and customer acquisition strategies.  This is to say nothing of the obscene concentration of governance tokens by founding teams and their investors. In a democracy, everyone has a voice and a vote. In DeFi, one token equals one vote which equals plutocracy. In a real sense, community votes are symbolic as nominally independent development teams and their financial backer VCs make all the decisions in DeFi.  While DeFi is indeed largely owned and operated by a few massive whales, the entire ecosystem subsists thanks to a relatively small number of degens who cycle through liquidity pools, looking for the best “APY.”  In the past year, DeFi’s total TVL moved between $40 billion and $60 billion, while monthly users never topped three million. It's the same money that’s being cycled between the same wallets.  Again, crypto is disconnected from real economic activity and almost all of the millions of dollars in funds that look very impressive on paper is used for speculation. And given the hurdles of getting involved in DeFi — from the UX to Ethereum’s transaction fees and that fact you’re competing against whales — it’s really only useful for technically savvy traders with high risk tolerance.  So why is this ecosystem putting on this show? Most people don’t have bad intentions. If you're in crypto, it's because you believe in a better future. You're an idealist. You want to change the world.  Why are founders putting on this show of airdrops, and governance forums and DAOs? In most cases, it’s not because the projects need any of this. It’s not because the project is actually decentralized enough. They’re doing this because they think it’s what regulators want to see.  To a large extent, protocol teams are responding to a hostile regulatory environment where the top agency involved hasn’t been clear about what is and isn’t in violation of U.S. laws. There are a million unknowns about something even as simple as an airdrop.  So DeFi’s founders and builders set up non-profit organizations, go pseudo-anonymous and try to pass off “valueless” tokens. But they’re not fooling anyone. Regulators know this is decentralized theater.  Regulators, especially in the U.S., have already started coming after crypto and DeFi. That includes supposedly community-run DAOs like Ooki and actually decentralized protocols like Tornado Cash.  Build useful  So what’s the answer? If you believe in what crypto is trying to achieve then keep after it. Chase the goal. Build the things that need to be built.  And it’s not illegal or immoral to make money along the way; early adopter degens pave the way for mass adoption, and speculation provides initial liquidity and allows projects to battle test. The game of TVL musical chairs among degens is actually fine and healthy at this early stage.  But let’s lift the curtain on decentralization theater, and cut the B.S. Starting out more centralized is often necessary, but save everyone’s time and be transparent about it. Don't pretend it's your ""community"" running things when it’s not. Don't portray your application or protocol as decentralized when it's not.  Decentralize only when you mean it, or just don’t.  A connection to the “real world” where DeFi can be used by everyday people and businesses to transact freely and more efficiently is coming. As I said before, there’s a lot to already be proud of in DeFi and crypto more broadly.  Coming back to those users in Argentina, people in emerging markets are increasingly using DeFi, for example to hold and earn yield on stablecoins. Build for them. Build for the artist that came starry-eyed into the space last year. Build for your friends still using dinosaur banks. But just please, stop building for Gary Gensler.

Ripple Is Now on the List of Amazon’s Partners On Monday, August 14, the world’s largest online retailer Amazon confirmed its strategic partnership with a prominent blockchain company RippleNet. According to the statement, Amazon will use Ripple’s native XRP token for digital payments to enable smooth, speedy, and reasonably-priced transactions. Amazon has highlighted three key Ripple’s products on the AWS Partner Profile. First of all, the page described xCurrent, Ripple’s software solution that allows to process cross-border real-time payments efficiently and at lower costs: “The solution is specifically designed to meet the needs of banks by fitting within their existing risk, compliance,and information security frameworks.” Secondly, Amazon emphasized xRapid, Ripple’s solution for sourcing on-demand liquidity and minimizing its costs: “xRapid uniquely uses a digital asset, XRP, to offer on-demand liquidity, which lowers costs while enabling real-time payments in emerging markets. Built for enterprise use, XRP offers banks and payment providers an efficient, scalable, reliable liquidity option to service cross-border payments.” Finally, the e-commerce titan endorsed Ripple’s xVia, API which enables global payments with just a single integration: “xVia's simple API requires no software installation and enables users to send payments globally with transparency into the payment status and with rich information, like invoices, attached.” Additionally, Amazon’s announcement provided examples of Ripple’s commercial use cases for banks, payment providers, exchanges, and corporates: “e-Invoicing International supply chain payments Global currency account Real-time cashpooling International bill pay Real-time remittances and international P2P payments” What Does it Mean for Ripple and Crypto Industry In General? The Ripple-Amazon collaboration is a groundbreaking move which marks the first time a cryptocurrency is integrated into a major retailer system. Undoubtedly, this partnership also signifies a step towards global crypto adoption and might potentially revolutionize the way global e-commerce works. If the collaboration is successful, Amazon could set an example for other retailers to follow suit and integrate cryptocurrencies into their systems as well. As for Ripple, becoming partners with Amazon definitely adds up to the blockchain company’s recognition and strengthens its position as one of the leading crypto platforms across the market. The new collaboration aligns with Ripple's mission to “build breakthrough crypto solutions for a world without economic borders”. XRP Reacts to the News Following the announcement, the price of Ripple’s native token soared and briefly reached $0.637 before pulling back shortly after.

Mining revenue is also up, as the bitcoin Bitcoin recorded a spike in transaction volume. As a result, Riot Blockchain, one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies in the US, has recorded an increase in operations in the second quarter. According to its 2023 second-quarter financial results, the mining company recorded a new all-time record hash while ramping up its Bitcoin mining operations. Solid Second Quarter 2023 According to its financial report, Riot has seriously ramped up its Bitcoin mining operations. As a result, the mining company produced 1,775 BTC during the second quarter of 2023, a 27% increase compared to the 1,395 BTC it produced during that same period in 2022. In May 2023 alone, the company produced 676 BTC at an average of 21.8 BTC per day. The average cost to mine each bitcoin was $8,389, beating Q2 2022’s average of $11,316. Related Reading: More Selling? Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase Riot also witnessed an increase in mining revenue, as Bitcoin miners generated a remarkable total revenue of $2.4 billion. Although the price of Bitcoin during the quarter was 15% less than what it was in Q2 2022, Riot saw a total revenue of $76.7 million, as compared to $72.9 million in Q2 2022. Mining revenue ($49.7 million), engineering revenue ($19.3 million), data hosting revenue ($7.7 million), and power curtailment credits ($13.5 million) were also higher than in Q2 2022. Not only has RIOT’s revenue from bitcoin mining increased, but their actual bitcoin holdings have also grown substantially. As of June 30, Riot held 7,264 BTC with the price of each BTC at $30,477. In total, Riot finished the quarter with $408.4 million in working capital, including $289.2 million in cash on hand and $221.4 million in Bitcoin, while also reducing its net loss to $27.7 million compared to $353.6 million in Q2 2022. BTC price remains volatile | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Increase In Bitcoin Mining Power Riot Blockchain also drastically increased its hash rate throughout the quarter, reaching an all-time record hash rate capacity of 10.7 EH/s.

However, Riot’s power strategy contributes to the stability of the energy grid in Texas at times of high demand by selling extra power back to the grid.

During Q2 2023, Hut 8 ( HUT ) mined 399 bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), a 58% drop from the year-ago quarter, primarily from an increase in average bitcoin network difficulty, the impact of the suspension of operations at its North Bay facility, and ongoing electrical issues at its Drumheller site. The issues at Drumheller, which HUT had previously reported, were mainly the result of high energy input levels causing miners to fail. Operations are currently at ~20% of its installed hash rate at the site. Hut 8 ( HUT ) said it has implemented new custom firmware across all miner models designed to lower the power supply's maximum output voltage, increased repair staff, and acquired new hardware to expedite repairs. The electrical issues were exacerbated by high energy rates, which further increased curtailment at the site, the company said. Hut 8's ( HUT ) installed hashrate was 2.6 EH/s, excluding its North Bay facility, as of June 30, 2023, unchanged from March 31, 2023. Mining profit of C$3.20M dropped from C$14.9M a year ago. As of June 30, 2023, the company had total self-mined bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) balance held in custody or pledged as collateral of 9,136 with a market value of C$368.7M. Its total digital assets on its balance sheet at June 30 came to C$368.9M, up from C$203.6M at Dec. 31, 2022. Q2 adjusted EBITDA of -C$2.69M sank from C$98.2M a year earlier.

16036312,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547190,1692025203,Silent Bitcoin Storm: Glassnode Uncovers What Lies Beneath The Surface,"In the dynamic realm of Bitcoin, the ability to discern patterns and trends from raw data is invaluable. Glassnode’s latest report, “Exhaustion and Apathy,” serves as a beacon, illuminating the intricate nuances of the current state of the market. Let’s delve deeper into the numbers and their implications. Historic Lows In Bitcoin Volatility The overarching theme of Glassnode’s findings is the unprecedented stagnation in Bitcoin’s volatility. The data reveals that the digital asset has been trading within a remarkably narrow $29,000 to $30,000 range. Historically, Bitcoin has been synonymous with volatility, making this current phase an anomaly. The report underscores this by highlighting the Bollinger Bands’ tightness, noting, “The upper and lower Bollinger Bands are currently separated by just 2.9%.” Such constricted movement has been a rarity in Bitcoin’s tumultuous history. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? Meanwhile, the dynamics between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH) offer a captivating narrative. Glassnode’s data indicates a significant shift in wealth between these two cohorts. The STH’s wealth has burgeoned by +$22B this year, while the LTH has witnessed a near-identical reduction of -$21B. This shift is not merely about numbers but also about market sentiment and strategy. The cost basis further elucidates this dynamic. The STH cost basis has surged by +59% YTD, settling at $28.6k. In stark contrast, the LTH cost basis lingers considerably lower, around $20.3k. This divergence suggests that recent market entrants might be paying a premium, potentially due to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or speculative behavior. Glassnode’s exploration into spending patterns in this low volatility environment is also particularly enlightening. The data suggests that in such periods, the majority of coins moved on-chain have a cost basis that hews closely to the spot rate, resulting in minuscule realized profits or losses. The Sell-Side Risk Ratio, a pivotal metric in this context, is languishing at an all-time low. To put it in perspective, fewer than 27 trading days (0.57%) have recorded a value lower than the current one, signaling a market teetering on the edge of a potential volatility resurgence. Segmented View Of BTC’s Supply The report’s segmented analysis of Bitcoin’s supply, based on ‘investor holding time,’ offers a layered understanding of market behavior. The ‘Hot Supply,’ representing the most active coins, constitutes a mere 2.8% of all invested value in BTC. This suggests a market dominated by holders rather than traders. Related Reading: SHIB, PEPE, APE Gain Against Bitcoin, Santiment Explains What This Means The ‘Warm Supply,’ spanning from a week to six months, has seen a modest uptick year-to-date, now accounting for around 30% of Bitcoin’s wealth. This segment’s behavior is crucial as it often acts as a bridge between short-term reactions and long-term convictions. The ‘Single-Cycle Long-Term Holders,’ those entrenched in the 2020-23 cycle, are the behemoths, holding a staggering 63% of the invested capital. Their cost basis, as per Glassnode, stands at $33.8k, indicating an average unrealized loss of -13.3%. In juxtaposition, the classic LTH cohort, which includes the long-dormant and deep HODLed supply, boasts a cost basis of $20.4k, translating to an unrealized profit of +43.6%. This stark contrast underscores the lingering impact of the 2022 bear market and the cautious optimism of early adopters. In conclusion, Glassnode’s data-driven insights paint a nuanced picture of the Bitcoin market. The dominance of long-term holders, the historic lows in volatility, and the evident investor apathy all converge to suggest a market in a state of stasis. The numbers indicate a market that’s waiting, perhaps for a Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? or a significant event, to determine its next direction. At press time, Bitcoin was trading just above the 50-day EMA.

This surge reflects the cryptocurrency’s enduring appeal, adaptability to market trends, and potential to disrupt traditional finance. Speculations abound about the factors driving this surge, sparking discussions on its implications for both XRP’s future trajectory and the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite this surge in trading activity, the expected correlation between volume and price failed to materialize, leaving market analysts puzzled by the intriguing phenomenon. XRP transaction volume. Source: Messari The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to unexpected fluctuations, but the recent surge in XRP’s trading volume has brought forth a unique puzzle. Unlike the traditional market dynamics, where a surge in volume often corresponds with a significant price movement, XRP’s price remained relatively muted. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges This divergence has led experts to speculate that the surge in volume might not primarily represent genuine buying support for the asset. XRP Buyers’ Attempt To Reclaim Higher Ground In a separate report, it was highlighted that the XRP price had staged a minor recovery attempt from the $0.6 support level the previous week. In an endeavor to regain higher ground, the coin price exhibited a short-lived 11.4% jump, only to encounter immediate resistance at $0.665. The subsequent rejection candle at this crucial barrier spoke volumes about the prevailing market sentiment. Traders, it seems, are still inclined to sell on bounces, a strategy often observed in established downtrends. XRP is trading at $0.6286, according to TradingView.com Over the course of seven days, the gains amounted to a mere 0.1%, underscoring the tenuous nature of the recovery attempts. Anticipating A Potential Turnaround Amidst the price volatility, a key question emerges: can the falling XRP price rally once more? If the price does indeed witness another surge in buying pressure that propels it to the $0.6 support level, it could signal a concerted effort by buyers to accumulate the asset at a discounted rate. All eyes are now on the critical resistance level of $0.665. Should the XRP price manage to break through this barrier, it could serve as the initial sign of a broader recovery trend. Market participants and analysts alike are closely monitoring these developments, seeking clues that could shed light on the elusive interplay between trading volume, price movements, and market sentiment.

42392713,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAQ5B,1692019769,Ethereum's Technical Evolution and Institutional Interest in ETH Staking,"Ever since Ethereum became a practical blockchain technology platform and developed into an incumbent player next to Bitcoin, it has encountered several infrastructure challenges concerning scalability, throughput, efficiency and security. Problems with scalability hinder the speed at which transactions can occur, while challenges with throughput affect the number of transactions that can be handled per second. Efficiency relates to the excessive energy consumption and expenses involved in mining; whereby complex computational problems were solved to safeguard new coins using the now-defunct Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.  As to security, since the functionality of the Ethereum blockchain is based on executing smart contracts, security challenges mainly involve smart contracts as opposed to the Ethereum network. Compounding security challenges on Ethereum are various Layer-2 decentralized applications (dapps) and scaling solutions that are built on top of Ethereum, many of which are not finance-related.  To mitigate and subsequently overcome the above challenges, starting in August 2021, the Ethereum network underwent several infrastructural improvements, starting with EIP-1559, which improved the network’s fee system. The next improvement took place in September 2022, known as the Merge, which was a major shift in the network’s consensus mechanism. The Merge was followed by the Shapella upgrade in April 2023. The Shapella upgrade enabled validators on the network to unstake their network-locked ether.  These improvements have led to a growing interest in decentralized financial (DeFi) protocols by financial institutions and the yield they offer to investors. Hence the development of Ethereum staking as a financial product.     EIP-1559 (London HF)  Also known as the London Hard Fork, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559 was a milestone in the evolution of the Ethereum blockchain into its current state. It involved changes in codes to improve the blockchain’s transaction fee system. The cornerstone of this improvement was relinquishing the gas fee system known as ‘first-price auction’. The first-price auction scheme, or legacy system, required network participants to bid competitively to have their transactions processed, with the highest bidders almost always getting prioritized over others.  EIP-1559 introduced a new fee system with three key features: the base fee, variable block size, and the tip.  Base fee:Prior to EIP-1559, a validator would have to submit a bid as a transaction fee, which would then be taken up by miners who could see all the transactions and their associated bids. Miners would then receive transaction fees in their entirety. EIP-1559 introduced a base fee that is the minimum gas price that a validator must pay to be included in a block. The key benefit of the base fee is that, as a result of its predictability, it makes gas fees more predictable and high fees less frequent.  Variable block size:EIP-1559 also changed block size and gas number dynamics. Post upgrade, Ethereum blocks now have 1 to 30 million gas units worth of transactions, which were previously capped at 15 million. Moreover, post-upgrade, the base fee is directly related to the implementation of variable block sizes.  Miner tip: Also referred to as a ‘priority fee’, the miner tip functions as an incentive mechanism for miners to prioritize transactions. Miner tips are used in times of high transaction demand on the blockchain network, which means when a block is filled with its maximum of 30 million units worth of transactions. In other words, the miner tip mechanism is a temporary reincarnation of the ‘first-price auction’ system.  EIP-1559 made the fees predictable and reduced volatility. Users and dapps that seek prioritization of their transactions on the network can pay minors a tip (priority fee) for faster inclusion and processing of their transactions. EIP-1559, which took place in August 2021, has since led to improvements in the user experience, a better fee structure, and automation.  The Merge  In September 2022, another milestone was reached in the upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain network. It was an overhaul of the blockchain network’s consensus mechanism. Ethereum underwent a successful upgrade to transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to one of proof-of-stake, which came to be known as the Merge. It involved merging the Ethereum mainnet, its execution layer, with the Beacon Chain, its proof of stake consensus layer. As a result of the Merge, the network relinquished the mining model (PoW).  Proof of stake, the new consensus mechanism, involves the active participation of stakers (validators) in validating transactions. Today, Ethereum can be staked on centralized cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp, as well as decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Lido, dYdX, Uniswap and 1inch.  A fundamental difference between PoW and PoS is the huge savings in energy consumption that PoS offers—over 99% in energy savings to mint a new block, comparable to Finland’s energy grid. On the security side, PoS offers a sigh of relief as it makes it extremely difficult for bad actors to control hashing power for fraudulent transactions, a practice known as the 51% attack under the PoW consensus mechanism.  Post Merge, the tokenomics of Ethereum continued to evolve as smart contract platforms saw growing use cases and viable business adoption in NFT and DeFi, enlarging the Ethereum ecosystem.  The Shapella Upgrade  The Shapella upgrade (a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella) was the most recent upgrade to the Ethereum network that took place in April 2023. It marked the completion of Ethereum’s transition to PoS. The upgrade removed uncertainty around whether and when ETH stakers would be able to withdraw their assets and rewards. The significance of Shapella lies in its ability to impact supply and demand for ETH and its price, as it enabled validators to withdraw staking rewards and made it possible for the potential release of billions of dollars of dormant staked ETH into the blockchain’s supply chain.  Before the Shapella upgrade, stakers could only deposit their ETH into the Beacon Chain and earn rewards, but they could not withdraw their funds. Therefore, the upgrade offers an exit for stakers, which comes in two formats: full withdrawals and partial withdrawals.  Full withdrawals pertain to when validators completely exit the Ethereum network, which entails taking out the necessary 32 ETH to act as a validator. On the other hand, partial withdrawals solely involve withdrawing the rewards accumulated during a specific validator's staking journey.  Ethereum’s journey to further improvement continues. The next upgrade that is expected to take place later this year is EIP 4844, which, upon completion, is expected to reduce fees, increase transaction throughput, and make it more cost-effective to integrate layer-2 solution protocols with Ethereum.  Ethereum Staking and Banks  The enhancements to the Ethereum blockchain have led to decreased volatility, risk and a more secure network. They have brought about the evolution of a tech platform that offers investors yield with liquid staking tokens and restaking protocols, which are gaining significance in the emerging financial ecosystem of Web3. The staking rewards promised by the above technological developments are enticing banking and custodial institutions to invest in and develop staking and data solutions for a growing ETH staking market. This growing market offers new opportunities for asset managers and advisors to develop customizable staking solutions for their clients.  Ethereum Trend Indicator (ETI) and CESR by CoinDesk Indices  CoinDesk Indices (CDI) is the leading provider of digital asset indices by AUM since 2014. CDI offers single-asset reference indices, broad market and sector indices, and systematic strategies. Part of this solution suite includes the Ether Trend Indicator (ETI) and the Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR).  ETI is a daily signal which conveys the presence, direction, and strength of the current price trend of ether. ETI seeks to help the market navigate the ‘crypto seasons’ by providing outcome-driven investment products that aim to unlock new sources of return, help manage risk, and improve overall efficiency to reduce potential costs. It is used in long-only dynamic allocation strategies, broadcasting one of five possible daily values. The values correspond to the direction and strength of the trend in price and are calculated daily and derived from historical daily levels of the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX).  CESR is a staking rate product. It is a daily benchmark rate that represents the mean, annualized staking yield of the Ethereum validator population. It provides participants in the Ethereum ecosystem with a standardized benchmark rate for staking and a settlement rate for derivative contracts. CESR can also help market observers and analysts generate deeper insights across Ethereum. It captures all relevant rewards for Ethereum validators, including consensus rewards and total priority transaction fees. The methodology accounts for deposits, withdrawals and “slashing” and reflects the portion of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) earned by validators. Historical daily CESR rates can be aggregated to address any evaluation period or contract tenor. CESR is administered by CoinFund and calculated by CDI.

Gaming tokens, referred to as ""play-to-earn"" tokens, have drawn a lot of attention since they combine investment and enjoyment. This article examines three gaming tokens that have the potential to add value to your cryptocurrency portfolio: Axie Infinity (AXS), Gala Games (GALA), and Pomerdoge (POMD). Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Axie Infinity (AXS): Pioneering NFT Gaming Revolution Starting off, Axie Infinity (AXS) has gained notoriety for its brilliant fusion of blockchain and NFT technologies. At its foundation, the game gives players the ability to gather, raise, and fight against fantastical beings known as ""Axies."" Additionally, these Axies have been painstakingly tokenized as NFTs, giving them inherent valuethat players may trade and sell with ease. This idea is supported by the ground-breaking play-to-earn paradigm. This enables users to make money by actively engaging in battles and quests. As a result, it leads to a ground-breaking fusion of gaming and investment. Furthermore, Axie Infinity's value has dramatically increased, drawing in both investors and gamers. As a result, Axie Infinity offers an enticing opportunity for diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio due to its strong potential for future expansion and integration. Gala Games (GALA)- Empowering Game Development Democracy By introducing player and creator empowerment, the creative force known as Gala Games (GALA) is unwaveringly committed to reshaping the game business landscape. Gala Games expands a platform where users can intricately participate in creating and owning games thanks to blockchain technology. Consequently, the GALA token is the key to this dynamic since it allows for easy transactions and interactions between players and creators. Moreover, Gala Games stands out for its unwavering dedication to decentralization and community involvement. Thereby, giving developers the power to maintain creative liberty and ownership of their video game creations. Because of Gala Games' unusual commitment to user-centricity, it stands out in a sea of gaming tokens. As a result, it is enticing to both gamers and astute investors. Pomerdoge (POMD) To Surpass Axie Infinity and Gala Games As Axie Infinity and Gala Games are stagnating, Pomerdoge is expected to increase 10x in the next month, according to analysts. The complex environment that Pomerdoge is creating will house NFTs, POMD tokens, a marketplace and an exciting play-to-earn (P2E) gaming platform. Therefore, these components combine to provide an engaging and satisfying experience that draws crypto aficionados from all over the world. Players from all over the world will be able to compete and converse on the P2E game's platform.

However, we'll be highlighting some of these lesser-known tokens that have shown significant growth potential. They include Nexo (NEXO), Pomerdoge (POMD), and 1inch (1INCH) tokens. Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Key Cryptocurrencies To Watch Closely – 1inch (1INCH), Nexo(NEXO), and Pomerdoge (POMD) The once bearish trend experienced by the 1inch (1NCH) token has flattened and it is looking set to go on a bullish rally. This is evident in the stats that show that it has seen a slight move towards a positive price action after suffering a 2.45% loss in price value in the last 7 days. 1INCH currently trades at $0.30 with a 24-hour trading volume of $14 million. After falling to an all-time low of $0.25 on June 15, 2023, 1inch is bouncing back at the moment, with the coin gaining 3% in the last 30 days. Crypto price prediction platforms have projected that 1inch could exceed the $0.5 benchmark very soon. Right now, analysts reckon that 1 inch is on the right track to surge in the coming days and weeks. Investors Confident in the Resurgence of Nexo (NEXO) Despite Current Dip in Price Notwithstanding the ongoing declining price action of the Nexo (NEXO) token, investors and analysts are confident that the token will rally anytime soon. For context, It has lost 1.93% in price value in the last 24 hours and trades at $0.63 as of the time of writing. However, the trading volume of Nexo in the last 24 hours shows that the market activity of the token gained 8.88% to see a market return of over $1.90M. A further look at the price chart shows that Nexo is 3.69% better off in price value than it was in the last 30 days and has only lost 0.58% of its price value in the last 7 days. As such, Nexo may well be a shrewd investment option. Most crypto price prediction platforms already predicted that Nexo will hit the $1 benchmark in the year. If the coin breaks the current resistance level, we could witness a rally very soon. Pomerdoge (POMD) Surges As More Investors Buy Into the Presale Pomerdoge (POMD) has been consistently on an upward trajectory since its presale phase started. Pomerdoge is a P2E gaming platform where individuals from around the globe can connect and network with each other while engaging in healthy digital gaming competitions.

The pro-Bitcoin advocate scored the majority of the votes, making a stinging win during the Primaries on August 13. Javier Milei Demolishes Electoral Competition Javier Milei, an outspoken Argentine economist, is known for his sharp criticism of traditional politics and his fervent support of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Due to this, previous poll predictions had stated that Milei would score no higher than third place in the recent elections. Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange? However, Milei decimated the August elections with a stunning display of voter support, accumulating over 30% of the 90% of votes counted. Milei leads the libertarian party, “La Libertad Avanza” and the party is dominating with 32% of votes. In comparison, Argentine presidential candidates like Patricia Bullrich in “Juntos por el Cambio” (Together for Change) party received 28.14% votes, and Sergio Massa in “Unidos por la Patria” (Union for the Homeland) party received 26.84% votes. From the onset, Milei has attracted the attention of the Argentine population through his outspoken support of cryptocurrency, lack of political interventions, and the abolishment of the country’s central bank. Milei has stated that the country’s central banks should be destroyed to eliminate corrupt political authorities that influence the country’s economy and inflation rates. He has also said that Argentina’s adoption of bitcoin cryptocurrency would help create a more stable and accountable government, reducing government bureaucracy and improving the country’s declining economy. “The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax,” Milei stated. BTC price recovers after brief dip | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Argentina Grapples with Spiraling Economic Crisis The daily reality of the Argentine country is filled with significant growth fluctuations, high inflation, and a deteriorating GDP. Argentina’s inflation is the third highest in the world, following Venezuela and Lebanon. Reports also state that the country faces one of the worst economic crises since the depression from 1998 to 2002. Recently, Argentina has hit new record lows against the dollar weekly. Since the beginning of 2023, the Argentine peso has lost 24% in value against the dollar, resulting in black market rates selling one dollar for 500 pesos. Argentina is also in debt, owing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) an astonishing $44 billion. Milei’s approach toward adopting cryptocurrency triggers several governmental agencies, including the IMF, which strongly opposes Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Milei’s manifesto includes plans to dollarize the country’s economy, which aims to stabilize the country’s native currency. Related Reading: San Francisco’s SoFi Bank Reveals Significant Holdings In BTC, ETH, And DOGE Argentina’s current economic crisis has also struck a nerve in Argentines, with many young citizens strongly supporting Milei’s views and commitment to free-market policies. Although Milei’s victory in the primaries is a positive step forward toward the general elections coming up on October 22, his success is not without controversy, as critics publicly oppose his policies and views. Milei’s win in the August primary election also does not guarantee a win in the general election. However, his victory has undoubtedly upended the country’s political system and sparked conversations about Argentina’s future.

FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been sent back to jail ahead of his October trial on seven federal criminal charges after a federal judge revoked his release on bond Friday afternoon, saying the former crypto heavyweight appears to have tried to tamper with witnesses. Bankman-Fried is willing ""to risk crossing the line in an effort to get right up to [the line], wherever it is,"" said U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York.

IMF should be concerned When the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forced the Argentine central bank to guarantee that it wouldn’t dabble in bitcoin, on pain of having its last crucial loan denied, the global financial agency must have thought that it had stopped bitcoin from being used in at least one Latin American country. A short time later, and the IMF must be feeling more than a trifle worried as a libertarian pro-Bitcoin candidate looks to be about to win the country’s presidential primary elections with more than 90% of the vote already counted. Central bank is a scam Javier Milei, young leader of La Libertad Avanza party, is not a meek and mild libertarian either. He is openly campaigning to abolish the Argentine central bank, calling it a “scam”. Such a statement is inflammatory in the extreme and will probably be taken by many from the Argentine elites and the banking sector as the rantings of a revolutionary hot head. However, the presidential hopeful has shown in interviews that he understands how money works, and he is calling out politicians and the central bank for cheating people with an “inflationary tax”. Milei had the following to say in an interview: “The problem is that governments are not going to want to give up compulsory use of fiat currency. Bitcoin is the natural reaction to central bank fraud, but allowing money to become private once more isn’t something the thieving politicians will allow.” In past times, such language used by an aspiring politician, let alone one that would be president of his country, would have been denounced by the ruling class and would have been enough to see that this person got nowhere near any position of power. Argentina running out of options However, this is Argentina, a country that has played the IMF game for many decades, with presidents and top bank officials doing exactly as they were told, only for Argentina to lurch from one default crisis to another, over and over again, with citizens' purchasing power in the Argentine peso practically going to zero, and with an annual inflation rate of well over 100%. For Argentina to move onto the sound money base that is Bitcoin, could be a very interesting move for the country. That the elites in Argentina, plus the powers that be across the globe, might allow such a decision is something else. Argentina is in an extremely precarious financial position, and has only just managed to avoid default just recently with the help of China and the Latin American Development Bank. It will take a very brave and resolute leader to oversee such an incredible transition. For Argentina, there may be no other option.

Here’s what the memecoins’ profits mean. SHIB, PEPE, And APE Have Enjoyed An Uptrend Recently Bitcoin has been going through a major phase of stagnation recently as the number 1 cryptocurrency’s price has remained stuck between the $29,000 and $30,000 levels. Much of the other market hasn’t been all that different, either. Out of the few coins that have gone against the grain and have displayed some volatility. However, the meme coins have especially stood out. Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Apecoin, in particular, have all pulled away from BTC. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, also saw bullish momentum earlier, but the asset has slowed down recently. Out of these assets, PEPE has been the best performer, as it has observed profits of about 22% within the past week. Looks like PEPE has been going up recently | Source: PEPEUSD on TradingView While Pepe’s weekly gains are certainly the most impressive of the bunch, the meme coin is actually in severe losses of 17% when considering the period of the past month. Related Reading: Want A Bitcoin Spot ETF? Then Prove BTC Is Not Manipulated, Says SEC ApeCoin has risen by 12% in the past week, and while the coin isn’t in negative during the past month, its performance for the period is still only flat. APE has also gone up in recent days | Source: APEUSD on TradingView Unlike these two assets with significantly smaller market caps, Shiba Inu has not only registered impressive gains of 16% during the past week, but it has also observed a massive 32% rise during the last month. SHIB has sharply jumped recently | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView The reason behind the solid Shiba Inu performance is likely to be the much-hyped Shibarium upgrade, which is expected to launch sometime later in the current week. Does The Memecoin Rally Hold Any Significance For The Greater Market? All in all, it’s clear that these three meme coins have been building up bullish momentum recently, and they have been doing so simultaneously. In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed that while these assets may be rising, their social volumes haven’t budged much. SHIB and others haven't seen too high social volumes | Source: Santiment The “social volume” here is a metric that keeps track of the degree of discussion that an asset is receiving on the major social media platforms. When this indicator has a high value, it’s a sign that a large number of users are talking about the coin and that there may be FUD or hype present around the coin. In uptrends, this metric reaching very high values is generally not a good sign, as it shows that FOMO is on the rise among social media users, which is something that has historically had an opposite effect on the price and has led to top formations. Since these metrics have risen for SHIB and the other meme coins, it means that social media users haven’t been paying too much attention so far to the pumps that these cryptocurrencies have been going through. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? In the same post, Santiment also explains that the meme coins pulling away from Bitcoin have historically held significance for the entire sector. “This can often signal that the entire crypto market may be veering toward ‘overheated’ territory,” notes the analytics firm. Santiment also says that when SHIB and co. see isolated pumps, “it is often associated with greed and/or boredom from the crowd.

Is this yet another infallible buy signal for this indicator? Price action about to change? All quiet on the Bitcoin front as the apex cryptocurrency continues to follow a meandering, slightly boring and predictable sideways trajectory between the $29,000 to $30,000 range. However, momentum is perhaps just starting to bubble up underneath Bitcoin’s wanderings as one of the most successful and trusted indicators has suddenly sprung into life - flashing a buy signal that was last seen at the beginning of the year, after which Bitcoin started to thrust its way out of the last bear market. The Bitcoin hash rate The Bitcoin hash rate is the amount of computing power that Bitcoin miners contribute to the network. The hash rate goes up when more miners are competing for blocks. On the flip side, when the price drops, or does not go up for a long period of time, miner capitulation happens, meaning that mining is no longer profitable, and miners take their machines offline. Even though the Hash Ribbons are a lagging indicator, on the higher time frame they are a very reliable sign that a bottom or a dip in the Bitcoin price has been reached. Given that Bitcoin is at a rather crucial point in what is seen by some as just a bear market rally, and by others as the initial phase of the new bull market, this signal will perhaps tip the argument more in the favour of the latter exponents. A perilous financial time A backdrop of dire economic warnings make for an incredibly interesting time for Bitcoin. The traditional monetary and banking system is on the edge of a cliff of financial oblivion, and should it go over this cliff, most financial assets might be expected to go with it. There are analysts who say that Bitcoin is a risk asset, and so would be expected to be one of the first to feel the pain of a financial meltdown. However, others would say that Bitcoin was created precisely for such an extreme scenario, and given that it is outside of the traditional financial system, many investors would see it as a liferaft to which they could transfer their wealth. It is certainly hoped that financial armageddon can be avoided, but given the way that governments and central banks have handled world economies, things are looking extremely perilous. It can be argued that the fiat currency experiment has reached the bitter end. All those still hoarding currency in the bank are doing so naively, probably unaware that their purchasing power is diminishing rapidly, and that they run the risk of being ‘bailed in’ should the bank fail. Bitcoin is a sovereign store of wealth that is scarce, predictable, and the most secure computing system on the planet. Those looking to save themselves in the perilous time to come would do well to investigate Bitcoin’s properties. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin traded just over $29,300 while ether flirted around the $1,850 mark. Both assets have returned slightly over 1% for investors in the past week - making it one of the lowest volatility periods.  The bitcoin lull meant most majors and mid-cap tokens, such as cardano's ADA, solana's SOL and lido (LDO) moved similarly little, with sudden movements getting sold off quickly and no major declines.  The lack of market movement has possibly led traders to meme coins such as shiba inu (SHIB) and pepe (PEPE), data analytics firm Santiment said in a Saturday report. Such rallies often mark local market tops - with record open interest in SHIB futures blaring a likely warning sign for bullish bitcoin moves in the coming weeks.  “Historically, we need to be aware that surges from speculative assets that really only see minimal development activity (at best), this can often signal that the entire crypto market may be veering toward 'overheated' territory,” Santiment said.  Meanwhile, some market traders say an ETF ruling could bring back the infamous volatility of the crypto market.  “While the options market's expected volatility (DVOL) remains notably low, we are observing a slight uptick in BTC, especially visible versus ETH,” shared Deribit chief commercial officer Luuk Strijers in an email. “A potential catalyst for this could be the looming ETF news on the shorter term and the halving impact on the longer run.  “Although the chances of imminent ETF-related news are slim, any announcement would likely have a more pronounced effect on BTC than on ETH,” Strijers added.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB | PEPE,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/14/bitcoin-slumbers-as-etf-hopes-simmer-pepe-leads-altcoin-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5011db575cd55431983d50d349891e908e9fc66-1500x1061.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bernstein expects a spot bitcoin ETF market to be sizable, reaching 10% of bitcoin’s market cap in two to three years.  The SEC extended its review of the Ark 21Shares bitcoin ETF application on Friday, as the regulator continues to assess applications from traditional finance heavyweights such as BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity Investments.  Cryptocurrency ETF’s will benefit from a “strong brand marketing push by leading global asset managers,” and a “distribution push from retail brokers and financial advisors,” the note said.  The broker says new capital to power up a new crypto cycle will come from fresh stablecoin supply, tokenization of traditional assets, native crypto infrastructure tokenization and ETFs.  “On-chain assets have been stuck in a $40b range this year, and stablecoins in circulation at around $120b,” the report added.

42392707,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAPuv,1692006847,BALD Developer Sends $12M Back to Ethereum After Spectacular Mess Up,"The developer transferred 2,100 ether to crypto exchange Kraken.  The meme coin plunged 90% in August, but not before some traders netted monumental gains from the token.  The mysterious developer behind bald (BALD), one of the most viral tokens in recent months, transferred some $12 million in ether (ETH) back to the Ethereum network on Sunday.  The transfer happened weeks after bald ran up to an $80 million capitalization before some actions caused prices to plunge 90%.  Data cited by analytics firm Lookonchain shows the bald token deployer bridged 7,000 ether ($12.9M) from the Base network back to Ethereum on Sunday. Bridging refers to the transfer of tokens between different blockchains.  The deployer then deposited 2,100 ether, worth $3.87 million at current prices to the crypto exchange Kraken.  This transfer marked the first time more money was sent out of the Base network than bridged in, a Dune Analytics query shows.  Bald’s mysterious rise in early August came when Base, a blockchain built by crypto exchange Coinbase, wasn’t even officially open to the public. A viral post of a trader turning $500 to hundreds of thousands sent Bald zoomed 4,000,000% within days, attracting over $66 million in ether to the ecosystem as traders hoped to squeeze out returns from an otherwise flat broader market.  Bald seemed to have it all: Seemingly endless liquidity, a growing community, an influx of new traders and, among some circles, scant hopes of it becoming the next Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, this euphoria lasted little beyond a few days. Bald prices fell as much as 90% after peaking after the token's deployer removed millions of dollars worth of liquidity – causing sentiment to quickly sour as traders rushed for the exits amid the uncertainty.  The deployer had previously added up to $35 million worth of ether to a liquidity pool on Leetswap, an exchange built on Base network, which created the illusion of it being a well-funded project.  They also possibly made millions of dollars in fees from supplying ether against bald tokens, as well as from selling ether for bald when prices rose.  As such, the developer seemed little fazed after the price drop. ""The tokens controlled by the deployer address, including liquidity tokens, are owned by the deployer who reserves the right to do whatever with them,"" they said in a tweet.  ""If you still decide to trade this token you will probably lose all your money (if you somehow haven’t already). This is a memecoin. There is no roadmap. The fundamental value of this token is $0. There is no BALD team,"" they added at the time.  Some sleuths have even linked Bald to Sam Bankman-Fried-owned Alameda Research based on the wallet activity and links to Alameda projects. However, the wealthy deployer’s identity remains a mystery as of Monday.

Goodtimes — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 12, 2023 Hoskinson’s remarks were sparked by a video clip in which Ethereum developer Justin Drake commented on staking, likening it to sausage-making and suggesting that understanding the intricate process could lead to disillusionment. Hoskinson’s use of the colloquialism underscores his perspective on Ethereum’s staking mechanism. Some interpreted his comment as a candid critique of the opacity surrounding Ethereum’s staking process, hinting at potential undesirable aspects hidden beneath the surface. Ethereum’s own founder, Vitalik Buterin, has previously expressed reservations about staking Ether due to security and operational complexities, providing a backdrop to Hoskinson’s dig.

The note suggests that the Federal Reserve may commence a series of interest rate cuts by the end of June 2024. “The cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target,” the Goldman economists wrote. This statement underscores the bank’s belief that the Federal Reserve’s current stance on interest rates may be too restrictive, especially if inflation rates continue to trend towards the central bank’s target. The note further elaborates: “Normalization is not a particularly urgent motivation for cutting, and for that reason we also see a significant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady.” This cautious tone suggests that while Goldman Sachs is predicting a rate cut, they also acknowledge the unpredictability of the Federal Reserve’s decisions. Related Reading: US Bitcoin ETF Approval Could See North America’s ETF Volume Rise To 99.5% The recent data, which showed US inflation rising at a slower-than-expected rate of 3.2%, with the core consumer price index at a 4.7% annual pace, further complicates the picture. With the Fed’s benchmark rate currently set between 5.25% to 5.5%, Goldman Sachs expects it to stabilize around 3 to 3.25%. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? Expectations of a rate cut from Goldman Sachs are in line with market expectations according to the CME FedWatch Tool. In May 2024, 68% already expect there to be at least a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut. However, it remains to be seen whether macro events will influence the Bitcoin price again. In the last few months, BTC increasingly decoupled from macro events while the stock market rallied towards all-time highs and stagnated around the $30,000 mark. Related Reading: Want A Bitcoin Spot ETF? Then Prove BTC Is Not Manipulated, Says SEC Interestingly, the timing could be very positive for the Bitcoin market. On the one hand, March 15, 2024 is the final deadline for spot Bitcoin ETF filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, Investco, VanEck, and WisdomTree; on the other hand, Bitcoin halving is coming up at the end of April (currently expected on April 26). The high expectations for these two events, coupled with a dovish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, could be a massive catalyst for the Bitcoin price. At press time, BTC traded at $29,426 and saw another calm weekend amid the liquidity summer drought. Breaking above $29,550 is key to establish any bullish momentum to initiate another push towards $30,000.

16024489,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/synesis-one-launches-the-worlds-first-nlp-ai-data-crowdsourcing-application-on-solana-mainnet,1691999742,Synesis One launches the world's first NLP AI data crowdsourcing application on Solana Mainnet,"Zug, Switzerland, August 10th, 2023, Chainwire Synesis One, the world’s first AI data crowdsourcing platform on the Solana Blockchain, announced today the launch of its new Train2Earn App ‘Workspace by Synesis’ on iOS, Android, Saga, and web browsers. The App allows anyone, anywhere in the world to train AI and earn rewards. “The Workspace App is a significant leap forward in our mission to provide high quality data to companies developing AI applications,” said Paul Lee M.D., Cofounder and CEO of Synesis One. “We designed the Synesis One platform to connect companies that need quality AI training data with digital workers who can generate the data quickly, and at competitive prices.” The need for high-quality data to train and refine AI models is growing at an exponential rate, as nearly every industry from financial services to health care is starting to integrate AI into their business processes. Without data, AI models are basically useless: they can't make connections or find patterns or make predictions. That’s why humans are still needed to train AI systems. “We’re a bit like Wikipedia,” says Paul. “Synesis One workers are contributing and refining data every day. But unlike Wikipedia, our contributors are paid for their contributions. That's why we call our business model Train2earn. They train AI and earn rewards.”The applications for Synesis One are limitless. “Train2Earn is the first enterprise-quality on-chain software where business logic is conducted entirely on blockchain,” said Synesis One Head of Product and CTO David Saccon. “This means the provenance of our crowdsourced data is fully traceable and auditable. We believe we are providing a critical component for a new type of open data supply chain to power AI applications.” In addition to crypto payments, the Train2Earn platform also uses the blockchain to enable a public voting process in which contributors reach consensus about the quality of the submitted data. The result is a web3 application that is secure, decentralized, and interoperable. Synesis One’s first client is Mind AI, which is building an advanced natural language reasoning engine. The Synesis One community is helping their team of computer scientists crowdsource the 'mental map' the engine needs to make sense of the world. By training the engine, contributors are also helping humanity achieve the goal of general artificial intelligence. The Train2Earn mobile app is now available for download on the App Store, Google Play Store, and Saga phone App marketplace. For more information about Synesis One and the Train2Earn mobile app, please visit www.synesis.one. About Synesis One Synesis One was founded in 2021 to crowdsource data needed to train a conversational reasoning engine for sister company Mind AI. The platform connects corporate clients in need of AI training data with crowdsourced human intelligence to provide it. The company raised $9.5 million to fund development of the platform and data ecosystem.

With 90% of the vote counted, Milei – of the ""La Libertad Avanza"" (Freedom Advances) party – had 30.5% of the votes versus candidates from ""Juntos por el Cambio"" (Together for Change) and ""Unidos por la Patria"" (United for the Homeland), who received 28% and 27%, respectively.  Pre-election polls suggested Milei would finish no higher than third in today’s vote.  ""The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax,” Milei has previously argued. Regarding Bitcoin, he said that it ""represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector.”  While having a favorable attitude towards the crypto, Milei has not advocated for Bitcoin’s use as legal tender within Argentina (similar to El Salvador). Instead, Milei has called for a “dollarization” of the economy, which currently is dealing with a triple-digit rate of inflation.  With no candidate likely to obtain more than 45% in today’s polling, a general election among the winner for each party will be held in October.

42392704,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAPVH,1691978460,Disappearance of $900K Puts Focus on Vintage Bitcoin Project Libbitcoin,"Information security firm Distrust says a total of at least $900,000 was stolen across multiple blockchains.  Hackers were able to exploit a vulnerability in the Libbitcoin explorer, an open-source command line tool or text interface used by Bitcoin developers to produce cryptographic keys and communicate with the blockchain.  In 2011, just two years after Bitcoin was launched, British-Iranian anarchist developer Amir Taakia and a group of open-source coders created an alternative to Bitcoin Core – the original and still the most popular way of connecting to the Bitcoin network.  That alternative piece of software, branded Libbitcoin, has now evolved into a comprehensive suite of tools – a library – for critical functions like communicating with the Bitcoin blockchain and generating cryptographic keys.  It was even featured in Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos’s popular and arguably canonical book Mastering Bitcoin.  But after roughly $900,000 disappeared from various user wallets over the past few months, Libbitcoin, once presumed secure, has turned out to be unsafe.  Here’s how the latest saga unfolded, according to a report on milksad.info, which details the findings of Distrust, the security firm that discovered the vulnerability in July, assisted by a group of independent contributors.  At some point in May, hackers began secretly stealing funds from unsuspecting users after discovering an obscure vulnerability in a number of wallets generated by the Libbitcoin explorer, called BX.  The vulnerability was dubbed “Milk Sad” because “milk” and “sad” were the first two words in a wallet-recovery seed phrase generated by the vulnerability, the report states.  The most significant heist – 29.65 bitcoin (BTC) worth about $870,000 at current rates – took place July 12. Distrust says a total of at least $900,000 was stolen across multiple blockchains, including from some of the roughly 2,600 bitcoin wallets affected by the vulnerability.  Hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger seem to have been unscathed, but there are still a number of wallets at risk, and the full extent of money stolen is “yet to be determined,” according to an Aug. 8 tweet by Anton Livaja, a member of the Distrust team.  BX comes with a text command called “bx seed” that uses the clock on a developer’s computer to produce a seed phrase for creating a wallet.  Crypto software provides random combinations of 12 to 24 words or seed phrases to users who want to “recover” or regain access to their wallets in the case of accidental loss.  But when using BX, the resultant phrase turns out to be insufficiently random. According to the report, “a decent gaming PC can do a brute-force search,” or guess all possible word combinations for a user’s seed phrase, “in less than a day.”  “Think of this as securing your online bank account with a password manager that creates a long random password,” the report states. “But it often creates the same passwords for every user. Malicious people have figured this out and drained funds on any account they can find.”  Ethereum, Zcash, Solana, Dogecoin affected  Milk Sad is not restricted to Bitcoin. Ethereum, Zcash, Solana and even Dogecoin are among the list of eight blockchains affected. Similar but not identical vulnerabilities have been detected in Cake Wallet and Trust Wallet, both multi-chain wallet apps.  Typically, seed phrases are created using a generator capable of producing a set or “key space” with a dizzying number of unique word combinations represented by the exponent of a binary digit or “bit” – essentially, the number two raised to the power of 128, 192 or 256.  BX has a paltry 32-bit key space which can only yield about 4.3 billion unique word combinations. “That’s not as many combinations as it sounds,” according to the report.  Eric Voskuil, BX’s lead developer, admitted that the seed generator was indeed insecure, but insisted there was no bug in the software, arguing that the bx seed text command had been misused. He tweeted a screenshot of the application’s GitHub documentation that warns developers of the vulnerability.  “This is not a bug in BX or Libbitcoin,” Voskuil tweeted. “It is reckless wallet development.”  Several cryptographers in the Bitcoin community begged to differ.  “The case is crystal-clear,” tweeted Tim Ruffing, cryptographer at Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream. “It's your bug, period.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | DOGE | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/14/disappearance-of-900k-puts-focus-on-vintage-bitcoin-project-libbitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e1a695626af768edcb0d234ea8972d21cd8c6c5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
