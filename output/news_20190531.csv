42381992,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qR6V,1559336416,The Copyright for the Satoshi White Paper is Already Causing Trouble,"Craig Wright's copyright registration of the original bitcoin white paper is starting to create ripple effects.  On May 28 Scribd, a service for posting downloadable documents on the Internet, notified CoinDesk that it had pulled down our copy of the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper.  ""This is a notification that Scribd’s BookID copyright protection system has disabled access to Bitcoin White Paper (id: 411710754). This does not necessarily mean that an infringement has occurred, or that you have done anything wrong,"" the company wrote in a terse email.  This was the link in question – a plain, unmodified copy of the Satoshi white paper. I also uploaded a copy calling it a musical production of the white paper. Scribd did not pull mine down although it should, theoretically, be covered by Wright's copyright.  As we noted before, while Wright did register copyright for the white paper this means absolutely nothing unless someone contests the copyright in court. However, because systems like BookID most likely ping the US copyright database, copies of the paper will be dinged on public services.  Chilling effects  The chilling effects of this are very real. While in our specific case there is little concern the white paper will ever disappear – it will be here forever or until CoinDesk's servers melt down – the loss of access could have far-reaching and unintended consequences.  What's more, anyone can register a copyright for almost anything. Copyright – and patent-trolling – are already rampant in other parts of tech and it's clear blockchain is next.  As for CoinDesk's particular problem, everything seems back to normal... for now.

42382001,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRJ5,1559331011,SEC's Hinman Says Some ICOs May Be Eligible for 'No-Action' Relief,"Startups that conducted initial coin offerings (ICO) years ago may be eligible for relief from potential enforcement actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an agency official said Friday.  For the last year and a half, the regulator has been filing cases against projects that raised money by selling tokens without registering them as securities. But in his opening remarks at the agency's FinTech Forum in Washington, D.C., SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman said that cryptocurrencies are capable of shifting from being a potential security to very clearly not being one.  “Digital assets may evolve into an instrument that no longer needs to be regulated as such,” he said.  Hinman has made a similar point before. In a 2018 speech, he implied that ethereum may have resembled a security during an ICO at its launch, but said that by last year, it was sufficiently decentralized that it had evolved away from being a security.  Though he did not reference ethereum on Friday, Hinman did use other examples to illustrate his point.  As one such example, he cited TurnKey Jets, which secured a no-action letter earlier this year, reassuring the firm that the SEC staff would not recommend taking enforcement action against it.  Hinman explained that the company’s token, network and use case were all fairly mature when the letter was issued, meaning the token had a functional use case and the network was fully developed.  Notably, though, Hinman said that even if some aspect of the project was not fully developed, the SEC may have still been willing to provide no-action relief.  “If they needed more relief on the secondary market for that token, that would not be outside the realm of a possible no-action letter,” he said.  What if?  Taking this example one step further, Hinman posed a hypothetical: What if a startup with TurnKey's eventual model existed three years earlier, without a mature network or functional token?  If this hypothetical startup sold its token ""in amounts that did not correlate to its use case but resembled funding,"" that token would look like a security.  However, if three years later, that startup went to the SEC and showed that its token demonstrated utility aspects, the SEC may be willing to work with the company, Hinman said, adding:  “We’d likely be able to work our way through a no-action letter.”  Stephen Palley, an attorney with Anderson Kill who attended the forum, told CoinDesk that, in his view, Hinman was indicating that a token which resembled an investment contract could turn into something akin to a utility token.  Moreover, Palley said, it was interesting that the SEC has indicated it is using its framework to make this sort of determination.  In his remarks, Hinman noted that the SEC's actions to date have been conducted in accordance with its existing statutes and rules.  ""I mention this to show the flexibility of the regulatory framework we are working under,"" he said.

The legislation amending the Payment Services Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act was formally enacted on May 31 and will take effect in April of next year.  Among the notable changes, the act does away with the definition of “virtual currency” and replaces it with the broader term “cryptographic assets.”  Further, any company even storing cryptocurrency will be considered a “cryptographic asset exchange” and thus required to register and maintain what experts believe will be an expensive license.  “Smaller companies will need abundant funds if more stringent management systems are required. It may be impossible to maintain existing business unless it changes,” said Masahiro Yasu, CEO of ALIS, token-based social media system that will be affected by the change.  The new law, which had been in the works for months, will also limit margin trading in cryptocurrency.

42381993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRCn,1559323842,Bitcoin Shines Amid Wall Street Losses,"Bitcoin decoupled from traditional markets in May, rising more than $3,000.  The cryptocurrency, currently at $8,300 on Bitstamp, is set to end higher for the fourth straight month with 60 percent gains. That is the longest monthly winning streak and the biggest monthly gain since August 2017.  Notably, the leading cryptocurrency by market value has put on a good show despite the losses on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index – a benchmark for global equity markets – is on track to end May with a 6 percent loss.  Other riskier assets – the ones which are sensitive to economic growth prospects – are also flashing monthly losses, as seen below.  Both copper and brent oil, the barometers of global economic activity, have dropped 9 percent and 11 percent, respectively this month. The Chinese Yuan has also shed 2 percent.  Investors have clearly sold risk in May, possibly due to the re-escalation of the US-China trade war and the resulting fears of a global economic recession.  The flight to safety has boded well for traditional safe haven assets. For instance, gold is reporting a 1 percent monthly gain and the US 10-year treasury yield is down 13 percent or 43 basis points (bond prices and yields move in opposite directions).  The gains in the traditional safe havens, however, appear lackluster when compared to bitcoin’s 60 percent rise. That said, it is still too early to conclude that BTC is the new safe haven.  This is due to the fact that up until now, BTC has moved mostly in line with the risk assets, as seen in the above chart. For instance, BTC is up 127 percent on a year-to-date basis. The S&P 500 and other major risk assets are also reporting year-to-date gains.  Also, BTC largely mimicked the price action in the equity markets in 2018.  BTC's reputation as digital gold will be solidified if it continues to post solid gains during bouts of risk aversion, if any, in the coming months.

42381999,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRGZ,1559312424,EY Open-Sources 'Nightfall' Code for Private Transactions on Ethereum,"One of the world's largest consultancy firms has released a new set of protocols for enabling private transactions atop the ethereum blockchain.  The project, dubbed ""Nightfall,"" by Ernst & Young (EY) was released on GitHub Friday.  The goal, according to the code's description on GitHub, is to provide a means for transacting on ethereum with ""complete privacy."" As it states:  ""Nightfall integrates a set of smart contracts and microservices, and the ZoKrates zk-snark toolkit, to enable standard ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens to be transacted on the Ethereum blockchain with complete privacy. It is an experimental solution and still being actively developed.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the freely-available code is aimed at helping corporate EY clients use the ethereum blockchain for use cases that include supply chain management, food tracing, and transacting between different corporate branches.  Nightfall leverages a well-known technology in the crypto space known as zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs, put simply, allow for the sharing of information proofs between untrusted parties without revealing the information itself.  Putting ZKPs to work  As explained by Jonathan Rouach – CEO of privacy-focused blockchain application QEDIT – it's similar to showing someone Waldo exists on a picture without revealing where on that picture he is located. The popular children's activity book ""Where's Waldo"" requires users to locate a key figure in a crowded image.  ZKPs make such a matter possible using a combination of information theoretics and cryptography, Rouach explained during an address at Consensus Construct 2019.  First introduced in the late 1980's, ZKPs not only separate information from data but also duly prove information without revealing data. It is currently being used by cryptocurrency projects such as Ligero and Zcash to secure on-chain transaction privacy.  QEDIT also uses zero-knowledge proofs to build blockchain-based privacy tools for enterprise clients such as VMWare and RGAX, a subsidiary of Reinsurance Group of America.

EY, in specific, aims to run Nightfall in two of their existing blockchain products called ""EY OpsChain"" and ""EY Blockchain Analyzer,"" according to the firm's global innovation leader for blockchain, Paul Brody.  The EY OpsChain is meant for coding applications on the blockchain for use cases such as procurement, sales, inventory management, and the like.  “We have a second application called the Blockchain Analyzer and that’s really to help understand what we did on a blockchain,” explained Brody to CoinDesk. “It’s primarily used by our audit teams to match transactions between public or private blockchain networks and ERP systems and other enterprise systems for audit purposes.”  Now, with the Nightfall code publicly released on GitHub, Brody notes that other developers outside of EY and their clientele can further iterate and build systems leveraging the new protocol.  Brody told CoinDesk:  ""We're trying to put together an entire suite of capabilities that would include audit and security [and] would allow an enterprise to say yes we are comfortable that we can do secure, private, reliable and regulatory compliant business transactions on a public blockchain network.""

42402937,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtOt,1559304039,Coinbase Adds Support for EOS Cryptocurrency on Retail Site and Apps,"Coinbase has added support for the EOS cryptocurrency for its retail customers.  The exchange announced in a blog post on May 30 that the option would be available on Coinbase.com and its Android and iOS apps, allowing users to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or just store EOS. The token was added to its Pro platform back in April.  While the EOS option is now available for customers in ""most"" of Coinbase's served jurisdictions, the U.K. and the U.S. state of New York are not included initially. ""Additional jurisdictions may be added at a later date,"" said the company.  In the post, Coinbase describes EOS, saying:  ""EOS is a cryptocurrency designed to support large-scale decentralized applications. There are no fees to send or receive EOS. Instead, the protocol requires EOS to use resources like RAM, CPU, and network bandwidth. It also rewards the entities that run the network periodically with new EOS, effectively substituting inflation for transaction fees.""  The addition of the token comes after Coinbase said last September that it would more quickly add new cryptocurrencies, at the time releasing a new listing process for crypto assets.  In December, it published a list of 30 assets it planned to list in the future, including EOS. That arose from a new policy of revealing future listings long before launch, likely to avoid accusations of insider trading as happened when it added bitcoin cash in November.  According to CoinMarketCap data, EOS has seen a price bump in the last several days, though this appears to broadly align with the general market movements for top cryptocurrencies. There's also been speculation that EOS developer Block.One may announce notable news on June 1.  At time of writing, EOS is trading at $7.66, down 5.3 percent over the last 24 hours.

42402958,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddted,1559302238,Bitcoin Price Looks Poised for Pullback But June Could Revive Rally,"View  Bitcoin fell $1,100 on Thursday, creating a bearish candle on the daily chart and confirming a bearish divergence of a key indicator.  Prices risk falling to the 30-day moving average (MA), currently at $7,342, in the next few days.  The pullback could be short-lived, as BTC tends to perform well in June, and the long-term bull case is still intact.  The case for BTC extending its four-month winning streak in June would weaken if the price finds acceptance below the 30-day MA.  Bitcoin is teasing short-term bearish reversal at the onset of the historically good month of June.  The premiere cryptocurrency is currently trading at $8,300 – down 4.5 percent on a 24-hour basis – after having hit a new 12-month high of $9,097 on Thursday.  The rise above the psychological level of $9,000 was short-lived, as expected, with prices falling back to $8,600 by 16:15 UTC. The cryptocurrency went on to hit an intraday low of $8,000 before printing a UTC close at $8,378.  The sudden $1,100 pullback from one-year highs ended up engulfing the price action seen in the previous three trading days – a sign of buyer exhaustion.  Further, prices closed below the key support of $8,390 (May 16 high), invalidating the bullish higher high established above that level on May 26.  The price pullback looks to have legs, as trading volumes on Bitstamp doubled on Thursday as prices dropped. BTC, therefore, could remain on the defensive in the first week of June.  However, the bulls may get a boost, as historical data shows the cryptocurrency tends to do well in the final month of the second quarter.  BTC has scored gains in June in five out of the last seven years.  Prices fell 14.77 percent last year, snapping the three-year June winning run.  The 27.85 percent price rise seen in 2012 is bitcoin’s best June performance to date.  Daily chart  BTC created a “bearish outside day” candle on Thursday, which occurs when the day begins on a positive note but ends with pessimism.  That candlestick pattern is widely considered an early sign of bullish-to-bearish trend change, especially when it appears after a prolonged rally.  Traders usually wait for a strong follow through – preferably a UTC close below the bearish candle’s low – before adopting a bearish bias.  The focus, therefore, is on $8,000 (Thursday’s low). Acceptance below that level will likely invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a deeper drop, possibly to the historically strong support of the 30-day moving average, currently at $7,342.  With the relative strength index (RSI) reporting bearish divergence – lower highs as opposed to higher highs on price – and volumes rising sharply, a break below $8,000 looks likely.  While the odds are stacked in favor of a deeper correction, the cryptocurrency could still manage to eke out gains in June for the fifth straight month if the 30-day MA reverses the pullback.  The cryptocurrency has charted higher lows along the 30-day MA throughout the rally from $3,500 to $9,000.  Also, the case for a drop to the 30-day MA at $7,342 would weaken if the support at $8,000 holds ground over the weekend. In that case, BTC could rise back to $9,0oo.

42402936,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtNu,1559298057,Blockchain Adds PAX Stablecoin to Mobile Wallet,"One of the cryptocurrency industry’s most popular wallet providers, Blockchain, is adding support for the dollar-pegged stablecoin PAX to its mobile wallets this week as part of a broader strategy to grow usage.  The general manager of Blockchain’s wallet product, Xen Baynham-Herd, told CoinDesk the company eventually plans to enable fiat redemptions as well, through upcoming partnerships. Charging small fees on such swaps is how the startup turns a profit.  “Doing the stablecoin project here with PAX is a really big deal because it’s not just that we are adding a new asset, it’s adding a true dollar balance into the wallet,” Baynham-Herd said of the company’s first stablecoin integration, adding:  “Anyone with an internet connection can download a wallet and get USD funds, essentially. … People everywhere can now have access to all sorts of assets the same way they can access all sorts of information.”  By Monday, users will already be able to swap assets like bitcoin, ether or stellar for PAX within the wallet itself.  While Baynham-Herd declined to say when fiat and traditional assets might be scheduled to arrive, demand for such offerings is already starting to percolate. PAX issuer Paxos, a New York-based startup, also has a commodities-focused operation near Blockchain’s London headquarters.  Paxos CEO Chad Cascarilla told CoinDesk the company's blockchain-based precious metals trading system has already settled $700 billion worth of trades with 55 institutions since it launched roughly 10 months ago. In the near future, Paxos will also launch a new, gold-pegged asset called Pax Gold, which can be redeemed for physical bars of gold from a London warehouse.  Baynham-Herd said Blockchain is open to exploring options like Pax Gold, in addition to other stablecoins beyond PAX, because it will allow traditional assets to transcend national borders the way bitcoin already does. Such partnerships could have widespread implications for retail users.  Stepping back, Blockchain’s wallets account for 22 percent of all on-chain bitcoin transactions, according to a tweet by Blockchain CEO Peter Smith. Yet the ways Blockchain collects demographic information about these transactions is considered, by some, to be controversial.  Global distribution  Baynham-Herd said there are roughly 38 million wallet signups and millions of active monthly users, more than half of whom are located outside the United States. Baynham-Herd said Russia, Nigeria, Brazil and Argentina are home to some of the company’s largest user bases.  Like many wallet providers, Blockchain wallets aggregate IP information based on the users’ internet connection. Blockchain also provides optional know-your-customer (KYC) verification for users who want in-wallet trading capabilities or access to perks like the stellar airdrop last November. The company says it now verifies ""tens of thousands of KYC users per day.""  Bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer told CoinDesk he would prefer Blockchain to prioritize Tor integrations and encourage users to do KYC with new accounts instead.  ""Potentially linking years of bitcoin activity to real-world identity just to get $5-worth of stellar doesn't bode well for the privacy of end-users,” Wertheimer said.  Speaking to this criticism, Baynham-Herd said: “We only collect very minimal information on users.”  In the meantime, a company spokesperson said Blockchain is hiring aggressively, growing from roughly 60 employees to around 150 over the past year and looking for nearly 50 more positions this summer.  “We’re always hiring,” Baynham-Herd confirmed, adding:  “Engineers, product, trading-related positions, the whole spectrum.”  Blockchain CEO Peter Smith image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | AIRDROP,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/31/blockchain-adds-pax-stablecoin-to-mobile-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/838e6b5c37e8df886346945d27a0730a2e405ed8-1500x853.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402941,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtSp,1559295068,Collapsed Crypto Exchange Cryptopia Owes Creditors $2.7 Million: Liquidators,"The liquidators of failed New Zealand crypto exchange Cryptopia have released their first report on the firm's financial situation, revealing that it owes over US$2.738 million to creditors.  The appointed liquidator Grant Thornton New Zealand published its report Friday, saying that 69 unsecured creditors are owed at least $1.37 million and secured creditors over $912,000, with an expected deficit of $1.63 million. Secured creditors include Dell NZ and Coca Cola Amatil (NZ).  Staff at the firm are owed $207,000 for outstanding salaries and holiday pay, as well as $177,000 in unsecured debt.  Grant Thornton said that the amount owed to unsecured creditors is likely to rise.  Cryptopia was hit by a major hack in mid-January resulting in “significant losses.” A blockchain data analytics firm estimated after the hack that as much as $16 million in ether and ERC-20 tokens could have lost. It later restarted trading services amid banking issues, and finally went into liquidation and suspended trading operations earlier this month.  The liquidators report said that, though Cryptopia had restarted trading, volumes ""were insufficient for the Company to meet its debts as they fell due and it was decided the appointment of liquidators was in the best interests of customers, staff and other stakeholders.""  Earlier this week, Grant Thornton filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. to preserve Cryptopia data stored and hosted on servers with an Arizona-based firm.  The amount owed to customers is still unclear. Grant Thornton said:  ""The Company held cryptocurrency in wallets by cryptocurrency and has a database detailing the customer transactions and balance allocated to each customer. We are currently gaining access to the database to undertake a reconciliation of the holdings against the customer balances. Until the user balance database is reconciled with the crypto-asset wallets operated by the company, we cannot confirm the value of Customer holdings. ""  At time of liquidation, the exchange possessed $691,229 in cash, but had a loan of around $150,000, the liquidator added. It also had fixed assets with a face value of over $1.3 million, although the value that would likely be recoverable is more likely around $242,000.  Cryptopia's tax liabilities are still unknown, as New Zealand's tax authority was carrying out an audit when the firm filed for liquidation.  The effort to recover the cryptos lost in the hack is ongoing by local police, with the liquidators also enlisting the help of former staff.  ""This involves gaining access to the company's crypto-assets wallets and transferring them to secure cold storage where available,"" the report said.

42402953,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtah,1559289638,A Crypto-Friendly Puerto Rico Bank Is Crowdfunding on Circle's SeedInvest,"A new financial institution is preparing to open its doors for crypto startups in the U.S., and raising capital in an unorthodox manner.  Founded by two Russians and an American with finance backgrounds, Arival Bank (with one “r”) is waiting for an International Financial Entity (IFE) license from regulators in Puerto Rico before it can launch.  In the meantime, San Juan-based Arival is about to kick off an equity crowdfunding campaign on two platforms: SeedInvest, recently acquired by crypto exchange Circle, and Crowdcube in the U.K. The campaign is scheduled to start in early June with a goal to raise $3 million (all in fiat), SeedInvest associate Samuel Lawson told CoinDesk.  Explaining why Arival is raising money this way, COO Jeremy Berger said:  “It’s important for us to get the public involved, not just as investors but supporters of our vision. We need their feedback to drive the way we flesh out our tech, for example. It builds a real word of mouth presence and we hope it’ll bring significant impact on customer acquisition.""  Arival plans to approach traditional VC investors for an eventual Series A round, Berger added.  Founders Slava Solodkiy, Igor Pesin and Berger came up with the idea for Arival after learning how slow and reluctant banks are to cater to startups and the independent contractors native to the gig economy.  “We want to serve clients who are getting rejected by traditional and even digital banks: crypto-related businesses (our first target audience), charity organizations, freelancers from co-working spaces, expats, refugees, residents from e-residency program in Estonia, etc.,” CEO Solodkiy said.  According to Lawson, this is part of what made Arival ""a natural fit"" for the investor base at SeedInvest, which vets startups before listing their equities on its platform.  ""Crypto businesses and other SMBs [small and medium-sized business] are underbanked and traditional players are yet to provide this growing part of the global economy a real solution for banking,"" he said. ""Further, by taking a global approach and working to acquire an international banking license, the company fits well into the decentralized crypto model.""  Lawson also noted that Arival's founders previously worked at Singapore venture capital fund Life.SREDA, which invested in a number of prominent digital banks, including Simple and Moven in the U.S., Fidor in Germany and Rocketbank in Russia.  Licensing  Arival applied for the IFE license in August of last year. This license would connect the business to the U.S. Federal Reserve system but is less onerous to obtain than a U.S. bank charter, which can take a year or more.  At the same time, an IFE can serve clients globally, Arival’s chief financial officer Berger explained.  “We want to build a real borderless bank,” Solodkiy said. For clients, this means “you’ll have to be verified once, and after that open with us as many bank accounts as we could provide across different jurisdictions.""  As an IFE, Arival would join the small number of Puerto Rico-based crypto-friendly banking entities, including San Juan Mercantile Bank and Trust, recently launched by Wall Street veteran J. Robert Collins Jr.; Medici Bank, led by a descendant of the Renaissance-era Italian banking family; and Noble Bank, known for once working with the troubled (but systematically important) stablecoin issuer Tether.  However, in February, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York halted approval of new accounts for Puerto Rican offshore banks, citing concerns about expanded U.S. sanctions against Venezuela, Reuters reported.  Solodkiy and Berger told CoinDesk that Arival will only face the Fed account issue when they have their IFE license at hand, and while they are waiting for one, they hope the crackdown period will end.  Meanwhile, Arival started the application process for a banking license in Lithuania in December. It also envisions opening branches in the U.K., Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Dubai and Australia.  Virtual and real  Once licensed as an IFE, Arival would serve as a hub for clients to connect to a network of banks and lending marketplaces via a single app. Again, part of the value proposition is removing duplication of effort.  “You need to be verified only once by us, and do not need to provide the same package of docs and answers for each standalone service, you can see and manage everything from the same window,"" Solodkiy said.  Potential clients include crypto exchanges and wallet services, ICO-backed startups, funds and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, Solodkiy said. Berger said Arival has nearly 700 prospective customers on its waiting list.  Arival intends to be fully accessible online, with a totally electronic document flow and no need for clients to go to a physical branch to open an account. Client companies will be able to connect to Arival via its open API.  The company will also offer services for other fintech startups to build up their compliance, Solodkiy says, calling this arrangement “compliance-as-a-service.”  Nevertheless, Arival also hopes to interact with its customers face-to-face.  Solodkiy and Pesin previously co-founded a fintech accelerator called InspiRussia, which a year later was acquired by Qiwi, an e-payment company and a blockchain pioneer in Russia, and they hope their new venture can foster a similar vibe.  “We also want to have our office as a co-working space for our clients and fintech and blockchain startups that are planning to work with us,” Solodkiy said.

42402940,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtTo,1559275215,What to Expect at the SEC's Blockchain Forum Friday,"At a fraught moment for government-industry relations, U.S. regulators and cryptocurrency insiders are sitting down for a public meeting.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will convene its first FinTech Forum Friday at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C., discussing a range of issues related to digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT). The speaker roster includes a dozen legal, financial and technical experts, as well as several key SEC officials.  Yet while some see an opportunity to air the industry’s concerns and get a better understanding of the SEC’s perspective, the forum comes at a time when some major crypto firms are taking a more aggressive tack.  Most notably, crypto startup Circle said this month it had laid off 30 of its employees, blaming “an increasingly restrictive regulatory climate in the United States” as one factor.  In a subsequent blog post, Circle said the SEC, at the very least, had issued confusing, if not contradictory guidance. The firm cited a speech last year by Director William Hinman, which emphasized decentralization as a key factor in determining whether a token is a security, and a more recent framework, which did not mention decentralization.  Messaging platform Kik has also recently made headlines with a $5 million fund to “defend crypto” from regulatory overreach. The crowdfunding campaign – which individuals can donate to using cryptocurrencies – is aimed at helping companies (including Kik) fight court cases against the SEC, should the regulator sue them for securities violations.  The regulator sent Kik a so-called Wells Notice in November 2018, notifying the company that SEC staffers believe it violated securities laws when it raised $98 million in a token sale for its kin cryptocurrency. Kik CEO Ted Livingston has said the company spent about $5 million communicating with the regulator since then.  Circle, Kik and others say a lack of clarity from the SEC about what is and is not a security is hurting the industry and holding back innovation in the U.S.  But it does not appear as though this uncertainty will be resolved on Friday, given the lineup and agenda, not to mention legal limits on what the SEC can do.  A seat at the table?  One individual familiar with the SEC’s forum told CoinDesk that they were concerned by the list of panelists for the forum.  While many of them are experts in their respective fields, few are from actual crypto startups – or firms that would immediately benefit from greater clarity.  “There’s no broker-dealer here, maybe Fidelity will say they want to be a qualified custodian but there’s no qualified custodian here,” this person said, referring to David Forman from Fidelity Brokerage Services, who will speak on the panel about trading and markets. “There’s no entity that would be subject to the regulations of the SEC at issue.”  Referring to the panelists from Deloitte and Ernst & Young, the individual stated:    “I know having a big four accounting firm is important to [SEC chairman] Jay Clayton … but it’d be nice to have an investment manager talking, since it’s the investment manager considerations.”            Kevin Werbach, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, countered that “It’s impossible to come up with an agenda for an event like this that represents everyone in the industry.”  “There will always be some perspectives that are insufficiently represented,” said Werbach, who will speak at the forum. “I’m sure the SEC thought hard about whom to invite in order to get the best discussion of the issues they’re most concerned about.”  Werbach also noted that startups can engage with Finhub – the SEC’s fintech-focused wing – through other means as well.  Open dialogue  Still, the mere fact that the SEC is engaging with the crypto industry at all is promising, said lawyer Jay Baris of Shearman & Sterling.  Baris, who is a panelist at the SEC’s forum, said the agency is “reaching out and saying ‘talk to us,’ and I think that’s a good idea.”  The SEC is opening a two-way communication flow: market participants are able to express their views, but the SEC is also able to explain why it is approaching regulation the way it is, he said.  Another panelist, John D’Agostino of DMS Governance, a provider of services to investment funds, said the industry should pay attention to the topics chosen by the SEC for the agenda (capital formation; trading and markets; investment management; and industry trends for DLT).  Baris added:  “This is not structured as a legal forum, but as a forum for information sharing.”  IBM’s Christopher Ferris echoed the sentiment, telling CoinDesk that his panel would be forward-looking, and would focus more on where the crypto space may be headed from a technology or use case perspective.  Actual action  In any event, calling on regulators to clarify rules around crypto may not be the best avenue for the industry.  Margaret Rosenfeld, a partner at K&L Gates LLP, told CoinDesk via email that regulators in the U.S. are reliant on what is already outlined in existing statutes and law.  “We need to understand that these U.S. regulators … cannot forge new pathways in the law,” she said. “The appropriate government authority for all of us to be calling on for clarity at this point is Congress.”  Circle’s blog post concurred. The company said it had been educating policymakers both within the U.S. and other jurisdictions about “why digital assets represent a fundamentally new class of financial instrument.”  Congress needs to pass laws directly addressing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, lest the U.S. be left behind by other nations, the blog post said. However, until new laws are passed, Circle said it intends to continue advocating before regulators.  As such, Werbach said, “anything that gives the regulators more direct exposure to thoughtful representatives of the industry, and vice versa, is likely to be productive.”  He concluded:  “There is plenty of one-on-one contact between both sides, but a comprehensive public event like this provides an opportunity to evaluate the big picture.”  SEC Chairman Jay Clayton image via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/31/what-to-expect-at-the-secs-blockchain-forum-friday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9e378be03fa7dc063084a28e25c241de3010f22-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402954,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtde,1559269294,North Korean Hackers Target Crypto Exchange UPbit's South Korean Users,"North Korean hackers have allegedly attacked users of South Korean exchange UpBit with a clever phishing exploit.  According to data released by the security company East Security, the hacker attempted a cyberattack by sending a phishing e-mail on May 28. The subject of the mail suggested that UPbit needed more information regarding a fictional sweepstakes payout for tax purposes. The mail did not come from the exchange but from another server outside of South Korea.  The email contained a file claiming to contain documentation for the payout. According to East Security, running this file displayed what looked like a normal document but would activate malicious code. It would then send data about the user's machine as well as exchange logins to the hackers and then connect the machine to a command-and-control system for later remote access.  ""In analyzing attack tools and malicious codes used by hacker groups, there are unique characteristics we saw,"" said Mun Chong Hyun, head of the ESRC Center at East Security. He noted that these are similar to another attack called Operation Fake Striker that attacked Korean government agencies earlier this month.  The hackers also used the same techniques in January to target reporters, though this seems the first attack by the suspected group on a crypto firm.  ""As bitcoin prices rise, more and more people are using exchanges. What this means to the hackers is that the number of targets have increased, and so have the chances of stealing cryptocurrencies stored in the exchanges,"" said Mun Chong Hyun.  In a clever move, the hackers password-protected the malicious file with the word ""UPBIT."" This means that traditional anti-virus tools would not be able to detect the malicious code.  ""We have not heard of any reported damage,"" noted Mun Chong Hyun. ""In order to avoid cyber attacks, you should not install or click suspicious files or documents.""
