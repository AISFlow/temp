30876221,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629552,1720827049,"Is Ethereum (ETH) About To Retest $4,000? Analyst Foresees 3x Rally","Amid the market slowdown, crypto analysts believe Ethereum (ETH) might be ready to retest key resistance levels again. Meanwhile, investors are expectant about the second-largest cryptocurrency performance as the final approval of spot ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) approaches. Related Reading: TrumpCoin (DJT) Surges 55% After News Of Trump’s Participation In Bitcoin 2024 Conference Is Ethereum ETFs Approval Already Priced In? The upcoming approval of spot Ethereum ETFs has crypto investors speculating about the launch’s impact on ETH’s performance. Renowned investor Daan Crypto Trades believes the news about the S-1 form approval won’t affect Ethereum’s price. Per the trader, the announcement will play out like the 19b-4 approval news in May. Nearly two months ago, the rumors about the ETH ETFs decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fueled Ethereum’s rally. The ‘king of altcoins’ surged over 30% in anticipation, going from $3,000 to $3,900. However, the token’s price did not see any further impact after the official announcement. To Daan, the SEC’s approval won’t be bullish or bearish as it is “99%+ priced in.” The analysts added that “the real test will be the actual flows once the ETFs are live.” Moreover, the trader considers the market will see a lot of Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) outflows, but not “as bad as we saw with GBTC.” Regarding the demand for the Ethereum ETFs, the crypto investor affirmed that 20% of spot BTC ETF inflows are expected. The expectations will be that it’s anywhere from 10-30% of what BTC got in terms of inflows. I think ~20% is a pretty safe estimate. Anything higher would obviously be a nice surprise. ETH doesn’t need as many flows as BTC does to make it move after all. The market cap is 1/3th and there’s a lot of supply locked up in staking/defi products etc. Pretty thin market compared to BTC. ETH 3x Rally In The Next Year Crypto analyst Jelle considers that ETH could soon be able to retest key resistance levels. The second-largest cryptocurrency is “reclaiming the 200-day EMA, with the ETFs approaching fast.” Per the post, If ETH successfully holds this level, the cryptocurrency could test the $4,000 mark. The analyst expects Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in the following weeks. To him, the flagship cryptocurrency will have a “boring next few weeks” moving sideways. Jelle also affirmed that investors are not “ready for it to melt faces,” commenting on those who doubt ETH. “Every cycle, people give up on ETH, saying it’s ‘dead tech’ – only to be proven wrong again,” he said.

30872805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629510,1720821638,Bitcoin Recovery Stalls As HODLers Apply Selling Pressure,"On-chain data shows that Bitcoin long-term holders have potentially been selling recently, something that may explain BTC’s continued bearish momentum. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow CDD Has Registered Huge Spikes Recently As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained, old cryptocurrency tokens have recently been deposited in large quantities in centralized exchanges. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD).” A “coin day” refers to a quantity that 1 BTC accumulates after staying dormant on the blockchain for 1 day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Forced Weak Hands Into Largest Loss-Taking Since 2022 Lows: Report When a coin that had been sitting still inside a wallet is finally moved, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days it had been carrying before the move are said to be “destroyed.” The CDD keeps track of the total amount of coin days being reset in this manner across the network. In the context of the current topic, though, the general CDD isn’t the one of focus, but rather the Exchange Inflow CDD, which only keeps track of the coin days being destroyed through transactions into wallets connected to exchanges. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow CDD over the past month or so: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow CDD has registered some spikes of considerable scale this month. This would imply that many dormant coins have recently seen deposits into exchanges. Generally, spikes in the CDD correlate to movement from the long-term holders (LTHs), as these HODLers tend to accumulate large amounts of coin days. Therefore, the recent spikes in the Exchange Inflow CDD suggest that these diamond hands have been transferred to exchanges. Holders make transactions into exchanges when they want to use one of the services these platforms provide, which can include selling. The chart shows that the spikes earlier in the month had come when Bitcoin had plunged towards its lows, implying that the selling pressure from this cohort may have played a role in the crash. The latest spike, larger in scale than the others, has come while BTC has been trying to start a recovery rally from these recent lows. So far, BTC has had no luck, suggesting that the selling from the LTHs has potentially been holding the coin back. Related Reading: Chainlink Traders Capitulate After 10% Plunge: Bottom Here? It remains to be seen how the Exchange Inflow CDD behaves in the coming days and if any potential further spikes would impede Bitcoin in its path to recovery.

30869222,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629529,1720816212,"Market Strategist Predicts 32% Stock Market Crash, How Will This Affect Crypto?","Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, has predicted that the stock market will experience a significant crash by 2025. His prediction is noteworthy, given the impact that a decline in the stock market could have on the crypto market. Market Expert Predicts 32% Crash In Stock Market Berezin mentioned in an interview that the S&P 500 will decline by 32% and drop to 3,750 by next year. He explained that this downtrend would occur due to a recession in the US, which he predicts could happen at year-end or early 2025. He claimed that the reduction in consumers’ spending is already hinting at this recession as households have no savings to spend and banks are tightening their lending standards. Related Reading: Cardano Sees 1,218% Spike In This Major Metric, Will ADA Price Follow? Berezin also alluded to the rising unemployment rate, which he noted shows that the labor market is weakening and hints at an imminent recession. The market strategist warned that the Federal Reserve’s tightening monetary policy will make matters worse as the Central Bank continues to “drag its feet” in cutting interest rates. A potential decline in the stock market could negatively impact the crypto market, given Bitcoin’s strong positive correlation with the S&P 500 at times. Whenever this happens, Bitcoin’s price, and by extension, the broader crypto market, is known to move in the same direction as the stock market. Furthermore, based on Berezin’s analysis, a recession could have the same impact on the crypto market since consumers will have less to invest in Bitcoin and altcoins, which could cause trading volumes to dry up and lead to price declines for these crypto tokens. The crypto market has also shown that it is not immune to macroeconomic factors, considering how it has reacted to the Fed’s decision not to reduce interest rates just yet. Some Positive For Bitcoin And The Crypto Market The US June Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data was released on July 11. It provided a positive for Bitcoin and the crypto market, showing that the inflation rate dropped by 0.1% from May and put the annual rate at 3%, the lowest over three years. This development has further strengthened the call for the Fed to cut interest rates, as inflation is cooling off in the country. Related Reading: Analyst says Ethereum Will Reach $8,000 ATH, But This Needs To Happen First A cut in interest rates would boost investors’ confidence in investing more capital in risk assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, there is the belief that the Fed could cut interest rates by September if the monthly inflation data continues to show that inflation is slowing in the country. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,000, down almost 2% in te last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

With an eye on a key Fibonacci level, the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $26 billion, is poised for a potential price explosion that could send the XRP price to new yearly highs, coupled with a bullish announcement surrounding the token’s rise since Thursday. XRP Becomes Bridge Asset In $1.2 Trillion Market CoinGecko data shows a notable increase of 50% in trading volume over the past few days, demonstrating the renewed bullish sentiment surrounding the XRP price, along with a significant collaboration announcement with the world’s largest derivatives marketplace, CME Group, which has further strengthened XRP’s position in the market. Related Reading: Litecoin Is A Hub Of Whales: Over $2.85 Billion Of $100,000 Transactions Processed On Thursday, CME Group made a major announcement, revealing that starting July 29, the CME and XRP dollar reference rates and real-time indices will be included in its suite of benchmarks, positioning the token as a bridge asset in a market worth approximately $1.2 trillion. The XRP price has benefited from this announcement, as transparent pricing information is likely to increase liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell XRP tokens, resulting in the current price surge of 4% witnessed in the 24-hour time frame. Additionally, this collaboration may open new doors for creating financial products, such as futures and options based on XRP, providing holders with additional ways to manage risks and maximize their investments. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of blockchain payments company Ripple, which is closely associated with XRP, expressed his enthusiasm for the collaboration, emphasizing the importance of having a trusted benchmark reference rate as a critical step in adopting institutional crypto products. Garlinghouse praised the joint effort between CME Group and CFBenchmarks to create an XRP index, noting that the market has validated the need for such initiatives. Ripple’s CEO stated: First step towards institutional crypto products is to have a trusted benchmark reference rate. Nice to see CME Group and CF Benchmarks collaborate on this for an XRP index. The market has spoken. XRP Price Eyes $1.8 In addition to the news, technical analysis points to further upside for the XRP price if certain conditions are met. Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently noted in a social media post that XRP is testing the $0.462 Fibonacci level, which is key to the token’s prospects and expectations for the continuation of the uptrend. The analyst also spotted two bullish divergences in the price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) numbers as they made higher lows on the weekly XRP/USD chart. This led Dark Defender to believe that if the XRP price breaks and consolidates above this level from today until Sunday, the cryptocurrency could begin a journey towards the $1.88 level, representing a 288% price increase from the current trading level of $0.465.

42390757,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8fAH,1720809701,DePIN Can Power a More Sustainable GenAI Industry,"Most of us don’t think twice when popping something into ChatGPT. We’ve gone from expecting results for “Thai food near me” in a few seconds to itineraries for a two-week food tour around Thailand just as quickly. The end-user experience for this doesn’t feel very different. But from an energy standpoint, a lot has changed.  A ChatGPT search reportedly uses ten times as much power as a Google search query. With the current energy infrastructure already nearing its limits, the GenAI industry is worried about overloading data centers and returning to non-renewable energy sources. Even Open AI’s Sam Altman has called for clean energy to solve the impending GenAI compute crisis.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  Decentralized compute networks offer a promising answer to the GenAI energy question. Leveraging DePIN will encourage technology development, democratize access to powerful resources, and onboard more users into web3. Who says crypto can’t be green?  DePIN’s energy potential  The solution to powering the GenAI explosion could very well be in your home office. Decentralized networks can leverage the power of edge nodes operated from computers and laptops. If a computer meets the minimum hardware requirements, a user can set up the node operating dashboard in a few minutes. The network then uses untapped GPUs to run compute tasks in the background. Decentralized edge computing can also help balance the computational load more effectively. By processing data closer to its source, edge AI reduces latency and enhances efficiency.  DePIN compute networks aren’t only providing new power sources, but also rewarding the power suppliers. At Theta, for example, EdgeCloud node operators earn TFUEL or TNT-20 tokens for completing compute jobs. They can further stake these tokens to help govern and secure the blockchain from EdgeCloud clients. It’s similar to NEAR’s cloud computing for blockchain projects or Flux for dapps. Participants receive tokens to lend their resources to a network.  Decentralized compute networks present a win-win scenario. Node operators can exchange their reward tokens for other assets, and GenAI applications can harness their necessary energy. Through attractive rewards, DePIN also effectively lowers the barriers to web3 entry. And as countless airdrops have shown us, rewards are an easy way to encourage more users to explore and contribute to the ecosystem at large.  Sustainability  Environmentalists will tell you that re-using existing resources is one of the most beneficial climate actions you can take. DePIN protocols apply this idea to computing networks by providing new utility to underutilized hardware. Very few home computers are running at full power 24/7. DePIN repurposes their CPU/GPU and, in turn, reduces the need to manufacture new devices. This approach maximizes available resources while enhancing network efficiency. While the total energy usage might increase due to the higher availability of GPUs, the decentralized model ensures that this energy is used sustainably.  Despite its potential, skepticism from the general public during the DePIN rollout is practically a given. The industry has a lot of work to do before it can prove it’s matured past FTX-level disasters. Environmental concerns around mining are still popular arguments against cryptocurrencies. This means DePIN use cases that protect the climate are incredibly valuable. DePIN providing green solutions for our favorite AI tools is even better. It’s another proof point for DePIN being a solid path toward mainstream adoption.  Democratizing GenAI access  It’s not just an energy question. Access to high-performance GPUs has traditionally been limited to large enterprises. Cloud providers are expensive, and their packages often don't match small business needs. This exclusivity has prevented smaller institutions from leveraging advanced AI tools. It’s a repeat of an all-too-common technology phenomenon – financial barriers ensure those with capital stay in power. GenAI can support breakthroughs from new rare disease treatments to completing crypto transactions. These must not be limited to just a few actors.  Thankfully, DePIN democratizes GPU access by making it affordable and accessible to a broader audience. Universities, startups, and independent researchers can now harness the power of AI without financial concerns. This mission aligns with one of the blockchain community’s main goals of financial inclusion and connecting more people to digital assets.  It also speaks to the power of moving away from centralized providers. Unfortunately, the crypto industry is intimately familiar with the dangerous impact of a single bad actor. Providing more institutions with access to decentralized GPUs prevents an overreliance on a single data center or AI company. If AI penetrates our lives the way experts predict, it’s imperative that no single company has too much say in what this looks like.  The future of DePIN and GenAI  This year’s DePIN summer is also an AI summer. As hundreds of thousands flock to warm destinations with cold drinks, they’ve likely already been aware of AI’s influence. Maybe they had facial recognition at their boarding gate, or perhaps ChatGPT helped them find their dream resort. Behind the scenes, these applications were gathering vast amounts of energy to make our lives easier.  Many don’t realize that DePIN applications will start to pop up just as quickly. We’ll be given more opportunities to monetize our resources, whether that’s CPU, GPU or GPS history. There’s no reason these developments must be at odds with each other. In fact, they should develop in tandem. DePIN can help ensure AI development is energy-efficient and climate-friendly. In the AI age, GPU is the new oil, and we should treat it as such.

42390746,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8eaN,1720808393,Conduct Versus Code May Be the Defining Question in Roman Storm Prosecution,"The core question at the heart of the U.S. Department of Justice's case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm is whether he created software or controlled a service.  Storm's attorneys sparred with prosecutors Friday during a three-hour-long hearing on his motion to dismiss the government's case against him, with Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York questioning both teams about their arguments on this central question.  The DOJ charged Storm – and fellow developer Roman Semenov – with conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiring to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (in other words, conspiring to violate sanctions regulations) last August. Storm pleaded not guilty to the charges and moved to dismiss the case against him in March.  Among the DOJ's charges are allegations that Storm and his fellow developers knew that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and other malicious actors were laundering funds through the mixer, which prosecutors described as a business offering a service. The defense has argued that Storm merely developed privacy software for financial transactions that he released to the world for anyone to use.  In Friday's hearing, defense attorney Brian Klein, of Waymaker LLP, argued that Storm had no control of Tornado Cash after May 2020 – the time period in which the DOJ alleged Storm broke the law through his operating the decentralized mixer.  Keri Axel, also of Waymaker, added that Tornado Cash's user interface did not in itself control the transactions that users sent around.  ""They're not connected to those transactions,"" she said, later adding, ""I don't think we're anywhere close to wilfully providing service to the DPRK.""  This was a theme during the hearing, with the defense repeatedly emphasizing that Storm didn't have control of Tornado Cash's pools, which were immutable, and therefore Storm couldn't be criminally liable for how people used the mixer.  “This is the only [money laundering] case ever where the defendant didn’t have control over the funds. Period,"" he said.  Liability and control  Prosecutor Thane Rehn argued that “any legitimate business” that becomes aware of criminal activity is required to take steps to stop it.  “That’s a lot. I’m not sure what you expected Mr. Storm and his colleagues to do. Should they have shut down Tornado Cash?” Failla asked the prosecution. “How do you saddle him with liability?”  Failla mused on what the tipping point, as she called it, should be for when a service should shut down when it becomes aware that criminals are using it in the process of bad actions  Rehn said “a single transaction” has been known to be enough evidence – Storm, sitting at the defense table, shook his head at this.  If Storm didn’t make a profit, would he have been prosecuted, the judge asked.  No, prosecutors said, there would still be a case: “We could imagine a philanthropic money launderer.”  WhatsApp hypothetical  As Failla considered arguments about whether Storm could be held criminally liable for activity on the software he helped to create, she asked prosecutors whether another software used by criminals – encrypted messaging application WhatsApp – could similarly be blamed for what users did with its technology.  Because WhatsApp is encrypted, it “must know” that one of its major selling points is that criminals can use it without their communications being spied on.  “I don’t see you charging WhatsApp,” Failla said, asking prosecutors what the difference is between the two softwares that makes one liable for criminal activity and another not.  The encryption, Rehn said, means that WhatsApp doesn’t have specific knowledge about what's happening and can’t separate the wheat from the chaff – the criminal from the non-criminal activity.  Failla countered, asking Rehn whether that would change if the Attorney General were to write to WhatsApp, informing them that criminals were using it to evade law enforcement – surely then, she asked, WhatsApp would be “on notice”?  Rehn ultimately argued that activity on WhatsApp – communication – is protected by the First Amendment, whereas it is “certainly constitutional” for the government to make certain requirements of financial institutions.  Document production  The first half of the hearing focused on two other defense motions: a motion to compel the DOJ to produce evidence from other U.S. government agencies and foreign governments, and a motion to suppress the DOJ from seizing certain cryptocurrencies.  The defense wanted the DOJ to produce documents tied to mutual legal assistance in criminal matters treaties (MLAT) from the Dutch government, which recently prosecuted a third Tornado Cash developer, Alexey Pertsev. The defense also wanted the DOJ to ask the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to produce any material they might have.  Klein said the standard for the MLAT material is if the defense has a ""strong sense"" that the material may be helpful, conceding that the team did not necessarily know if the communications would be relevant.  ""It doesn't have to be an actual exhibit, just something that can help us uncover [further evidence],"" he said.  The DOJ argued that communications with a foreign government might have diplomatic sensitivities, and couldn't be shared.  ""The defense's request is entirely speculative,"" said prosecutor Ben Arad.  Klein said he would be happy with redacted documents that omitted any of the diplomatic concerns. He also asked the judge if she could review the materials herself if she was inclined to refuse the defense request.  The DOJ similarly pushed back against the request to have OFAC and FinCEN turn over any materials, saying those agencies are not part of the prosecution.  The judge also seemed skeptical of the defense argument, saying the request seemed to want her to order an end-round against existing case law, which protects agencies not part of prosecutions.  Klein said the DOJ had already turned over a FinCEN report, which he said was tied to the request.  The judge did not make any decisions on Friday, saying she would rule ""promptly"" on the various motions. She also pushed Storm's trial, currently scheduled for September, to Dec. 2. Rehn said he anticipated a roughly two-week trial.  While Judge Failla did not indicate how she would rule, she seemed open to arguments from both parties.  “You might look at this and say it's a very noble message. I might look at it and say it's a haven for criminals,” Failla said. “And we’d both be right.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Nikhilesh De, Cheyenne Ligon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/12/conduct-versus-code-may-be-the-defining-question-in-roman-storm-prosecution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9dc18f06e6607c0a239529fc733f06f9a07b2d84-2783x1565.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390762,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8fuR,1720807790,Fed Might Focus on Weakening Labor Market Rather Than Inflation as It Mulls Rate Cuts: Economists,"Thursday's CPI report showed further signs of cooling prices although inflation is far from the Fed's 2% goal.  However, the Fed might be more focused on the labor market, which could become a threat if it slows down significantly more.  Odds for a rate cut in September have increased to nearly 95%.  Markets, including crypto, briefly rose after Thursday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report which showed that prices cooled more than expected in June, spurring hope among traders that the Federal Reserve could indeed cut interest rates this year.  Even though Friday’s less-closely watched Producer Price Index (PPI) data came in hotter than expected, traders remained confident that the central bank will cut rates in September. Odds for that are currently just under 95%, according to CME’s Fed Watch tool.  The Fed has a dual mandate – to keep prices stable while also promoting maximum employment. A weakening labor market might thus force the Fed to begin easing monetary policy well before inflation returns to its 2% target (June's CPI data showed inflation rising at a 3% year-over-year pace).  The U.S. unemployment rate has increased for three consecutive months to 4.1% in June from 3.8% in March.  “I do believe the labor market is going to be the bigger risk to the economy going forward,” said John Leer, head of economic intelligence at Morning Consult. “While it shows signs of cooling, it remains very strong by historical standards,"" he added. ""It would be a historical anomaly if the Fed manages to successfully engineer a soft landing, i.e., tame inflation without triggering a recession.”  Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the slowdown in the labor market at an appearance on Capitol Hill earlier this week, saying that it is no longer “a source of broad inflationary pressures for the economy.""  “The Fed will be worried that the negative trend may be a turning point for additional weakness in the labor market down the road,” said Olu Sonola, Fitch Ratings' head of U.S. economic research. “Chair Powell did signal earlier this week that the balance of risk between the unemployment rate and inflation is now two-sided and the labor market is now back in balance. This gives them an incentive to start cutting rates sooner than later, now that inflation seems to be back on that path down to 2%.”  Even if the Fed starts to cut rates, this might not be as bullish of a signal as some traders think, 10x Research’s Markus Thielen said, given that investors in a weakening economy might choose to pull money out of risk assets – crypto included – in order to allocate it to safer investments.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/12/fed-might-focus-on-weakening-labor-market-rather-than-inflation-as-it-mulls-rate-cuts-economists,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d04353f3e223fd38f783f7d89740a01da0029c63-5183x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Analyst Upbeat On USTC, Sees Price Soaring Over 300% Ethereum Supply Tightens Up The first sign of this supply gap came earlier this month when an unknown market player moved a staggering 6,400 Ethereum to the Beacon Chain depositor wallet. The Beacon Chain, which checks recently added blocks to the network, is the basis of Ethereum 2.0 This big action suggests that investors might be inclined to lock down their ETH holdings instead of aggressive trading. 🚨 6,400 #ETH (20,015,930 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to Beacon Depositorhttps://t.co/wrOSlw2LaR — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 11, 2024 According to cryptocurrency analysts, this is a blatant sign that a lot of Ethereum users are optimistic about the network’s long-term prospects. They are effectively removing a sizeable chunk of the ETH supply from the market by locking up their coins on the Beacon Chain, which might have a big impact on the asset’s price dynamics. Following this trend, Glassnode data shows that Ethereum 2.0 fresh deposits have recently grown. Key to the next Ethereum 2.0 update, this measure monitors the number of users staking at least 32 ETH to participate in the rewards system on the network. The rising staking activity suggests that the community is rather optimistic about the future of the Ethereum ETF, which is fast approaching. Bullish Momentum Surge Ahead An examination of Ethereum’s exchange inflow and outflow data provides even more evidence in favor of the bullish story. Santiment claims that the network’s exchange outflow has been greater than its influx, which suggests a lessening of sell-side pressure. When ETH is being taken from exchanges more than being deposited, buyers are certainly in power. Together with the rising amount of locked-up coins, this dynamic could provide the perfect environment for an ETH price surge .

Factors contributing to the dip include Mt. Gox repayments and Bitcoin sales by the German government. Solana saw a boost following news of potential spot Solana ETFs to be listed on CBOE. By Zain Vawda Crypto prices have been in somewhat of a free fall over the past two weeks. After several months of stable prices, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has seen its biggest drop since late 2022. It's now trading below the 200-day moving average, causing many short-term holders to face unrealized losses. Bitcoin prices tend to move in cycles, and the latest cycle has similarities and differences from past cycles. Following the collapse of FTX, the market enjoyed approximately 18 months of steady price gains. However, after reaching the $73k ETF high, it entered three months of range-bound trading. Between May and July, the market saw its deepest correction of this cycle, with a drawdown exceeding -26% from the all-time high. A decline of 20% usually signals a bear market, with Bitcoin however some perspective is needed as the moves are usually larger than conventional instruments. Looking at the current Bitcoin downtrend, it is much shallower than previous ones, which could be a sign that the crypto market, thanks to mainstream adoption (Bitcoin ETF), may be normalizing in line with other instruments. This could just be my optimism talking. Let us take a look at the past cycles and downtrends in Bitcoin prices following significant gains. Source: Glassnode German Bitcoin Sales, Mt. Gox Repayments The recent dip in crypto and bitcoin prices may be traced to repayments by Mt. Gox, the former exchange platform. The repayments have added extra supply to the market, coupled with the German Government selling their Bitcoin as well. According to Arkham, on June 25, 2024, the wallet labeled ""German Government ((BKA))"" sold 900 BTC through three separate transactions. The first transaction of 200 BTC was sent to Coinbase, and the second transaction of 200 BTC went to Kraken. A third transaction, involving 500 BTC, was sent to a previously unknown wallet. Despite these transfers, the wallet still holds 46,359 Bitcoin, worth over $2.8 billion. The sale of bitcoin by German authorities coupled with the Mt. Gox repayments have no doubt been a contributing factor to the recent drop in bitcoin and crypto prices. Solana ETF Solana (SOL-USD) was another stellar performer yesterday as news filtered through that spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to get a final decision by mid-March next year after the Chicago Board Options Exchange ((CBOE)) applied on Monday to list ETFs from VanEck and 21Shares. On July 8, CBOE submitted two applications: one for the 21Shares Core Solana ETF and another for the VanEck Solana Trust. The CBOE compared the proposed Solana funds to spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, which the SEC approved earlier this year. They stated that Solana's decentralization, speed, and capacity make it resistant to manipulation that could harm investors. Heatmap of the Crypto Markets for July 9, 2024 Source: TradingView Technical Analysis BTC/USD From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is showing some concerning signs. First, the long-term upward trendline has been broken and retested. Second, a death cross pattern is about to form as the 50-day moving average crosses below the 100-day moving average, signaling bearish momentum despite today's price pullback. The immediate resistance is the 200-day moving average, just above the current price at 58,823. If Bitcoin breaks above this, it could retest the 60,000 level. Beyond 60,000, the next resistance levels are 61,750 and then around 65,000 where the 50 and 100-day moving averages lie. If Bitcoin drops lower, the first support area will be the recent lows around 53,500, followed by the psychological level at 50,000.

Top issuers such as BlackRock with Securitize, Ondo Finance and Superstate are planning to apply, they told CoinDesk.  Maker's governance token (MKR) jumped 5% on the news.  Crypto lending platform MakerDAO, the protocol behind the $5 billion stablecoin DAI, is planning to invest $1 billion of its reserves in tokenized U.S. Treasury products. Top players in the space including BlackRock's BUIDL, Superstate and Ondo Finance are lining up to apply for the proposal.  ""We think this is a very good move from MakerDAO and we are excited to participate with Blackrock's BUIDL,"" Carlos Domingo, CEO of tokenization platform Securitize, BlackRock's issuance partner, said in an email to CoinDesk. ""As the leading tokenized treasury issuer, we will certainly apply.”  ""Superstate's USTB is an ideal partner for MakerDAO,"" Robert Leshner, founder of Superstate, told CoinDesk. ""We're excited that MakerDAO is creating an open process where we can introduce USTB to the community.""  Ondo Finance {{ONDO}}, the $550 million RWA platform, also plans to participate. ""It's a natural fit in our mission of bringing institutional-grade financial products and services to everyone,"" Nathan Allman, founder of Ondo Finance, said in a Telegram message. ""We look forward to participating.""  Maker's governance token {{MKR}} jumped 5% on the news about those issuers' interest in the proposal.  MakerDAO's plan means a significant reshuffle of its reserve strategy as the protocol, one of the first players in decentralized finance (DeFi), ushers into a next era under founder Rune Christensen's Endgame Plan. The protocol has spearheaded crypto's real-world asset (RWA) trend, backing its decentralized stablecoin in part by U.S. government bonds and bills held off-chain with a range of partners.  Read more: Rune Christensen Explains Why He Wants to Remake Maker and Kill DAI  The open competition called ""Spark Tokenization Grand Prix"" to allocate $1 billion to tokenized offerings was announced on Thursday at ETHCC in Brussels, Belgium and also outlined in a Spark SubDAO governance post.  Spark Protocol is a lending platform build on top of Maker, and is ""poised to become the central hub for RWAs on Maker and Ethereum,"" the announcement said. It's led by the Spark SubDAO, a smaller decentralized autonomous organization within MakerDAO.  Applications will open on August 12 with more details about the competition coming in the next weeks, the post said.  The investment will be funded from redirecting reserves from the Clydesdale facility managed by Monetalis and the Andromeda facility by BlockTower, Sebastien Derivaux, co-founder of Steakhouse Financial, a DeFi consulting firm that was also the author of the tokenized treasury proposal.  Monetalis will offboard from MakerDAO after community backlash for failing to present adequate reporting about the reserves in a timely manner.  Big boost for tokenized treasuries  MakerDAO's investment would mean a huge boost for the tokenized real-world asset protocols due to its sheer size.  U.S. Treasuries have been at the forefront of tokenization efforts of digital asset firms and traditional financial institutions alike. These products are attractive for protocol treasuries as a low-risk instrument where they can park their blockchain-based cash and earn a stable yield without leaving the blockchain ecosystem.  The market for these products tripled in a year to $1.85 billion, according to data provider rwa.xyz.  MakerDAO's allocation would mean another 55% growth.  This is not the first similar action, though.  ArbitrumDAO, an ecosystem development organization of Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum, finalized a similar contest called STEP on Thursday to allocate the equivalent of 35 million of Arbitrum's native tokens {{ARB}} – roughly $27 million worth – in tokenized offerings.

42390753,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8fKX,1720800381,Why Blockbuster Games Will Soon Be Built on Modular Appchains,"The AAA gaming space is absolutely massive (“AAA” refers to the biggest games produced by the biggest developers). To put it into context, it is bigger than the movie and music industry combined – almost 300% bigger. The stories are better and stronger, and the overall experience is more satisfying and enriching.  A great example of this is the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 trailer, surpassing 184 million views since December. Large-scale games like GTA have firmly established themselves as a gaming phenomenon and a cultural and economic powerhouse within the entertainment industry.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Week 2024. Jack O’Holleran is the Co-Founder and CEO of SKALE, a gas-less EVM-compatible blockchain designed for Ethereum scaling.  Take Bethesda Game Studios, for instance. The amount of developers behind each game has increased by 266% between Fallout 4 and Starfield. From AAA console games with huge budgets to massive mobile phone virality, there’s parallel growth in the Esports industry and the accompanying revolution in content consumption led by streamers across YouTube and Twitch. The Esports audience has risen to over 640 million – an over 140% increase since 2019. Gaming's entertainment versatility swallows all mediums.  How Web3 Changes the Game  Implementing Web3 technology into the stack would transform the AAA economic model, opening up the marketplaces to a global audience of gamers and enthusiasts who watch more than play and want to participate in the economy. Game companies will not only be able to monetize in their walled garden, but also every global NFT marketplace. In addition to opening up to a wider marketplace, the scope of purchases would skyrocket. Land, assets, cars, skins, gear, and more would be open to buyers, fans, and enthusiasts across the globe.  This all sounds great, but until now, it has not been impactful due to technical complexity, UX friction, and scaling issues. These have been a significant blocker to mass adoption. The answer to this UX and scalability conundrum is implementing an invisible blockchain experience – and here’s how it would look.  Thanks to recent innovations in UX-focused products like wallets, fiat ramps, frictionless compliance tools, and easy-to-use marketplaces, the UX hurdles have been handled. Still, scaling to serve hundreds of millions of smart contracts and daily transactions across one blockchain has been a blocker. Thanks to the help of modular appchains, this global scaling challenge is finally being addressed.  Read more: What Hamster Kombat Did: How Telegram Built a Web3 Gaming Juggernaut  To be clear, this type of game obviously wouldn’t be built on the ETH mainnet and would frankly be too much for any one monolithic chain in its current state. Too much happens in a major global game at one time for the legacy technology of monolithic chains or rollups to handle if a true on-chain gaming experience is desired. This is primarily due to congestion caused by “gas hog” applications or “noisy neighbors.” The only real solution would be a horizontally scalable blockchain coupled with modularity and a gas-free experience for end users.  Modularity Appchains Solve the Noisy Neighbor Problem  The ""noisy neighbor"" problem is a significant hurdle in blockchain networks, where one resource-hungry application can monopolize network resources, causing performance issues and security risks for all users. This issue resembles a loud tenant in an apartment building disrupting the entire complex. In blockchain, a single application consuming excessive resources can create bottlenecks, slow down transactions, and increase latency for everyone sharing the network. This can be particularly problematic with popular gaming or viral AI apps driving up blockspace prices and creating network slowdowns.  Modular appchains address these scalability challenges through horizontal scalability and modularity. They offer a solution that enhances the performance and security of decentralized applications by operating as independent blockchain networks within a larger ecosystem. Each appchain functions like a soundproof apartment, ensuring that a disruptive application on one chain doesn't affect others.  Read more: David Z Morris - 5 Blockchain Games: What Works and What Doesn't  Each modular appchain has its own dedicated computational power, storage, and bandwidth, preventing any single application from hogging resources and maintaining balance across the network. Despite their independence, these appchains inherit security properties from the entire network of nodes, providing robust protection similar to a high-security building where each apartment benefits from overall security measures.  Modular appchains also support seamless chain communication, allowing applications to interact, bridge, and share data securely with zero fees. This ensures that while residents enjoy privacy, they can still collaborate and share information when needed.  The Web3 industry is now equipped with the technology to support the next generation of AAA gaming, aiming for an “Invisible web3 Experience” where players simply engage with games in a global marketplace without concern for the underlying technology. This creates a win-win scenario, generating more revenue for games and offering a superior experience to players with enhanced transparency, trustlessness, and true asset ownership.  The infrastructure is ready –– the next step is the arrival of big games.

Analyst Identifies Where BTC Is In This Cycle","In March, Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $73,000, sparking debates amongst market watchers and analysts about whether the cryptocurrency has hit its top this cycle. However, a crypto analyst has provided an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s recent price movements and future outlook, suggesting that the pioneer cryptocurrency still has substantial upside momentum ahead. Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Reached Second Early Cycle Top On July 11, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CryptoCon,’ took to X (formerly Twitter) to share insights into Bitcoin’s price movements based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) Bollinger Band % phases. The analyst disclosed that Bitcoin’s RSI Bollinger % Band phases were one of the few technical indicators which offer unparalleled accuracy in identifying truecycle tops for Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Analyst says Ethereum Will Reach $8,000 ATH, But This Needs To Happen First The RSI Bollinger % Band is a unique technical tool used to confirm a trend’s relative strength and determine the direction of a current trend. In his post, CryptoCon disclosed that the RSI Bollinger % Band phases had successfully distinguished the initial April double tops of 2013 and 2021, pinpointing the final true top for both bull cycles. Sharing a price chart of Bitcoin’s historical price movements from 2010 to 2015, CryptoCon highlighted several phases in each bull cycle that led to a true price cycle top for Bitcoin. The analyst indicated five distinct phases for Bitcoin – the bear market breakout, the first cycle breakdown recovery, the second early top, the time High (ATH) break and the cycle top phase. Based on these phases, CryptoCon believes that Bitcoin has completed the third phase of its current market cycle which is the “second early top.” The analyst revealed that the cryptocurrency achieved this phase by crossing the red 0.99 value-line for the third time in March 2024 when Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high above $73,700. CryptoCon noted that Bitcoin’s rise to the second early top phase suggests that the cryptocurrency’s recent price movements will not be able to firmly push it above new all-time highs. He highlighted that this significant move to rise above ATHs is expected to occur in phase four, where Bitcoin will hit its “all-time high break.” BTC Nears Cycle Top With Two Phases Left Looking ahead, CryptoCon has disclosed that despite Bitcoin’s rise to a second early top in March and its recent downward price movements, the cryptocurrency still has two phases left to witness the best price action in this market cycle. The analyst disclosed that the market has already hit critically low levels of RSI Bollinger % Bands, typically seen at each cycle bottom, and even the 2020 Bitcoin crash. Related Reading: Forbes Says Shiba Inu Price Will Rise 1,700% To Reach $0.0003 ATH, Here’s When With just two phases left, Bitcoin could break into its highest level, potentially surpassing its initial $73,700 all-time high.

According to analytics company Chainalysis, traditional money launderers – criminals working outside crypto – may be moving their cash on-chain too.  Released Thursday, Chainalysis' latest report on crypto money-laundering shines a light on an apparently flourishing world of on-chain money transfers that aren't definitively illicit but nevertheless share the characteristics of transactions that would raise eyebrows in banks.  Traditional money launderers are starting to utilize crypto networks to create ""large-scale money laundering infrastructure"" to clean cash that originated outside of crypto, Chainalysis Head of Research Kim Grauer told CoinDesk.  These transfers don't originate from the crypto scams, thefts and ransomware attacks that Chainalysis is famous for flagging on the blockchain, the transparent digital ledger of all crypto transactions. Their software and labeling systems help crypto exchanges and other entities avoid accepting funds from criminal activity and assist government investigators in tracking suspects down.  By contrast, this more opaque class of transaction comes from wallets that aren't known to be illicit. And yet they flow across blockchains and into exchanges following strategies that traditional financial compliance departments would likely flag. For example: splitting into rounded tranches sized just below know-your-customer reporting thresholds, and then sticking them back together later on.  Grauer said most on-chain investigators won't be surprised that this kind of thing has been a potential trouble spot for years. Still, she said the July report is Chainalysis' first attempt to document how big the trend is across the entire blockchain. The company found it was orders of magnitude larger than even the known illicit transaction base.  Indeed, Chainalysis found a glut of transactions valued just below the $10,000 mark – at which point additional know-your-customer rules kick in – when analyzing all transfers sent to exchanges in 2024.  It's worth noting that just because a crypto transaction to an exchange is, say, $1 below the $10,000 threshold, it isn't definitively illicit. But banks and money services businesses in the traditional financial sector have long used heuristics like that to track down criminal activity.  ""Our investigators take many things into consideration when they're determining whether something is suspicious, and this would be one thing – but definitely not enough"" to prove wrongdoing, Grauer said.  Far more telling are transactions that flow to over-the-counter brokers who advertise their willingness to turn criminal crypto into dollars, no questions asked.  ""This is trying to advance the conversation about how we in crypto think about compliance techniques to mirror what was developed in traditional banking,"" Grauer said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/12/traditional-money-launderers-appear-to-be-using-crypto-chainalysis-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6722d54cd32ec69ba17f3991527c0d31b47c58ba-3680x2070.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After peaking in April, the coin has been trending lower, looking at the arrangement in the daily chart. There is strength at spot rates. So far, LTC is up 20% from July lows and continues to peel back losses. The expansion in price also comes amid other positive developments, at least from on-chain developments. Is Litecoin A Whale Haven? According to IntoTheBlock, there has been a significant uptick in on-chain transfers on the proof-of-work network. As of July 12, the network has processed $2.85 billion worth of transactions, each averaging at least $100,000. Related Reading: Spot Ethereum ETFs FOMO: Tron Founder Justin Sun Drops $5 Million On ETH This level translates to over half of the network’s market cap. Most importantly, Litecoin is doing far better than top altcoins. IntoTheBlock data shows that though Dogecoin has roughly 3X the market cap of Litecoin, it only sees $590 million in large transfers daily. The huge difference means Litecoin attracts more whales, most likely drawn to the network’s security and low fees. Litecoin has not changed, and its original mandate of complementing Bitcoin remains. It operates as a proof-of-work network powered by miners who must commit to buying new gear and updating it regularly to be competitive. As of July 13, Litecoin had a hash rate of 1.01 PH/s, according to Coinwarz. Despite Litecoin’s Halving in 2023, more miners are unfazed by falling rewards and continue to secure the network. MWEB Private Transactions Rising, LTC Unfazed By Short-Term Price Fluctuations The spike in Litecoin transactions also comes amid the increasing adoption of Mimble Wimble (MWEB). According to MWEBexplorer data, MWEB transactions have doubled in the past few days. This surge points to a rising preference for private transactions among Litecoin users. Through MWEB, users can send private transactions. Though MWEB transactions are more expensive, coming in at $0.00267 versus $0.0008 for ordinary transactions, it is relatively cheaper than transacting on Bitcoin. According to YCharts, the average Bitcoin transaction fee now stands at $1.487, up from 1.163 recorded yesterday.

The probe's conclusion is another win for the crypto industry in its years-long struggle with the regulator and follows news, reported by Fortune earlier this week, that the agency had ended an investigation into stablecoin issuer Paxos.  ""Based on the information we have as of this date, we do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission against Hiro Systems PBC, formerly known as Blockstack PBC,"" the SEC's division of enforcement said in a letter to Hiro attached to the Friday filing.  The letter contained a boilerplate caveat that such a notice ""must in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff's investigation.""  Hiro makes tools for developers to build apps on Stacks, a layer-2 blockchain that supplements Bitcoin. Stacks is the brainchild of crypto industry veteran Muneeb Ali, who is now CEO of Trust Machines, another builder in the ecosystem, and a board member at Hiro.  In a tweet Friday after the filing came out, Ali wrote that the SEC's probe looked into the Stacks protocol, not just the Hiro entity.  Sufficiently decentralized?  The company, then known as Blockstack, launched the first version of the Stacks chain, with its eponymous token {{STX}}, in 2018. Early on, the company treated the tokens it sold as securities.  It conducted a portion of its token sales under the SEC's Regulation A+, which allows issuers to sell limited amounts of securities to the public without registering. Other tokens were sold under the exemptions for securities sold only to accredited (Reg D) or international (Reg S) investors.  In January 2021, a new version of Stacks launched, with a new consensus mechanism (proof of transfer). To Hiro's mind, the network had become fully decentralized.  In an SEC filing that month, the company said it was no longer providing ""essential managerial services to the Stacks Blockchain,"" and therefore it was no longer necessary to treat Stacks tokens as securities.  Apparently, the SEC was skeptical of that interpretation. In September 2021, Hiro disclosed that it was responding to an inquiry from the division of enforcement.  Friday's filing marks the end of that inquiry and, presumably, the removal of a sword of Damocles that had been hanging over the firm.

30852427,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629491,1720789200,"Cardano Moves Toward $0.4233, Will ADA Maintain Its Uptrend?","Cardano (ADA) lately has been steadily climbing toward the $0.4233 resistance level. This upward movement which has persisted for a while now is raising curiosity among market participants as to whether the crypto asset can continue to maintain its bullish momentum and break through this significant resistance level. Also, Cardano’s recent price performance has showcased its potential for further growth. As ADA continues to maintain its steady upward trajectory, this article delves into exploring this current price action and analyzes technical indicators to determine if the crypto asset can hold its gains and push beyond the $0.4233 resistance mark or face a pullback and begin the drop again. With a market capitalization of more than $14 billion and a trading volume of more than $304 million as of the time of writing, the price of Cardano is currently down by 1.82%, trading at around $0.4008 in the last 24 hours. ADA’s market cap and trading volume are currently up by 1.73% and 41.13% respectively. Assessing ADA’s Potential To Break Through $0.4233 Currently, on the 4-hour chart, the price of ADA is gradually rising with steady momentum and making a move with strong bullish momentum toward the $0.4233 resistance mark. Furthermore, it is evident that the cryptocurrency asset has broken above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The formation of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) also suggests a continued steady bullish rise for ADA’s price toward $0.4233 as the signal line of the indicator has been maintaining a constant movement above 50% and is attempting a move into the overbought zone. On the 1-day chart, although the crypto asset price is still trading below the 100-day SMA, it has been on a steady rise toward the $0.4233 resistance mark. If this upward momentum persists, Cardano could reach this mark and break through it. Lastly, an analytical examination of the formation of the 1-day RSI reveals that Cardano could sustain its bullish momentum and attain the $0.4233 mark as the signal line of the indicator has risen above 50%. Can Cardano Sustain Its Momentum? If Cardano can maintain its current bullish momentum to reach the $0.4233 mark and close above, it may continue to move upward to test the $0.5229 resistance level. When this level is breached, the digital asset may experience further price gain toward the $0.6822 resistance level and possibly other levels above. Conversely, If ADA’s price faces a pullback at $0.4233, it will start to decline once more, heading back toward the $0.3389 support level. Furthermore, Cardano may see further price decline to test the $0.2388 support level and perhaps other levels below if this $0.3389 point is broken.

42417706,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZftl,1720788693,XRP Is the Sole Crypto Major in Green as Bitcoin Bulls Remain Sidelined,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell 2.3% in the past 24 hours to $57,000 after briefly surpassing $59,000 on Thursday. XRP tokens were the only major gainers, rising 5% in the past 24 hours amid favorable developments.  One trader said bulls were likely ""on the sidelines"" amid selling pressure from bitcoin wallets belonging to the German state of Saxony.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} slumped 2.3% in the past 24 hours to pare back Thursday’s brief gains after a spike following the latest U.S. CPI readings, bringing down with it the broader crypto market.  Core CPI for June rose 3.3% versus an expected 3.5%, appearing bullish for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. However, it turned out to be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event with many already anticipating a good report and prices being driven up in the days prior, analysis firm Santiment said in an X post.  BTC briefly traded above $59,000 on Thursday, falling to $57,000 in European afternoon hours on Friday. Losses in major tokens followed as ether {{ETH}} and BNB Chain’s BNB dropped 2.2%, while Solana’s SOL and dogecoin {{DOGE}} lost as much as 5%.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens by market capitalization, fell 2.48%, indicating losses across the market.  Only XRP is in the green among majors with a 5% gain in the past 24 hours, data shows. Such gains came as traditional futures powerhouse CME and CF Benchmarks announced the debut of indices and reference rates for XRP on Thursday, one that Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of closely related blockchain payments firm Ripple, said could boost institutional adoption.  Some traders consider the current price lull to be stemming from market participants remaining “on the sidelines” amid sales pressure from defunct exchange Mt. Gox and the German state of Saxony.  “Bitcoin is back at $57K after a failed assault on $60K on Thursday,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in an email to CoinDesk. “German authorities are actively selling off previously confiscated Bitcoins. This volume is not huge, but some potential buyers prefer to stay on the sidelines, seeing the overhang of sales.”  Kuptsikevich ruled out gains in major tokens until BTC made a move higher. “An altcoin season could only begin when the prices of the largest coins, such as bitcoin, have reached all-time highs and appear overvalued to some,” he said.  The German state of Saxony transferred over $600 million worth of BTC to exchanges on Thursday – moving one of the biggest chunks in weeks.  Arkham data shows that it moved more than 3,000 BTC in early Asian hours on Friday to various exchanges and OTC trading firms, leaving just over 6,000 BTC in its wallets, worth $340 million at current prices.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP | BNB,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/12/xrp-is-the-sole-major-in-green-as-bitcoin-bulls-remain-sidelined,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c58fc7f56689a9fb13c417b5b99c732750052c6-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417725,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZg9F,1720786100,First Mover Americas: BTC Retreats From $60K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded around $57,000 during the European morning, following a pullback from the $60,000 resistance level on Thursday, a decline of 2.4% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) fell 2.3%. Bitcoin climbed above $59,000 on Thursday after the U.S. reported its first drop in consumer prices in four years, a positive sign for the prospect of an interest-rate cut by the Fed. Bitcoin's failure to maintain a sustained rally, despite positive macro news, suggests there is more price weakness ahead.  Iris Energy's Childress, Texas site is well suited for the company's focus on bitcoin mining even if analysts have determined it unsuitable for AI, Bernstein said in a report. IREN shares fell almost 14% on Thursday following a short-selling report by Culper Research which pointed out the site's flaws as a potential hub for AI and high-performance computing (HPC) purposes. “Iris Energy has not claimed it intends to retrofit its bitcoin mining site in Childress to AI,” Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. The broker estimates 65% of the company's value is derived from bitcoin mining and the remaining 35% from AI/HPC. Iris Energy’s current $1 million/megawatt capital expenditure metric is a reflection of bitcoin mining capex, the broker said. Comparing it to AI/HPC capex is not meaningful.  Partior, a blockchain payment joint venture of banking giants JPMorgan, DBS and Standard Chartered, has raised $60 million in Series B funding. The investment was led by Peak XV Partners with contributions from Valor Capital Group and Jump Trading Group. Partior aims to establish unified blockchain-based interbank payment rails for instant clearing and settlement. Using blockchain-based technology to expedite such banking processes is now fairly commonplace. JPMorgan's Onyx network has settled hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions since going live a few years ago. Last month, Fidelity used Onyx to tokenize shares in a money market fund.  Chart of the Day  XRP's bitcoin-denominated price (XRP/BTC) is up for the third straight day and at the highest in two months.  On Thursday, CME and CF Benchmarks announced the debut of indexes and reference rates for XRP and Internet Computer (ICP).  Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs Inc., said the benchmark reference rates will boost institutional adoption.

Tron Founder Buys $5 Million Worth Of ETH In an X (formerly Twitter) post on July 11, Spot On Chain, an AI-driven on-chain analytics platform, uncovered a new Ethereum transaction allegedly executed by Sun. According to the analytics platform, the Tron founder had supposedly spent $5 million to buy 1,614 ETH tokens at an approximate price of $3,097 per ETH. Related Reading: Forbes Says Shiba Inu Price Will Rise 1,700% To Reach $0.0003 ATH, Here’s When Spot On Chain revealed that since February 8, 2024, Sun has purportedly purchased a total of 362,751 ETH tokens at an estimated cost of more than $1.11 billion, with an average price of $3,047 per ETH. This massive ETH transaction was executed via three crypto wallet addresses. Additionally, the analytics platform noted that the Tron founder recently deposited 45 million USDT to Binance, a major crypto exchange, suggesting the possibility of new intentions to buy more Ethereum soon. The crypto founder has often received ETH coins from Binance right after depositing his stablecoin into the exchange. Interestingly, Sun’s newest ETH purchase comes as the FOMO surrounding Spot Ethereum ETFs is growing stronger in the crypto market. Previously in June, Gary Gensler, the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Spot Ethereum ETF trading will officially launch in the summer. As a result, the broader crypto market has been looking forward to the debut of a digital asset that could potentially trigger a major rally for ETH. Before his $5 million ETH purchase, Sun had supposedly recorded a major loss after Ethereum declined by 10% on July 7. Spot On Chain disclosed that the Tron founder may have lost $66 million in the volatile market, erasing the initial $58 million profit he had gained just a day earlier. Ethereum Whales Enter Accumulation Phase Despite the recent declines experienced by Ethereum, the FOMO and excitement surrounding Spot Ethereum ETFs may have triggered a change in market sentiment and investors’ demand for the cryptocurrency. According to prominent crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, Ethereum whales are back to accumulating ETH. The analyst disclosed that the cryptocurrency had witnessed a brief distribution period, potentially triggered by Ethereum’s low market performance and subsequent drop to $3,055 as of writing. In addition to ETH, Bitcoin (BTC) has also declined significantly, plummeting by more than 14% over the past month. Related Reading: Cardano Sees 1,218% Spike In This Major Metric, Will ADA Price Follow? While whales show renewed interest in Ethereum, crypto analysts predict further price declines in the cryptocurrency following the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs. However, as demand for Ethereum ETFs rises and market conditions stabilize, ETH could see its price potentially rising as high as $8,000 this market cycle.

42417715,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZfyv,1720782667,The Bullish Fed Rate-Cut Play in Bitcoin Is Not as Straightforward as You Think,"Thursday's inflation report probably set the stage for the Fed to begin cutting interest rates this year.  While the crypto community expects the first rate cut to kickstart a bull run for bitcoin, the reaction depends on the context in which the bank eases.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) seems increasingly likely to start cutting interest rates this year after yesterday's inflation report, fulfilling crypto bulls' long-standing desire for a more risk-amenable macroeconomic environment.  The consensus in the crypto market community is that rate cuts, likely to begin in September, will boost fiat liquidity, catalyzing demand for riskier investments like bitcoin {{BTC}}.  While that's plausible, markets may have already priced in any easing. Rate-cut expectations have dominated crypto and traditional market sentiment since the second half of 2022 and are among the key catalysts behind bitcoin's surge from 2022 lows near $15,000 to record highs above $73,000 this year. Consequently, the actual rate cut might elicit only a tepid response from the market.  What's likely to be more important is the context in which any interest-rate reduction takes place.  A stimulative effect on asset prices is likely to be more pronounced if a cut comes at a time of low inflation and a thriving economy. One that occurs amid signs of economic fragility might convey a negative signal, prompting investors to rotate money out of riskier assets and into safer ones such as government bonds.  ""If the Fed cuts rates solely due to inflation concerns in September 2024, it could be short-term bullish for bitcoin,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. ""However, if growth concerns drive the cut, either in September or later, bitcoin might face significant selling pressure.""  Historically, bitcoin has gained the most when the Fed pauses its cycle of rate increases, Thielen said. The arrival of the first cut has typically met with a tepid response.  ""During the Fed's pause from rate hikes until July 2019, bitcoin experienced explosive growth, returning +169%. Following a seven-month pause in 2019, the Fed cut interest rates, initiating a steep rate-cutting cycle. Initially, bitcoin responded positively, rallying +19% within a week after the July 31, 2019, rate cut. However, two weeks later, Bitcoin was back to flat,"" Thielen said.  Thielen added that the rate cuts in the second half of 2019 were due to economic uncertainties and weighed over BTC's price. The cryptocurrency's price fell 33% in the second half of the year, CoinDesk data show.  U.S. stocks show a similar pattern.  ""The arrival of a Fed rate cut cycle has tended to coincide with a sizable stock-market drawdown,” Austin Pickle, a strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said last month, according to MarketWatch. “Since 1974, the average drawdown has been roughly 20% over 250 days following the first Fed rate cut.”  Pickle added that the stock market would suffer if the Fed is forced to cut rates in response to macro weakness.  That means crypto traders should be watchful of signs of weakness in the U.S. economy.  According to Fidelity's business cycle tracker, the U.S. economy was in the late stage of expansion at the end of the second quarter. Leading indicators like new orders for consumer goods and materials, consumer sentiment and building permits signaled weakness ahead. Should the weakness become more pronounced in coming months, a rate cut will do little for risk assets, including BTC.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/12/the-bullish-fed-rate-cut-play-in-bitcoin-is-not-as-straightforward-as-you-think,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/838a099eb448c3c605209c1a7520fdc15805198e-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Many analysts are hopeful about its future even if it has lately dropped. At $20.45 right now, INJ has a market capitalization of $1.91 billion and a daily trading volume of $375.74 million. Related Reading: Analyst Upbeat On USTC, Sees Price Soaring Over 300% Analyst Upbeat About Injective Respected expert Jonathan Carter feels INJ is beginning to show indications of recovery. It’s deviating from a declining wedge pattern, he notes, which usually marks the conclusion of a downturn. Carter said INJ may soon reach $36 if it breaks over some technical thresholds. Other professionals see this favorably. They stress the need of keeping above the $16.5 to $18 area as INJ is creating a firm bottom and should be kept above such level. Should it sustain this level, they believe it might shoot up to $30, barring any negative pressures. #INJ Injective completed healthy correction and bouncing from the lower border of the falling wedge🧐 Breakout above descending resistance and ma 100, could target $36 soon🎯 pic.twitter.com/TNCgeZV0sG — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) July 10, 2024 INJ Staking Power High staking payouts are one of INJ’s strongest appeals. With an annual percentage yield (APY) of about 20%, it appeals far more than many other cryptocurrencies and conventional financial instruments. Ethereum provides around 3.3% APY, whereas Solana provides roughly 7%. Assuming the rate remains constant, a $100,000 investment in INJ may perhaps result in $20,000 in yearly incentives. Both novice and seasoned investors seeking for passive income sources are drawn to its great return potential. INJ Price Performance So Far Still, one should keep in mind the volatility of the crypto market. When INJ jumped over 1,000% in 2023, its performance in 2024 was poor in comparison. Following a peak in March of $52.96, it has dropped more than 62% to its present level. The erratic character of digital asset investments is highlighted by this clear difference. Meanwhile, technical indicators and the dread & Greed Index point to a negative current market atmosphere. Although some estimates indicate INJ may reach $64.27 by August 2024, one should use great caution with these projections. Though optimistic long-term forecasts, given the contradictory signals and pessimistic attitude it might not be the best moment to buy INJ. The natural volatility of the crypto market implies that, even if great rewards are possible, there is also a chance of major losses. At least, this is the forecast of crypto prediction platform CoinCodex as of today. Related Reading: Filecoin Boom Incoming? Market Optimism Fuels Crypto’s Next Breakout Star In essence, Injective offers a fascinating possibility with its high staking payouts and expansion possibility. Still, it has significant drawdowns, much like any crypto investments. Before making any decisions, prospective investors should give their risk tolerance much thought and conduct extensive study.

42417718,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZg0z,1720775297,Iris Energy Has Committed Most of Childress Site to Expansion of Bitcoin Mining: Bernstein,"Iris Energy shares slumped 14% after a short seller said the company's Childress site was unsuitable for hosting artificial intelligence or high-performance computing.  Bernstein notes that the company never said it intended to retrofit the bitcoin mining site to AI.  Iris Energy (IREN) shares fell almost 14% yesterday following the publication of a short-selling report by Culper Research that noted the unsuitability of the bitcoin miner's Childress, Texas site for artificial intelligence (AI) or high-performance computing (HPC).  The company, however, has committed most of the planned expansion at the site to bitcoin {{BTC}} mining, broker Bernstein said in a research report, and the existing power and data center infrastructure there work very well for that purpose.  “Iris Energy has not claimed it intends to retrofit its bitcoin mining site in Childress to AI,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  The broker also estimates 65% of the company's value is derived from bitcoin mining and the remaining 35% from AI/HPC. Bernstein said it completely disagrees with the view that the mining activity is valueless.  Potential AI upside for Iris Energy comes mostly from the 1.4 gigawatt West Texas site that has a power interconnect, the report said, and the opportunity lies in the monetization of the land and the power supply.  The broker said Iris Energy’s current $1 million/megawatt capital expenditure metric is a reflection of bitcoin mining capex. Comparing it to AI/HPC capex is not meaningful.  The company’s valuation is in line with other bitcoin miners such as CleanSpark (CLSK) and Marathon Digital (MARA), whose entire valuation is driven by mining, the report said.  Bernstein initiated coverage of Iris Energy earlier this week with an outperform rating and $26 price target. The shares closed at $11.20 on Thursday.

From an abrupt drop earlier in the year to an optimistic current return, both experts and investors find appeal in the digital asset. Related Reading: Filecoin Boom Incoming? Market Optimism Fuels Crypto’s Next Breakout Star USTC plummeted more than 51% from $0.330 at the start of the year, to $0.1660. This huge drop made people wonder what the future holds for buyers in the stablecoin. But this week, market data showed that things got better: the price of USTC went up by more than 10%. This good news has given people new hope that the asset might be able to come back to life and renewed their excitement. Crypto Analyst’s Breakthrough Prognosis Noting a confirmed bullish divergence pattern, renowned crypto specialist Javon Marks gave USTC some positive words. He projects a likely upside of more than 360% with a breakout target of $0.08097. From the current levels, USTC could show a big comeback and provide good returns to those who have survived the past crisis. $USTC (Terra Classic USD) has confirmed a bullish divergence pattern while maintaining a major set of Higher Lows that can suggest an uptrend to still be in-tact and a more than 360% upside from here! With prices already being broken out and $0.08097 as the breakout target,… https://t.co/qhghFWXNbm pic.twitter.com/yFpQ2pmJDT — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) July 10, 2024 Technical Views The creation of higher lows on the price chart indicates that buyers are entering the market at prices that are gradually increasing. This means that demand is growing, which may indicate that the uptrend will continue. Another piece of evidence that supports the positive prognosis for USTC is this technical insight. USTC is seen to encounter critical support and resistance levels that could potentially impact its future trajectory, despite the optimistic technical patterns. As of mid-April 2024, USTC is currently circling a critical support level. In another development, Binance gave the Terra Luna Classic community some support for their LUNC burn effort meant to cut supply. A post by Binance community associate Diana generated discussion in the community by implying that the plan is also part of the USTC resurrection strategy. Popular community member Mr. Diamondhandz1 added to this narrative that Binance is helping with the USTC rebirth in addition to their monthly LUNC burning. Related Reading: Solana Frenzy: Big Buyers Fueling Rally On Top Crypto Exchanges In almost half of the entire 126 billion tokens burnt by the community, over 62 billion LUNC have been decimated by Binance. The community is depending on Terraform Labs to burn USTC in their wallets while the USTC repeg strategy is yet to be finalized. Former Binance big boss Changpeng Zhao recently disclosed that the exchange invested $3 million in Terra but has not sold or relocated its LUNC assets. As a result, LUNC’s price climbed by more than 1% to $0.00007192; it fell short of the $0.000072 threshold. The 22% drop in the 24-hour trading volume suggested lower trader enthusiasm. Likewise, USTC’s price increased 0.50% to $0.01608; market uncertainty caused a 41% decrease in trading activity over the past 24 hours. USTC Price Forecast Meanwhile, USTC’s price is predicted to rise by about 8% by August 10, 2024, reaching $0.0172. This prognosis shows a likely upward advance based on various technical signs even with the current negative outlook. At 29, the Fear & Greed Index currently captures market concern. Apart from a 9.84% price volatility, USTC observed fourteen green days in the last thirty days.

30839516,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629356,1720767624,"Germany Liquidates Over 90% Of Bitcoin Holdings, Retains Only $284 Million","After a month-long period of increased selling pressure, the German government has nearly exhausted its Bitcoin treasury, selling over 90% of its BTC seized in January in the country’s largest Bitcoin seizure, worth over $2.1 billion. With less than $300 million worth of BTC remaining, this signals the end of a significant sell-off period, with expectations of further price appreciation for the largest cryptocurrency on the market. 9.9% Of Seized BTC Remains On-chain data from market intelligence firm Arkham reveals the German government’s selling activity on Thursday, showing that the German police wallet initially sold 2,375 BTC ($137.87 million) to exchanges including Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase. Subsequently, an additional 3,250 BTC ($191.02 million) was sent to exchanges for selling purposes and over-the-counter (OTC) deals, according to the data. The German government recently transferred 5,000 BTC ($286.44 million) to Flow Traders, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, 139Po and bc1qu. They have now transferred 10,627 BTC ($615.33 million) to market makers and exchanges on Thursday alone. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Major Gains for These Altcoins But Warn Against XRP and ADA With only 4,925 BTC remaining, Arkham data shows that the German government currently holds 9.9% of the original 50,000 BTC seized from Movie2k in January, worth just over $284 million at the current BTC price of $57,000. Movie2k, a movie streaming website, was found guilty of money laundering and other illegal activities by the state of Saxony in Germany. Our sister site Bitcoinist reported on Wednesday that Dr. Lennart Ante, co-founder of the German-based blockchain research lab, said the Saxon government is obligated to sell the confiscated bitcoin as per standard procedure, even though lawmakers such as Joana Cotar have urged the country’s legislative chamber to keep the seized BTC. Nonetheless, Dr. Ante further clarified that the general prosecutor’s office of Saxony is responsible for liquidating the confiscated BTC assets as per “standard procedure.” Bitcoin Price Analysis Currently trading above $57,400, the good news is that the BTC price has consolidated above this level for the past few days, signaling a sense of stability in the market ahead of a potential renewed bullish move higher to tackle key resistance levels. This starkly contrasts last week’s price action, when Bitcoin saw violent price swings in both directions as selling pressure from the German government and uncertainty surrounding the payments from defunct exchange Mt. Gox flooded the market. Related Reading: Binance Bought A Whooping 41,000 BTC During The Dip: Did They Save The Bitcoin Market? In the short term, the Bitcoin price will have to face the $58,200 resistance wall, which has proven to be a hard nut to crack for the largest cryptocurrency on the market for the past 6 days, being unable to surpass this level to test the $60,200 obstacle subsequently. Ultimately, it remains to be seen when the German government will end its Bitcoin sell-off and deplete its entire Bitcoin treasury and how BTC’s price will react as the daily selling pressure experienced for the past month subsides.

The firm is looking to expand its footprint in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and in Asia-Pacific.  Morgan Creek Digital plans to raise up to $500 million for a new fund targeting early stage opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain technologies, chips and data, the company said in a press release on Friday.  The firm is talking to sovereign and institutional investors, corporate officers, and industry subject matter experts in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and in Asia-Pacific (APC) as it looks to expand its regional footprint, the company said. It is also talking to U.S. based investors and partners.  The venture capital firm says the EMEA and APAC regions are going to be leaders in the future of technology by notably increasing investments in AI and blockchain.  “With the global reach of Web3, MCD will be spending more time in international markets looking to connect with the best CEOs and partners,” Morgan Creek Digital General Partner Mark Yusko said in the release.  The new fund will invest in the “ABCDs” of Web3, in companies that look to combine the power of AI, blockchain technology, and the associated chips to unlock value from data. The firm prefers to invest in technology that overlaps sectors, such as high performance chips that can be used for AI training in data centers or for bitcoin mining.  The company notes that APAC countries are expected to almost triple investment in generative AI to $3.4 billion in 2024 and EMEA digital budgets for AI are predicted to grow by 40%, which could potentially add $30 billion in new net investment by 2025.  “In particular, the Middle East is going through a renaissance of new cutting-edge technology,” Yusko added.

However, for Ethereum to reach this ambitious price target, the analyst emphasized that the cryptocurrency must fulfill certain key conditions. Ethereum Road Map To $8,000 ATH A crypto analyst identified as ‘Bluntz’ on X (formerly Twitter) has expressed bullish optimism for Ethereum’s future outlook. The analyst forecasted that ETH could witness a mega rally to an $8,000 all-time high this market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Double Top Pattern On 4-Hour Chart, Analyst Reveals Targets Bluntz shared a video on June 8 via his official X account, highlighting key conditions Ethereum will have to overcome before it can reach a new all-time high around $8,000. The crypto analyst noted that ETH/USD is presently near recent lows, as a result, Ethereum could be getting closer to its lowest point in this current bearish trend. The analyst disclosed that it was highly unlikely that Ethereum would immediately start surging upwards from its current low point. He emphasized that the cryptocurrency will need to undergo additional downward movement before witnessing a surge to the $8,000 price target. For Ethereum to begin its road map to the $8,000 all-time high, Bluntz believes that the cryptocurrency must “sweep $2,800, take out the low and reclaim it.” After this, the analyst revealed that a three-wave corrective pattern, termed an “ABC,” will be completed, potentially signaling the end of Ethereum’s downward trend and the beginning of a substantial upward movement. Bluntz also noted in his video that Ethereum’s ABC wave correction will send the price of the cryptocurrency to $6,000 before pulling back and rallying again to a cyclic top of around $8,000. He expects Ethereum to trade sideways for a while, testing new lows before entering a recovery stage. Analyst Asserts Ethereum’s Biggest Gains Are Yet To Come In his post, Bluntz confidently asserted that Ethereum has yet to experience its “big run” in this market cycle. Although the cryptocurrency surged to new highs above $4,000 earlier this year, Bluntz and a few other crypto analysts have predicted more bullish upsides for the cryptocurrency. One of the primary reasons behind the market’s optimism concerning Ethereum’s price outlook is the upcoming launch of Spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Bluntz disclosed in his video that the introduction of Ethereum Spot ETFs will likely trigger a substantial price increase for Ethereum. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000, But What About Altcoins? The analyst revealed that various crypto community members have engaged in a hot debate about the potential launch of the Ethereum ETF, expecting it to have a positive impact on Ethereum’s value. However, contrary to belief, Bluntz anticipates a major ETH sell-off, emphasizing that the price of the cryptocurrency will likely drop following the launch of its ETF. This initial sell-off phase could indicate the shakeout of weaker hands in the crypto market. Following this, Bluntz expects Ethereum to be “bid up heavily,” potentially driving the price upwards.

Downside may be limited as recent supply overhang from Germany's Saxony state has exhausted.  Fed rate cut bets, FTX repayments may offer support, according to a prime broker.  Thursday was a significant day for crypto markets as bitcoin {{BTC}} failed to surpass a key resistance despite a positive U.S. inflation report, maintaining the downward trajectory observed since early June.  On Thursday, after the U.S. reported the first drop in consumer prices in four years markets quickly lifted the Fed rate cut bets, sending higher-risk assets, including BTC.  For a moment, it appeared that bitcoin bulls would establish a foothold above the descending trendline, characterizing the sell-off from June highs near $72,000. Such a move would have signaled an end to the pullback and could have drawn in momentum traders, as discussed in Thursday's First Mover America.  Read more: Fed Might Focus on Weakening Labor Market Rather Than Inflation as It Mulls Rate Cuts: Economists  However, bullish hopes were quickly dashed as prices turned lower from the trendline resistance, falling below $57,000 early today.  The latest bull failure, observed against the backdrop of positive macro news flow, might mean more price weakness ahead. A similar trendline rejection on July 1 proved costly, deepening the sell-off.  Still, there is hope for the bulls. The daily chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and changes, is teasing a crossover above zero, a sign of an impending bullish shift in momentum.  The supply overhang from Germany's Saxony state, which catalyzed the price drop early this month, is nearly running dry. Besides, it remains uncertain what percentage of the 95,000 BTC, which represents a portion of the total 140,000 BTC scheduled to be distributed to Mt. Gox's creditors, will be liquidated.  ""The prospect of some of the $16.3 billion FTX repayment over the next months translating into buying pressure, the increasingly positive stance toward crypto on both sides of the aisle, and the potential of an interest rate cut in September benefiting risk assets more generally should embolden medium- and long-term bulls,"" crypto prime broker FalconX said in a newsletter Friday.

Iggy Azalea Collaboration With DWF Labs DWF Labs, through a series of posts on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), announced its strategic partnership with now crypto investor Iggy Azalea, as the company recently signaled a new chapter for the company, focusing on “next generation” liquidity partnerships to support crypto projects. Related Reading: XRP Set To Skyrocket 60,000% On Tightest Bollinger Bands Ever: Analyst In response to the collaboration, Iggy Azalea revealed that she had loaned her entire MOTHER token holdings to DWF Labs and Wintermute, an algorithmic trading firm specializing in digital assets. By entrusting her holdings to these market makers, Azalea expressed confidence in their expertise and ability to increase the token’s stability and finance. One user on social media emphasized the significance of this move, highlighting that the founder tokens are now locked, ensuring the token’s “unruggable” nature. However, no further details on the collaboration were provided by either party, leaving questions as to how the partnership will potentially boost MOTHER’s price or its stability in the coming months. MOTHER Price Analysis This latest partnership adds to Iggy Azalea’s growing involvement with the meme coin, as the singer unveiled plans in June to revive a telecommunications company she co-founded, which had an immediate positive impact on the price of the MOTHER token, resulting in a 27% spike at the time of the announcement. Azalea shared her vision of allowing MOTHER and Solana token holders to use their tokens to purchase phones or monthly wireless plans. The singer revealed in her statement that the payment infrastructure for these transactions will be handled by technology company Sphere Labs, with phone services provided by Unreal Mobile, which led to a price spike above the $0.2300 mark for the meme coin. Related Reading: Binance Bought A Whooping 41,000 BTC During The Dip: Did They Save The Bitcoin Market? With the recent announcement and the partnership of the meme coin with DWF Labs, the token surged nearly 60% in the early hours of Thursday, with the MOTHER token hitting a 5-day high of $0.04816. However, after the initial hype surrounding the inception of the meme coin, MOTHER has steadily declined after hitting an all-time high of $0.2306 on June 6th, now down 85% from that level. Currently, the token has corrected to its current trading price of $0.0347, which shows the volatility experienced over the past month, while the token also notes a 16% price drop over the past seven days. However, in the potential scenario where the current uptrend continues, $0.0349 will be the next obstacle to overcome for the meme coin, as it has acted as a resistance wall for the token in the past week. On the other hand, the next support level is at $0.286.

The announcement propelled the token’s price by over 55% while other Trump-inspired memecoins increased by nearly 20%. Related Reading: Drake Loses Bitcoin Bet Following Canada’s Copa America Exit, ARG Fan Token Soars 40% Trump Joins The Bitcoin Conference On July 10, Former US president and Republican candidate Donald J. Trump was officially announced as a keynote speaker at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference. The Bitcoin Conference will occur in Nashville, Tennessee, between the 25th and 27th of July. Crypto-friendly Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will also participate in the upcoming event. Moreover, former pro-crypto Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will join the largest Bitcoin conference in the world as a keynote speaker. The CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, the organizer of The Bitcoin Conference, expressed his enthusiasm for Trump’s participation. “July 27th we change the course of history,” David Bailey stated in an X post. The news of Trump’s involvement in the event was well-received by many industry figures. However, other industry members and investors questioned Trump’s intentions. CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju wondered whether the former US president’s efforts were genuine: Is this a strategy to gain votes, or is it a genuine effort to make the United States a Bitcoin nation? Does anyone know? Despite the skepticism, the crypto community seems optimistic about the news, as Trump-inspired tokens soared last night. TrumpCoin And Trump-Inspired Memecoins Soar TrumpCoin’s price quickly reacted to the news, skyrocketing 55%. The token hit the $0.013 resistance level for the first time since June 27, according to DexScreener data. DJT saw a controversial launch nearly a month ago after online reports claimed TrumpCoin was the “official” Trump token. As a result, many investors sold most of their Trump-inspired memecoins, making them crash around 30%. At the time, Martin Shrekli, also known as “Pharma Bro,” claimed that the token was officially related to Trump’s camp. Shrekli stated that Barron Trump, son of the former US president, was closely involved with TrumpCoin. However, it was later revealed that Shrekli was behind the token. Crypto sleuth ZachXBT exposed the scheme on X, uncovering the truth before Shrekli admitted his involvement in an X Space. Since then, DJT’s price has gone on a descending trajectory. The token has seen a 33% decrease in the last two weeks. However, it registers a 10% increase from its price 24 hours ago, currently trading at $0.0086. Related Reading: Football Takeover?

30829347,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629312,1720749656,Is a Bitcoin Breakout Looming? Options Markets Signal Imminent Volatility Surge,"QCP Capital has recently released a new market analysis offering insight into what might be in store for the price of Bitcoin (BTC) — more importantly, which direction it could move next. These fresh insights particularly focus on the options market. Market Anticipates Movement: Analyzing Bitcoin Options The latest report from QCP Capital has identified an interesting pattern in the Bitcoin options market, highlighting a rise in front-end volatility specific to BTC. This increase by 5 points in short-term volatility indicates that traders are preparing for larger price swings over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Beware: Analyst Warns Of Potential Traps Amid Price Fluctuations Additionally, the increasing number of topside risk reversals suggests growing expectations among traders that prices will likely continue to increase favorably, influencing market sentiment. According to QCP Capital, this combination of higher implied volatility and attractive risk reversals sets the stage for a potential bullish price rally. The QCP analysts particularly noted: Bitcoin front-end volatility increased by 5 points this morning, with risk reversals favoring the topside, signaling the market’s anticipation of potential topside volatility. While Bitcoin has shown some signs of recovery as the market digests these fundamental analytical forecasts, volatility persists on the way up. Particularly, amid the gradual rebound, the asset still appears to be getting pulled by the bears. Earlier today, BTC traded as high as $59,313; however, at the time of writing, the asset has now shredded most of its gains for today and is now trading at $57,766, a few dollars away from its 24-hour low of $57,127. This continued volatility occurs against the backdrop of a broader financial market that is constantly changing, with a special focus now on the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). QCP noted: With the perceived reduction in supply, a softer CPI print could serve as the catalyst to break out of this [current] range, especially bolstered by the upcoming launch of ETH spot ETF trading next week. We identify a compelling risk-reward opportunity on the upside through Digitals. Long-Term BTC Holders Sentiment Furthermore, regardless of all of these, the underlying confidence among Bitcoin’s long-term investors remains unshaken. According to the latest on-chain data from Glassnode, this cycle’s steepest price corrections are not even persuading these investors to sell. Glassnode reported that despite several market blips, like Bitcoin dipping to as low as the $53,500 mark last week, long-term holders are as determined as ever and have not changed their aspirations in months. The data suggests that only 36% or perhaps even less of the total Bitcoin capital has moved during this week’s sell-off events – substantially lower than past major market capitulations with over 60% involvement.

As per on-chain transaction data, Cardano whales have also been relatively quiet since the last week of June. Daily whale inflows have steadied under 5 million ADA since the beginning of the month, save for a recent spike earlier in the week. Particularly, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock indicate a recent 1,218% spike in daily whale inflows, a development that may signal the start of an ADA price uptick. Cardano Sees 1,218% Spike In Major Metric According to the Large Holders Inflow from IntoTheBlock, the Cardano blockchain witnessed a 1,220% surge in whale inflow. As noted earlier, daily inflows into whale wallets have been on a decline since July 5. However, a surge in activity at the beginning of the week resulted in the number of inflows into whale addresses spiking from 14.51 million ADA on July 8 to 110.82 million ADA on July 9. This increase is more noticeable compared to the 2.83 million ADA recorded on July 7, which represents a 3815.9% increase in daily inflows over two days. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Sparks Sell-Off Rumors With 11,215 ETH Coinbase Deposit The Large Holders Inflow metric tracks the amount of tokens entering into wallets holding at least 0.1% of the circulating supply of ADA. According to data from Coinmarketcap, there are currently 35.87 billion ADA tokens in circulation. Meaning each wallet being tracked by the metric has to possess at least 35.87 million ADA tokens before they can be classified as large holders or whales. According to the ADA holdings distribution, only 0.01% of the total Cardano addresses are within the range of those possessing 10 million to 100 million ADA tokens. However, they control a majority (36.26%) of the coins in circulation, which gives them a say in the overall price movement. Will ADA Price Follow? Whale activity doesn’t just affect prices directly; it can also sway overall market sentiment. When some of these big players make moves, it can either boost confidence or spread fear among other whales and retail investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Double Top Pattern On 4-Hour Chart, Analyst Reveals Targets Recent bearish sentiment saw ADA hit a nine-month low of $0.3211, but it has rebounded and is now on the verge of reversing into a positive percentage in a seven-day timeframe.
