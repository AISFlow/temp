13221442,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=480643,1641599949,The SEC Files A Strike Against Ripple’s Defense. Could It Drown XRP?,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a surprise attack on the Ripple case by filing a letter of supplemental authority to strike Ripple&apos;s &apos;fair notice&apos; defense. Simultaneously, the token XRP is down 2.33% in the last 24 hours to $0.7 following the market&apos;s downtrend. The SEC&apos;s Surprise Move As the popular SEC vs. Ripple case is expected to be resolved around April this year, the SEC has made a new move that left many wondering if previous expectations could change. The American regulator is using a winning move from another case to strike at Ripple&apos;s key arguments. The SEC had taken John M Fife and five entities controlled by him to court in September 2020 for selling $21 billion of penny stocks and gaining a profit of $61 billion without registering as security dealers. FIFE&apos;s defense adopted an argument similar to Ripple&apos;s, alleging the SEC hadn&apos;t given them a fair warning and the term &apos;dealer&apos; can be widely interpreted. Last month, the court denied this argument. What Does It Mean For The Ripple Case? Naturally, the regulator now aimed to use this denial to strike at Ripple&apos;s &apos;fair notice&apos; key defense. Similarly, Ripple&apos;s &apos;fair notice&apos; defense alleges the regulator failed to notify them about a possible violation of federal securities laws and claimed the term &apos;investment contract&apos; is being misused b...",NEGATIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/all/the-sec-files-a-strike-against-ripples-defense-could-it-drown-xrp/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Sources told CoinDesk in September that PayPal subsidiary Curv was actively working on developing a stablecoin.  “We are exploring a stablecoin; if and when we seek to move forward, we will of course, work closely with relevant regulators,” a PayPal spokesman told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  Bloomberg first reported the news after evidence of PayPal’s exploration into building its own stablecoin was discovered in the company’s iPhone app by developer Steve Moser and shared with Bloomberg. Hidden code and images show work on what is called a “PayPal Coin.” The code shows the coin would be backed by the U.S. dollar, Bloomberg noted in its report.  PayPal has been very active with its cryptocurrency efforts recently, increasing the amount of crypto its customers can purchase, as well as investing in educating its users on crypto and working to allow them to withdraw their crypto safely to third-party wallets.  A PayPal spokesperson told Bloomberg that images and code inside of the PayPal app stemmed from a recent internal hackathon – an event in which engineers team up to quickly explore and build new products that may never see a public release – within the company’s blockchain, crypto and digital currencies division.

42423938,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNlh,1641590448,"Market Wrap: Crypto Traders Reduce Leverage, Selling Pressure Subsides","Bitcoin stabilized at around $41,000 on Friday and is down about 9% over the past week. Analysts expect prices to move sideways, although they may be vulnerable to further declines if technical support levels are breached.  The reduction in leverage in bitcoin and ether futures markets could signal healthier market conditions. Typically, there is a lower chance of additional downside volatility when traders reduce their position sizes.  Earlier this week, “based on liquidation data, it seems like a few leverage traders tried to speculate on a rebound and got burned in the process,” Genevieve Yeoh, a research analyst at Delphi Digital, wrote in a blog post.  Liquidations, which can accelerate downward price movements, occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading.  For now, bitcoin remains near a three-month low, tracking declines in global equity markets.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,928, -2.97%  Ether (ETH): $3,216, -6.11%  S&P 500: $4,677, -0.41%  Gold: $1,795, +0.19%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.76%  Traders reduce risk  Some analysts are pointing to signs of stabilization in crypto markets following Wednesday’s sell-off. After roughly $800 million in liquidations during the price dip, selling pressure could subside over the short term.  “We have already seen significant de-risking in recent weeks with both BTC and ETH perpetual swap funding rates near zero,” David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in a newsletter on Friday.  A perpetual swap is a type of crypto derivative trading product, similar to traditional futures.  “Leverage has been reduced sharply, reflected in the BTC basis falling from 20% in early Q3 2021 to 5% in January 2022 and the ETH basis falling from 20% to 2% over the same period (according to Deribit),” Duong wrote.  Exchange outflows  The net flow of bitcoin and ether to and from exchanges has trended lower over the past year. This week, however, more BTC moved into exchanges, which could signal a bearish shift in investor sentiment.  Net inflows imply investor intention to sell, while consistent outflows represent strong holding sentiment and take out circulating supply from the market, paving the way for price rallies.  While the recent uptick in net inflows to exchanges doesn’t signal a trend shift, analysts are closely monitoring a sustained rise similar to January, which could lead to a prolonged market sell-off.  Altcoin roundup  Ether liquidations: Traders racked up $182 million in losses on ether-tracked futures products in the past 24 hours, according to data from analytics tools Coinglass. That is $14 million higher than bitcoin-tracked futures, which usually see the largest liquidations in the crypto market, during a comparable period.  Serum’s fund raise: The protocol that undergirds much of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Solana blockchain is raising funds to expand operations, and about $70 million has been committed so far. Buyers in the funding round received both Serum’s SRM tokens as well as a portion of the ecosystem fund, with 85% going into the fund. Ecosystem funds are a growing trend among major projects.

42423940,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNnh,1641588753,Fantom Transactions Surge Ahead of Avalanche as DeFi Prospects Heat Up,"Transactions on emerging layer 1 blockchain Fantom crossed those on Avalanche this week as crypto users looked for the next decentralized finance (DeFi) play. Layer 1 blockchains refer to individual blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, Fantom and Solana that can support products and services built atop their networks.  More than 1 million transactions were processed on the Fantom network, compared with 728,000 transactions on Avalanche earlier this week, research from Delphi Digital found. Such transactional activity on Fantom was previously seen in September, data from blockchain trackers show.  “As the narrative rotates from Avalanche to Fantom, it’s not surprising to see it reflected in transactions. Opportunistic capital moved over to yield farm on Fantom with high yields on stablecoins of around ~30-60% APR (annual percentage rate),” Delphi Digital analysts said in the note.  Both networks have processed more than 853,000 transactions in the past 24 hours, with the surge in Fantom mainly driven by upcoming DeFi projects and users interacting with current ones.  Interest in Fantom has increased as Daniele Sestagalli and Andre Cronje – developers known for launching protocols on Avalanche, Ethereum and Fantom that lock billions of dollars in value – announced a collaboration on an upcoming project that will deploy on Fantom.  Some say the announcement has contributed to a shift in focus on Fantom.  “The news of collaboration on an upcoming project that will use Fantom as the foundation for multi-chain deployment with a new token model quickly shifted the L1 narrative away from other Layer-1s such as Avalanche, and toward new Fantom project launches,” Yun Heng Lin, a special projects analyst at Delphi Digital, told CoinDesk in an email.  “Hundred Finance is a new project on Fantom that has recently received a lot of attention, and it is leveraging the now-popular ve-token model with high stablecoin yields of up to 30% APY (annual percentage yield). This, in turn, generated a lot of hype and speculation, as evidenced by Fantom surpassing Avalanche in daily transaction count,” he added.  DeFi emerges on other networks  Blockchains such as Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL) and Terra (LUNA) and Fantom (FTM) have witnessed growth in both their native tokens and value locked on DeFi protocols in the past few months as industry participants sought DeFi opportunities away from Ethereum.  DeFi activity on Avalanche saw a multifold increase last year as projects after projects like decentralized money market Wonderland and decentralized exchange Trader Joe grew in popularity.  Total value locked (TVL) on the Avalanche network grew to as high as $13 billion in December from $72 million in February, making it the fourth-largest DeFi network in the world by TVL.  But the likes of Fantom are catching up.  Fantom-based DeFi protocols had $6 billion locked up as of Friday, up from $2.9 million last April. A bulk of the value is locked up on cross-chain exchange Multichain and decentralized exchange SpookySwap, which together account for nearly $4 billion of the TVL.  Future projects are expected to see even more inflows of funds into the Fantom market.  “Felix, Fantom’s Binance-powered hybrid exchange will ship early Q1 2022 and provide retail entry into Fantom’s ecosystem, and the Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM) upgrade are upcoming catalysts for Fantom,” Delphi’s Yun wrote.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/07/fantom-transactions-surge-ahead-of-avalanche-as-defi-prospects-heat-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bb08ba1b725833261b91a773223ddff808e2995-5405x3702.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411847,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaos,1641587725,Top 6 Crypto Passive Income Generators for 2023,"Passive income is money generated from ventures in which an individual is not actively involved. For the most part, all you need to do is invest your money or digital assets in a particular crypto investment strategy or platform and watch it generate profit. In some cases, the earnings are fixed and predictable. In others, several factors beyond your control may come into play.  A typical way many try to make a return in crypto with little to no involvement is through buying and holding crypto – also known in the industry as “HODLing.” This means an investor is prepared to purchase a digital asset with the mindset that its price will hopefully rise significantly sometime in the future. Such investors are ready to go the distance as this long-term strategy might require them to hold their positions anywhere between six months to five years. Through the duration of this investment, an investor does not have to be proactive in the crypto market. They only need to buy the digital asset and store it in a secure wallet – preferably a non-custodial wallet.  A wallet is a device or app where you can store a special key (private key) that gives access to your cryptocurrencies. The non-custodial variants let you store the private key in your personal devices, including a computer, mobile phone or purpose-built wallet devices. With this, you have complete control over your private keys and, ultimately, your digital assets. By comparison, with a custodial wallet, a third party controls your private keys.  However, simply buying and holding a crypto asset for any length of time does not guarantee you will make a profit. In fact, it’s very possible you could lose money. As such, exclusively HODLing crypto cannot be considered a truly passive income generator.  Ways to earn passive crypto income  Proof-of-stake (PoS) staking  Proof-of-stake is a type of blockchain consensus mechanism designed to allow distributed network participants to reach an agreement on new data entering the blockchain. Note that blockchains enable open and decentralized networks where participants contribute to governance and processes involved in validating transactions. This is critical because such a community-focused approach eliminates the need for central authorities like banks. In most cases, blockchains randomly pick participants, elevate them to the status of validators and reward them for their efforts.  The systems used to pick validators vary from blockchain to blockchain. Some blockchain networks require users to deposit or commit their financial resources to the network. Here, the blockchain selects validators from a pool of users that have staked a specified sum of its native digital asset. In return, validators earn interest on the staked funds for contributing to the validity of the network. This validation mechanism is what is called proof-of-stake. It provides an opportunity for holders (those in it for the long haul) to generate passive income.  Knowing fully well that transaction validation might be technically tasking, you could opt for PoS blockchains that allow you to delegate your stakes to other participants who are ready to take up the technical requirements of staking. Understandably, the reward distributed to validators is slightly higher than that of a delegator. Some of the PoS blockchains you could consider are:  Cardano  Ethereum 2.0  Polkadot  Solana  For even more convenience, you could adopt one of the several staking services available today. With these platforms, you can deposit a fraction of the number of digital assets required by the blockchain. For example, you normally have to deposit a minimum of 32 ETH on the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain to become a validator. With a third-party Ethereum staking service, however, you could deposit as little as 5 ETH to start accruing interest.  Interest-bearing digital asset accounts  Holders can take advantage of interest-bearing crypto accounts to earn fixed interest on their idle digital assets. Think of this as putting money in an interest-earning bank account. The only difference is that this service supports only crypto deposits. Instead of holding digital assets in your wallets, you can deposit them in these accounts and receive daily, weekly, monthly or yearly earnings, depending on the predefined interest rates. Crypto service providers that offer such products include:  Nexo  Celsius Network  SwissBorg  BlockFi  Lending  Lending has become one of the most popular crypto services in both the centralized and decentralized segments of the crypto industry. As an investor, you can lend your digital assets to borrowers for a chance to earn interest. There are four main lending strategies you could opt for:  Peer-to-peer lending: Platforms that provide such services enable systems that allow users to set their terms, decide the amount they want to lend and the interest they intend to generate on loans. The platform matches lenders with borrowers, similar to how P2P (peer-to-peer) trading platforms match buyers and sellers. Such lending systems provide users with a certain degree of control when it comes to crypto lending. However, you have to deposit your digital asset on the lending platform’s custodial wallet beforehand.  Centralized lending: In this strategy, you rely solely on the lending infrastructure of third parties. Here, the interest rates are fixed, so are the lock-up periods. Like P2P lending, you have to transfer your crypto to the lending platform to start earning interest.  Decentralized or DeFi lending: This strategy allows users to execute lending services directly on the blockchain. Unlike the P2P and centralized lending strategies, there are no intermediaries involved in DeFi lending. Instead, lenders and borrowers interact with programmable and self-executing contracts (also known as smart contracts), which autonomously and periodically set interest rates.  Margin lending: Lastly, you could lend your crypto assets to traders interested in using borrowed funds to trade. These traders amplify their trading position with borrowed funds and repay the loans with interest. In this case, crypto exchanges do most of the work on your behalf. All you need to do is make your digital asset available.  Cloud mining  Unlike the proof-of-stake mechanism explained earlier, some blockchains, including Bitcoin, opt for a more computer-intensive approach where users need to prove the eligibility of their claim to become validators (more commonly called miners) by competing against each other to solve highly complex mathematical puzzles. This process is called crypto mining. Due to the competitiveness of this consensus mechanism, miners have to invest in powerful computers and pay exorbitant electricity bills.  Undoubtedly, this venture is time-consuming and technical. And so, investors often opt for an alternate approach called cloud mining. With this, you can pay third parties to take up the technical aspect of crypto mining on your behalf. In essence, you pay a platform that offers such services a lump sum to rent or buy mining machines from their mining facilities. After this first payment, you might have to pay a daily maintenance fee so that the cloud mining service provider can help you manage your mining rigs.  As exciting as this sounds, it comes with lots of risks. Cloud mining has been a subject of controversy ever since it became widely adopted. There have been several cases of scams due to the remote nature of this mining venture. Therefore, you should carry out due diligence before opting for this option.  Dividend-earning tokens  Certain tokens offer holders a fraction of the revenue of the company that issued them. All you need to do is hold the token, and you are automatically eligible to receive a certain percentage of the company’s revenue. The number of tokens you own determines the share of the revenue you would receive. An example of this is KuCoin Shares (KCS), where holders receive a daily share of transaction fees accrued by the KuCoin blockchain asset exchange. The amount received is proportional to the amount of KCS tokens each holder stakes.  Yield farming  Yield farming is another decentralized, or DeFi, method of earning passive crypto income. This is made possible by the dynamic operations of decentralized exchanges, which are basically trading platforms where users rely on the combination of smart contracts (programmable and self-executing computer contracts) and investors for the liquidity necessary to execute trades. Here, users do not trade against brokers or other traders. Instead, they trade against funds deposited by investors – known as liquidity providers – into special smart contracts known as liquidity pools. In turn, liquidity providers receive a proportional amount of trading fees from the pool.  To start earning passive income via this system you first have to take up the role of a liquidity provider (LP) on a DeFi exchange such as Uniswap, Aave or PancakeSwap.  To start earning these fees, you have to deposit a specified ratio of two or more digital assets into a liquidity pool.  For example, in order to provide liquidity to an ETH/USDT pool, you will need to deposit both ETH and USDT tokens into it.  Once you deposit liquidity, the decentralized exchange will transfer LP tokens representing your share of the total funds locked in the liquidity pool. You can then stake these LP tokens using supported decentralized lending platforms and earn additional interest. This strategy allows you to earn two separate interest rates from a single deposit.  The crypto passive income opportunities listed in this guide are just some of the many ways you can make extra profit with your idle digital assets. Note that none of these opportunities are risk free. Hence, it is advisable to carry out your own research, seek professional guidance from a qualified financial advisor and determine what best suits your investment goals.

42423932,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNbh,1641586422,Pudgy Penguins NFT Project Ousts Founders as Mood Turns Icy,"There’s trouble brewing in the huddle.  The beloved NFT project Pudgy Penguins voted out its founders on Thursday after they allegedly failed to deliver on stated goals and drained the treasury of funds. And now at least one splinter group is arguing that the entire project should be decentralized, potentially an industry first.  Launched in July, Pudgy Penguins has become one of the most successful NFT projects, raking in over 45,400 ETH in sales on NFT marketplace OpenSea. (That works out to about $140 million in today’s ether (ETH) prices.) NFT stands for “non-fungible tokens,” a subcategory of cryptocurrencies that represents ownership in a unique asset, from art to real estate.  The collection of 8,888 chubby and flightless Antarctic creatures – donning accessories such as baseball caps and fishing rods – were available to mint last July for 0.03 ETH and sold out in less than 20 minutes.  According to Twitter user and Pudgy Penguins owner @9x9x9eth, Pudgy Penguins co-founder Cole Thereum “promised a game, a token, an educational book on NFTs and more” to the community last September.  “After a half year, they still have not yet set up the team, they are still in the stage of hiring,” 9x9x9 told CoinDesk via Twitter.  (9x9x9 publicly stated he has spent nearly 600 ETH on the collection and holds 242 Pudgy Penguins NFTs and one rare “banana” penguin, purchased for 100 ETH.)  Pudgy Penguins pseudonymous co-founders Cole Thereum and Twitter user @tubbyfat didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment via Twitter direct message.  On Wednesday evening, 9x9x9 published a Twitter thread claiming the Pudgy Penguins founders were looking to abandon the project and offered to sell him its shell for 888 ETH (about $2.8 million), an offer he turned down.  Since the tweets, the floor price of a Pudgy Penguin shot up from about 0.6 ETH ($1,860) on Wednesday evening to 1.7 ETH ($5,270) as of press time.  Now, the project has received buyout offers as high as 750 ETH ($2.3 million) from other prominent individuals in the NFT market, including Mintable co-founder Zach Burks, NFT collector @beaniemax and Netz Capital’s Luca Netz.  Others in the community are more wary of a buyout. NFT hedge fund Starry Night Capital’s @Vince_Van_Dough and eGirl Capital’s @loomdart – other prominent stakeholders in the project – have floated the idea of migrating the community to a new project called Wrapped Penguins.  The Pudgy Penguins founding team receives a small percentage in royalties from each NFT sale, meaning founders of successful projects can continue to line their pockets as long as trading volume persists.  Wrapped Penguins, available as a free mint on NFT platform Metadrop for current Penguin holders, would sever all ties with the original founding team with the new project in the hope of creating a parallel community that would be governed using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) framework.  A wrapper is a smart contract that takes an asset and issues a parallel asset, allowing the Pudgy Penguins NFT holder to hold an identical “wrapped” penguin. The Wrapped Penguins project has said the holder will be able to “unwrap” their token into the original NFT at any time.  Profile picture projects (PFP) such as Pudgy Penguins, Larva Labs’ CryptoPunks and Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club have driven the recent boom in NFT sales, often run by centralized founding teams who tease new releases for their holders.  Pudgy Penguins “could be the first pure decentralized PFP project ever,” 9x9x9 told CoinDesk.  The battle for control over the Pudgy Penguins project also raises governance questions surrounding NFT communities – or more broadly, what happens when founders fail to deliver on stated goals or the communities themselves experience infighting.  Recent events are reminiscent of battles that have plagued major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, known in the industry as “hard forks.”  “In real life, stakeholders can use the board to dump a poorly performing CEO. This is the first attempt I’ve seen in crypto to do in essence the same thing,” tweeted Jordi Alexander, chief investment officer of Selini Capital. “The community forks everything out without the baggage of the CEO.”  Amid the turmoil, some Pudgy Penguin holders have used the spotlight to spread a popular Pudgy rallying cry: “I am my penguin and my penguin is me.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/07/pudgy-penguins-nft-project-ousts-founders-as-mood-turns-icy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a77d0f41802e1478338790474b8f3322d5373e0c-2130x1464.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411582,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOtI6,1641583663,How to Stay Sane During a Crypto Crash,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are having a rough few weeks. Bitcoin is currently down more than 18% over the last 30 days. CoinGecko’s tabulation of total crypto market cap shows a peak way back on Nov. 10, and steady declines since. The floor prices of some NFTs have also started to show hints of weakness.  For a truly stunning number of crypto newcomers, this may be something of a new experience. The past two years have seen incredible growth for platforms like Coinbase, where verified users rose from 37 million in the second quarter of 2020 to 68 million in the second quarter of 2021, then up to 73 million in Q3.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That likely translates to tens of millions of crypto holders who have never experienced a true crypto bear market, much less an extended “crypto winter.” It’s not certain that we’re in for either of those, but both are possibilities – and for new entrants, it’s worth doing some psychological preparation.  First, some perspective. Bitcoin dropping towards $40,000 doesn’t exactly sound like the apocalypse for anyone who has been in the space for very long. BTC rose to that price for the very first time just one year ago, in January of 2021. It even dipped well below that barrier as recently as July, briefly breaking under $30,000. On a longer time span, BTC’s current 38% drawdown from a November peak doesn’t even rank among the token’s biggest crashes: As recently as 2018, BTC crashed 84% in just a few weeks.  In short, those who bought at moments of highest hype are probably feeling some pain right now, but a lot of other holders – those who looked for good entry points to accumulate – are still up big. That’s perhaps the most important lesson in crypto investing: because they are so accessible and liquid, these assets are subject to big, quick swings in sentiment leading to fragile blowoff tops. Even more than in equities, Warren Buffett’s timeless advice applies: Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.  The most recent sharp crash was back in July, when the drawdown was over 50%. The price recovered handily from that dip, partly fueled by subsequent major developments such as adoption by El Salvador and Twitter. Something similar could reverse the current trend, though broader conditions point in the wrong direction. Above all, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s intent to tighten the money supply this year will be a drag on Bitcoin’s specific “inflation hedge” proposition, and likely tighten startup funding and other speculative investments more broadly.  But what seems likely to remain intact is the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency adoption, interest and markets. That pattern has held for most of the past decade. Each crypto boom attracts a huge new inflow of speculators and venture capitalists, many of whom have only the vaguest understanding of the technology and why it’s important. Many of these new entrants get burned by FOMOing into a top. Just as often, they outsmart themselves by buying some token hyped by founders as “the next Bitcoin” that turns out to be a cheap sham or just a bad idea. In the current cycle in particular, “decoupling” among crypto assets has accelerated, and the gap between good bets and bad ones has been huge.  See also: Crypto Miners Are Better Investments Than Bitcoin Even After Sell-Off: Analysts  Some of those who get burned – as many newbies are getting burned right now – take their ball and go home, embittered and resentful. But a huge chunk of them actually stick around, learn from their mistakes and ultimately wind up even more deeply involved and committed. Newly armed with understanding, they form an even stronger phalanx of users and advocates the next time price action draws mainstream attention. This cycle obviously can’t continue forever. Eventually, Bitcoin in particular will find a steadier “correct” price. Maybe it’s somewhere around $50,000 and that has already happened – though I personally don’t think so.  As I laid out in my 2022 predictions, the rhythm of new ideas, integrations and adoption (particularly by nation-states) is likely to remain high regardless of price action. That, along with the literally millions of new folks learning about, using and even developing crypto systems, will form a strong foundation for the next round of excitement and growth, whether that happens in three months or three years. Either scenario is possible right now. Position your portfolio – and your expectations – accordingly.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

The cryptocurrency was down about 9% over the past week as upside momentum continued to slow.  There is minor support around $40,000, which could stabilize the current pullback. However, upside appears limited around the $45,000 resistance level. This means buyers could quickly take profits if a price bounce occurs.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since Dec.11, albeit within a price downtrend.  Over the long-term, BTC is vulnerable to further selling, especially if buyers fail to hold the $38,000-$40,000 support zone over the weekend. On the weekly chart, the RSI is not yet oversold, which suggests the downtrend remains intact.  Lower support is seen around $28,000, which is near the June 2021 low.

Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Points At &apos;Extreme Fear&apos; As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC fear and greed index has dropped to very low values. The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is a crypto indicator that measures the general sentiment among investors in the market. The index uses numbers to represent the sentiment on a numeric scale that goes from zero to hundred. Values of the indicator above fifty mean that the current holder sentiment is that of greed. And values below 50 imply that the market is fearful at the moment. Index values below 25 and those above 75 fall into the &apos;extreme&apos; category, signifying extreme fear and extreme greed, respectively. The indicator usually remains in the greed zone during bull runs. Extreme greed values have historically signaled that a correction in the price of Bitcoin may be near, and a top could form. On the other hand, values of fear may be there during bearish trends, and extreme fear might imply that a bottom could soon form.

JPMorgan sees 2022 having potential to be “the year of the blockchain bridge (driving greater interoperability of various chains) or the year of financial tokenization.”  Regarding bitcoin, JPMorgan says it’s “particularly well-designed as a modern store of value, and the strong design has contributed to the increased confidence in and value of Bitcoin.” However, bitcoin still comes up short against other stores of value, including gold, given its limited history, according to Worthington.  Additionally, bitcoin’s heightened volatility likely won’t make it a good currency since that “could undermine crypto as a medium of exchange, as a unit of account and as a standard for deferred payments, the other recognized functions of money.” Volatility concerns have not stopped bitcoin from rising in value, however, he added.  Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is “still a buy” for investors, as the company is a beneficiary of the growth across the crypto industry, Worthington wrote.  Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs told clients that “hypothetically, if bitcoin’s share of the ‘store of value’ market were to rise to 50% over the next five years (with no growth in overall demand for stores of value), its price would increase to just over $100,000, for a compound annualized return of 17-18% (accounting for growth in bitcoin supply over time).”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/07/jpmorgan-sees-more-crypto-adoption-in-2022-debates-bitcoins-status-as-store-of-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/156f756029761ef916a2a74f4937e05fb3dbd06e-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411580,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOt8B,1641577024,Is a DAO + LLC Still a DAO?,"2021 was the year of the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. Projects like PleasrDAO, Friends With Benefits and ConstitutionDAO showed the potential for collective action and governance. DAOs are novel legal structures with a big future. But how will they work in practice? I have my doubts.    Decentralized autonomous organizations are, in very basic terms, communities represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by its members and not influenced by a central authority. And even though they seemed to have been fatally injured after The DAO hack in 2016, they are now rising again at a considerable speed.  Cristina Carrascosa is a tax lawyer and CEO of ATH21, the first crypto specialized law firm in Spain. She regularly writes the crypto-related newsletter Legal by Design.  ConstitutionDAO is the latest to get international attention. It was a community of crypto investors who launched a DAO with the objective of buying one of the 13 surviving copies of the U.S. Constitution that was up for sale at Sotheby’s in mid-November.  ConstitutionDAO launched just seven days before the auction and solicited donations from investors in exchange for tokens (PEOPLE) using a multisig wallet with 13 signatories listed on its website. In one week, the DAO raised an impressive $40 million.  Takeaways  Although the DAO did not win the auction, it’s worth considering several takeaways from the episode, as they may apply to other DAOs.  The first one is about the token.  As per the terms and conditions made public on their website, donors were granted the right to redeem governance tokens that contained the right to vote on certain decisions. No, the tokens did not represent property portions of the Constitutional text (if they had won the auction), but the right to have a say on the proposal set forth by the DAO, including the management and presentation plans for the text. Ownership would be in the hands of a Delaware-based limited liability company (LLC) and thus its shareholders would effectively be the owners of such a valuable piece.  Read more: Will DAOs Replace Crypto Venture Capital?  The first question that comes to mind is this: Why would anyone in their right mind be willing to exclude and waive shareholder limited liability and go for a structure that pretty much increases it at an exponential level?  With many DAOs, a Delaware-based LLC holds all the ownership rights and serves as the beneficiary of the funds – or part of them – raised in a token sale launched by a DAO. It has no other responsibility than to forward proposals on the asset exposure based on a vote with crypto.  Both ConstitutionDAO and Flaming DAO – focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – employed LLCs acting in support of virtual tokenized structures (DAOs). And the reason is obvious: operational agreements like LLCs are used to limit members’ liabilities and fiduciary obligations, to the extent permitted by the corresponding law.  DAO participants launch DAOs once they have this legal peace of mind. But if the back ends of DAOs end up being limited companies plus an operational agreement to warrant liability restriction, aren’t DAOs just the pretty, tokenized front ends?  Read more: What Is a DAO?  If they need to count with a legal, territorially bounded company that is used to specifically override the essence of a decentralized organization, are DAOs like ConstitutionDAO real DAOs?  Embryonic efforts  Is there a rush to push DAOs as revolutionary corporate structures when they still might be in an embryonic first phase of social experiments?  I look at the DAO space and definitely can see how tokens, governance systems, cross-border and trustless relationships can help with executing completely legitimate causes (like ConstitutionDAO). I also believe this may be the right path towards more complex and perhaps legally self-sufficient constructions. But we’re not there yet.  Before we can figure out a way to make DAOs legally more efficient and safer than vintage limited companies, and that will be hard to accomplish, DAOs are in the practice acting as a front end only. At the moment, the back end is represented by an old fashioned regulated corporate structure that grants certain protective rights very much appreciated when engaging in international, trustless, crypto adventures.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | PEOPLE | TOKEN SALE,Cristina Carrascosa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/07/most-daos-are-decentralized-in-name-only,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/402a8389e59d9f6727213717ee6c6e7200a7d5f7-5757x3843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Friday, former Twitter Spaces lead data scientist Julien Gaillard announced on Twitter that he was stepping away from the social media giant to become the data science lead for lending behemoth Aave.  Aave is one of DeFi’s pre-eminent protocols, commanding $12.89 billion in total value locked as the fourth-largest project per DeFiLlama. In recent months, Aave founder Stani Kulechov has been teasing a possible social media offering, at one point going so far as to say that the protocol was pondering “Twitter on Ethereum.”  “It goes without saying that Web3 has the ability to empower users more than the social media created by big tech and this empowerment is attractive for many people working in Big Tech to join Web3,” said Kulechov in a statement to CoinDesk. Other recent hires include Jessica Sit, a former Apple team lead, to head Aave’s marketing and content efforts, as well as Christina Beltramini, a former Tik Tok business development specialist as head of partnerships.  Kulechov also wrote on Twitter that he was “Excited to work with @juliengaillard on decentralized social media.” However, sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that Gaillard’s responsibilities might focus more on the existing DeFi offerings.  Despite his clear experience in the sector, Gaillard won’t be working entirely on the possible social media push, and will instead head an expanded data science division to help the protocol “be more analytical on our risk analyses and data-driven decision making on the product side,” the source said.

42423927,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNXh,1641575986,A16z Publishes Web 3 Policy Proposal for World Leaders,"If you’re a world leader hoping to transform your country into a global Web 3 hub, Andreessen Horowitz wants to show you the way.  On Friday, the venture capital firm – often called a16z for short – released a policy agenda aimed at global governments with 10 guiding principles on how to “build a better internet.”  In the agenda, a16z encourages world leaders to think proactively about Web 3 policy, starting by establishing a clear vision, providing clear and fair tax rules as they apply to digital assets, embracing multi-stakeholder governance and more.  Web 3 refers to a possible next generation of the internet that encompasses decentralized protocols and aims to reduce internet users’ dependency on tech giants like Facebook and Amazon.  The policy agenda is not a first for Andreessen Horowitz.  Last October, the VC firm put out a similar 35-page report aimed at U.S. lawmakers called “How to Win the Future,” as well as recommendations to the Senate Banking Committee on clarifying the laws around digital assets. A16z’s policy push is mirrored by similar efforts undertaken by Coinbase, which released its Digital Asset Policy Proposal calling for the creation of a new regulator to oversee the crypto industry. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange FTX has published several blog posts on what regulatory policy could look like.  The globally-reaching policy agenda, penned by former U.S. diplomat Tomicah Tillemann – now the global head of policy for a16z – is the product of what Tillemann described as a “demand driven effort” to respond to an influx of global leaders reaching out to a16z for help shaping policy frameworks for Web 3.  “We are seeing a growing number of governments approaching us saying that they want to be Web 3 republics,” Tillemann said.  Tillemann, one of a16z’s partners, told CoinDesk that the VC firm has spoken with “key leaders on every populated continent,” though he declined to name any countries a16z is working with.  The policy agenda also recommends that global leaders “embrace the role of well-regulated stablecoins,” and provide clear regulatory frameworks for private stablecoin projects.  Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) might be gaining speed around the world, but Tillemann was adamant that any development of CBDCs should take place in conjunction with “the vibrant private marketplace for stablecoins” and that it would be a “mistake” to focus solely on CBDCs.  “We need the dynamism and the innovation that exists in a private stablecoin marketplace in order to ensure the optimal outcomes,” Tillemann told CoinDesk. “There’s a reason why people benefit from having a choice of different payment mechanisms.”  Tillemann also said that a global focus on CBDCs over stablecoins would put the U.S. at a disadvantage.  “[The U.S. is] behind the curve and other countries, particularly authoritarian countries, are much further along in developing CBDC architecture,” Tillemann said.  The former U.S. official also took a jab at American lawmakers, saying:  “It’s important for U.S. policymakers and regulators to understand that we are far behind in a race that many of them don’t seem to recognize is underway,” Tillemann told CoinDesk. He believes the fact that a16z published the policy agenda might serve to emphasize this point.  “We think [the global policy agenda] is a useful reminder to policymakers in the United States that other governments are not standing still – in fact, they are moving at light speed in many cases to adopt and embrace these innovations in a way that U.S. policymakers are frankly struggling with.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/07/a16z-publishes-web-3-policy-proposal-for-world-leaders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4db23f02f78a895bf984fe53346eb609b254b465-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411583,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOtEn,1641574712,Kazakh Mining Slide Offers Lesson for US Lawmakers,"A big disruption in Bitcoin’s hashrate this week can be pinned on one man: Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who after declaring a state of emergency during opposition protests ordered telecom carriers to impose an internet blackout, which meant Kazakh-based Bitcoin miners couldn’t operate.  Does this indicate that Bitcoin is becoming vulnerable to geopolitical risks? Not really. In many other ways Bitcoin has become more resilient after China’s crackdown last year led to a diversification of mining around the world. Bitcoin’s recent performance reinforces that dynamic adaptability.  Still, there are vital lessons to draw from the fact that the Bitcoin mining economy was materially impacted by the actions of a single dictator, one whose Central Asian country now occupies a large post-China place in that economy, to which it supplies cheap-but-dirty coal-based power.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The U.S. Congress, which is now reportedly planning hearings to address some lawmakers’ concerns about energy usage by Bitcoin mining, should heed those lessons.  A draconian response in Washington (e.g. in limiting miners’ energy access) would encourage U.S.-based miners to move to countries like Kazakhstan that are doing close to nothing to expand renewable energy. Alternatively, if Congress was to seize this moment – when the appeal of authoritarian states as homes for crypto businesses has been tarnished – it could craft a constructive policy framework that aligns Bitcoin mining with green energy expansion and supports the kind of democratic freedoms Kazahks deserve.  How great is the Great Hashrate Migration?  According to MiningPoolStats, hash power commanded by the largest mining pools – a reasonable proxy for overall Bitcoin hashrate – shrank by a hefty 12.7% on Wednesday.  To be sure, the decline was likely exaggerated by other factors. First, it came just after network capacity reached a new all-time high early in the new year. Second, it coincided with a sharp plunge in bitcoin’s price – induced by news of tighter U.S. monetary policy – which likely led some miners to power down their more inefficient, loss-making machines.  Still, it was an especially pronounced decline. And unlike the seemingly anomalous occasional blips – such as the Nov. 24 fall in hashrate, apparently caused by a technical outage at the Binance mining pool, seen in the chart below – this one’s main cause was a political event.  This was also the first, tangibly negative aspect of what has otherwise been a positive story: that the Bitcoin network not only took just six months to recover from China’s crackdown on miners in May and June but did so with far greater geographical diversity than was previously the case.  After Chinese authorities shuttered a massive 90 terahashes per second (TH/S) of hashpower – then half of Bitcoin’s global capacity – miners ended up relocating across a range of countries with a variety of political systems and energy mixes, ranging from renewables-centric economies to coal-dependent. As of August, the U.S. was the largest player, accounting for 35% of total capacity, according to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, with Kazakhstan in second place at 18.1%.  That a dictator from the latter could single-handedly cause such a contraction in the network doesn’t necessarily undermine the thesis that this more decentralized, diversified geographic spread is more secure. After all, the Kazakh hashrate closure – most likely temporary – was nowhere near as disruptive as China’s more permanent move to shut down 50% of the network. Nonetheless, it brings home certain grounded realities often overlooked by crypto utopianists, who portray Bitcoin as an unstoppable, independent system for human beings to autonomously store and exchange value.  One is the continued importance of nation-states and of the capacity of their leaders to set rules that impact Bitcoin. (This can be positive as much as negative – witness bitcoiners’ enthusiasm for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s move to make the cryptocurrency legal tender in his country.)  The other was that access to Bitcoin depends on internet availability. It’s true that the private and public keys with which people control their bitcoin balances can exist offline and survive outages. But if there’s no access to the internet in a certain location, users there can’t exchange funds and miners can’t participate in generating and validating blocks of transactions.  Still, you’d be foolish to see this as a sign of Bitcoin’s fatal flaw. The bigger story of the past year was that the Bitcoin ecosystem proved remarkably adaptable. In the wake of the China shutdown, miners showed an openness to new frontiers, both toward geographical locations and toward new, nimble business models that made it profitable to mine with renewable energy in places where it previously wasn’t. (I again urge you to read this CoinDesk column by Nic Carter on the ways in which mining has evolved this past year.)  Pay attention, Congress  All of this is greatly relevant to members of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Energy and Commerce Committee, which is expected to soon hold hearings on the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.  There are concerns – quite legitimate, I’d say – that the surge in U.S. mining has in some places led owners of previously shuttered coal plants to start servicing Bitcoin miners. That is inflating the price of electricity in communities where it is scarce. But if a knee-jerk instinct among Democrats is to follow China’s book and ban mining, they will only drive the industry offshore, to places where fossil fuels are more readily and cheaply available – places like Kazakhstan.  Right now, miners are likely weighing whether the costly disruption from the Central Asian country’s political crisis is worth the benefits that accrue from the subsidies its government provides to the local coal industry to keep power cheap. Why give them a reason to overlook such political risks?  Policymakers should think holistically about three realities. One is that climate change is not going away. The other is that Bitcoin is not going away. The third is that Bitcoin’s geography-agnostic miners are highly adaptable and will continue to seek out the most cost-effective energy sources anywhere and anyhow.  How to marry those realities? With policies that incentivize miners to use green energy and, with the perpetual revenue stream they generate, to underwrite the development of renewable energy infrastructure for the benefits of society at large.  Do that and you’ll not only have a net carbon-negative impact, you’ll be denying dictators like Tokayev an investment source with which to finance the planet-destroying industries that fund the apparatus with which he oppresses his people.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Michael J.

42423926,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNRh,1641574581,"WisdomTree Adds Bitcoin Futures Exposure to Fund, Refiles for Spot ETF","WisdomTree, an asset manager with over $76 billion in assets under management, announced Thursday that it had added bitcoin futures exposure to its commodities-focused Managed Futures Strategy exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The move comes a month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected WisdomTree’s application for a spot bitcoin ETF, though the company has since refiled.  Last fall, WisdomTree indicated plans to add up to a 5% bitcoin futures exposure to the Managed Futures Strategy Fund, which was launched in 2011 and has about $164 million in assets. The company has now added an approximate 1.5% allocation to bitcoin futures contracts. The fund has no plans to invest in bitcoin directly.  WisdomTree isn’t new to giving bitcoin futures exposure to its fund, having added a 3% allocation to its Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund (GCC) in October.  “Our view was that bitcoin is serving a role similar to gold and why people buy gold in commodities strategies,” said Jeremy Schwartz, global chief investment officer of WisdomTree, in an interview with CoinDesk.  WisdomTree is embracing a long investment strategy with bitcoin futures. “Right now, we are not going short on bitcoin futures. We think there is more risk [in shorting] given the volatility,” said Schwartz.  The SEC has created a path for bitcoin futures funds to go public. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF began trading in October and VanEck debuted a fund the following month.  Spot bitcoin ETFs, however, have faced much stronger regulatory resistance. WisdomTree and VanEck have both had their applications denied, and the SEC this week delayed a decision on NYDIG’s spot ETF filing. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has indicated a number of times that he prefers a bitcoin futures ETF over a fund with direct bitcoin exposure.  “We’ve said that for a 100% bitcoin fund, we prefer the spot. We have not filed for a 100% futures [fund]. For a 3% to 5% position, we think that futures are a reasonable access tool. But for a 100% position, we think that you want the spot,” said Schwartz. “We’re making our filings as strong and compelling as possible, and you’ve got to get over the different issues from the SEC.”  CORRECTION (Jan. 10, 23:16 UTC): Corrects allocation in third paragraph to 1.5% from 1.3%.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/07/wisdomtree-adds-bitcoin-futures-exposure-to-fund-refiles-for-spot-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df92a28827493fd8b56f4cc94645e1c4d075260f-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The protocol, which lets users curate their own NFT galleries and museums, raised $3.8 million in a funding round led by Electric Capital and IDEO CoLab Ventures.  JPG’s mission is to provide “increased discovery and context for NFTs,” providing curatorial experiences on par with the world of fine art.  “The scope we’re aiming for is bigger than just artworks,” JPG co-founder Sam Spike told CoinDesk in an interview. “While building relationships with existing galleries is important, our thesis about the cultural importance of NFTs extends into gaming assets, tokenized literature or collectibles, Apes, Cats, whatever it may be.”  The platform has already been responsible for a slew of successful showings in recent months, including generative art showcase “The Digital,” which debuted at Miami’s Art Basel festival in December.  Much skepticism remains about the longevity of the digital art trend, but its impact over the last year has been undeniable. In 2021, nearly $41 billion of Ethereum-based NFTs were sold, while the total value of the traditional art market was estimated to be just $50 billion, according to data from the Financial Times.

The team behind one of Solana’s largest projects is midway through a $100 million fundraising to expand operations. According to a press release provided to CoinDesk, the Incentive Ecosystem Foundation, the legal entity staffing the team behind the orderbook-based decentralized exchange, is raising the funds to hire and move into new product verticals, including “NFTs, gaming, metaverse and DAO tooling.”  So far the round includes participation from Commonwealth Asset Management LP, Tagus, Tiger Global and executives at Golden Tree Asset Management.  According to pseudonymous Serum core contributor JHL, the Incentive Ecosystem Foundation is an entity used to give contributors salaries and benefits. It will also manage the Serum Ecosystem Fund, which holds tokens in the Serum and Solana ecosystem, including projects like Raydium and Bonfida.  Buyers in the round received both Serum’s SRM tokens as well as a portion of the ecosystem fund, with 85% going into the fund.  Ecosystem funds are a growing trend among major projects. The funds source deals within their particular ecosystem, fostering early-stage companies and sending tokens from those projects to fund liquidity providers. One recent example is Avalanche’s $100 million “Blizzard Fund.”  Read more: Avalanche Developers and Investors Form $200M ‘Blizzard’ Investment Fund  JHL told CoinDesk that the fundraising is still ongoing.  “In committed capital, we’re right around $70 million,” he said, adding that the investments are locked for one year with a linear vesting schedule over an additional five years.  The raise comes at a time when Serum is attempting to “further decentralize from the Alameda and FTX family,” JHL said. It also comes as the crypto markets are tanking, with Solana’s SOL among the top losers in recent days.  Read more: Polkadot, Solana Biggest Losers Among Top Cryptos  “Serum was originally founded by [FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried], and at the time most of the contributors to Serum were employees of Alameda and FTX. Over time, both due to the evolving regulatory landscape as well as the desire to include the community further in Serum’s future, we’ve now decentralized Serum – it has its own employees, it’s completely separate in a legal sense and in every way possible,” he said.  The Incentive Ecosystem Foundation will use the funds to help Serum become a self-sufficient entity and expand operations. Per JHL, the team is currently “five-to-10 people, really,” and a major use of the funding will be to expand the marketing and technical teams.

Coinsuper had $14 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours, a tiny fraction of Binance’s $22 billion 24-hour volume, data from CoinMarketCap shows. At its peak in late 2019, Coinsuper handled $1.3 billion in daily volume, Bloomberg wrote.  One of the venture capitalists that had backed Coinsuper told Bloomberg that they had completely written off their $1 million investment in the exchange. Six to eight months ago, the VC lost contact with the exchange’s management team, while Chairman and CEO Karen Chen stopped responding on WeChat, Bloomberg said. Chen is the former president of UBS China.  Between July and December, several employees also left the company, according to the report.  The exchange, founded in 2017, is backed by Pantera Capital, which still lists Coinsuper as a portfolio company on its website.

42423930,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNPh,1641557178,Turkish Lira Is Now More Volatile Than Bitcoin,"The Turkish lira is now more volatile than bitcoin.  The currency’s 90-day historical volatility, a measure of how much the price fluctuated from its average, against the U.S. dollar has risen to an annualized 65%, TradingView data show. That’s a fivefold increase in two months. Bitcoin’s historical volatility has dropped to 61%.  Rising historical volatility implies prices have been moving more than usual. Assets with high volatility readings are considered risky investments, which means the lira, a sovereign currency, is now riskier than bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created and distributed on a peer-to-peer basis and often criticized for being unreliable as a medium of exchange and store of value because of its high price turbulence.  The lira crashed from roughly 9 per dollar to 18.5 in the six weeks to mid-December before strengthening to as high as 10. At press time, it was trading at 13.83. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has followed a strategy of reducing interest rates at times of rising inflation, which contradicts economic orthodoxy, and has replaced central bankers who opposed the cuts.  “Lower interest rates amidst high inflation is going to lead to people selling the currency – a recipe for disaster according to traditional theory,” David Belle, founder of Macrodesiac.com and U.K. growth director at TradingView, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  In November, the lira weakened when Turkey cut borrowing costs for a third straight month even as inflation surged. When battling high inflation, countries typically use rate increases and other tools to suck liquidity out of the market. Rate hikes boost the yield on the domestic currency and typically lead to exchange-rate appreciation. As the currency strengthens, the cost of imported goods declines.  Bitcoin, which has a programmed or fixed monetary policy, provides a contrast, especially for troubled economies. The cryptocurrency’s pace of supply expansion is cut by 50% every four years through programmed code that reduces the mining reward.  The lira’s 90-day historical volatility is now significantly higher than the single-digit readings of major fiat currencies like the euro, pound and yen. Still, it remains less volatile than meme cryptocurrencies like dogecoin and shiba inu.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/07/turkish-lira-is-now-more-volatile-than-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78664d09d7ebfb8c32d6f67ade8b604c55a34a04-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423929,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNZh,1641549915,Ether Sees Higher Liquidations Than Bitcoin After Falling Under $3.2K,"Traders racked up $182 million in losses on ether-tracked futures products in the past 24 hours, according to data from analytics tools Coinglass. That is $14 million higher than bitcoin-tracked futures, which usually see the largest liquidations in the crypto market, during a comparable period.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  Over 87% of the total $182 million in losses came from long positions, while only $22 million worth of short positions were liquidated. The majority of the liquidations occurred on crypto exchange OKEx, which saw almost $79 million in losses, followed by FTX at $27.6 million.  Longs are futures positions that bet on rising prices of their underlying assets. Shorts, on the other hand, are futures trades that bet on declining prices.  Ether lost its $3,300 support level in early Asian trading hours on Friday, plunging to as low as $3,113 before briefly gaining over $90 at the time of writing. Friday’s drop was a continuation of a market-wide decline that started on Wednesday. The U.S. Federal Reserve released the minutes of its December meeting that signaled a tightening of financial policies and caused a sell-off in risky assets.  The relative strength index (RSI) reached oversold levels again on Friday after briefly venturing out of that zone on Thursday night. RSI is a technical tool used to measure the magnitude of price movements, and oversold levels imply assets might be undervalued after a price correction.  Ether failed to break over and hold above the $4,000 price level in December, implying a weakening market at the time.  Among the major sellers in the past two months was the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit that oversees development on the Ethereum network. The foundation moved 20,000 ethers, worth over $90 million at the time, from its cold wallet to crypto exchange Kraken in November, which may have contributed to some of the selling pressure in the past two months.

42423933,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNdh,1641549210,Avalanche-Based Wonderland Makes Seed Investment in Betting Dapp,"Algorithmic money market Wonderland has made a seed investment in Polygon blockchain-based decentralized betting application BetSwap, the team said in a post on Friday.  The move marked one of the first instances of a community-governed crypto project investing in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that relies on smart contracts instead of third parties for providing financial services, such as lending, borrowing and trading, to users.  Wonderland users (self-styled as the “frog nation” in crypto circles) who stake assets on the Wonderland platform will receive BetSwap tokens once they are issued. BetSwap allows users to bet on or be a bookmaker for a variety of markets, such as sports. Its BSGG tokens allow holders to get discounted platform fees and participant in platform governance.  According to the post, about 2 billion BSGG tokens were allocated for $18.3 million worth of wMEMO, a freely traded token that represents the amount of TIME – the native token of Wonderland – staked by users.  What Wonderland brings to the table is both funds and a dedicated community that interact with crypto protocols. “Wonderland is offering a unique perspective for early projects: the eyes and opinions of a vibrant, fast-growing crypto community which is aligned to its treasury and the success of these early-stage investments by holding the wMEMO token,” developers said in the post.  Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) like Wonderland let their token holders propose improvements and govern decisions pertaining to the growth of such platforms. They differ from traditional companies, where decisions may be driven by a board of directors and private investors instead of users.  New use cases of DAOs are extending from mere governance to investments in other protocols, where participants receive token allocations based on the amounts invested or staked in DAOs.  Wonderland and the Frog Nation  Wonderland’s TIME tokens are backed with a basket of underlying assets issued over the Avalanche blockchain, giving the tokens an intrinsic value that they cannot fall below. TIME is what the platform calls “money” – a wholly decentralized means of value backed by liquidity provided by the platform’s own users.  Among Wonderland’s objectives is to invest in other DeFi protocols using funds staked by its users, in exchange for tokens.  This is part of a rising anti-venture capitalist narrative by the frog nation’s “frogs” – a bunch of common men and women using technology and crypto to capitalize on opportunities and provide value to protocols, instead of seed funding rounds and investments mostly benefiting venture funds and well-connected private investors.  Read more: Will DAOs Replace Crypto Venture Capital?  Wonderland and its creator Daniele Sestagalli shot to popularity in November on the back of the successes of both OlympusDAO, an Ethereum-based algorithmic currency protocol that inspired Wonderland, and Abracadabra, an Ethereum-stablecoin lending project built by Sestagalli.  Sestagalli has since gained even more popularity in crypto circles by using a community-first approach in an attempt to bring value to protocol users. And the community is betting big on what Sestagalli touches: A Sestagalli proposal to take over Ethereum DeFi protocol Sushi in December saw the SUSHI token rise by as much as 10%, as earlier reported.  Sestagalli says DAOs can get better deals than venture funds because of their communities. “DAO can compete with VCs getting even better deal flow thanks to the value proposition of a Community of investors rather than a few suits,” he tweeted on Friday.  TIME’s price saw a brief bump up following Friday’s announcement but lost 3.2% in the past 24 hours amid a plunge in the broader market.

Mining revenue, however, fell to £7.82 million ($10.6 million) even as the number of BTC mined increased from 185 because of sharp dip in bitcoin’s price throughout the month.  Argo mined fewer bitcoin in 2021 than Bitfarms (3,452) and Marathon Digital (3,197) did.  Last year, Argo purchased a data center in West Texas and 20,000 Bitmain Antminer S19J Pro machines to fill it. The firm expects to see its hashrate increase by more than 2 exahash per second (EH/s) to a total of 3.7 EH/s when the center is completed in the first half of this year.  In addition to trading on the LSE, Argo is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market.  The London shares were trading up about 5% at the time of publication.

42375546,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wcP,1641536478,"Bitcoin Slips to 3-Month Low, Analysts Divided on Impact of Fed’s Tightening","Bitcoin continues to lose ground as minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting released earlier this week flagged the chance of a faster policy tightening.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to $41,012 during Friday’s Asia trading session, hitting its lowest level since Sept. 29 and taking the weekly decline to 12%, CoinDesk data show.  The downward move gathered pace on Wednesday after the Fed minutes revealed policymakers discussed aggressive interest rate hikes alongside a faster pace of balance sheet normalization, dubbed quantitative tightening (QT) – the opposite of liquidity-boosting balance sheet expansion. The hawkish tone took a toll on equities, with tech stocks bleeding for the second consecutive day on Thursday.  “Bitcoin has been trading as a risk-of/risk-off asset lately and seems to be tracking equities lower,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, said about $200 million in long positions have been liquidated in the past couple of hours, pushing the spot price lower. Kssis added that leverage remains high and a further drop below $40,000 may be seen, more so if bond yields continue to rise on the Fed’s hawkish stance.  The popular narrative is that Fed’s plans to shrink its balance sheet and raise rates concurrently could lead to prolonged asset price deflation.  “It’s time to evaluate the conviction you have in whether positive interest rates could damage equity portfolio and see further global downward pressures,” Kssis said. “A 60/40 equities-to-bonds portfolio mix means that if the 60% in equities declines, big fund managers automatically sell bonds to maintain the ratio.”  “So if the Fed allows equity prices to fall, it will increase the borrowing costs of the governments because as bond prices fall, yields rise !!! That could trigger more selling in BTC,” Kssis added.  On Thursday, the U.S. two-year Treasury yield, which mimics short-term interest rate and inflation expectations better than the 10-year yield does, rose to a 22-month high of 0.87%. The short-term yield has more than doubled to 0.76% in the past quarter, according to TradingView. The yields may rise further if the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC on Friday show the pace of job additions nearly doubled to 400,000 in December, as expected. That would validate the Fed’s recent hawkish pivot.  According to Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra Markets, the macro story has become worse for crypto in the past few months. “Stay bearish crypto as Fed’s QT plan accelerates. The macro story has gotten even worse for crypto since I started talking about the crypto bear case in November,” Donnelly said in an analysis note shared on Twitter.  “Markets tend to view QT as the most risk-negative brand of tightening policy from the Fed because it’s the inverse of the aggressive monetary easing that triggers a Pavlovian “BUY EVERYTHING” reaction each time the Fed eases,” Donnelly said.  Some observers suggest otherwise. “The fears of a prolonged bear market in stocks and digital assets might be overblown as historically markets have remained resilient during tightening cycles,” Arca’s Dorman said.  Indeed, bitcoin pretty much remained bid through the major part of the previous tightening cycle that began in December 2015 and ended in December 2018. The cryptocurrency rallied from roughly $350 to nearly $20,000 in the two years to December 2017 before entering a yearlong bear market.  Further, stock markets came under pressure in the final quarter of 2018 – after nearly two years of rate hikes, as Dorman said on Twitter.  “Bottom line -- the Fed raising rates is not what causes big, long-lasting market selloffs... it’s AFTER very long Fed hike cycles when markets typically face sustained declines and recessions happen,” Dorman tweeted.  Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone foresees bitcoin and crypto benefitting from the tightening cycle. “Expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 may support a win-win scenario for Bitcoin vs. the stock market, McGlone said in a research note published Thursday. “Stretched markets have become common, but commodities and Bitcoin appear to be early reversion leaders. It’s a question of bull-market duration, and we see the benchmark crypto coming out ahead.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/07/bitcoin-slips-to-3-month-low-analysts-divided-on-impact-of-feds-tightening,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/daa18406dc7993ea677e2a568202e8922c5dd536-1690x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375556,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wnj,1641533922,The Inside Story of How India’s Crypto Exchanges Were ‘Inspected’ by Tax Agencies,"The Takeaway:  Tax agencies have several other crypto exchanges on their radar but expect these “inspections” to serve as a deterrent that will make the industry voluntarily fall in line.  Agencies have been examining crypto exchanges’ finances in India since August 2021, the investigation is still ongoing and currently focused on evaluating transactions to correctly assess tax liability.  The overall tax owed may be manifold the current amount of Rs 84.35 crore (i.e. 843.5 million Indian rupees, or $11.3 million), but calculating the tax on different types of transactions is a lengthy process. Currently, the tax owed has been self-calculated by exchanges but not verified as final amounts by agencies since data by exchanges has not been completely compiled and made available to agencies for verification.  Experts deeply entrenched in India’s crypto industry requested anonymity and said that “this was more willful evasion than interpretation-based ambiguity.”  A tax official flagged a mismatch between revenue earned, transactions made and tax paid by several crypto exchanges in India this past August.  This official did not open a formal investigation at the time – but within the next four months, tax agencies would collect over Rs 84 crore ($11 million) from less than half a dozen crypto exchanges in back taxes and fees.  “We keep on looking for data of different companies. We don’t necessarily open files. If we did, there would be hundreds of files for investigation,” said a source with direct knowledge of the matter, requesting not to be named.  The impression in the crypto industry has been that government officers are not tech-savvy and don’t understand crypto. But he wasn’t an ordinary tax official. He was part of a team that could trace its intellectual capacity to some of the finest technical institutions in India. This team had been watching the crypto space closely and, due to their technical background, equipped to understand the evolving space.  His job was to find and stop tax evasion and collect back taxes. The institution that gave him these powers was India’s Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGI), a body entrusted with the task of “collection, collation and dissemination of intelligence relating to evasion of indirect tax.” The DGGI functions under the purview of the all-powerful Ministry of Finance.  As the DGGI, which is a national law enforcement agency, began scrutinizing the tax returns of crypto exchanges, a similar, but independent operation had begun in India’s financial capital, Mumbai.  A regional agency tasked with fighting tax evasion in Mumbai, the Goods & Services Tax and Central Excise Mumbai Zone (CGST Mumbai Zone), had begun studying a big fish in India’s crypto-sphere – WazirX.  The relatively esoteric nature of cryptocurrencies and their exchanges was factored into the investigation. Since it was a brand new space for the tax agencies, the discoveries about crypto exchanges and the deeper nuances around cryptocurrencies occurred simultaneously.  This novelty and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto (India has yet to complete legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies) led to the agencies giving exchanges more room to operate. Exchanges and agencies refrained from calling what happened next as “raids,” which has a somewhat derogatory connotation associated with willful tax evasion.  CoinDesk spoke to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter to determine the sequence of events.  The ‘inspections’  The tax agencies insisted that they conducted “inspections” and after scrutinizing the limited documents (financial returns of exchanges) and third-party sourced information (intelligence gathering) they felt the need to check the books (seeking out documentary proof to make the case stick).  On Sept. 1, not too far from the DGGI office in New Delhi, an inspection team traveled to the outskirts of the national capital to the city of Noida, a tech hub and a major revenue contributor to India’s most populated state, Uttar Pradesh.  The team went to the office of BuyUCoin, owned by M/S I Block Technologies Pvt. LTD.  BuyUCoin was the first of four exchanges DGGI tax officials “inspected” because “it was the most obvious and glaring transgressor,” said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.  BuyUCoin refers to itself as “India’s Most Secure Crypto Exchange,” boasting of “1 [million] plus customers” and allowing customers and merchants to “buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the best prices.”  BuyUCoin’s transgression was not paying an 18% tax on the commission it earned on all its transactions on its platform since its inception in 2017.  India’s goods and services tax (GST) code was introduced in 2017 and had a tumultuous and controversial path. GST is an indirect tax that service providers, retailers and consumers must pay.  At the time, the company’s chartered accountant said that BuyUCoin did not need to pay taxes for crypto transactions. Between 2018 and mid-2020, the question of paying taxes did not arise as crypto transactions had more or less fizzled out after India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), published a circular effectively preventing banks from supporting or engaging with exchanges in crypto transactions.  In March 2020, the Indian Supreme Court countered the RBI’s stance, effectively reopening the gates for crypto in India. In late 2020, BuyUCoin reexamined its position on paying taxes by consulting a GST specialist. This specialist suggested BuyUCoin pay its unpaid tax dues, and it took the company more than eight months to collect data from the past 3 1/2 half years.  BuyUCoin CEO Shivam Thakral claims the exchange was about to pay up its dues in a few days, but tax officials entered its office on Sept. 1, 2021, around 2:00 p.m. They left around midnight, with Rs 1.04 crore (around $140,000) and a small sum of interest and penalties, taking a total of Rs 1.1 crore (around $147,600) in total. The penalty was provided voluntarily, not demanded. Tax officials have not determined the exact amount of penalty since the investigation is still ongoing.  The official BuyUCoin statement admitted “to some human mistakes from our end” due to a “lack of clarity on filing procedures.”  On Sept. 22, the same tax officials reached Mumbai to inspect CoinDCX, which is owned by M/s Neblio Technologies PVT. LTD.  The exchange describes itself as “India’s largest and safest cryptocurrency exchange.” CoinDCX says it has over 7.5 million active users and a daily turnover of Rs 100 crore ($13.4 million).  CoinDCX’s violation was similar to BuyUCoin.  “They too were suppressing their taxable value and not paying GST on every transaction they earned commission on,” said a source, and others agreed.  Additionally, CoinDCX said it was providing some export services, which are non-taxable, but in reality the exchange had made no exports at all.  CoinDCX paid Rs 15.7 crore as tax plus interest of Rs 1.4 crore for a total of Rs 17.1 crore (around $2.2 million). They did not pay any penalty.  By Oct. 7, the tax officials had reached the office of CoinSwitch Kuber, owned by M/s Bitcipher Labs LLP, in India’s IT hub, Bengaluru. CoinSwitch Kuber had 1 million Indian users at the start of 2021 but ended the year with 14 million and a 3,500% rise in transaction volume.  “CoinSwitch was a different case,” said a source with direct knowledge of the scrutiny.  “They were paying taxes on Indian transactions. However, they were also entertaining transactions by foreigners thinking it is export of services, which is not taxable. They were not taking into account the fact that whether it be an Indian or a foreign transaction they were making a commission and therefore that commission is taxable.”  CoinSwitch Kuber paid tax and interest to the tune of Rs 12.7 crore and interest of Rs 1 crore for a total of Rs 13.7 crore (around $1.8 million).  The next day, since the tax team was already in Bengaluru, they visited the office of UnoCoin, owned by Unocoin Technologies Pvt. LTD. UnoCoin has “1.5 million-plus people trading” on its platform and labels itself “India’s most trusted crypto exchange.”  UnoCoin was paying tax on transaction fees but not when they would tweak the buying and selling rate to make it competitive. They would keep the buying rate a little higher than the average buying rate and the selling rate a little lower than the average selling rate. They were not paying GST on the margins.  They paid tax, interest and penalty of Rs 1.8 crore, plus an interest of 1.1 crore, and a penalty of Rs 0.3 crore for a total of Rs 3.2 crore ($429,408).  The DGGI collected a total of Rs 35.1 crore ($4.71 million) from the four cryptocurrency exchanges. The tax amount was Rs 31 crore, but interest, and in some cases penalty, was additional as self-admitted liabilities.  Meanwhile, Mumbai’s regional agency, Goods & Services Tax and Central Excise Mumbai Zone (CGST Mumbai Zone), was scanning tax documents available to it related to India’s biggest exchange, WazirX, which is managed by M/s Zanmai Labs Pvt Ltd.  WazirX had announced that its user base had grown 10 times in 2021 to 10 million and recorded trading volumes of over $38 billion year to date.  By Dec. 30, CGST Mumbai Zone tweeted its findings, a tax violation of Rs 40.5 crore (approximately $6 million) and an additional Rs 8.7 crore as interest and penalties for a grand total of Rs 49.2 crore ($6.6 million).  WazirX said it had been “diligently paying tens of crores worth of GST every month” in a statement.  “There was an ambiguity in the interpretation of one of the components which led to a different calculation of GST paid. However, we voluntarily paid additional GST in order to be cooperative and compliant. There was and is no intention to evade tax. That being said, we strongly believe that regulatory clarity is the need of the hour for the Indian crypto industry. It will also provide us with more clarity on taxation so that we can work in sync with the lawmakers, and continue to be a responsible industry player,” the statement said.  The two agencies conducted five “inspections” that involved the “complete cooperation” of all five exchanges, more than 100 officers, in at least four cities, over several months, to recover Rs 84.35 crore ($11.3 million) in back taxes without any material seizures.  Algorithms  This Rs 84.35 crore sum was an accumulation of the taxes owed through August 2021 and based on data calculations by the cryptocurrency exchanges themselves. The exchanges’ algorithms have yet to collect complete data on all the transactions taking place regarding the matter and have yet to determine the tax figure due based on their misinterpretation of the law, whether willful or not.  All of the exchanges estimated and self-evaluated the figure they owed till August 2021 and paid interest as well as penalties in some cases based on those figures.  “Trade has been happening so fast that it is difficult for exchanges to determine their own taxable revenue,” the sources said.  Ambiguity or willful evasion  Sidharth Sogani, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency research organization Crebaco, said the 84.35 crore figure did not make any sense.  “In absence of regulations, the direct and indirect taxes are being charged based on assumptions. Without clear guidelines, you will not know who is right. The GST department should make that more clear,” Sogani said.  Not everyone agrees.  One individual, deeply entrenched in India’s crypto industry, requested anonymity because of potential partnerships with crypto exchanges, said that “this was more willful evasion than interpretation-based ambiguity.”  For exchanges to suggest outright ambiguity while paying back taxes and penalties appears disingenuous. Even if the exchanges are given the benefit of the doubt that they misunderstood the law, their interpretation appears to be both convenient and disproportionate, government and law experts suggested.  “Legislation around crypto may be awaited, but the law is absolutely clear about tax implications on services provided by way of facilitation of crypto trade,” a government source said.  “No question of willful evasion. This is purely an interpretive issue,” said Rajat Mittal, a Supreme Court lawyer dealing with taxation matters for more than a decade and who has a deep interest in the crypto-sphere. Mittal tweeted an entire thread about the “inspections.”  “Paying up the tax, interest and penalty, was not an admission of guilt. It was potentially to avoid a show-cause notice which would have not only prolonged the matter but would have also made them face a potential 100% penalty rather than 15% penalty, not to mention the ire of the power of tax agencies,” Mittal said.  Sources with direct knowledge of the inspections believed the exchanges were trying to willfully evade paying taxes, but not necessarily to make a profit. Instead, these individuals believe the startups were caught in a perfect storm of focusing on building their businesses to cater to the concerns of venture capitalists, adding customers, inadequate taxation background of young founders and a careless attitude towards the complicated nature of taxation calculations while regulations are awaited.  “In preliminary scrutiny you don’t know if the taxpayer is genuine or has a mala fide intention,” said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. “The investigation is still going on. But prima facie this appears willful. It is unbelievable that with venture capitalist funding, big legal teams, and IT experts, this would happen. They knew what they were doing.”  A spokesperson for WazirX explained there needs to be clarity on classification of fees received on coins and better understanding is required in terms of different layers of taxation for the crypto asset industry.  “Even industry bodies believe the tax department’s stand is justified” as reported by Economic Times.  “It is absolutely clear. The exchanges were trying to evade tax to make profits. There can be no other logical reason for such a convenient interpretation,” said Vijay Pal Dalmia, a lawyer who was the first to approach the Supreme Court of India in 2017 seeking a complete ban on cryptocurrencies.  On the other hand, “why would Indian crypto exchanges relishing in a burgeoning sector, take such a needless risk for such tiny profits?” asked Mittal.  They are well aware of the potential whiplash they could face from unfriendly regulatory watchdogs and the government, which has reportedly already decided to ban private cryptocurrencies, Mittal said. The potential for future growth far outweighs the needless risk in this case.  A government source believed their actions will act as deterrents, and other crypto exchanges will fall in line and pay up unpaid taxes.  Although the tax authorities did admit that other crypto platforms were on their radar, they did not share the number of platforms they were considering “inspecting.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/07/the-inside-story-of-how-indias-crypto-exchanges-were-inspected-by-tax-agencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25369121b28c53d1ed00a82618b7e068129b7887-4000x2668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
