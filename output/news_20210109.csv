42385559,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2K2d,1610224105,Bitcoin Miners Saw 33% Revenue Increase in December,"Bitcoin miners generated an estimated $692 million in revenue in December, up 33% from November, according to on-chain data from Coin Metrics analyzed by CoinDesk.      Extending November’s own 48% increase, miner revenues continued to soar as bitcoin rallied over 300% last year, briefly trading above $29,000 for the first time ever on New Year’s Eve.      Revenue estimates assume miners sell their BTC immediately.      Measured by per terahash per second (TH/s), miner revenues nearly tripled in the past three months, reaching $0.284 Thursday, per data from Luxor Technologies, its highest level since August 2019, as CoinDesk previously reported.      Network fees brought in $68.3 million in December, or nearly 10% of total revenue, a slight percentage decrease from the 10.5% of revenue represented by fees in November.      Fees were quite volatile in December, bouncing between $4 to all the way to above $12 throughout the month, per Coin Metrics.      Notably, fees as a percentage of total revenue continues a strong upward trend since April, prior to the network’s third-ever block subsidy halving in May. Increases in fee revenue are important to sustain the network’s security as the subsidy decreases every four years.      Taking advantage of the revenue increase, miners are bringing more machines online, pushing the network’s difficulty to record highs after Saturday’s adjustment.      What’s more, miners have ordered so many new machines to capitalize on the period of increased profitability that leading manufacturer Bitmain, for example, has sold out until August even after nearly doubling the price of some models.

42385552,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2JrJ,1610217616,Wrapped Bitcoin ‘Burns’ Outpaced Minting for the First Time in December,"Traders are swapping their tokenized bitcoins for the real thing more than ever.    BitGo saw a record 11,613 wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) swapped for real bitcoin (BTC) in December, with only 2,731 BTC exchanged for the bitcoin-backed ERC-20 tokens last month.  December marked the first time in the young project’s history that “burns,” the reversion of WBTC back to BTC, have outnumbered “mints.”  The total value of the “burned” WBTC is approximately $235 million, based on bitcoin’s price at the time the tokens were swapped for BTC.  Diminishing yields in decentralized finance (DeFi), a primary use case for WBTC, and increased trading activity on traditional cryptocurrency exchanges amid bitcoin’s recent eye-popping surge are likely reasons for the increase in burns and slowed rate of minting.  Most of the burns came from trading firms Alameda Research and Three Arrows Capital.  BitGo’s Wrapped Bitcoin project gained wide popularity through Q3 and early Q4 2020 amid a DeFi frenzy that saw over 124,000 BTC tokenized on Ethereum at its peak after starting the year with less than 600 BTC.  In mid August, demand for WBTC was so high that bitcoins were being tokenized faster than they were being mined.

42385560,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2K1N,1610213438,Long-Desired Bitcoin ETF Could Actually Hurt Price in Short Term: JPMorgan,"While a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) would be a long-term positive, in the short term it could hurt the price of the leading cryptocurrency as it would draw institutional money from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), currently the only way for some on Wall Street to gain exposure to bitcoin, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a report.    Optimism over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving a bitcoin ETF this year has grown due to the likelihood of a new commissioner being appointed this year, the report notes.  But that change would give competition to GBTC, which benefits from being the only game in town. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Due to regulatory and other restrictions, some financial institutions and funds can't directly own bitcoin or even buy shares directly from Grayscale. To get in on the bitcoin action, they have little choice but to buy GBTC shares on the secondary market at a premium. With an ETF, that premium would shrink, reducing the attractiveness of GBTC shares.  A shrinking GBTC premium would also diminish the allure of a popular trade, the analysts wrote. Right now, some institutional investors buy GBTC at net asset value with the intent of selling after the mandatory six-month lockup period expires to capitalize on that premium. Should the premium drop due to the coming introduction of an ETF, it would diminish the popularity of buying GBTC at NAV for that purpose.  The JPMorgan analysts estimate the GBTC premium monetization trade could account for around 15% of outstanding GBTC stock.  The prospect of a bitcoin ETF and the resulting diminishing GBTC premium could also lead some institutional investors who bought in in the second half of last year to sell when their six-month lock-up expires, further putting downward pressure on GBTC premiums, the analysts wrote.

42385553,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Jq3,1610206049,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits Record High Amid Miner Revenue Surge,"Bitcoin’s mining difficulty just reached a record high above 20.6 trillion as more people are mining at a larger scale than ever before thanks to ballooning mining revenue and bitcoin’s parabolic price rally.      “A new difficulty all-time high is no surprise considering mining revenue has tripled in recent months,” said Edward Evenson, business development lead at Braiins, a mining software company that recently acquired full ownership of leading pool Slush Pool after being majority stakeholders since 2013.      Saturday's adjustment at block 665,280 marks an 11% increase from the last adjustment on Dec. 27.      Difficulty is a relative measure of the amount of resources required to mine bitcoin that climbs or falls depending on the amount of computing power consumed by the network, known as its hashrate.      As bitcoin’s price continues to soar – almost touching $42,000 Friday – miner revenues keep pace, incentivizing even more participants to mine. Twelve months ago, bitcoin’s difficulty was below 15 trillion.      “I see this trend continuing in the first half of 2021,” Evenson told CoinDesk.    'Show me the money'    Signalling even more upward difficulty adjustments in the future, mining companies plan to capitalize on higher revenues at such a scale that their orders for new machines have left leading manufacturers like Bitmain sold out until August even after nearly doubling the price of some models.      “ASIC manufacturers have had to turn away more than half a billion dollars in mining equipment orders in Q4 2020 alone,” Evenson said. “Hardware supply chains are currently overloaded by immense demand.”      Companies like Core Scientific are handily contributing to the overload with massive 59,000-machine orders from Bitmain, which are set to triple its mining capacity.    Publicly traded mining firms like Riot Blockchain (RIOT)https://hashrateindex.com/stocks/riot and Marathon Patent Group (MARA)https://hashrateindex.com/stocks/mara placed similar pre-orders for 31,000 and 90,000 machines through 2020, respectively.    Based on the ongoing mining frenzy, Bitcoin’s hashrate is “likely to at least double in 2021,” Evenson predicts.    A major miner problem    More than an inconvenience, the current ASIC shortage signals a deeper fundamental weakness in the mining sector amid soaring revenues and activity.      “Right now, the biggest risk to the mining business is the ASIC shortage,” said Steve Barbour, president of portable mining infrastructure manufacturer Upstream Data, in a direct message with CoinDesk.      Barbour said he doesn’t see “any signs yet” that manufacturers are “ramping up fast enough” to meet the yet unabated surge in demand for machines. They aren't even pursuing temporary solutions like offering mid-tier machines for “miners who aren’t interested in high-priced, high-efficiency gear.”      With no signs of replenished supplies, miners have been scavenging secondary markets for any available and working machines, causing prices of some models to reach 12-month highs, per CoinDesk’s prior reporting.      The miner manufacturing business “definitely has room for more diversified competition,” Barbour said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/09/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-hits-record-high-amid-miner-revenue-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb5a2e6b4c898d84909fe825672c714bbaefb7de-1065x728.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform, which mainly caters to ""social"" or beginner traders, raised its required deposit level to $1,000 from $200.  The number of new registrations and the volume of deposits and trading on the platform hit all new highs in 2021, fueled by crypto, Amy Butler, global head of PR for eToro, said in an email to CoinDesk.  ""We have seen huge demand for crypto, especially bitcoin,"" she said.  While institutional funds were the main driver of the bull run last year, this report of ""unprecedented demand"" by eToro could be a sign that retail traders are finally starting to jump in with both feet.  ""In this first week of 2021 we have seen days with over 40,000 new registered users in a day and volumes of crypto trades at 10 times the average of last year,"" Butler said.

While last year's performance largely stayed off the front page of non-crypto publications, this year's string of all-time highs has been getting more and more attention from the mainstream media. This is undoubtedly creating increased interest and perhaps a ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO) on the part of retail investors, the likes of whom are now overwhelming eToro and potentially others.

42385563,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2K6P,1610197206,Think How Well Bitcoin Would Be Doing if You Could Actually Buy It,"For all the talk about bitcoin (and broadly crypto) being easier to buy than ever before, Friday morning, as bitcoin was topping $41,000 per coin, I spent hours trying to make a small $100 purchase.      According to some, the latest rally was initiated by institutional investors looking for a hedge against fiat inflation and the U.S. dollar's decline in foreign exchange markets, and they seem to be having no problem buying – the price has shot up $20,000 in less than a month.      But if my experience is an example of what other retail investors are dealing with, there's still plenty of frustration to be had with the crypto markets. And think how much higher the price could be if all these newbie investors could get their hands on some of that sweet, sweet digital gold.    Transaction declined    This maddening adventure into purchasing more bitcoin to hodl started not as panic that I was going to miss out; no, I've been in the space since late 2012 and have seen the majority of the bull runs and bear markets. I am in no hurry to buy at the top.      But I was using this revival as a time to set up recurring purchases with these mainstream mobile apps that are touting easy crypto buying as the technology matures.    See also: Bitcoin Trading Fees on PayPal, Robinhood, Cash App and Coinbase: What to Know    I started with Square's Cash App, an application I've used plenty, loading money into my account to then take advantage of the boosts, like $1 off any coffee-shop purchase. But when trying to set up a bi-weekly purchase of bitcoin, I got the ""something went wrong"" error message. What, though!? What the hell went wrong!? (Stock purchases were also declined.)      OK, no problem, I've had a Coinbase account for many years and have purchased crypto with that account, so that should be an easy buy. Except that it wasn't. After updating my card details from an old debit card, I put in a buy order that was promptly declined.      For f**k's sake.      Next, I tried Blockchain.com, what was probably my first bitcoin wallet ever, besides a paper wallet. That transaction was denied based on my residence being in New York where they don't operate (thanks a lot, BitLicense).      How about Gemini, then, where just a couple weeks ago, I purchased some DeFi tokens? On the first try, the purchase was declined because the market moved, so the displayed price had changed. I tried again – begrudgingly, because the fees on a $100 transaction were nearly $6.50 – and a couple seconds later received an email, ""Success! Your buy order is complete.""      Finally! Except, wait, nope, 30 minutes later I received another email stating the transfer failed and the buy order was not completed.      Maybe all these services are overwhelmed by demand? Both Coinbase and Kraken suffered outages this week during the run.      Robinhood was next. I was instructed to deposit money into my account before I could buy, but after putting my routing and account number in the app stated my financial institution is not supported (Robinhood seems to be using Plaid for connecting bank accounts).      Binance.US? Didn't work, either, again on the basis of not doing business with customers residing in New York. I tried inputting my parent's address in the Midwest, which allowed me a first level of verification, but to buy bitcoin you need to go through the advanced verification, requiring a picture of a bank statement or utility bill. My driver's license still shows my former Midwest address, but that wasn't a sufficient form of verification at this stage.      Lastly, it dawned on me that PayPal just began allowing crypto purchases, so I logged into my account. While a button on the homepage said ""Discover Bitcoin,"" when I clicked it, it took me to my dashboard, which had no clear way to buy bitcoin. By this time, I was fuming and called a friend to have him check his ability to purchase. He was able to buy in seconds.      So now, I'm thinking that I'm on some kind of blacklist; maybe harping on how banks suck and crypto companies that play by traditional finance's rules are selling out has finally caught up with me.    See also: Why Is Bitcoin Going Up, and Will It Crash Soon? What’s Next as Price Doubles to $40K    But after some troubleshooting, I realized it was because my PayPal account is a business account (pretty arbitrarily really), so I went through the process of setting up a separate individual account, which I had to link to a random, burner email account. From that individual account dashboard, the ""buy bitcoin"" button was right up front and so I put through an order and received a note that my transaction had gone through.      But for anyone not interested in carrying out all these different setups for the story, this kind of process is infuriating, and I'd assume any novice crypto buyer would have given up after the second rejection.    The main problem    Which brings me to what appears to be the real issue – my traditional financial institution.      I bank with a state credit union in Colorado. After trying these various routes to ""financial freedom,"" I called its customer service line. I've had to call it before to open up payments applications, such as Zelle, so I figured I'd just need to tell it to take the blocks off my account (I've bought crypto in the past using this bank-branded debit card).      But after being on hold, the customer service agent told me all crypto transactions are ""considered very high risk"" and declines them, no matter whether I assure them it's a transaction I want to make or not.      She told me to contact each of the companies directly and see if there was another way to make a purchase – for instance, I could maybe pay directly out of my checking account – but when trying to input my account details before, the credit union didn't seem to be supported.      This new risk aversion to anything crypto-related is strange. The bitcoin industry has matured substantially and, in many enthusiasts' eyes, running towards $50,000 per coin means the incumbents, the status quo, the powers that be, have no choice but to take us seriously now.      That doesn't appear to be the case.      Instead, I'm refreshing my bank account portal every 15 minutes because of that PayPal transaction.
