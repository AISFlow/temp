Bakkt COO Adam White announced Tuesday during CoinDesk's Invest: NYC conference that the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) subsidiary is working on adding the product.  ""We have the intention of offering a cash-settled contract as well,"" White said.  According to sources familiar with the plan, the new cash-settled monthly futures are to be offered through ICE Clear Singapore, the company's Singapore-based clearinghouse, and traded on ICE Futures Singapore.  That said, futures traders signed up to the company worldwide will be able to access the product, similarly to how traders worldwide can access its current futures, offered through ICE Clear U.S.  The new product is a response to customer demand and will be based on the data provided by Bakkt's physically-settled bitcoin futures product, White said.  While Bakkt is targeting a launch date before the end of the year, CoinDesk's sources said the company is still in discussions with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  Bakkt, first unveiled in August 2018, spent more than a year building and launching its physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts, in which customers receive the actual bitcoin on a contract's expiration rather than the fiat equivalent.  At present, only CME offers cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts in the U.S. With its new product, Bakkt will be able to offer both.  In recent weeks, the company has announced its intention to offer options contracts on top of its existing futures product, as well as a consumer app to let customers purchase goods with bitcoin from merchants sometime next year.  On Monday, Bakkt announced that it would be expanding its custody services to any institutional clients, growing out from only offering services to customers who trade futures on ICE.  Speaking broadly on Tuesday, White noted that retail customers have largely driven the bitcoin market over the past few years.

Speaking at a joint Tron-Poloniex event live-streamed over Twitter on Tuesday, Sun said Tron was among several investors in the exchange, but the exchange is operated independently from his company.  Founded in 2014, Poloniex was acquired by Circle in early 2018 for $400 million. The exchange, which once commanded more than 50 percent of exchange transactions, has seen steadily dwindling volume in recent times. Before its recent dispersal, Poloniex had little more than 1 percent of the exchange market.  “Poloniex is one of the biggest exchanges in our industry,” Sun said. “I think the exchange is going to grow and that’s why we collaborate with it to have more initiatives.”  Those initiatives include listing Tron's tokens on Poloniex and an airdrop campaign of USDT and TRX20 for users on the platform in the next few weeks, Sun said.  While Sun said Tron will also collaborate with Poloniex on trading, he declined to reveal further details about the initiative or other areas of cooperation.  Sun also described Poloniex’s strategy to woo Chinese crypto investors. Chinese users will be able to log in through a new domain pwang.com – which still directs to Poloniex – and the exchange also accepts Chinese government IDs for Know-Your-Customer regulatory purposes, he said.  Last month, Poloniex announced plans to spin out from Circle into a new company called Polo Digital Assets. The new owners planned to spend more than $100 million and shift away from the U.S. to the global market, the company said.  Denying that he had invested in Poloniex, Sun tweeted on the same day: “I’m not buying anything.”  Justin Sun Image via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,"David Pan, Anna Baydakova",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/12/despite-denials-tron-founder-confirms-investment-in-poloniex-crypto-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/330763e58a77d8d9392d59aeb1151352b155b592-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The announcement by the crypto custodian and issuer of hot and cold storage wallets means that a sizable share of on-chain transactions pass through its services, a sign of consolidation, and power, in the crypto space.  It also raises questions about market collapse: If BitGo goes down, would those assets be at risk? But when asked that question directly, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, on stage at ""The Shape of Things to Come: Crypto Custody in a Proof-of-Stake World"" panel, said there was nothing to fear.  “The big thing we do is try to remove single points of failure,” Belshe said. BitGo’s multi-signature key system secures assets, even if one layer gets breached – the clients hold the keys, he said.  Belshe credited BitGo’s growth to customers’ value of their multi-sig security.  In a statement, he said:  ""It is a great assurance to our clients that they are always in control of their own assets no matter the circumstances. BitGo is their trusted partner that is focused on making the market for digital assets bigger, stronger and more secure every day.""

Within the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the Digital Currency Research Institute is part of the central bank's payments division.  Speaking at a conference in Singapore, Changchun Mu said the central bank will not seek full control of users’ personal details, while fulfilling authorities’ need for information, according to a report by Reuters.  “We know the demand from the general public is to keep anonymity by using paper money and coins ... we will give those people who demand it anonymity in their transactions,” Mu said at the conference.  “But at the same time we will keep the balance between the ‘controllable anonymity’ and anti-money laundering, CTF (counter-terrorist financing), and also tax issues, online gambling and any electronic criminal activities,” he said.  China’s digital currency has divided opinion in crypto and blockchain circles. While some observers see useful validation in the world’s most populous nation adopting a bitcoin-adjacent currency system, others worry about authoritarian surveillance and control. The central bank has said it will guarantee cash-like levels of privacy but admits it will retain the ability to track down crypto users if it suspects illegal activity, like money laundering.  “That is a balance we have to keep, and that is our goal.

In a sweeping rejection published this weekhttps://www.bct.gov.tn/bct/siteprod/actualites.jsp?id=638 the central bank quashed “unfounded” rumors that it had become the first monetary authority to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC), asserting instead that an unaffiliated “proof of concept” project was taken “out of context:”  “The [Central Bank of Tunisia] has not engaged any relationship, of any kind, with any national or foreign provider with the aim of creating any digital currency.”  The bank did admit that it is considering a CBDC, as it says it is studying “all existing alternatives.” But there are no immediate plans for an E-Dinar to go live: “The bank is studying the opportunities and risks inherent in these new technologies, particularly in terms of cyber security and financial stability.”  Last week, Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency reported the Central Bank was partnering with the Universa Blockchain to develop and issue a digital currency. The announcement was claimed to have come at a FOREX Club Tunisia event.  But the Central Bank said that no announcement was ever made. Instead, it pointed to a CBDC test project demonstration at the FOREX event at the root of the misunderstanding:  ""This test of POC (Proof of concept) was taken out of context becoming a marketing operation where the name of the BCT was improperly used.""  Universa's CEO Alexander Borodich also presented the project at the Malta AI & Blockchain Summit in Malta last week. Borodich hadn't responded to CoinDesk's request for comment by press time.  Universa, which raised $28.8 million during an ICO in 2017, has been mired in a scandal in Russia. In March 2018, Universa community manager Artur Lipatov wrote a Facebook post saying that Universa's blockchain could not power smart contracts, the company's operations were in trouble, and that he was leaving – that post is now unavailable.  The statement dropped Universa's token value by 20 percent from $0.037 to $0.03 and Borodich sued his former employee for $15,500 for defamation.  Tunisia earlier showed some mild interest to the blockchain tech. In 2015, the country's Ministry of Communication Technologies posted a job opening for an intern with blockchain knowledge. The same year, Tunisia's postal service reported trialing a crypto-powered payment app.  The country remains open to experiments with the tech, according to today's statement.

With its new Fiat Gateway service, Paxos said Tuesday that users will be able to execute simple swaps between U.S. dollars and stablecoins, including the firm's own Paxos Standard (PAX).  Notably, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, will be the first to integrate the product. The firm will also have its stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD), included in the swap options.  “Paxos is a trusted partner that keeps innovating ways to make traditional and digital assets more interoperable. The new Fiat Gateway is the fastest, simplest U.S. dollar on/off ramp for our customers. We look forward to working more closely with Paxos to integrate additional solutions,” said Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, Binance's CEO.  Binance may work with Paxos to integrate additional solutions in future, CZ said, though he didn't provide any specifics. The exchange has only recently started adding fiat funding options, having launched deposits in rubles, euros and other currencies in recent weeks.  While Paxos’ Fiat Gateway will facilitate swaps between fiat currency and stablecoins, the company announced a second offering called Stablecoin Swap that allows fee-free 1:1 interoperability between Paxos-powered stablecoins.  Both of Paxos' new services can be integrated into third-party platforms via an application programming interface (API). Previously, these facilities were available only for customers using Paxos.com.  “The APIs will help our technology can become more widely available and scalable,” said Charles Cascarilla, Paxos CEO and co-founder.  Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted Paxos Trust Company no-action relief in October, allowing it to settle equity securities trades on its blockchain platform for broker-dealers. Credit Suisse and Société Générale would be the first two companies to utilize the service, Paxos announced at the end of last month.

Its new Kryptos platform will help institutions parse regulatory hazards and build risk assessment models.  Kryptos ""is our step towards financial institutions, so they can have the transparency they need to build risk management programs and integrate into the crypto economy,” Chainalysis co-founder and COO Jonathan Levin said.  It’s the blockchain analysis firm’s first product to specifically target institutional players, joining KYT, the exchange-facing anti money laundering software, and Reactor, which helps investigators trace criminal money flows.  Those products help governments, crypto companies and investigators analyze their sectors of the crypto economy, Levin said. But while those entities grasp the larger crypto ecosystem, crypto-curious investors, including the banks and advisors not already involved, have no clear point of entry.  That could stymie investment. Chainalysis’ solution: build a “trusted and referenced” dataset for new market entrants.  Levin said:  “If you are in a financial institution and trying to understand who the major players are what assets are trading where they are registered, how their activity looks on the blockchain, and how to make sure you're managing your risk appropriately, you’ll log into Kryptos and see those top counterparties you’ll be wanting to do business with.”  The product, still in beta and set to launch early next year, features a mix of manually-collected data to give them that view. Chainalysis’ employees compile and update reams of regulatory, compliance, and business interest information in one place.  Levin said:  ""We find that Kryptos is a good way for someone to get that high level overview, really a good starting point for someone to do a deeper dive investigation.”  That, he claimed, is good for everyone: ""All players in the cryptocurrency ecosystem stand to benefit from increased transparency.”  Data storage image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/12/chainalysis-kryptos-tool-is-an-inside-look-for-outside-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a37e6a7339728412fd897e867018625cf2a98868-1500x1091.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nervos, a blockchain development startup, is providing part of the technical infrastructure for the project.  The firms are developing pluggable components for the network that could enable regulators to supervise contract deployments, asset holdings and transfers, as well as the enforcement of anti money laundering regulations, Bo Wang, a Nervos researcher, told CoinDesk.  The components will also allow financial institutions, such as banks and regulatory agencies, to freeze assets and accounts in case of emergencies via sidechains, according to Wang.  “Supervision nodes will enable regulators to independently run and maintain nodes, extract data, and participate in the ecosystem's supervision,” he said, noting Huobi Chain will also provide tools for pre-deployment audits and continuous tracking.  Huobi Chain unveiled the public blockchain in July in partnership with blockchain startup Nervos. It can be used for financial services and applications, including lending, debit services, stablecoins, security token offerings, exchanges and payment services, the company said.  The firm has touted the network as the first financial public chain to support nodes that let regulators contribute to the network as validators.  Huobi Group founder and CEO Leon Li said in today's announcement:  “If major banks and financial institutions are to fully embrace and adopt permissionless blockchain technology, we need to create a safe and secure environment that makes it easier for them to transition their products and services to the blockchain.”  Nervos is also working with financial giant China Merchants Bank to develop its decentralized finance applications.

42403528,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgEQU,1573565448,"With Code of Conduct, Trade Group ADAM Seeks Legitimacy for Crypto","One year after its formation, the Association of Digital Asset Markets (ADAM) has drafted a code of conduct for the cryptocurrency market.  The trade group has also recruited five more companies, bringing its total membership to 15. The new members are: custodians BitGo and Anchorage, trading firm and VC investor CMT Digital, lender BlockFi, and prime brokerage Tagomi.  Released Tuesday, the draft is part of an ongoing effort by institutionally-focused companies to bring legitimacy to an industry regarded by traditional investors and regulators as a digital Wild West.  ""The digital asset industry has had a rocky first decade. Crypto investors have learned all the hard lessons of a century's worth of financial crime and scandal in the course of ten years,"" said Dan Burstein, the general counsel and chief compliance officer at the Paxos exchange, one of the group's 10 founding members.  ""There hasn't been a lot of transparency,"" he added. ""Investors don't always know what's a reliable place to conduct their trading.""  To rectify that situation, the code sets standards for governance, ethics, transparency, fairness, compliance, risk management, information security and business continuity, as well as preventing conflicts of interest, market manipulation, money laundering and terrorism financing.  For example, the draft says ADAM members should ""be truthful in their statements, use clear and unambiguous language, make clear whether the prices they are providing are firm or indicative, and provide to clients and counterparties all material information"" about business relationships.  Next, ADAM will circulate the draft to its members for feedback. The group expects them to sign a final version of the code in early 2020.  ""As digital asset markets ... become ever-more enmeshed in capital markets, it is important ... to level the playing field and establish the high standards and operating protocols deserving of this promising and innovative asset class,"" said Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of XBTO Group, another ADAM founding member, in a press release.  Does it have teeth?  Although it is not a regulatory document, companies that are found to have violated the code run the risk of being kicked out of the association and losing what ADAM hopes will become a powerful imprimatur in the market.  ""Being associated with ADAM is a signal to investors, business partners and regulators that you are making an effort in good faith to live by certain standards,"" Burstein told CoinDesk.  ADAM's is not the first code of conduct for the nascent crypto industry – Global Digital Finance (GDF), a London-based trade group with more than 70 members, released one last year.  That code totals more than 15,000 words, divided into eight separate PDF files. ADAM's code is comparatively tidy: less than 4,000 words in a single, 12-page document.  Because ADAM's membership (all US) includes different types of companies with different business models, ""we can't be too prescriptive,"" Burstein said. Instead, it took a ""higher-level, principles-based approach,"" setting general guidance rather than narrow rules.  ""The idea is not to tell people what they should be doing at all times,"" he said. ""We are, after all, in an innovation industry.""

42403520,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgEGe,1573565403,Web3 Studying How to Integrate Kadena's Smart Contract Language on Polkadot,"The Web3 Foundation is studying how to adopt blockchain startup Kadena’s Pact smart contract programming language for the Polkadot ecosystem.  The two organizations signed an agreement to kick off a research project studying how Pact can be integrated into different blockchain platforms, beginning with Polkadot, Kadena announced on Tuesday at CoinDesk’s Invest: NYC event.  Pact is designed to facilitate smart contract executions among developers that use different blockchains. Kadena hopes the language will become a smart contract standard, regardless of developers’ preferred blockchains.  The firm's founder Stuart Popejoy unveiled the cross-chain smart contract language in June 2019 for “hybrid blockchains,” both public and private. Kadena claims Pact is one of the first “human-readable” languages to execute smart contracts with Formal Verification, a way of verifying algorithms’ “correctness” using mathematical methods.  Formerly called Chainweb, Kadena's blockchain platform went live on Nov. 4, weaving together 10 proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains running concurrently. At the same time, the firm also announced a $20 million token sale.  The network tackles scaling challenges on existing PoW networks by running multiple blockchains concurrently, with shared merkle roots allowing for data to be shared across different networks.  Kadena raised $12 million through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale in April 2018. Fidelity Investments’ private investor arm, Devonshire Investors, Multicoin Capital, Asimov Investments, SV Angel and SIG participated in the token sale  The company’s push to integrate blockchain platforms with a universal smart contract language came on the heels of the Web3 Foundation’s interoperability project that facilitates inclusion of different Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain platforms.  “Web3 Foundation looks forward to the results of Kadena’s forthcoming feasibility study, and learning more about the role the Pact language could play in the Polkadot ecosystem.” Dieter Fishbein, the foundation’s head of grants, said in a statement.  Started by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot launched its DOT token sale in July with a $1.2 billion valuation at the time.

Announced Tuesday at CoinDesk's Invest NYC conference, the technology provider is adding support for margin trading, with a raft of trading options and controls for crypto brokerages and exchanges utilizing its software.  AlphaPoint’s platform is customizable, to better serve clients operating in different markets and regulatory regimes, spokesman Patrick Shields told CoinDesk:  ""Rather than creating a one-size fits all model, we focused on creating a platform that is highly configurable,"" he said. ""Some examples include requiring approval workflow for end users, and configurable minimum deposit size, leverage and liquidation levels, fees and other settings.""  At launch, the company said that no clients were immediately implementing AlphaPoint margin trading, but ""several firms"" are beta testing the platform, including the Canadian cryptocurrency trader National Digital Asset Exchange (NDAX), according to a press release.  Bilal Hammoud, NDAX founder and CEO, said in a statement that he looked forward to the partnership:  ""We will bring BTC to CAD margin trading to Cryptocurrency and allow traders to enjoy a secure, compliant, and technologically advanced platform.""  Margin trading – when one buys a security (or in this case a cryptocurrency) using borrowed funds – is becoming increasingly prevalent in the crypto space as many popular exchanges continue implementing the feature. Binance rolled out margin trading in July, and Bakkt, Coinbase’s professional trading platform and Kraken all have the option.  But that increase has not come without pushback. Certain countries around the world have discouraged crypto margin trades and placed tight controls on the practice, as in Japan.

The crypto wallet and investment app provider announced Tuesday that U.S. customers are now able to deposit, withdraw or trade bitcoin SV, DAI and cosmos, among many other crypto assets. Additionally, customer withdrawal and deposit amounts will rise to $4,000 per day, $8,000 per week and $16,000 per month.  The service expansion also adds deposit and withdrawal capabilities for at least four stablecoins, including tether, TrueUSD, paxos and DAI, according to the firm.  In coming weeks, Abra will open up access to the new assets for users outside the U.S. as well. The additions bring the total number of cryptocurrencies on offer to over 200. Unlike most exchange services, Abra allows users to freely exchange all in-app assets without trading pair limitations.  The new options will not include Qtum (QTUM), bitcoin gold (BTG), EOS or OmiseGo (OMG), a spokesperson told CoinDesk. Abra announced earlier this year that its U.S. customers would not be able to hold those particular cryptocurrencies from Aug. 29, due to “regulatory uncertainty and restrictions” in the country.  At the time, the firm also said that residents of New York state could no longer use bank ACH or wire transfers, or American Express cards for deposits and withdrawals after the same date. Other U.S. users can currently fund accounts with AmEx, Visa and Mastercard, as well as bank and wire transfers, and crypto.

The company will include educational and certification agencies as nodes to increase credibility of the network, and choose partners depending their industries rather than which regions they are based in, the exec explained. However, who those firms might be is not yet being disclosed.  “We can not disclose the names of our partners who participate in the consortium blockchain at this time,” Li said.  Ant Blockchain Open Alliance is aimed to cut costs and expand the reach of services in different industries, such as finance and healthcare, to a larger user base.

The company announced Tuesday that it would release an EXODUS 1 smartphone that integrates with crypto exchange Binance's namesake blockchain, providing support for its decentralized exchange and token.  The EXODUS 1 Binance edition will integrate Binance Chain with the device's native Zion Vault wallet app, according to the announcement. Essentially, users will be able to directly access the Binance DEX using the phone.  HTC decentralized chief officer Phil Chen said Binance's ""borderless vision is a cause that EXODUS also aspires to"" according to a press release.  ""We are partnering with the biggest and most liquid crypto exchange along with the trust minimized principle of empowering users to own their own keys and run their own full bitcoin node,"" he said, further suggesting that supporting the Binance DEX natively in the device might help change how users interact with exchanges.  Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said smartphones ""are the most natural devices"" for hardware wallets, particularly ones users will always hold onto. ""Crypto, on the other hand, will make every smartphone both a POS terminal and a payment device, cutting out most other middlemen,"" he said.  CZ said he was ""excited"" to see how people might adopt cryptocurrencies using the device:  ""The implications are profound and far-reaching. The most innovative smartphone makers are racing to adopt crypto. We are delighted to support and work with HTC EXODUS to make sure its users can access the Binance chain and DEX to help people access crypto and exchange anywhere.""  HTC first announced it would be launching a cryptocurrency-friendly smartphone last May, when it unveiled the EXODUS 1. The phone was released later in 2018, initially only available for purchase using cryptocurrency. The company opened up fiat sales to the wider public earlier this year.  Among its features, the EXODUS boasted of a ""secure enclave"" function to act as its mobile hardware wallet, acting as a secure environment for users to store their cryptocurrency private keys without risk of being hacked or otherwise compromised.  This year, HTC followed up its EXODUS 1 offering with the 1s, a more affordable variant capable of running a full bitcoin node provided users added (a lot of) extra card storage.  The new Binance edition of the device will retail for US$599, or 899 Singapore dollars, at a discount to the original price of the device. Once more, the phone can only be purchased through cryptocurrency on HTC's website. Some early customers may also receive BNB airdropped to their devices.

It wasn't the possibility of a market correction that worried him. It was the risk that the whole business might disappear.  ""There was always a non-zero chance that bitcoin would gap down, die, and never come back,"" Matuszewski, 31, said in a phone interview.  Matuszewski, who previously oversaw trading at the cryptocurrency-focused financial company Circle, says he's now confident enough in the market's future that he's teamed up with two partners to pool more than $10 million to start a proprietary-trading firm. They are Bobby Cho, 35, former head of trading at brokerage firm DRW's Cumberland crypto unit, and Julien Collard-Seguin, 31, a former technology executive at Circle.  According to Cho, the new company, called CMS Holdings, started trading in October. The business is registered in the Cayman Islands and doesn't manage money from outside investors, he said.  ""We deploy strategies much like a hedge fund in the market, except that we're not structured as such,"" Cho said.  The plan is to put 30 percent of the firm's money into highly liquid cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum and 40 percent to 50 percent into less-frequently traded tokens and digital assets, Cho said. The rest would likely go into long-term equity investments in the crypto industry, he said.  ""The space is evolving very quickly, and it's not stopping,"" Cho said.  Bitcoin's price has more than doubled this year to about $8,700 each, though it's still well off the record of about $20,000 reached in 2017.

42403530,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgESS,1573548715,"UPS Ships Beef to Japan, Tracked and Monitored Using Blockchain Tech","UPS has delivered a bunch of blockchain steaks to Japan.  The global shipping giant announced on Monday that, in partnership with blockchain livestock tracing firm HerdX, it had tracked, monitored and delivered a full shipment of beef from Kansas to a Tokyo steakhouse.  UPS, which built a data visibility tool that integrates with HerdX’s blockchain platform to provide constant updates, hailed the shipment as a step forward in international logistics and tracking.  The beef – black angus steak packaged by the Japanese-owned Creekstone Farms – began its journey in Arkansas City, Kansas, where it was loaded into UPS temperature-controlled packaging for its trip across the globe. During that flight, a bevy of sensors kept tabs on the steak and uploaded readings to the HerdX blockchain, according to the press release.  It was delivered to a Ruby Jack’s steakhouse in Tokyo. There, guests could order the steak and view its freight provenance via QR code. Diplomats in Tokyo celebrated its arrival last Friday and dined on the steak, the firms said.  Romaine Seguin, President of UPS Global Freight Forwarding, said in a statement that a lot went into the project:  “Blockchain verification for international air freight shipments is complex and requires a great amount of expertise in customs and freight forwarding. Getting it right has implications for many industries, such as restaurants, food & beverage, and retail.”  It was the first time HerdX's solution had been used to track beef with blockchain tech on this route. HerdX specializes in building blockchain-based livestock verification tools for farmers, its website showshttps://herdx.com/farm/.  Used by firms as a means to verify the provenance and freshness of food products on the way to stores – as well as as a marketing method to appeal to health, environment and animal welfare-conscious consumers – blockchain tracing platforms are starting to make their way into the supply chains of major companies like Walmart, Carrefour and Cargill.  The initiative adds to blockchain-based works underway by UPS, including inking a deal in March with e-commerce company Inxeption to develop a platform based on the tech to facilitate business-to-business sales. The firm has also applied for a patent for a concept that uses blockchain as part of a distributed system for sending packages worldwide.

Launched under the “BT” ticker, Bithumb Coin will work as a medium of exchange for the ecosystem, the company told CoinDesk in a statement Tuesday. The Bithumb Chain itself is expected to launch sometime in the first quarter of 2020.  From a mechanics side, the exchange will mint a hard cap of 300 million Bithumb Coins. Half of the exchange's revenue will be used to burn 50 percent of BT's token supply over time – similar to Binance Chain's Binance Coin (BNB) – resulting in a final 150 million token supply. Initial token distribution will be split between on-exchange incentives and chain development, moreover.  Bithumb says the exchange will utilize the coin for handling fees, rights to use Bithumb Chain and future payment mechanisms. Earlier this month, the exchange announced its ""Exchange-as-a-Service"" feature to develop decentralized finance applications or decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols using Bithumb Chain as a backbone.  Bithumb says its tokens can be used to vote in chain governance, such as investment decisions, for Bithumb Chain.  A part of Bithumb Korea, one of South Korea's largest exchanges, Bithumb Global operates out of Singapore with an average daily trade volume of nearly $700 million, according to Coinmarketcap.
