42377818,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fif,1416268214,US Marshals: Latest Bitcoin Auction Timed to Avoid Market Disruption,"UPDATE (18th November, 20:40 BST): Noted bitcoin investor Barry Silbert has announced Bitcoin Investment Trust will form a syndicate for the auction.      The US Marshals Service (USMS) has revealed it intends to auction potentially all of the 144,000 BTC confiscated from Ross Ulbricht during its Silk Road investigation in the coming months, but that it has elected to break up the sales in order to prevent disruptions to the bitcoin market.  The USMS announced on 17th November that it will auction off just 50,000 BTC previously owned by Ulbricht, who stands accused of operating the now-defunct Silk Road online black marketplace. The bidding registration for this auction, which is currently underway, will be open to interested parties until 1st December.  USMS spokesperson Lynzey Donahue told CoinDesk that the USMS intends to hold additional auctions for the remainder of Ulbricht's bitcoin holdings in the months ahead, but that it has yet to set dates for any subsequent sales. When asked, Donahue acknowledged that the auctions were being held over an undisclosed period of time to avoid potential market problems.  Donahue said:  “We didn’t want to flood the market with the sale of too many bitcoins at any one time.""  The agency confirmed that the auction process will be the same as the one held in July, when nearly 30,000 BTC was ultimately sold to Draper Fisher Jurvetson founding partner and noted bitcoin investor Tim Draper. Unlike the upcoming auction, those bitcoins were confiscated directly from the Silk Road servers, not from Ulbricht himself.  The USMS also noted that significant changes in the price of bitcoin that have taken place in recent months did not factor into the agency’s decision to hold the auction.  The price of bitcoin has declined from roughly $650 at the time of the initial auction in July to a press time figure of $384.  Past auction participants weighing new round  CoinDesk reached out to a number of venture capitalists and investors who submitted bids in the July auction, including eventual winner Tim Draper. Overall, it seems that while some participants are looking to take part, others are still weighing the announcement.  Harry Yeh, founding partner at bitcoin-focused investment firm Binary Financial, said that that his fund will be submitting a bid. Binary took part in the last auction and, at the time, Yeh noted that such events present a unique opportunity for financial firms to acquire large quantities of bitcoin without the added costs that can come from buying over an exchange or off market.  Bitcoin entrepreneur and Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert said that his team is looking at the new auction and “evaluating running another bidding syndicate"".

42377821,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fox,1416245680,Markets Weekly: Trading Volumes More than Double Amid Price Surge,"The bitcoin markets were frothing last week as the price soared to a high of $458 on Thursday. Trading volumes more than doubled as markets were stimulated by the surging price.  Volumes rose by 2.3 times to nearly 6m BTC traded over the last seven days, compared to a week earlier. The stage was set for a price surge a week ago, as the markets digested the news of the inter-continental dark markets bust called Operation Onymous.  In the last week, prices swung a massive $97.57 from a trough on 11th November to a peak two days later. The price rose from $360.58 at the week's bottom to $458.15 at its top, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  There has been plenty of price action, then – not that you would know it by looking at the week's closing prices. The bitcoin price opened the week at $360.29 on 10th November and closed ay $388.55 on 16th November, representing a rise of 7.84%.  The price movement was backed by robust trading volumes across a range of exchanges. BTC China reported a trebling in volume, while Bitfinex recorded an increase of nearly double the amount, compared to a week earlier. BTC-e showed trading volume growth of 128%, while OKCoin and Bitstamp both showed rises of 117%.  The fact that exchanges across the board reported strong volume growth is an indicator of the bitcoin markets' health. The current bitcoin price surge appears to be well-supported.  A futures kerfuffle  While the bitcoin price may have seen some serious price action last week, it didn't compare to the kerfuffle around Huobi's futures market.  Here's how Huobi told it: It turns out an enthusiastic trader had taken advantage of Huobi's newly introduced high-leverage margin accounts, which offers leverage of up to 20-times. The trader went long on a weekly futures contract at a price of 3,000 CNY. The market moved against him and he had to close his position at 2,817.76 CNY.  That would have been the end of it, but Huobi's futures market didn't have enough liquidity to fill the orders at that price. Plus, lots of other highly leveraged positions were facing margin calls. The price kept tumbling. The order was finally filled at 2,378.72 CNY, or more than 400 CNY below the intended price. This resulted in 3,032 BTC of unintended losses.  The exchange then spread those losses across traders on its platform, effectively forcing them to take a haircut of 46.1% on their trading profits. Huobi said it would reimburse affected traders by giving them credit on the platform.  BitMEX  founder Arthur Hayes, who is launching his own derivatives exchange on 24th November, was quick to write to CoinDesk, pointing out that his platform bears all the risk for its products, meaning it would not force its users to take a loss because of a wonky market.  Hayes wrote in an email:  ""When clients of BitMEX ask what differentiates BitMEX from other derivatives exchanges, I thump my chest and scream 'Counterparty risk!' BitMEX stands behind all trades.""  Arbitrage window and hedge fund rumours  Hayes also pointed out an intriguing arbitrage opportunity in his weekly trading newsletter. He calculated the price deviation on major non-Chinese exchanges from the global average from 11th to 14th November. He then compared this to the price offered on OKCoin over the same period.  Arbitraging between exchanges in China and outside the country has been lucrative in the past. This time, Hayes found that non-Chinese exchanges, like BTC-e, were offering discounts of more than 10% of the BTC global average spot price, while OKCoin was offering a premium of 20% at the same time. That's a spread of 30 points.  The arbitrage opportunity lasted for 24 hours, Hayes wrote, although he noted that only traders with funds already sitting on the exchanges would have been able to take advantage of the opportunity.  Speaking of OKCoin, the exchange's CTO Changpeng Zhao claimed his company had signed on a massive new client: a hedge fund with €3bn under management that had begun to trade on its platform. The exchange hasn't provided evidence of this whale of a trader yet.  Coincidentally, CoinDesk does know of a hedge fund, located in the favoured neighbourhood for such outfits, London's Mayfair, that is looking into the cryptocurrency space. But it hasn't said anything about trading on OKCoin, or indeed any exchange, yet. Watch this space for more details as we get them.  Bitcoin bull-runs are lucrative  Pantera Capital's monthly research note came out a couple of weeks ago. It contains some reassuring analysis of the bitcoin price.  The research observed that bitcoin had a hit a new low below the 200-day moving average on 5th October. Of course, that was just before the current price run-up in the wake of Operation Onymous.  The note also found that bitcoin bull cycles returned, at a minimum, more than triple the amount invested. The most profitable bull-run it has recorded were the 66 days from 5th April 2011, when it returned 44-times the invested capital. The price then rose from $0.67 to $29.58.

42377811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fZr,1416244112,"US Marshals to Auction 50,000 Bitcoins Seized from Ross Ulbricht","The US Marshals Service (USMS) has announced that it will auction off 50,000 bitcoins, worth roughly $20m, that belong to accused Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht.  The auction is the second held by the US agency, following the sale of 30,000 BTC in July. Involving well-known participants from across the bitcoin and traditional finance industries, the auction was won by venture capitalist Tim Draper, who successfully bid on all the rounds organized by the USMS.  According to the announcement, the USMS began accepting bids at 9:00 EST on 17th November, and the deadline for bids ends on Monday, 1st December. The auction will take place over two rounds, with 10 blocks of 2,000 BTC in the first round and 10 blocks of 3,000 BTC in the second.  The process is similar to the prior Silk Road-related bitcoin auction, requiring pre-registration with the USMS and initial deposits for the two rounds of $100,000 and $150,000.  According to the USMS, the 50,000 BTC being auctioned were confiscated from computers owned by Ulbricht in connection with the US government’s long-running case, which alleges that Ulbricht is the Silk Road mastermind Dread Pirate Roberts.  “This sealed bid auction is for a portion of the bitcoins contained in wallet files that resided on certain computer hardware belonging to Ross William Ulbricht, that were seized on or about October 24, 2013.”  The winner of the auction will be notified if their bid has been selected on 5th December, with payment required on 8th December, according to the announcement.

42377817,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73flB,1416241460,"Blockstream Raises $21 Million from Google Chairman, LinkedIn and Yahoo Co-Founders","Blockstream has officially announced $21m in seed funding to continue the development of its much-anticipated blockchain technology proposal, 'sidechains'.  Announced on the Blockstream website, the round was led by LinkedIn co-founder and Airbnb board member Reid Hoffman; Khosla Ventures, which has previously invested in bitcoin API developer Chain; and Canada-based seed fund Real Ventures. In total, Blockstream indicated 40 investors took part in the round.  Blockstream CEO Austin Hill positioned the funding as proof that the wider tech industry is increasingly acknowledging the disruptive potential of the technological innovations first introduced by bitcoin through its underlying ledger.  Hill wrote:  “Blockstream is the first company extending the capabilities at the protocol level to support massive scaling of bitcoin and blockchain technology to a broad range of asset types. Put another way, the extension mechanism of sidechains, the company’s initial area of focus, allows any number of so far unthought of developments to happen in an open and interoperable way.  First introduced earlier this year and released on 23rd October, the sidechains white paper seeks to enable the creation of an entire ecosystem of blockchains over which digital assets can be exchanged and transferred, with bitcoin serving as the lead chain for such activity.  Additional investment firms that contributed to the round included Crypto Currency Partners, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, Future\Perfect Ventures, Mosaic Ventures, Ribbit Capital and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang’s AME Cloud Ventures.  The announcement comes roughly one month after the first news regarding Blockstream’s funding round leaked online via an October filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. At the time, the document revealed Blockstream had raised $15m in funding, and that Hoffman would serve on the company’s board of directors.  Hoffman, in turn, took to LinkedIn today to discuss his investment, penning a lengthy entry on his belief in bitcoin as a revolutionary technology that will enable innovations in commerce.

42377806,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bqN,1416236458,Wedbush Securities Funds Buttercoin in First Bitcoin Investment,"Noted investment services provider and research firm Wedbush Securities has announced its first investment in the bitcoin ecosystem, contributing an undisclosed sum to newly launched US bitcoin marketplace Buttercoin.  One of the more vocal research institutions on the subject of bitcoin globally, Wedbush has long been bullish on digital currency while largely refraining from issuing any direct financial support to the ecosystem.  Buttercoin  CEO Cedric Dahl framed the funding as proof that institutional players on Wall Street are increasingly interested in supporting the bitcoin ecosystem, and that the bitcoin industry in turn is evolving to fit the needs of established financial players.  Dahl told CoinDesk:  ""The partnership is evidence that [...] bitcoin security and custodial practices have evolved over the past two years to a point where institutions feel safe to enter the bitcoin space.""  In statements, Sheri Kaiserman, head of equities at Wedbush, spoke to why Buttercoin was the right partner to grow its interest in the space. In addition to the funding, Wedbush revealed it would use Buttercoin's marketplace as the trading vehicle for its clients.  ""We are impressed with Buttercoin in many regards, notably that it provides reliable, trustworthy and excellent trade execution, and most importantly that it has a US banking relationship,"" Kaiserman said.  Opening to the market in October, Buttercoin has not revealed its US banking partnership, citing competitive interests. However, it has positioned this relationship as a key differentiator in a US market that is still seeking regulatory clarity.  Additional investors in Buttercoin include Centralway Ventures, Google Ventures, Reddit co- founder Alexis Ohanian and Y Combinator.  Targeting institutional players  Dahl suggested that the partnership was months in the making, noting that his company reached out to inquire about Wedbush's interest in serving as a market maker on Buttercoin in January.  According to Dahl, though slow to fruition, the partnership could do much to encourage interest from other institutional players it is currently courting.  ""Buttercoin is in talks with other institutional players including market makers, prop shops and hedge funds,"" Dahl said.  Dahl predicted that should current trends continue, bitcoin could be more widely adopted in portfolios as diverse as pension funds or university endowments in the coming years, and that it intends to capture this growth on its platform.  However, he indicated that such a development is contingent on federal and state governments providing the needed regulatory clarity for the industry.  Race to secure liquidity  Dahl positioned the partnership with Wedbush as the start of a long-term partnership between the two firms.  In exchange for conducting activities it's marketplace, Dahl said Wedbush would receive a discount from its standard trading rates. Such an incentive, he indicated, will also be available to other large players that use its market.  ""The more volume they process the greater the discount,"" Dahl added.  Notably, the move coincides with an uptick in announcements from active US-based bitcoin trading services providers.  Palo Alto-based Mirror, which recently rebranded from Vaurum, announced this summer that it will leverage nearly 30,000 BTC purchased at auction by investor Tim Draper to fuel the growth of its platform.  Similarly, New York exchange Coinsetter announced a plan last week to draw more market makers to its order book, offering 10% of the company to interested firms and suggesting liquidity is now a top priority for US-based bitcoin trading startups.

42377794,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bgJ,1416235211,Spanish Bank Backs Decentralised Bitcoin Exchange Coinffeine,"Spanish bank Bankinter has made an investment in Coinffeine, a bitcoin startup launched in June by four engineers aiming to create a new distributed exchange platform.  The investment, made through the Bankinter Innovation Foundation, is one of the first in the bitcoin ecosystem, according to the bank.  Coinffeine  is developing a distributed platform for the exchange of fiat money by cryptocurrencies in a secure and anonymous environment. It is designed to let users send fiat money and transfer bitcoins outside banks in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion.  BitTorrent for your bitcoins  The Coinffeine desktop app, which the company likens to ""BitTorrent for your bitcoins"", is scheduled to launch next January.  ""The big innovation here is the Coinffeine protocol, a mathematical model based on Game Theory. This protocol ensures the safety of the fiat-bitcoin exchange without a trusted third party and in an automated way, offering the same experience as a traditional exchange even though the transactions are really P2P,"" the company said in a statement.  Coinffeine co-founder Sebastián Ortega told CoinDesk the platform will provide customers with a service that combines the existing financial infrastructure with a distributed exchange.  Ortega explained:  ""Coinffeine lets you keep ownership of your bitcoins in a way that only a distributed exchange can provide. You don't need to trust anyone, not even us, for the safeguard of your coins and you can reuse the existing financial infrastructure for handling the fiat payments.""  Ortega said the platform features an ""astounding security model"" and provides customers with a number of benefits, including low fees.  ""You only need to pay for the payment processor fees and enhanced privacy and more flexibility, as exchanges between end-users are subject to less legal burdens across the globe,"" said Ortega.  Coinffeine's client  Coinffeine said Bankinter’s strategy is to support the startup and also become one of its main clients in the future. The company said it could not disclose the exact amount of funding it received via the Bankinter Innovation Foundation.  However, the non-profit foundation usually invests €25,000-€200,000 in promising startups. Dedicated to promoting entrepreneurship and innovation in Spain, it is funded exclusively by Bankinter.  ""Bankinter Innovation Foundation invest in products and services that relate to its business ecosystem and, when possible, wants to be a first friendly early-adopter customer that helps the startup to develop,"" explained Ortega. ""In the case of Coinffeine, we are still working on finding the best collaboration framework to make it happen.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/17/spanish-bank-backs-decentralised-bitcoin-exchange-coinffeine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdbe7af6356cef8625d3ad2f9982628f9ca3700e-1465x566.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377791,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bWF,1416229142,Ex-Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit: Digital Currencies are Spawning Innovation,"Former Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit has come out in favour of digital currencies, stating they have potential to change the world.  Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Pandit said he is interested in the emerging technology as a source of innovation that could eventually make its way into the traditional financial sector.  ""I am a believer in the fact that whether it is the virtual currency or the services around virtual currencies do have the promise of changing the world,"" he said.  He went on to argue that digital currencies could leave their mark on other currencies and existing transfer mechanisms:  ""The reason I like the concept of virtual currency is because it's spawning a lot of innovation and thinking about how you transfer money around the world, how you store money, all those kinds of things. I think those developments can be used just as well for normal currency as they can for virtual currency, that's beautiful.""  Praise for Coinbase  Pandit said he was impressed with bitcoin wallet and payment processor Coinbase after meeting with its representatives last week. He used the company as an example of a successful digital currency business that could impact financial services beyond bitcoin.  ""It's a wallet for bitcoin, but could be a wallet for 'bityen'. It could be 'bitdollar', it could be 'biteuro' – doesn't matter,"" said Pandit.  ""What's the beauty of this particular company? They can transfer money anywhere around the world at zero cost, freely. So it is a payment system, where this payment system is cost-free versus other payment systems, which are costly.""  It should be noted that most of the advantages outlined by Pandit are not exclusive to Coinbase. They are a feature of bitcoin itself, hence they are available to anyone using the bitcoin network.  Coinbase is currently one of the biggest names in the industry. Over the weekend unconfirmed reports emerged that the company is seeking up to $60m in additional funding, on a valuation of $400m. The company processes bitcoin payments for a number of major brands such as Overstock, Expedia, DISH Network and PayPal.  Veteran banker  Vikram Pandit started his business career at Morgan Stanley in the early eighties. Prior to that he taught economics at several US universities, including Columbia.  In 2005 he left Morgan Stanley to create a hedge fund, which was later acquired by Citi in 2007. As a result of the deal, Pandit joined Citigroup and in late 2007 he became the CEO of America's third largest bank holding company.  His tenure was marked by the start of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and Citigroup's insolvency later that year, despite receiving billions of dollars via the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).  Citi returned to profitability in 2010, but not before it was forced to eliminate thousands of jobs. As a result of his role, Pandit also became one of a handful of bakers to be immortalised in HBO's movie drama Too Big to Fail.  Pandit resigned as Citigroup CEO in late 2012, but several news outlets such as Bloomberg reported that he was in fact ousted by the board. Pandit went on to become chairman of the TGG Group in April 2014.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/17/ex-citigroup-ceo-vikram-pandit-digital-currencies-are-spawning-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40de30b582c8375ec5f24c6f6362355fbc7e2115-1456x679.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The two-day event, titled HackBit, culminated in eight teams pitching their ideas to a panel of judges. Each team had three minutes of presentation time, followed by two minutes of questions.  About 75 attended the hackathon, mainly university students from the north east and at least one from Ohio. Also participating were established bitcoin companies Blockchain and Chain, with contestants using either company's API.  Prizes  A team called To The Moon took first prize in the competition, with their concept of a Space Invaders-style game that awards the tiniest fractions of bitcoins, or satoshis, instead of points. Players can either keep their earnings to spend on game upgrades, or cash out.  The game, built on Blockchain's API, demonstrates bitcoin's ability to handle micropayments at scale and, according to participants, it's also fun to play.  Second place – and Blockchain's API award – went to BitRec, a receipt tracking system and spending dashboard that gives consumers valuable information on their purchasing habits. Third place went to a bitcoin trading tool called Bitquant.  Chain and Blockchain support  Chain co-founder Adam Ludwin told CoinDesk that his company also handed out a prize for the best use of its API. The winner, Lightcoin (not to be confused with litecoin), combined a hardware hack with innovative use of light and sound to notify bitcoin users when a transaction is made.  He said the team at bitcoin infrastructure platform Chain are big fans of both NYU and bitcoin, so it was ""a great match"".  ""In general, we love hackathons – in fact, one of our other teammates, Charley Hine, was supporting one in Colorado while we were at NYU. Hackathons are a great opportunity for us to learn about what developers want to do with bitcoin and help shape our product roadmap.""  Blockchain president Peter Smith said the company believed in supporting more developers entering the bitcoin universe, particularly students.  ""To be successful as a company, and as an industry, we're going to need an incredible amount of talented developers working on bitcoin.""  Most of the students involved were new to bitcoin, staying up all night to complete their projects.  The HackBit event was NYU's first bitcoin hackathon, and was held in conjunction with Hacker League, NYU's Entrepreneurial Institute and the NYU Entrepreneurs Network. It was also the first hackathon to be held at the brand new NYU Leslie eLab.
