42430601,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw69h,1559771135,"'Gold Is Superior to Bitcoin,' Say People Who Sell Gold","The folks that sell gold are a bit upset by Grayscale's Drop Gold advertising campaign.  In particular, GoldMoney.com, is going to great lengths to convince the investing public that the yellow metal is ""superior"" to bitcoin, not the other way around as the Grayscale ads claim.  The precious-metals company has created an infographic and white paper that aim to convince us gold isn't so bad.  GoldMoney.com founder Roy Sebag has quite a lot to say on the matter. His white paper begins by calling out Barry Silbert, founder of Grayscale parent Digital Currency Group:  The DropGold advertorial campaign has, in my personal view, been poorly conceived, and–as I have repeatedly stated via social media–is so preposterous in its nature as to be akin to uttering phrases like “drop Oxygen” or “drop Copper.” In short, I believe this campaign will not age well, and that it runs the risk of ultimately undermining the ideals and objectives of the cryptocurrency community, which, for the most part, are well-meaning in their desire to reorient society towards a return to the principles of sound commodity money which have underscored and amplified the proliferation of human cooperative societies from time immemorial until the very recent past (with Richard Nixon’s historically unprecedented and ostensibly temporary suspension of the Gold standard in 1971). To be even more explicit, I am sympathetic to the broad vision of the cryptocurrency community and feel that Grayscale and Mr. Silbert, through these actions, have made a critical error in judgement that is neither representative of the community nor beneficial to its core objectives.  Sebag goes on to argue that far from being weightless as suggested in the Grayscale ads, bitcoin actually weighs more than gold. After all, it is hosted on heavy servers!  Further, he tells us that gold has implicit utility – as a thing used to create more bitcoin!  ""Bitcoin needs gold to exist,"" writes Sebag. ""Gold doesn't need Bitcoin to exist.""  While Sebag is splitting hairs here – after all, bitcoin, as a digital asset, is invisible, tasteless, and odorless while gold is a physical object you can wear around your neck – his point is simply that we shouldn't yet discount gold as a valuable asset.  The market, obviously, would agree, with gold trading well above $1,000 an ounce. Just how much we should own as an investment, however, is still a tough call, infographic or no.

42430597,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw65h,1559768421,Every Game This South Korean Startup Makes Has Its Own Blockchain,"South Korean blockchain game startup Planetarium is planning to launch a test version of a new decentralized game, Nine Chronicles, later in this month. The role-playing game will store its storyboard and data all on a blockchain.  Its own blockchain.  This is the first game developed with Planetarium’s game authoring tool which will be officially released as an open source platform this year. Once Libplanet, the authoring tool, is made public by the end of this year, developers will be able to use it to make games as well as blockchains for the games.  Planetarium CEO Kijun Seo thinks blockchain game developers are shoehorning games into existing blockchain platforms like ethereum or EOS. Instead, Planetarium suggests that a game should be made and run in an independent and complete ecosystem, which means that if there are ten games, there should be ten different blockchain platforms made for each game.  “Decisions about the game are to be determined by the needs of the games, not by the platform. We should define the game first, not the blockchain underneath it,” Seo said.  Planetarium expects that its open-source platform will let the users create their own versions of games following the example of the legendary online game League of Legends.  An earlier game, Warcraft III, featured a popular custom map made by gamers which led to the birth of League of Legends, Seo noted, adding that blockchain can remove hindrances to such creativity:  “When game companies found out that any secondary creation by users’ modding went against their interests, they blocked the private servers that gamers installed or sued the users for violation of copyrights. I believe that decentralized games built upon our open source platform will be able to open a new era for secondary creations.”  Planetarium has already attracted seed investment from South Korean venture capital firms and it plans to adopt a dual-license system, encouraging the use of open source code but receiving funds for commercial uses.

According to a press release Wednesday, the SEC is accusing Longfin, whose share price jumped some 2,000 percent in 2017 after announcing a blockchain pivot, of falsifying its revenue and fraudulently getting the company listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The charges come on top of previous allegations of illicitly distributing unregistered shares, which previously resulted in a preliminary injunction.  ""The complaint alleges that Longfin and Meenavalli obtained qualification for a Regulation A+ offering by falsely representing in SEC filings that the company was principally managed and operated in the U.S. when, in fact, the company’s operations, assets and management remained offshore,"" according to the filing.  The company and its CEO also allegedly distributed 400,000 shares to insiders and affiliates without actually selling these shares, simply to meet listing criteria for the Nasdaq.  What's more, Longfin consultant Andy Altahawi allegedly ""misrepresented to Nasdaq"" how many shares were sold, and how many shareholders existed.  In addition to the fraudulent shares allegation, Longfin reportedly inflated its inflow, ""recording more than $66 million in sham revenue.""  In a statement, SEC associate director of the Division of Enforcement Anita Bandy said ""we allege a multi-pronged fraud involving fake revenue, misrepresentations to the SEC, and false statements to Nasdaq,” adding:  “Today’s filings reflect the work of a dedicated SEC staff who, after moving swiftly on behalf of investors to freeze assets last year, continued investigating to uncover the alleged fraud.”  The company shut down in November 2018.  The SEC has previously accused Longfin of issuing more than 2 million restricted shares to several individuals, who in turn sold these shares to collectively make more than $27 million in profits.  A federal judge later ruled  that “The SEC has shown that it is likely to prove at trial that these defendants participated in an unregistered, illegal public offering of the stock of Longfin Corp.”  SEC image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/05/firm-that-saw-stock-boost-after-crypto-pivot-hit-with-new-sec-charges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6410e701446e0448cc104f1a02edbb26bec70e8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430574,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw5Zh,1559763295,Privacy Crypto Grin's First Hard Fork Planned for July,"Grin developers have reached a rough agreement on a block number and expected date of activation for the crypto network's first ever system-wide upgrade or hard fork.  Proposed by Quentin Le Sceller, a Grin core developer and software engineer at blockchain startup BlockCypher, during a developer call on Tuesday, the proposed activation block number is 262,080. The network is expected to hit this block height on July 17.  On Wednesday, developers re-discussed Le Sceller's hard fork timeline, which also calls for launching a private test network for the upgrade in the beginning of June and activation of the upgrade on the public Grin test network – called Floonet – on June 19.  Taking a step back, Grin is a privacy-focussed cryptocurrency that leverages a technology called MimbleWimble to obfuscate transaction activity. Launched back in January, Grin raised roughly $65,000 from crowd-sourced donations in the months preceding its launch. After receiving a mysterious bitcoin donation in early May worth roughly $300,000, the project presently holds roughly holds about $420,000 in funds.  During today's impromptu meeting, Grin core developer Michael Cordner who goes by the pseudonym ""Yeastplume"" emphasized that while the proposed timeline could change, efforts should be taken to stick by the schedule.  ""If the date slips, we'll communicate it closer to the time,"" wrote Cordner in the developer chatroom. ""But we should really try to keep to it, which is another reason [why] we should keep all non-[hard fork] related [pull requests] out until post [Grin version] 2.0.0.""  Cuckaroo29  The scheduled hard fork in July is actually one of four anticipated system-wide upgrades in Grin's two-year roadmap of the Grin blockchain, designed to keep specialized mining hardware from proliferating on the network.  Most notably, Grin employs two different proof-of-work mining algorithms that dictate the efficacy of using ASICs versus more general computing devices called GPUs. One called Cuckatoo31+ is explicitly ASIC-friendly while the other, called Cuckaroo29, is designed to optimize for GPU-specific capabilities.  Overtime the vision is to gradually phase out Cuckaroo29 in favor of Cuckatoo31+ given a philosophy that no mining algorithm can remain ASIC-resistant forever. But in order to ensure that the secondary mining algorithm – Cuckaroo29 – stays truly ASIC-resistant for the initial period of two years, Grin developers agreed to execute minor changes to the later upgrade every six or so months.  Grin's first upcoming hard fork will execute a change to the Cuckaroo29 mining algorithm designed to ensure its ASIC-resistant qualities on the network. However, Le Sceller emphasized to CoinDesk that in a matter of two years, this mining algorithm ""will disappear.""  In addition, Grin developers are expected to discuss sometime this month potential delays or holds to the schedule of the Cuckatoo31+ mining algorithm taking effect in 2021 and beyond.  Other changes  Outside of the mining algorithm tweak, Grin's first hard fork activation will also feature notable upgrades to the cryptocurrency's wallet software aimed at increasing wallet flexibility and usability.  One of the proposals going into the hard fork titled ""improved bulletproof rewind scheme,"" Le Sceller tells CoinDesk will basically enable new kinds of wallet including multi-signature wallets and ""watch-only"" wallets alongside regular ones.  ""A watch-only wallet is just a way to see the output of a wallet (i.e. the balance and the incoming funds) but you won't be able to spend them,"" detailed Le Sceller. ""This is useful for a lot of stuff. [For example,] auditing or simply if you do not want to use your private key just to see your wallet balance.""  Additionally, Grin's wallet API will also get a boost to enable new functions such as transaction invoicing.  Le Sceller highlighted:  ""Regarding the new API version, [Grin developer] Yeastplume has been working on it for some time now and it's an enhanced version using JSON-RPC (compared to the previous one which was using REST)...A website using Grin [tokens] can create an invoice and the client only 'need to sign it' which reduces the number of back and forth.""  Le Sceller added that mining pools, exchanges, and other users interacting with the Grin protocol will need to upgrade both their node and wallet software in order to accept new blocks and build transactions past the anticipated hard fork point.  He also emphasized that while developers reached a consensus today around the hard fork timeline, ""all the dates in the document that I shared are tentative and not definitive,"" indicating potential for change after further discussion in months to come.

42382025,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUdP,1559760303,The SEC Can’t Keep Kik-ing the Crypto Can Down the Road,"Diego Zuluaga is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives.      The Securities and Exchange Commission, the most important regulator for the largest capital market in the world, has been grappling with the question of how to regulate cryptocurrencies for more than two years. Yet as of mid-2019, more than 10 years since the birth of bitcoin, it cannot claim to have made much progress.  The latest example of the SEC’s ambiguous approach is the launch of an enforcement action against Kik Interactive, Inc. Kik is a social media platform that began issuing its own cryptocurrency (Kin) in mid-2017.  Before the enforcement action, Kin’s market capitalization was $40 million – tiny by comparison to the wider crypto market ($245 billion), which is itself a tiny fraction of the $65 trillion market value of U.S.-listed stocks and bonds.  The SEC has a mandate to bring actions against individuals and firms that issue securities without registering the offering or adhering to an exemption. But the Commission has so far failed to provide any reliable guidance as to which criteria it uses to determine whether a token qualifies as a security.  Important spokespeople for the SEC, such as its Chairman Jay Clayton and the Director of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman, have made divergent statements. More generally, the SEC has repeatedly stated that it will judge future cases by their individual “facts and circumstances,” which has not helped market participants understand its general approach.  What has been lacking is a clear statement of the circumstances in which a token offering is not a securities offering. The SEC has failed to provide an avenue for crypto issuers who – as seems to be the case with Kin’s promoters – do not wish to offer a security and want to make that clear from the outset to prospective buyers.  Mixed signals  As recently as last year, Chairman Clayton claimed that “all ICOs [initial coin offerings] [he’d] seen [were] securities.” Yet, in the more than 12 months since, the SEC has pursued three dozen enforcement actions against digital asset issuers. That’s less than 10 percent of the 434 ICOs that the SEC’s own complaint against Kin cites for 2017, using figures from CoinDesk. What’s more, many of those three dozen involve outright fraud, not just unregistered securities offerings.  Clayton has not yet, to my knowledge, amended his previous statement. Meanwhile, Hinman almost exactly a year ago said in a speech that if a cryptocurrency was decentralized enough, it would not meet the SEC’s definition of a security, which involves a common enterprise and profits generated solely from the efforts of people other than the owner – the so-called Howey test.  A long-awaited guidance on digital asset offerings sought to outline, in plain English, the SEC’s procedure for deciding whether a token offering is an investment contract regulated by the SEC. Unfortunately, the guidance turned the 70-year-old, four-pronged Howey test into a 40-point-plus list of potential reasons why the SEC might consider a token offering to be an offering of securities. The guidance also introduced new concepts, like that of an “active participant,” which arguably broaden the reach of the Howey test beyond what the courts have previously interpreted.  Even SEC insiders have been critical of this guidance. Commissioner Hester Peirce, one of the loudest voices for innovation and clarity currently holding a top office at the SEC, has warned that the guidance risks unduly expanding the Commission’s remit in cryptocurrency regulation and discouraging innovators from doing business in the United States.  Fleeing the US  Indeed, major industry players like Binance and Circle have already either fully or partially geo-blocked United States IP addresses from using their services. Companies and talent have relocated to friendlier jurisdictions, such as Singapore and Switzerland. U.S. consumers and investors have been forced to forgo participation in what could be beneficial innovation in which they have a right to partake. Given America’s pre-eminent status as a financial and technology hub, and the large size of U.S. consumer and investment markets, this shift in geographic location appears to be mainly due to a failure of regulation. As the main regulator and the most aggressive when it comes to cryptocurrencies, the SEC has, however unwittingly, prolonged regulatory uncertainty.  Kik and its supporters see the SEC’s enforcement action as a chance to provide clarity for the crypto industry, and they have established a legal defense fund to that end. They argue that Kin was not marketed as an investment of money, but rather as a medium of exchange on the Kik platform and as a reward for performing certain activities on that platform. Kik also disputes the SEC’s claim of centralization and denies that users could have had an expectation of profits based on the efforts of the promoters.  Whether these arguments will persuade the court is an open question. Kin’s offering certainly shares some features with other ICOs, such as Munchee, that have previously settled with the SEC and returned the funds raised to their investors. The language used by Kin representatives and in documents relating to the 2017 token offering also arguably hint at a common enterprise and the possibility of quick returns, two prongs of the Howey test. Those statements might strengthen the prosecution’s case that Kin meets the Howey test.  Regardless of the outcome on the question of a securities law violation, a court might take a stab at defining decentralization, at last providing a reliable standard to establish which crypto projects fall under the SEC’s remit. The court is not the sole path for greater certainty. Legislative efforts, notably the Token Taxonomy Act, look to provide a legal definition of a digital token that would, in specific and clearly defined circumstances, fall outside the purview of the securities laws. I have also offered a framework that would treat functional cryptocurrencies as commodities and provide an off-ramp from securities registration for non-functional tokens that meet certain conditions, while retaining existing rules for tokens that meet the Howey test.  Over the last two years, the SEC has missed several opportunities to give clear and consistent guidance about the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies. This inaction has needlessly prolonged uncertainty and instilled distrust and fear among market participants. The effects of this failure on America’s leadership in financial innovation are likely to be long-lasting.

42382015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUQp,1559757657,Think Tank Pushes for Creation of a National Cryptocurrency in Switzerland,"Avenir Suisse, one of the most influential think tanks in Switzerland, released a report urging the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to start working on a national cryptocurrency.  The report, called “Blockchain After the Hype,” proposes an economic model based on the blockchain. It suggests that the next step is to move forward with the creation of a ""franc token"" controlled by the SNB.  According to the new model suggested by Avenir Suisse, developing a stablecoin could convert Switzerland into a “blockchain nation.” The publication presents this goal as a way to upgrade the Swiss financial sector by enabling the trade of cryptoassets.  “It would facilitate tokenized securities trading if the National Bank and major players in the industry were to drive the development of a Swiss franc token,” the report reads.  Also, the centralized asset would be a door to blockchain use in other areas of the financial industry, mainly trade finance and new business models. The approach will help Switzerland move ahead of its peers in Europe while expanding global market possibilities.  “If it manages to position itself internationally as a pioneer in trading tokenized securities, Switzerland will be able to expand its relatively small capital market,” Avenir Suisse wrote.  More Action, Less Talk  The need for a cryptocurrency comes after a year of back and forth from the SNB about the impact of cryptocurrency and its plans to use distributed ledger technology to create trading platforms for tokens.  The publication also presses for the necessity of a framework for blockchain and cryptocurrency. The think tank recommends that laws must be made adaptable to these technologies.  “Essentially the law should be changed only in areas where it’s not yet DLT-compatible. But these changes have to be made as soon as possible.”, the think tank says.  In the mean time, the SNB's stand towards crypto adoption is still on neutral ground after recently hosting the Conference on Cryptoassets and Financial Innovation.  Switzerland is known for its open policy on blockchain experimentation, but the think tank argues that the time for trials is over and that the institutions must move forward.  “Switzerland now has to take the next step in the development of DLT, morphing from the much-vaunted “Crypto Valley” into a fully-fledged DLT nation,” Avenir Suisse said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Diana Aguilar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/05/think-tank-pushes-for-creation-of-a-national-cryptocurrency-in-switzerland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ac39a0e6f17c8a5b570bb3bdcbfc482126dab02-1000x563.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As reported by Malta Today, the European Commission said the island jurisdiction's moves to boost its cryptocurrency sector, alongside sizable financial and gaming industries, mean an effective AML regime is required. The comments came in recommendations made to EU member nations regarding spending of EU funding.  The commission said that it was ""positive"" that Malta's Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit had seen increases in budget and staffing levels, and other procedures had been ramped up. However, it sees scope for government failings that could affect Malta's business prospects.  The commission said:  “Governance shortcomings, particularly in the fight against corruption, may also adversely affect the business environment and weigh negatively on investment. In particular, there is a risk of conflict of interest at various levels of government.  Further, it said the Malta Police Force’s Economic Crimes Unit is not adequately staffed, according to the report.  ""In this context, it is important to couple a strengthened legislative framework with timely and thorough implementation,” said the commission.  Malta has been actively working to create a friendly regulatory regime for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. To that end, the island's government passed several pieces of legislation last summer that have since seen notable crypto exchanges such as Binance and OKCoin open offices there.  The nation has already been taking some steps to more effectively spot suspect crypto activity. Last month, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) announced that it would integrate CipherTrace’s Compliance Monitoring product to “protect consumers, investors and business partners.”  The tool uses blockchain analytics and forensics to look out for “suspicious” addresses and wallets, according to CipherTrace’s website. The firm says it profiles cryptocurrency exchanges, ATMs, coin mixers and money laundering systems, as well as known criminal addresses, to score transactions and gauge the level of risk.

The announcement came during the tech giant’s Worldwide Developers Conference.  According to Apple, the new framework will integrate options for hashing, key generation and exchange, and encryption for developers on iOS apps. The new framework will supplant Apple’s previous framework, CommonCrypto, which does not support Swift.  CryptoKit will allow developers to avoid lower-level interfaces by freeing developers from managing raw pointers and automatically overwriting sensitive data during memory deallocation, according to the company. Encryption will be possible for data at rest or in transit.  The common key operations will include computing and comparing cryptographically secure digests, using public-key cryptography to create and evaluate digital signatures, and generating symmetric keys for message authentication and encryption.  While the new framework features more hash functionality, like support for SHA256, it will not support the secp256k1 curve used by Ethereum and other blockchains.

42382019,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUUb,1559752201,$1 Billion Valuation May Elude Ethereum Co-Founder’s New Blockchain Polkadot,"Blockchain project Polkadot’s bid for a $1.2 billion valuation has hit a snag.  Since January, the Web3 Foundation, the Switzerland-based nonprofit behind the project, has been trying to raise up to $60 million through a private token sale. According to people familiar with the situation, three Chinese funds have agreed to invest $15 million in the project's DOT tokens.  However, these three investors agreed to pay prices that, on average, valued the project below $1 billion, the sources said – falling short of the unicorn threshold Polkadot was reportedly seeking. (The agreed-to prices may vary from investor to investor.)  While it's unclear how many tokens the three Chinese funds bought, or how many investors besides them participated, one source said Polkadot has been able to sell only 70 percent of the intended 500,000 DOT.  Rather than closing the private round now, Polkadot will continue trying to sell the remaining tokens to accredited investors and distributing them freely to community contributors, sources said.  Assuming other investors participate at similar valuations to the three funds, selling the remaining 30 percent would not bring in the targeted proceeds. To raise the full $60 million, then, Polkadot would need to increase the allocation of tokens for sale.  In a statement, Web3 said it could not comment on any private sale, ""but we're looking forward to making that information public as soon as possible.""  Proceeds from the sale are to be used for testing Polkadot’s mainnet, incentivizing developers and funding Web3 Foundation’s research and operations, sources said.  Chain of chains  Stepping back, Polkadot is one of the most hotly anticipated blockchains that have yet to launch.  Created by Gavin Wood, co-founder of ethereum and founder of Parity Technologies, Polkadot aims to build a blockchain network that can enable other blockchains to work in conjunction with each other. A rival network with a similar goal of interoperability, Cosmos, launched in March.  In a separate statement, Parity CEO Jutta Steiner said the firm is “excited about the new possibilities Polkadot brings to the table,"" adding:  ""True interoperability delivered in a scalable, governable protocol has real potential to push the dream of an open internet forward. We’ve been hard at work over the past year building [custom-blockchain platform] Substrate and development on Polkadot has progressed as hoped.”  Steiner's statement did not address the ongoing token sale.  The market's appetite for such sales has trended upward in recent months, with Blockstack setting out to raise $50 million in a regulated offering, and other startups raising smaller amounts.  The Web3 Foundation garnered $145 million through a public sale of half the total 10 million supply of DOT in October 2017, valuing the tokens around $30 apiece. (The current placeholder tokens are locked in a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain and would be swapped for ones on the new blockchain once it launches.) It employs roughly 37 people and continues to hire in its quest to deliver a potentially lucrative technology for cross-blockchain transfers.  The foundation still plans to do another public distribution of tokens ""at or around"" the time the Polkadot blockchain launches, its statement said. ""Our goal is to ensure that DOT tokens make it into the hands of those that will actively participate in helping build out the Polkadot network.""  According to Polkadot's white paper, 30 percent of the total token supply was reserved for Web3 Foundation, while the remaining 20 percent was to be distributed prior to the mainnet launch, the date of which is still to be determined. Web3 has spent half of its allocation, leaving it with 15 percent of the total supply, said a source familiar with the situation.  OTC trading  Five percent of the total supply was allocated for the latest fundraise. The $60 million initially sought from the sale implies a target price per DOT of $100 to $120. The placeholder tokens are not listed on any major exchanges, as Web3 discourages trading them.  But a former Web3 employee said that over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks are currently swapping DOT tokens for anywhere from $75 to $120 each.  Contributors to the project, the former employee said, were compensated with tokens and are obligated to hold them for at least a year (while investors can liquidate immediately). Thus they are strongly incentivized to participate in governance after the launch, since votes are required to make code improvements that would support the tokens' value, this person said.  When asked about OTC trades, Web3 director Ryan Zurrer said, “We don’t authorize them and they are very risky,” since they would require either sharing a private key to the locked ethereum tokens or selling an IOU.  Some members of the ethereum community are critical of what they see as Polkadot’s similarity to permissioned blockchains, given how council votes will eventually have a tie-breaking and steering role in governance. It’s unclear who will be on that council, with rotating seats.  The former employee summed up the potential concerns by saying:  “It’s basically a permissioned blockchain run by Gavin, Ryan and their friends.”  UPDATE (June 6, 18:00 UTC): Passages in this article have been updated to clarify the status of the ethereum placeholder tokens, the reason they are difficult to trade, the motivation for token holders to participate in governance and the role of the Polkadot council.

42382020,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUVr,1559743209,Israeli Startup Launches First Non-Custodial Wallet Without Private Keys,"The world has seen both hot and cold storage but now one company is bringing “chill storage.” ZenGo, a Tel Aviv-based firm, is promising the first non-custodial wallet without private keys, points of failure, or passwords, all with a custodian-grade experience.  Following last years’ $4 million in seed funding from Samsung, Benson Oak, and Elron as well as three blockchain grants from Zcash, Tezos, and Zilliqa, ZenGo is going public with the mandate of simplicity and security.  The decentralized security protocols along with distributed key management means there is no single point of failure, “seed phrase or mnemonic non-sense,” or hackable or sim-jacking based password system.  “This is the first secure user controlled crypto wallet which can be adopted and used by anyone, removing the typical friction points you find in alternative solutions,” said Ouriel Ohayon, co-founder of the company. “Until now users had the choice between two poisons: be their own bank at the cost of complexity, human errors or hacks or trust a third party blindly (which they chose by default because it’s just easier but then lose total control).”  Frustrated with the “overwhelming and tedious” state of crypto wallets when first entering to the industry, Ohayon and his partners aimed to give ZenGo users total control over their funds, without the annoyance of traditional wallet.  Ohayon boasts his app's simplicity in setup, account restoration, and password-less access. Additionally, ZenGo has been audited by Kudelski and AppSec, offers biometric encryption, and can guarantee funds will not be impacted if either a user’s phone or server is hacked.  “Once we knew we could take the core principles of threshold cryptography and distributed computation and make it highly performant on the mobile, we knew we could build a step function improvement to whatever was existing,” said Ohayon.  Furthermore, unlike multi-sig technology, ZenGo is blockchain agnostic and can support any asset.  “After a few weeks of beta on iOS we already manage seven figures AUM in USD in our system,” he said. The platform is due to launch on Android in a few weeks, according to a representative.  ZenGo early adopters will have a lifetime of free access. Once established the company plans to charge a subscription fee to new customers and add services that will generate transaction fees.  “We believe wallets will become the default interface to interact with blockchain based services as long as they are usable,” said Ohayon.

According to a report by The Asahi Shimbun on Wednesday, the newspaper's sources have said that larger cryptocurrency transactions could be tracked in an effort to identify trades that are not being declared for tax purposes.  The potential move has been prompted by the finding that some 50 traders and 30 firms in Japan had not declared cryptocurrency income worth over 10 billion yen ($92.3 million) over the last few years, the sources said.  The level of tax under-reporting is likely due to the high rate at which crypto earnings are taxed. Classified as ""miscellaneous income,"" crypto gains are taxed at up to 55 percent. By comparison, earnings from trading stocks are taxed at 20 percent.  According to the report, an investigative team at the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau asked some cryptocurrency exchanges to submit clients' transaction data in 2018, allowing it to build a list of accounts that made sizable earnings  That, along with data collected by other regional tax offices around Japan, suggested to authorities that traders with around 7 billion yen ($9.26 million) of such income had attempted to conceal it for tax purposes.  As such, Asahi Shimbun says the tax authorities may file criminal complaints over tax evasion against traders who hid larger incomes or employed illicit means to do so.

Karpeles, the author of the new book ""Cryptocurrency 3.0,"" has come out as vocal proponent of improved security on the blockchain and bitcoin. “It is dangerous that Bitcoin will continue to exist with the current encryption technology,” he said in a wide-ranging interview with CoinDesk Japan.  In February 2014, Karpeles announced that hackers had stolen 850,000 bitcoin from Mt. Gox over the preceding year. The site, originally a ""Magic: The Gathering"" trading site, morphed into a bitcoin exchange and was one of the first places many crypto luminaries bought and sold bitcoin. The firm went bankrupt. Karpeles admitted fault and Japanese police arrested him. The hack was, in short, the definitive moment for cryptocurrency. In a heartbeat the industry went from clever toy to a serious – and expensive – business.  ""Although I was able to win my case in March 2019, I am very sorry that I caused a great deal of damage to customers and caused inconvenience to the people involved,” he said.  In the interview, he described the difficulties of running a popular exchange from his office in Japan.  “When I took over the management of Mt. Gox in 2011, I worked with the members of the field and a team of lawyers from various countries in order to cope with the system issues that will be discovered one after another and the rapidly increasing transaction volume,” he said. “I was monitoring on a 24-hour basis. At that time, it would be nice if I could sleep for 2 hours. Dealing with time difference between foreign countries meant I sometimes had a conferences scheduled for 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.”  “Perhaps now, the people in charge of operating the virtual currency exchange centers have learned to manage this pressure. However, human error can not be prevented as long as risk is covered manually,” he said.  Karpeles now believes that administrators must rebuild the entire bitcoin security infrastructure.  “There is still the risk of the virtual currency being stolen as a PC or hardware wallet may be hacked. In other words, with the current mechanisms and technologies, it is still impossible to eliminate risk. Innovation of cryptographic technology is a must,” he said.  “The point is encryption technology. Bitcoin itself has been using a technology called ECDSA from the beginning, and has never been hacked,” he said. “However, as it is difficult to eliminate hacking damage, you will have to think that there is also no permanently safe cryptographic technology. It is dangerous that Bitcoin will continue to exist with the current encryption technology.”  Karpeles wants security to be as simple – and visible – as the move from standard ""http"" to web sites secured by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS).  To that end, he's announced the creation of a new startup called Tristan Technologies Co that aims to build this new tech.  He said he still finds the cryptocurrency space magical, however, and there is still a whisper of the young man that took over an early exchange and created a worldwide sensation.  “As I wrote in my book 'Cryptocurrency 3.0,' I love Japanese animation, but one of the most impressive movies I’ve seen recently is 'The Promised Neverland,'” he said. “It is a story in which children escape from a place where they are trapped. How will each child deal with harsh and unfriendly reality? I watched the anime with great interest.”  “The reality surrounding cryptocurrency is severe,” he said in the interview. “However, I do not think that a powerful organization decides to do it this way, but I think that a system that can provide choices to each participant ‘everyone’ is ideal. If it works, even if there are security issues, it may not be possible for everyone to shift in the direction of solution without waiting for a big decision.”  Karpeles image courtesy of CoinDesk Japan.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/05/mark-karpeles-bitcoin-security-tech-needs-an-update,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f8057f5d3443d35e115efd699f5e5c07f9cface-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382031,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUkx,1559732403,Bitcoin Recovers From 2-Week Low But Price Outlook Remains Bearish,"View    Bitcoin’s short-term outlook has turned bearish, courtesy of Tuesday's UTC close below the 30-day average of price. A key daily and 3-day chart indicator is also indicating an end of the price rally from December lows.  Hence, BTC’s $400 recovery from 2.5-week lows hit on Tuesday could be short-lived. Prices risk falling to $7,000 over the next few days.  The hourly chart indicates the ongoing recovery may be extended to $8,000 before a potential slide toward $7,000.  A UTC close above the 10-day price average at $8,383 is needed to invalidate the short-term bearish setup.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) ongoing corrective bounce could be short-lived, as the charts are signaling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  The premiere cryptocurrency is currently trading at $7,822 on Bitstamp – up almost $400 from the low of $7,432 hit yesterday.  However, Tuesday’s UTC close below the 30-day moving average (MA) may embolden sellers, putting the sustainability of the gains in doubt.  The 30-day MA has served as strong support throughout the rally from early February lows near $3,500 to the recent high of $9,097. Essentially, BTC created multiple bullish higher lows along that line over the last four months, as discussed yesterday.  Now, the short-term outlook has turned bearish with the first UTC close below the average since Feb. 8. Other widely-tracked technical indicators are also signaling a trend change in favor of the bears.  Daily chart    The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has dived out of the rising trendline representing a rally from December lows near $3,100, and is now teasing a drop into a bearish territory with a reading below 50.00. Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages have produced a bearish crossover.  The Chaikin money flow index – which takes into account both the price and trading volumes – is losing altitude, a sign of weakening buying pressure.  The price action seen at press time also indicates that the tide has turned, with BTC struggling to register big gains above the 30-day MA, currently at $7,772.  That BTC is revisiting the 30-day MA hurdle is not surprising, as markets tend to crowd out weak hands (buyers in this case) before falling on price breakdowns/breakouts.  Overall, the cryptocurrency looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000 over the next few days.  3-day chart  On the 3-day chart, the RSI has rolled over from overbought levels above 70, signaling scope for deeper correction. The indicator diverged in favor of the bears (lower highs) earlier this week.  The Chaikin money flow index is also beginning to lose altitude on this time-frame.  Thus, BTC risks falling to the 200-candle MA, currently flatlined at $7,211.  Hourly chart  The hourly chart tells a slightly different story, reporting a bullish divergence (higher lows) of the RSI. So BTC may extend its recovery to $8,000, before a potential slide toward $7,000, as suggested by the daily and 3-day charts.  The short-term bias will remain bearish as long as prices are held below the 10-day MA, currently at $8,383.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382011,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUOJ,1559728839,Former Mt Gox CEO Says He Wants to Restore Japan as Tech Leader,"Update and correction (09:00 UTC, June 7): CoinDesk reached out to Mark Karpeles to discuss the facts of the original source of this article, The Mainichi newspaper. This was his reply:  ""Thank you very much for reaching out. I believe I've been quite clear during the press conference and I'm not sure how this got reported wrong, considering some people even asked if I wouldn't consider returning to the crypto/blockchain industry.  Tristan Technologies isn't exactly a startup per se, since the company has been up and running for years and is now self sufficient (and doesn't have the kind of budget startups usually have). We focus on IT solutions, mostly cloud-based, and offer services such as a Google Drive/Dropbox replacement called AtOnline Drive (among other things).  I am also working with London Trust Media (the company behind privateinternetaccess.com) on new brands and services such as futurefcmma.com.""  The article has been updated to reflect Karpeles' comments.      Mark Karpeles has revealed he's ""starting from zero"" with an IT project soon after escaping most charges in a court case over the collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  Talking to reporters at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan on Wednesday, The Mainichi reports, Karpeles said his company will develop a secure operating system that will outdo current systems in terms of speed.  Karpeles is acting as as chief technology officer of the Japan-registered firm, Tristan Technologies Co.  In comments that seem aimed to repair his reputation in the country, Karpeles said he hopes the tech will help restore Japan as a global tech leader after its advantage had been lost to U.S. giants like Apple, Amazon and Facebook in recent years.  He said:  ""Japan used to be engineering superpower in terms of its PCs but right now, taking the cloud for example, it's the U.S. that dominates. But I still believe in the potential Japan has and I would like to develop that.""  According to the report, the former Mt. Gox CEO indicated he currently does not hold any cryptocurrencies and that they are a high risk asset. ""I wouldn't say I'm rich today,"" he added.  Just three months ago, Karpeles was cleared in a Tokyo court on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. However, he was found guilty of manipulating the exchange's data, receiving a suspended sentence of 2.5 years. He later indicated he will appeal the conviction, saying in late March:  “During the opening of my trial in 2017, I swore to God that I am innocent of all charges. I believe appealing to the judgment is appropriate so that I can be judged again in full consideration of all the facts.”  In early 2014, Mt. Gox revealed it had previously suffered a massive hack involving 850,000 bitcoin, some of which was later found. The exchange officially filed for liquidation in April of that year.

Following a six-month pilot phase, Russian blockchain startup Factorin announced Tuesday that it's launching its system into production with Dixy – a supermarket chain with 2 percent of the Russian market and almost $5 billion in revenue in 2018 – already on board.  Developed on a private version of ethereum, the new system will allow Dixy's suppliers to receive payments within one business day instead of the previous two weeks. The platform connects with several banks and factoring companies (which facilitate the settlements between the retailer and multiple suppliers) via a single interface, according to Factorin co-founder Andrei Maklin.  Among the first participants are two Russian banks, Alfa Bank and Pervouralskbank, as well as several factoring companies in the country, Factorin said. The platform is available for participants via both desktop and mobile interfaces.  The product has been in the pilot phase since December and has run 12,000 test transactions over the period, Maklin told CoinDesk. ""Now with the testing we see that the platform significantly reduces the time of settlement, and we're going into production"" he said.  Dixy's chief financial officer, Julia Zhuvaga, confirmed the news, saying in a statement:  ""Tech visionaries like to thrill the public with the stories of the beautiful future, but in reality, top management in any company wants to see better results not in a couple of years but as soon as possible. This platform allows us to see the change here and now.""  According to Maklin, there are about 20 nodes in its network at the moment, of which two are ""full fledged"" nodes on participants' servers. Three more are now in the process of being set up, others are working in the cloud.  Dixy has become Factorin's first major client, but Maklin is keen to ensure it's not the last.  ""Working with Dixy for us became an example of innovation in the large companies. We have ambitious plans for retail and other industries,"" he said in a statement. Further down the road, the platform is planned to be scaled up and adapted for various types of business.

42382014,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUPZ,1559721646,Lightning Co-Creator Releases Code for Bitcoin Scaling Concept,"Tadge Dryja, who co-authored the original paper underpinning bitcoin's experimental lightning payments network, has released a new research paper outlining a proposed scaling solution that he's been working on for the past year.  Released Monday, Utreexo would make the part of bitcoin full nodes called the ""state"" (also known as the ""UTXO set"") smaller and easier to run with the help of cryptographic proofs. Though the idea has been around since before CoinDesk first covered the idea in January, this paper describes the idea in greater technical detail.  Dryja is known for being one of the most prominent technologists behind the ""lightning"" idea, that bitcoin can scale significantly if transactions are pushed to a second layer. Several groups of developers are working to implement the technology for bitcoin payments, though it's still experimental and not completely safe to use.  Utreexo has a similar motivation, which boils down to making bitcoin full nodes easier to run. Though they take some computing resources to set up, they're the most secure way of using bitcoin, without needing to trust a middleman to verify that transactions on the network are real.  ""As the number of users of the system increases, the UTXO set grows, and the resource cost of running a node increases. This has led to a progressively smaller proportion of users running their own node as more users rely on light clients or on [third] party nodes to inform them of the state of the network,"" the paper explains.  As such, the paper outlines a way that nodes could use cryptographic proofs to store less data without compromising on security. ""Nodes using the accumulator need only store a logarithmically sized representation of the UTXO set, greatly reducing storage space and disk seek times,"" the paper states.  The paper also reveals the results of simulations Dryja has run showing the benefits of the scheme.  ”Since January I've implemented more code and made the code public on GitHub, and gotten performance numbers for bitcoin mainnet download sizes,” he told CoinDesk.  Though, looking at these numbers, there is a small catch: although the storage requirements decrease overall, the proofs data increases the network bandwidth load.  ""In our simulations of downloading Bitcoin’s blockchain up to early 2019 with 500MB of RAM allocated for caching, the proofs only add approximately 25% to the amount otherwise downloaded,"" the paper explains.  If other developers want to take a look and pick it apart for themselves, Dryja told CoinDesk he released the code as open source so developers can test out the idea.  ""It's not integrated into a wallet yet, which will still take some time, but the library is there for people to try out,"" he remarked.

42382010,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUN3,1559707232,"The SEC Case Against Kik's ICO Appears Strong, Experts Say","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued messenger app maker Kik for its $100 million ICO – which the agency contends was an unregistered securities sale – and the regulator appears to have built up a strong case in its initial court move.  In a complaint filed Tuesday  , the SEC alleged that Kik violated federal securities law by not registering its kin token sale. In a response, Kik’s general counsel, Eileen Lyon, said that the SEC’s complaint makes a number of inaccurate assumptions which “stretch the Howey test well beyond its definition” and that the agency's push will not withstand judicial scrutiny.  Nelson Rosario, a principal at Smolinksi Rosario Law, told CoinDesk that the SEC’s complaint against Kik was similar to others brought against other initial coin offerings (ICOs), in particular with respect to the evidence that the regulator is putting forth.  “Obviously this is a very sophisticated kind of token offering, done by a company that was already established [and not a token startup] but [the] kind of evidence that the SEC brought to bear is very much the same that it’s brought against [other ICOs],” he said.  However, the most distinguishing feature of this case may be that it strictly focuses on an alleged violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.  “Until now, all of the SEC's contested enforcement actions have involved some element of fraud or intentional misconduct,” said Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at Compound Finance. He told CoinDesk:  “The Kik action is significant because it represents the SEC's first [contested] enforcement action for a pure regulatory violation – that is, a case where a token issuer simply failed to register with the SEC based on its good faith interpretation of the law.""  Rosario concurred, noting that this case did not involve any sort of alleged fraud, as did Stephen Palley, an attorney with Anderson Kill.  “This is a straight up ‘you didn’t register,’ this isn’t securities fraud, the allegation here is ‘you had a security and you didn’t register it,’” Palley told CoinDesk.  Strong case  Drew Hinkes, an attorney for Carlton Fields and general counsel to Athena Blockchain, said the SEC included a great number of facts in its case.  The regulator provided evidence sourced from YouTube, Slack messages, Twitter and even a roadshow that Kik conducted in the early stages of its token sale.  “The SEC has a ton of documentary evidence and a ton of facts,” he said.  This argument was repeated by Palley and Katherine Wu, an independent legal researcher.  “[It] reminds me of the Carl Sandburg quote: If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts. If the law and the facts are against you, pound the table and yell like hell,” Hinkes said, adding:  “Seems like there's a lot of strong facts in the SEC's favor … now the issuer gets to argue the law.”  The facts are likely to be the same facts that Kik will use to argue that it did not violate the Securities Act, however, Wu said.  Moreover, Hinkes noted that “facts aren't as crucial as the way the law is applied to the facts.”  On the facts, though, is where a precedent may be set.  Wu said that, in her view, Kik’s 2017 token sale “was very typical” of other ICOs at the time. The facts that are being used by the SEC to allege Kik violated securities registration requirements could then implicate other token sales, particularly those that conducted sales after the DAO report was published that year.  “If this is a win for the SEC, it will force a ton of the similarly problematic ICO projects to either have to register or disgorge any profits they made,” she said.  What’s more, the DAO report was actually referenced in the SEC’s complaint Tuesday.  'Carrot and stick'  To some, the SEC’s lawsuit Tuesday was all but inevitable.  Chervinsky noted that the regulator has invited crypto startups to work with it, giving companies a chance to comply with federal securities laws.  He noted that the regulator has been investigating “dozens or hundreds” of companies that conducted ICOs, but Kik is the first one to go to court for a registration violation.  “The SEC has taken a ‘carrot and stick’ approach to crypto regulation. … That invitation was the carrot. This enforcement action is the stick,” Chervinsky said.  Similarly, Palley said this case should not be a surprise, and Kik likely anticipated the complaint.  This anticipation may even be the reason why the company started crowdfunding its legal defense, he noted, referencing the recently-announced Defend Crypto campaign that Kik launched last week. He added:  “I would be surprised if this whole thing shocked anyone.”  Indeed, Michael Arrington, one of the sponsors of the campaign, told CoinDesk, ""I don't speak for the company and haven't spoken to them since the news, but from our perspective this was anticipated and was the entire point of the campaign. We continue to fully support their right to a proper defense and hope that cases like these bring regulatory clarity to this burgeoning industry.""  Kik essentially told the SEC that it should sue by making the SEC’s Wells Notice and its subsequent response public, Chervinsky said.  “By publishing its Wells response, Kik essentially threw down the gauntlet and challenged the SEC to file suit,” he said. ""The fact they did so today shouldn't surprise anyone. Kik got what it wanted: a fight in open court instead of behind the SEC's closed doors.""  Setting precedent  The fact that Kik was already an established company prior to its ICO – regardless of its financial status – means that the outcome of this case could have a broader impact compared to others. Rosario noted that Kik’s sale “involved some very sophisticated parties.”  That being said, the case has only just begun.  The SEC may have a strong complaint, but that does not necessarily mean that the case will proceed to a jury trial, Palley said, adding:  “Complaints always look bad … you always read them and think ‘that’s not good,’ that’s the whole point.”  Wu noted that “complaints are always written in a super-biased way,” as they are designed to make an argument.  A court or jury may not read the complaint as a scathing indictment (in a non-legal sense), and it is entirely possible that Kik and the SEC will come to a settlement prior to reaching a jury trial.  Further, the way the SEC opened its complaint moves away from its remit, said Diego Zuluaga, of the Cato Institute think tank.  In his view, the first few pages of the SEC’s complaint are criticizing its business model, which is not its job.  “They’re trying to bias people against [Kik],” he said.  The complaint discussed how “the Kik corporation was declining and its messaging app was losing revenue and losing users,” but the company suddenly launched a cryptocurrency, he said, concluding:  “That may or may not be the case, and I’m not taking sides … but it’s not the SEC’s job to judge business models. That’s designed to make the jury think they have fraudulent aims.”  Zack Seward contributed reporting.
