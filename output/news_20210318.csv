Within hours of the announcement, the firm's U.S. shares, listed on Nasdaq, soared by more than 80% in price, the most in TradingView's price history dating back to 2019.      The price move is unusual for WKEY, which was still trading below its 52-week high of $18.49 at the time of writing. The company is relatively small, with a market cap of only $244 million, even after Thursday's price surge – so it's not exactly a blue-chip, though it's not a Pink Sheets penny stock either.

42406102,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerxCm,1616099855,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Loses Steam After Briefly Touching $60K,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price slid Thursday, retreating along with U.S. stocks and oil prices as U.S. Treasury yields touched some of the highest levels in a year.      The 10-year Treasury note yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, breached 1.75% for the first time since January 2020. The rising yield has been seen by investors as a sign of market worries over future inflation.      A growing number of investors say bitcoin might serve as a good hedge against inflation, but the largest cryptocurrency is also seen as a risky asset. In recent weeks, commentators have warned that higher yields on bonds, typically viewed as a safe investment, might reduce the appeal of bets on riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.      Read more: Bitcoin’s ‘Rich List’ Shrinks Amid Continued Price Rally      ""$57,400 remains our pivotal spot,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, wrote in an email. ""Should bitcoin remain above this level, then the bulls will feel happy exploring and pushing prices to the upside, with $60,780 the target."" A break lower could see the market trade down to as low as $53,360, he wrote.      Bitcoin briefly touched $60,000 early Thursday but proved unable to hold that market level.      Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference Wednesday he saw no need to react to rising Treasury yields.      Some analysts say it may not matter too much for bitcoin – if central banks and governments keep plying financial markets with an unprecedented level of stimulus.      The Japanese brokerage Mizuho recently estimated that some $40 billion of the latest round of direct $1,400 stimulus checks from the U.S. government might be spent on bitcoin and stocks. The German lender Deutsche Bank published a report this week stating that bitcoin is “now too important to ignore” given its $1 trillion market capitalization.      Read more: The US Government Sold Some Bitcoin – And the Winning Bidder Got a Bargain      Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Thursday that central banks are likely to ""double down and 'support the economy' by debasing the currency, even as federal governments hand out helicopter money directly to their respective citizens.""    Ether trades in range    Ether (ETH) slid 2.6% to $1,776, moving in harmony with bitcoin.      For the past couple weeks, the second-largest cryptocurrency has stayed in a range between roughly $1,660 and $1,940.

42406095,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerx6s,1616098164,The US Government Sold Some Bitcoin – and Got a Good Price,"CORRECTION (March 25, 12:47 UTC): An earlier version of this story misinterpreted auction results from the U.S. General Services Administration. The buyer paid above the market price for the bitcoin, not below. An editing error was to blame.      A key reason bitcoin's price has doubled this year, according to many analysts, is so few holders want to part with the cryptocurrency: ""more buyers than sellers,"" as the old Wall Street adage goes.      Unless you're the U.S. government, which this week sold some bitcoin for dollars.      The amount was tiny in relative terms – not even an entire bitcoin, just 0.7501 BTC, worth a little over $40,000. Compare that to the current federal budget deficit, projected during the current fiscal year to exceed the record $3.1 trillion reported for 2020. A veritable drop in the bucket.      But apparently, the government got a good deal.      The Washington Post reported that the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), which held the two-day event that ended on March 17, often holds auctions, usually of surplus federal assets such as office furniture, school buses and aircraft parts.      However, GSA told the Post the federal government has been auctioning bitcoin since 2014, after the FBI shut down the online black market Silk Road and seized more than 170,000 bitcoin in the crackdown.      In this week's auction, the winning bidder got 0.7501 BTC for $53,104. That works out to $70,796 for a full bitcoin – more than 20% over the market price of about $59,000 on March 17.      The government told the newspaper the auction commanded a premium relative to the market price.      “Auctioning off this share of cryptocurrency broke new ground for our GSA Auctions platform, and we’re extremely pleased by the enthusiasm we’ve seen from our bidders,” Acting Regional Administrator Kevin Kerns, with GSA’s southeast sunbelt region, said in a statement to the Post.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/18/the-us-government-sold-some-bitcoin-and-got-a-good-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30af1f3a95e2adfcbc43724ed2fb13a4659a403d-1500x868.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerx0y,1616095385,$4.6M in Filecoin 'Double Deposited' on Binance; Exploit Open on Other Exchanges,"The very problem Bitcoin’s proof-of-work design was meant to stop just took place on the Filecoin (FIL) network – well, sort of.      According to developers at Filfox and FileStar, Binance processed a ""double deposit"" of FIL on Wednesday worth millions of dollars. This is not a true, on-chain double spend, but Binance credited the account for filecoin miner 6Block (the parent of Filfox and Filestar) twice for one deposit due to a “serious bug” in Filecoin’s remote procedure call (RPC) code.      A “double spend” occurs when the same funds on a blockchain are spent twice; Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm was designed to make this a virtual impossibility. But it appears that the RPC codes for Filecoin, a blockchain project for distributed storage built by Protocol Labs, feature a flaw where users can trick exchanges into accepting a deposit twice.    Read more: The Bitcoin Double-Spend That Never Happened    “The RPC channel is the information channel for exchanges to verify deposits are legitimate. They don’t verify directly. Instead, they send a message through the channel saying, ‘Hey, is this guy’s deposit any good?’ And they get a response back from their Filecoin node saying ‘yes’ or ‘no,’” Bitcoin developer Dustin Dettmer explained in a message to CoinDesk.      However, he added, the process Filecoin developers gave to exchanges to verify deposits includes a critical flaw that allows users to deposit the same coins repeatedly.      “This allows hackers to write a single check but re-deposit it as many times as they like – similar to how kids, in the arcade, used to tie strings to quarters to play forever using a single coin,” said Dettmer. “Except here the consequences are more drastic. Unlimited amounts of real funds could be stolen.”      The mishap could more correctly be called a “double-deposit” because this bug did not result in a true double-spend, and the miners who discovered it believe they have found other instances as well.    The Filecoin RBF ‘double deposit’ bug    The 6Block collective discovered the bug Wednesday after accidentally exploiting it. After a 61,000 FIL transaction (worth roughly $4.6 million) to the exchange was taking too long, the team bumped the fee with a “replace-by-fee” (RBF) transaction to speed it up.      A replace-by-fee transaction takes place when a user broadcasts a new transaction to replace an older, unconfirmed transaction and attaches a higher mining fee to it, with the goal of speeding up its confirmation.    Read more: Filecoin Network Upgrade Goes Live, Miners Claim 25% Block Rewards    This RBF transaction, however, resulted in the deposit showing up in their Binance account twice, effectively turning 61,000 FIL into 120,000 FIL. The problem is the second 61k FIL never actually hit Binance’s wallet – Binance was tricked into crediting the deposits twice because of a bug in Filecoin’s RPC codes. The team immediately alerted Binance and Protocol Labs.      Essentially, the bug meant Binance saw both transactions, ignored that they were conflicting and accepted both (for a replace-by-fee transaction, usually, the second, higher fee transaction is considered valid while the first is rejected).      Every exchange with Filecoin trading pairs uses the same ""StateGetReceipt"" RPC code to process deposits, so the bug is theoretically exploitable on any exchange that trades the token, the team said.      ""Protocol Labs suggested that exchanges fetch message receipts from RPC StateGetReceipt, which has a serious bug. When there are two messages with the same sender and same nonce on-chain, (which means a double-spend), StateGetReceipt returns the same result for both of them,” a Filecoin developer told the mining firms in their correspondence.      Deposits for Filecoin at Binance, Huobi and others have been halted as a result, the miners said. CoinDesk has reached out to popular exchanges Binance, Huobi and OKEx to verify these claims, but only heard back from Binance, who said that FIL deposits ""resumed as of March 19, 2021 at 00:45 UTC and systems are back to normal.""      Filecoin developers have opened a GitHub issue to work on a fix and the team has published a post-mortem if the issue. In correspondence with CoinDesk, they denied that the flaw resulted from an RPC error and instead claimed it originated from ""misunderstanding"" and "" misuse"" on Binance’s end.      ""There is no RPC bug. The issue resulted from incorrect usage of APIs from the exchange in question. We do not know of any other exchange that has made a similar mistake,"" Filecoin's team said. ""The team will work with exchanges to audit their deposit mechanism to avoid future issues.""      FIL is down 4.5% on the day.      This is a developing story.      Updated Thursday, March 18, 2021, 21:57 UTC: Additional comments from Filecoin team added and edits made to clarify that the exploit was a ""double deposit"" on Binance, not a ""double spend"" on-chain.

42433992,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6vJh,1616095092,The Art of Scarcity,"It’s 2019 and news headlines are ablaze over a banana. The banana had a name, “Comedian”, by Maurizio Cattelan, and it was stuck to a wall with duct tape at Miami’s Art Basel for an asking price of $120,000. The arguments levied against the banana were many. The primary one was the fruit had no business moonlighting as art. It had no intrinsic value, said critics. Millions of identical ones line the shelves of supermarkets. Nothing made the banana art except the mere say-so of the art community. It should not be showcased at a premiere art festival, let alone sell for $120,000. That it was soon plucked off the wall and eaten by a provocateur seemed to prove this.      True to its name, “Comedian” highlights the inconsistencies inherent in our ideas about value. The art world is perhaps the industry where the subjective nature of how value is constructed is most perceptibly on display. It is where Impressionist masterpieces and urinals have sold at similar price tags.    Aubrey Strobel is head of communications at bitcoin rewards startup Lolli.    The recent rise in the popularity of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, has reopened the conversation about what should or shouldn’t have value. The latest installment in this debate arrived last week with a $69 million sale of an NFT by artist Beeple entitled “EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS.” Beeple’s work is the most expensive NFT ever sold, and places its creator among the three most highly valued living artists after Jeff Koons and David Hockney.      The sale represents the convergence of two very different industries that have similarly faced criticisms of sky-high valuations disproportionate to their apparent value: art and cryptocurrency.      In art, one movement after another has proven alien ideas and products initially deemed undeserving of serious appraisal for not conforming to existing tastes have risen to rival their traditional forebears when it comes to monetary and social valuations. While the art world is typically receptive to new ways of thinking and seeing over time, financial institutions do not greet change so warmly.      NFTs share much of the stigma cast by critics on use cases of blockchain technology like bitcoin. Amid bitcoin’s surging popularity, it has faced rampant condemnations of its own lack of “intrinsic value”, a term that verges on the oxymoronic due to the innate subjectivity of how value is formed.      See also: Marc Hochstein – How Bananas and Mortgages Can Explain the NFT Craze      What does have intrinsic value? Not fiat currency, which consists of pieces of paper the government can print en masse at will. A key concern about fiat currencies like the dollar evokes “Comedian"": Bananas have no real fixed supply in the market, so any given banana can’t be worth $120,000. Changes in monetary policy can flood the market with money and drive the strength of a dollar up or down, thereby creating or destroying value. The argument may collapse in art due to its embrace of conceptual experimentation and dramatic irony, but it holds more water in economics.      The same argument about the importance of scarcity in determining an asset’s value underlies the argument for bitcoin and against fiat currencies like the dollar. Bitcoin’s supply, capped at 21 million, retains the unique characteristic of scarcity that is so critical to the legitimacy of an asset’s high valuation.    What does have intrinsic value? Not fiat currency, which consists of pieces of paper that the government can print en masse at will.    Beeple’s “THE FIRST 5000 DAYS” scarcity is created by a position on the blockchain that makes the transfer of the work the cyber equivalent of being carved in stone – the transaction is marked by a unique and immutable digital signature. Many argue Beeple’s work can be viewed in a form identical to the one that cost millions; however, underlying the value of any scarce asset is the knowledge that it, and only it, is the original. We understand this difference in value when it comes to reproductions of the Mona Lisa sold outside the Louvre. Why not of the images we see on Google?      The rising popularity of NFTs is also an ode to the cultural values of a digital society that is increasingly aware of the fault lines of fiat currency, akin to the way that Andy Warhol portrayed Campbell's soup cans to reflect on modern consumer culture.      As we continue to inspect the systems that we have long taken for granted, we may begin to see the similarities between a piece of paper vested with monetary value and a banana cast as art. Both are comedians in their own right, giving us the opportunity to evaluate the role of conformity and consensus in our conceptions of value.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Aubrey Strobel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/18/the-art-of-scarcity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d016b54824be8cd832670a76521d963256881a79-1023x681.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at a virtual payments conference hosted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Powell cited a report on CBDCs from the Bank for International Settlements and a group of seven central banks, including the Fed.      “One of the three key principles highlighted in the report is that a CBDC needs to coexist with cash and other types of money in a flexible and innovative payment system,” Powell said. “Improvements in the global payments system will come not just from the public sector but from the private sector as well.”      Powell added the Fed Board of Governors is conducting experiments on CBDCs along with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which is working researchers at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).      In recent months, Powell has emphasized several times that the U.S. would not act fast on issuing a digital dollar because of the physical dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.      The latest comment, though, is in line with Powell’s previous remarks about the Fed taking the prospects for a digital dollar seriously. Powell has said the Fed will engage with the public on the topic in 2021 and will seek congressional approval before issuing one.      CBDCs are an early-stage payments innovation that governments hope can increase payments efficiency and lower costs by running them on blockchains. The details on CBDCs are still murky, and detractors argue most transactions today involve money that’s already digital.      There’s a fear some governments may use CBDCs for increased financial surveillance.

In 2020, for example, 28 million BTC changed hands, equivalent to 150% of the total bitcoin in circulation. Meanwhile, 40 billion Apple shares were exchanged, equating to 270% of the total.      Furthermore, the average number of BTC exchanged daily in U.S. dollars is equivalent to only 0.05% of yen and 0.06% of GBP that do so.      Therefore, bitcoin must transform potential into results, in the same way Tesla has done, according to Deutsche.      Tesla, like bitcoin, has sparked numerous debates about whether it is the future of the car or a ""soon-to-die fad."" Sentiment has shifted dramatically in the last 18 months as Tesla proved itself able to deliver cars such as the Model 3 at scale.

42433998,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6vdh,1616086293,The Node: Hard Money and a Dovish Fed,"Yesterday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank would maintain its easy money accommodations. Interest rates will remain near zero and an asset-buying program will remain in place. The economy will be allowed to run hot. This is despite mounting inflation concerns in financial markets and among a minority of Fed members.      This has some asking, what does it mean for bitcoin? Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized monetary system. It exists as a foil to the U.S. dollar, with a stable issuance rate and a hard capped supply. Its price is wholly dependent on what other people are willing to pay for it. And, over the past year, there are a number of sophisticated investors willing to pay quite a lot for it.      Bitcoin has gained a place within the larger financial firmament. To some extent, it has become an indicator for the economy itself – a way of indirectly measuring inflation worries or the willingness for investors to gamble on risky assets. But bitcoin’s place is far from fixed, and there are a number of conflicting views of how a “hard money” world will react to a dovish Fed. Here’s a quick and dirty rundown.      Bitcoin is often discussed as an alternative store of value, particularly an alternative to gold. This seems to be the predominant view among Wall Street bigwigs and tech companies that came into the crypto economy in recent months. The purest distillation of this idea comes from Michael Saylor, who is directing his internet boom-era tech company, MicroStrategy, to bet big on bitcoin.      “I want something that I could put $425 million into for 100 years,” Saylor told CoinDesk in September. In this scenario, bitcoin is a place to park wealth, which would otherwise be eroded in an inflationary environment. Following Powell’s address, the U.S. dollar fell while would-be inflation hedges like bitcoin and gold rose.      Currently, “long bitcoin” is the second-most crowded trade in the financial market, according to Bank of America’s latest monthly investor survey. But this doesn’t indicate that all bitcoin holders are in it for the long haul.      In fact, a separate investor report out from Bank of America cast doubt on the “store of value” belief. Commodity strategist Francisco Blanch wrote that bitcoin’s main utility was as a speculative asset. Looking at bitcoin’s price history, he found, contrary to popular belief, bitcoin has mostly underperformed as an inflation hedge.      ""Looking year by year, we find that bitcoin has been positively correlated with CPI inflation in five out of the nine past years, with the largest correlations in 2014 and 2018 ... However, when looking at correlations with inflation surprises since 2011, we find that bitcoin has among the lowest co-movements, lagging most asset classes such as commodities, TIPS, and EM FX in particular,"" the report read. (I was unable to find the original document.)      Some believe that bitcoin could grow into its role as an inflation hedge, almost by sheer will. That phenomenon is called the “Tinkerbell Effect,” named after the fairy in ""Peter Pan,"" where something may be more likely to occur if enough people believe it will happen.      Still, some think bitcoin’s 12-year life is too short to make any solid predictions on how it will perform. Cam Harvey, senior adviser to Research Affiliates and a professor of finance at Duke University, told Bloomberg as much. He also said that even if bitcoin is viewed as a store of value, that couldn’t tell you much about the short term. Gold has held its value for millennia, he said, but is prone to wild fluctuations.      Bitcoin, too, is volatile. It’s for that reason some investors are loading up on the asset as a way to diversify their portfolios. That’s the opinion of Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure, who said bitcoin is not going anywhere but will likely remain unstable (primarily due to shallow liquidity.)      Instead of a gold alternative, Laboure imagines a world where bitcoin trades like Tesla stock. The comparison isn’t out of balance, Tesla’s sky-high valuation is based on the idea that electric vehicles will become standard. Bitcoin’s price at least partially reflects the possibility it becomes a global monetary standard.      Powell has been praised for his ability to cut through “Fedspeak” and give a clear indication of how the regulator will respond to the economy. Whether inflation picks up or not, the policy seems clear. Meanwhile, bitcoin is many things to many people.

The bank also calls central bank digital currencies ""kryptonite for crypto"" but it is intrigued by decentralized finance, which it says is ""potentially more disruptive than Bitcoin.""

DeFi services, from derivatives to asset management, were also mentioned as areas of growth in the Bank of America report.  However, Bank of America highlighted issues about scalability, stating, “Ethereum may be more scalable than Bitcoin, but it, too, faces constraints in terms of speed, block size, the price of ether and so on.”  “DeFi does, however, show the opportunity which [distributed ledger technology] offers to finance.

42376241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5dB,1616085152,‘Speedy Trial’ Taproot Activation on Bitcoin Could Still Include a ‘UASF’ Safety Net,"Taproot – Bitcoin’s most anticipated upgrade ever – has been “close” for a year now, but no one in Bitcoin’s community has agreed on how to activate it. With Speedy Trial, there might finally be a solution, though it may still involve a “user-activated soft fork” (UASF).  In a public meeting on Tuesday on Internet Relay Chat, Bitcoin stakeholders more or less agreed on the recently proposed Speedy Trial method, saying activation could begin this April or May (a month or so later than anticipated, when prior activation methods were on the table). There were no serious objections to the proposal in the meeting.  With Speedy Trial (more or less) receiving widespread support, the Bitcoin community is nearing the conclusion of a saga that began years ago. Assuming all goes as planned and Speedy Trial is a success, Taproot could be live on Bitcoin’s blockchain in November of this year.  And if it fails? Well, then the Bitcoin community learns new lessons about consensus. And it also means it could be back to square one with a “user-activated soft fork” as an inevitable activation method.  What is Taproot?  Taproot will outfit Bitcoin with Schnorr signatures, a signature scheme which Bitcoin could have used from day one and which will give a boost to Bitcoin’s privacy, custody and scaling softwares.  Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack  Unlike SegWit, Bitcoin’s last big upgrade, there’s no opposition to Taproot. But even as the upgrade itself isn’t up for debate, the way to bring Taproot online has been the subject of some very heated debate.  That’s because unlike a centralized network or service, where one person or group of people can dictate upgrades unilaterally, Bitcoin has no central authority. Upgrades are debated painstakingly among hundreds if not thousands of stakeholders across social channels.  Even when an upgrade is a so-called “soft fork” like Taproot, meaning it is compatible between older and newer software, the implementation is treated with care. So if consensus on a Taproot activation route isn’t clear, it’s hard to move forward with an upgrade without sufficient support.  What is Speedy Trial?  Such was the case with the so-called lockedintimeout or “LOT” debate.  Essentially, the community could not decide whether or not Taproot should fail if miners don’t adopt it, or whether or not the activation should include code for a “user-activated soft fork,” wherein node operators force activate Taproot by blacklisting blocks which don’t support the upgrade’s code (a similar “user-activated soft fork” scenario played a role in activating SegWit).  Read more: Bitcoin’s Taproot Activation Gains Momentum From New ‘Speedy Trial’ Proposal  Bitcoin developer Russell O’Connor proposed Speedy Trial to break the deadlock and provide a fast trial-by-fire to see whether or not miners would upgrade quickly (and thus, whether a UASF is even necessary).  Under Speedy Trial, miners would have three months to signal support for Taproot after its code is shipped through Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin’s primary software version. If 90% of the blocks in a given time frame are not Taproot-supporting, then that means miners don’t support the upgrade and activation fails. If the threshold is reached, then activation takes place after a six-month “locked-in” period. During this time frame, the upgrade is in the bag, but its actual activation is delayed to make sure there are no hiccups.  (One potential hiccup: Miners don’t actually have to upgrade to Taproot during the signaling period; they only need to signal their support, and they do so by including a unique bit of code in the blocks they mine. Thus, the delay partly exists so miners have ample time between signaling and activation to upgrade their nodes).  The code that would put Speedy Trial into motion could come either from Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 9 (BIP9), the code for which already exists, or through BIP8, which would need to be coded.  The UASF back-up plan  “We’re basically where we were a few weeks ago, but with more data,” Bitcoin developer Sjors Provost expressed on a Van Wirdum Sjorsnado podcast on Speedy Trial.  Indeed, this approach is a truncated version, in a way, of the LOT=False proposal that was previously debated alongside LOT=True.  Read more: Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade Nailed Down for July, but Some Finer Details Still Aren’t Finalized  Should Speedy Trial fail, it would resemble LOT=False in that nothing happens. This would also likely pave the way for a LOT=True scenario, some community members pointed out in a Tuesday Taproot Activation discussion.  “If Speedy Trial fails I think a UASF release is inevitable,” user Shesek said.  “Users would be advised to expect a followup ‘real’ deployment in the event this isn't signalled,” Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr said in the chat, with “real” meaning an activation by node operators through LOT=True or UASF. The prolific developer is of the opinion that Speedy Trial will fail because the timeline is too short and because miners may not activate even after they signal.  Putting to bed or ‘punting’ the problem?  In some respects, Speedy Trial is a consolation activation. It’s nobody’s first choice but people still support it because it may offer an end to what has become a tiring, dragged-out discussion over an upgrade that makes changes to a couple of lines of Bitcoin’s code (yes, really).  Blockstream and Bitcoin developer Rusty Russell likened Speedy Trial to “punting” the problem (namely, smooth soft fork activation coordination) down the field to deal with another day.  “I understand people are tired, and nobody wants conflict,” he said in the chat, while clarifying later his position that he believes Speedy Trial is “a terrible idea.”  According to Russell, it’s a terrible idea because it sets a precedent that the fastest and most effective way to an upgrade should win out, not one which makes node operators the final arbiters for choosing a change to Bitcoin’s software. This arbiter role, Russell and those like him argue, was the key takeaway from the SegWit saga and one of Bitcoin’s most effective checks for users against powerful interests.  That’s why proponents of this line of thinking want code for some form of UASF included with the Speedy Trial release from the get-go.  If Speedy Trial fails, then activation would lean on a BIP8-style user-activated soft fork – a proposal that was previously discussed but which had no consensus, thus prompting Speedy Trial.  This activation method would take place after Speedy Trial and would include a year-long (or 15-month) signaling period, after which time Taproot would automatically activate on user nodes through the UASF. (This scenario would have Taproot activating in 2022 or, at the latest, 2023).  Still, Speedy Trial has to fail for this backup to take effect, and it appears as though stakeholders are on board with trying Speedy Trial first.

But one thing is clear: Lindsay Lohan issuing her own NFTs through Tron is a signal of the market’s froth. The former Disney star plans to auction them off on March 20.      Lohan’s participation in the booming NFT scene comes during the technology’s seemingly overnight transformation into a fascination of the investing world. As CNBC runs multiple segments a day on NFTs, digital artists and musicians chase millions of dollars through auctions and sales.      The Lohan sale will be taking place on a new NFT clearinghouse on the Tron blockchain that also touts the involvement of musicians Swae Lee, Tyga, Ne-Yo, Soulja Boy and other celebs.      NFTs are unique blockchain addresses that attach an immutable digital history of “ownership” to files and objects, even when those items, being digital, are freely available for anyone to enjoy. Think of them as digital bragging rights you can sell. They differ from more well-known crypto “currencies” in their non-fungibility.      It was not clear at press time what exactly the content of Lohan’s upcoming NFTs were, and Lohan could not be immediately reached for comment. An earlier work featured bitcoin imagery.      ""Hollywood and the Music industry are finally waking up to crypto and it is in large part thanks to NFTs,"" Lohan said in a statement promoting an upcoming Clubhouse chat with Sun and former T-Mobile CEO John Legere. “I couldn't be happier to be a part of this revolution, helping to bridge the gap between creators and content admirers.”    Read more: It’s an NFT Boom.

Sometimes referred to as bitcoin's ""rich list,"" the number of unique addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC has shrunk by over 8% since Feb. 8, according to the data provider Glassnode.      ""Whale addresses have been selling,"" market analyst Lark Davis tweeted. ""This does not mean the bull run is over. It just means that profit taking is happening.""      On Wednesday, 2,275 addresses held at least 1,000 bitcoins, down more than 200 from Feb. 8's record high of 2,488.      A single person or exchange can hold multiple addresses, leaving some doubt in the numbers. It's possible the rise or fall in the number of addresses containing at least 1,000 coins does not necessarily represent an equivalent influx or outflux of large investors.      But a weakening of buying pressure from large investors would be consistent with other recent market indicators, including a decline in the so-called ""Coinbase premium,"" which theoretically indicates flagging institutional demand.

42434000,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6vjh,1616076000,Crypto Lender Hodlnaut Teams With Insurance Alternative Nexus Mutual,"Singapore-based cryptocurrency lending and borrowing platform Hodlnaut is teaming up with Nexus Mutual, an alternative to traditional insurance and one that is well-suited to decentralized trading and finance.      Hodlnaut (not to be confused with popular and now-defunct Twitter persona Holdlonaut) allows crypto holders to earn relatively high rates of interest by lending out crypto assets. Now, by way of the partnership with Nexus Mutual, the crypto lender can offer insurance cover on the assets held on the platform – BTC, ETH, DAI, USDC and USDT.      Insurance is thin on the ground in the cryptocurrency space. Even when it is included, the service being marketed doesn’t always match the small print of a policy. For example, when $100 million of digital asset cover is touted, this usually means the cryptocurrency in question must be at rest, held in so-called cold storage, which means not connected to any online environment.      But when it comes to exchanges, trading firms or yield-bearing platforms like Hodlnaut, assets need to be held in workaday “hot” wallets that are very much connected to the internet.      A shortage of hot-wallet insurance cover has led to firms simply holding their own self-insurance funds; now there are alternatives to traditional insurance springing up, such as Nexus Mutual’s tokenized approach.      Juntao Zhu, the co-founder and CEO of Hodlnaut, said his firm’s Nexus Mutual-backed insurance offering is very different from those companies claiming to have $100 million insurance cover provided by a big custodian like BitGo, which relates to the aforementioned cold storage only.      “I feel like we're one of the more honest firms in the space,” Zhu said in an interview. “Even though we use BitGo, we don't claim to have $100 million insurance. But you have Nexo, and you have Vauld [previously known as Bank of Hodlers] saying that they're $100 million insured.”      At this point in time, Hodlnaut’s maximum insurance capacity against losses or bankruptcy stands at $22 million across the platform, but that is expected to increase as the Nexus Mutual community-owned fund grows. (Nexus says it plans to sell over $1 billion worth of coverage by the end of this year.)    Read more: DeFi Insurer Nexus Mutual Raises $2.7M in NXM Token Sale    Hodlnaut has actually helped boost its cover capacity by purchasing Nexus’ NXM tokens and adding to the capital pool and staking its holdings. It’s not standard for firms seeking cover to go out and buy tokens and join the pool, said Nexus CEO Hugh Karp, but quite a few firms have done so.      “Its primary purpose is to signal to the broader market about how confident they are in their own security. All being well, they keep all the NXM and earn rewards from cover purchases,” Karp said via email.      In addition, Hodlnaut has sponsored $110,000 of equity towards a “shield mining” campaign on Nexus Mutual, a way of attracting stakers (risk assessors) to back a particular project by offering more in the way of reward tokens.      “Shield mining is a way for partners to bootstrap the availability of cover on Nexus,” said Karp. “It works by providing targeted bonus rewards to Nexus Mutual Risk Assessors who back the partners project. This opens up cover capacity on Nexus and therefore helps the partner project attract additional users who are more risk-aware.”      Much of the interest (and much of the cover Nexus provides so far) is directed towards the $44 billion decentralized finance (DeFi) market, where counterparties are represented by smart contracts and powered by automated market makers.      But centralized cryptocurrency lending – now known as CeFi in crypto circles – is also a giant and diverse industry, with firms including Genesis Capital, Celsius and BlockFi holding billions in assets under custody and raising hundreds of millions in capital to expand.    Read more: Crypto Lender BlockFi Raises $350M at a $3B Valuation    On that note, Zhu is proud of the fact that Hodlnaut has only ever raised $100,000 during its accelerator stage, and retains 90% ownership of a profitable company.      “We had to grind our way through the bear market and it was very tough,” Zhu said. “We are a small and nimble team with plenty of traction and $250 million in assets under management. To be honest, I don't know what we would spend a raise on.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/18/crypto-lender-hodlnaut-teams-with-insurance-alternative-nexus-mutual,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/886105096be5062a8b1bae6e4952d88d623eea58-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434007,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6vrh,1616072458,Ether Cards Banks $3.7M in Presale of ‘Supercharged’ NFTs,"Crypto startup Ether Cards sold $3.7 million worth of souped-up non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a pre-sale that closed earlier this month.      The graduate of ConsenSys’ accelerator program told CoinDesk collectors snapped up 1,752 total cards, including pieces by veteran comic book artist Mark McKenna and Dirty Robot, a Japan-based visual designer. A wider public sale of the remaining 8,250 cards, some of them rare, opens Thursday.      The sale serves as an early validation for Ether Cards’ gamified twist on collectible NFTs. Each card carries a smart-contract-based “trait” designed to prompt continued user engagement. For example, some might grant their holders discounts on future pack purchases, while others might increase the likelihood of a future “rare” pull.      That’s a stark difference from many of the NFTs that have swamped the digital art world in recent weeks, said Andras Kristof, Ether Cards co-founder. He said second-order “utility” traits bolster Ether Cards’ value proposition, granting them staying power that, say, a tokenized photo of someone’s cat utterly lacks.      “What you can do right now with NFTs is you can buy, you can sell and you can hold. And I think we can do better than that,” Kristof said.      The randomization of each NFT's traits is generated by Chainlink’s “Verifiable Randomness Function.”      “As NFTs become more popular, we anticipate that more and more projects will rely on Chainlink VRF as a means to prove the uniqueness and rarity of their NFT,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk. “Relying on unverifiable sources of NFT generation often leads to fraudulent manipulation, calling into question the very value of an NFT series.”      Just last week, digital artist Beeple watched in disbelief as his tokenized composite of 5,000 prints sold at auction for a record $69 million. It was a historic moment for NFTs as a medium – but also seen by some as troubling because massive sales could lead to an over-exuberant market for what are really just digitally traced JPEGs.      “After this project gains traction, nobody can afford to create a plain old NFT and get away with it,” Kristof said.      Ether Cards will release its framework for minting supercharged NFTs in the public domain – likely under MIT’s highly permissive software license, Kristof said. Doing so would let anyone iterate on Ether Cards’ NFT framework so long as they make their version similarly open.      Kristof said the framework would allow other creators to monetize blockchain-stored pieces.      Ether Cards did not tell CoinDesk by press time whether participating artists would take home a share of the profits.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | LINK | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/18/ether-cards-banks-37m-in-presale-of-supercharged-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be5ec1f87f5c46b47b325ab9dded35ff489ffcc7-1200x1074.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Australian-based startup is set to debut its first undercollateralized lending market with stable rates in April. Maple Finance closed a $1.4 million funding round led by Framework Ventures and Polychain Capital to help further develop and launch pools, a press release shared with CoinDesk states.      “Long term, we view Maple as the connector of traditional lending for crypto firms writ large,” Framework Ventures co-founder Michael Anderson told CoinDesk in a message. “Lenders want access to firms in the crypto space and borrowers want to work through a platform that understands their business model.”      In short, Maple provides curated loans using asset pools native to the world of DeFi. Pool delegators determine interest rates, loan value and payment terms based on a borrower's profile – just like in traditional banking.      Each pool will have different criteria, with the first such pool holding $15 million and denominated in stablecoin USD coin (USDC) going live next month. That’s markedly different from other primitives in the $20 billion DeFi lending market, which often only offer overcollateralized loan packages.    Read more: DeFi Startup Brings Corporate Lending Terms to Miners, Traders and Market Makers    Maple said the first pool will consist of “blue-chip borrowers, including prominent market makers and trading funds.” Trading firm Folkvang and market maker Wintermute are two potential first clients, Maple added. Additional pools will be created in other stablecoins, wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and ether.      “The launch of our first pool will be a significant moment for DeFi, enabling institutions, sophisticated investors and individuals to gain access to a stable, underlying yield that is generated from crypto-focused companies that are profitable and reputable,” Maple Finance co-founder Sid Powell said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/18/maple-finance-raises-14m-for-its-reputation-based-defi-lending-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74ef4d433113d3a7f91ef5a9ec243bcf7fc33437-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433982,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6rBh,1616067024,Bitcoin Price Gets Fed Boost but Bond Yields Could Play Spoilsport: Analysts,"Bitcoin's bull run looks set to continue after the Federal Reserve reconfirmed its pro-stimulus stance this week.      The largest cryptocurrency was up for a third straight day, gaining 0.7% to about $59,300 as of 17:32 coordinated universal time (1:30 p.m. ET).      The price rise came as 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields topped 1.75%, a day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday signaled that policymakers at the central banks would keep monetary policy at unusually loose levels for the foreseeable future to give the economy more time to heal. Such a stance could allow output and employment to recover quickly, potentially fueling a rapid reheating that could ultimately lead to faster inflation.      The higher Treasury bond yields reflect investors' demand for extra returns to compensate for the risk of inflation. A growing number of investors are betting that bitcoin might act as a hedge against a decline in the dollar's purchasing power, and the German lender Deutsche Bank published a report this week stating that bitcoin is ""now too important to ignore"" given its $1 trillion market capitalization.      ""The narrative for bitcoin as the preferred store of value has only strengthened in the wake of [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell's comments,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds said. ""Our outlook on BTC remains very bullish. Recent retracement to $53,000 was a short-lived pullback before the cryptocurrency makes way to fresh all-time highs.""      Powell pushed back against speculation of an early unwinding of monetary stimulus on Wednesday, boosting the appeal of inflation hedges such as bitcoin.      ""The strong bulk of the committee is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period,” Powell said during a virtual press conference Wednesday following a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, according to Bloomberg. The central bank head added that it was “not yet” time to talk about reducing the central bank’s liquidity-boosting asset purchases.      According to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at trading sentiment data provider Trade the Chain, further gains could be in the offing due to the Fed's decision to raise the per counterparty limit in the overnight reverse repurchase operations from $30 billion to $80 billion.      ""The hike implies that the Fed wants to keep overnight rates [short-term borrowing costs] low,"" Vinokourov said. ""Thus, it's dollar-negative and, in turn, should spur on flow back into assets.""      Besides, with the Fed-related uncertainty out of the way, bitcoin and the broader crypto market may now see a stimulus, or ""stimmies,"" rally, as tweeted by trader Alex Kruger. As per Mizuho Securities' estimates, Americans may spend nearly $40 billion of the latest round of direct stimulus checks on bitcoin and stocks, boosting their prices.      Bitcoin's daily chart is also painting a bullish picture.      Bitcoin jumped over 3% on Wednesday, confirming a bull revival signaled by Tuesday's ""hammer"" candle and shifting focus to record highs above $61,000 reached on Saturday.    Yield worries persists    Bitcoin bulls will be keeping an eye on the U.S. bond market because a faster rise in yields could weigh on equities, inviting selling pressure for bitcoin, too.      ""A rise in yields is problematic period, but a speedy ascent can destabilize markets,"" Kruger told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Equities and bitcoin took a hit in the last week of February, with the cryptocurrency falling by 20% as the 10-year yield spiked to 12-month highs above 1.5%.      Similar downturns could be seen if the yield continues to rise. At press time, the 10-year bond is seen at a 14-month high of 1.72% versus 1.62% pre-Fed Reserve announcement and 1.52% a week ago. The Fed's reassurance of continued stimulus support has so far failed to keep the benchmark yield from extending its recent rise.      Also read: Bitcoin Pares Losses as Fed’s Powell Sees No Rate Hike Anytime Soon      However, pullbacks in bitcoin, if any, would be short-lived, according to LMAX Digital's currency strategist.

In a press release on Wednesday, the central bank took specific aim against the baht stablecoin THT created on the South Korean stablecoin platform Terra.      ""[THT] could cause fragmentation to the Thai currency system should THT or other similar stablecoins come to replace, substitute or compete with baht issued by the BOT,"" the release reads.      The central bank now deems any activity involving THT ""illegal,"" on the basis the creation, issuance and usage or circulation of any material or token for money violates Section 9 of the country's Currency Act (1958).      Any person is able to issue a proposal on Terra's algorithmically governed platform in order to mint new cryptocurrency that is later voted on by stakers holding the platform's native luna token.      Do Kwon, head of Terraform Labs, told CoinDesk in a Twitter direct message Terra does not initiate proposals, nor does it ever vote on them. ""I think it's a very interesting development and quite amused we were able to catch the attention of a central bank,"" said Kwon. ""Great free public relations, right?""      Asked by a user on Twitter whether he believed the central bank could ""hurt"" the THT ecosystem within Terra, Kwon responded, ""lol no,"" on Thursday.      BOT said the general public needs to exercise caution and refrain from participating in any activity involving THT alleging users could be at risk of cybertheft and money laundering without the necessary legal protections.      Stablecoins linked to national currencies have been received with great trepidation by governments and regulators around the world.      See also: Thai SEC Backtracks on Unpopular Proposal for New Crypto Investor Qualifications      Most notably, the announcement of the diem (formerly libra) Facebook-backed stablecoin caused a wave of pushback, with the U.S., France, Germany and other nations saying it posed a threat to financial stability and even fiscal sovereignty and should be heavily regulated, if allowed to launch at all.

If approved, the ETF would be the first open bitcoin exchange-traded product in the U.S., though there has long been demand for such a product from the crypto community. Historically, the SEC has rejected every bitcoin ETF application, including VanEck’s past efforts, citing the potential for market manipulation and a host of other concerns.  However, industry pundits believe the agency may finally be ready to approve one under incoming Chair Gary Gensler, a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman who has been fairly bullish on crypto and blockchain, teaching courses on the technology at MIT in recent years.  VanEck filed for the ETF with Cboe BZX Exchange earlier this year, with Cboe publishing the 19b-4 at the beginning of March. Once the document is published in the Federal Register (the nation's logbook), the general public will have 21 days to submit comments on the SEC's portal.  The SEC can extend the review period up to 240 days before it has to make a final decision. When evaluating past applications, it has always extended these decisions to their full time limit.  A number of other companies, including Valkyrie and WisdomTree, have filed for bitcoin ETFs in recent months, after several applications were rejected in late 2019 and early 2020. Grayscale, a subsidiary of CoinDesk's parent firm Digital Currency Group, recently posted a number of job listings for ETF specialists as well.  Read more: What Is a Bitcoin ETF?
