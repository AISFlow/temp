42426844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAnh,1462315298,21 Inc Unveils Plan to Make Every Computer a Bitcoin Computer,"Balaji Srinivasan, co-founder and CEO of 21 Inc, announced the launch of the 21 software package at the Consensus 2016 blockchain conference, allowing anyone with a computer to receive bitcoin.  Freely available, the software allows any connected device to join the 21 network, enabling connectivity with the 21 Marketplace and providing capabilities that were previously only available to owners of the 21 Bitcoin Computer.  Srinivasan told the audience:  ""What we think is that there is going to be a third Web, the Machine Web, where the links are actually payments between machines.""  According to Srinivasan, the World Wide Web is the 'first web', consisting of documents connected to one another. The second is the social web, providing connectivity between people directly through technology.  In his presentation, Srinivasan argued for the ability to enable machines to be able to pay other machines, effectively monetizing HTTP.  ""The concept is a web where machines are earning bitcoin on every HTTP request,"" he explained. ""Every time you load a webpage is a HTTP request. That’s a lot of HTTP requests. If you are earning bitcoin on every HTTP request, that could be a lot of earned bitcoins.""  One of the immediate use cases: digital paywalls. Teasing Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal, Srinivasan walked through the example of signing up for the newspaper.  ""You either need to sign up for the paywall or you are paying Google ad based microtransactions,"" he said.  But Srinivasan also used the example of Amazon Web Services, which requires that users sign up for an account, enter their personal information and pay monthly with a credit card. He explained that on the machine-to-machine Web, there is no reason to sign up for anything.  Many avenues to bitcoin  During the presentation, Srinivasan walked through the various means by which the 21 software can generate bitcoins. Users can mine bitcoin, utilize a Coinbase integration to make purchases directly through the software, tap a faucet that allows for small amounts of bitcoin (with limits), complete small tasks for 21 directly in exchange for payment or create a machine-payable service.  Describing how the software can be used to create a machine-payable service, Balaji walked through the process of adding a single line of code to any application. This, he said, allows the developer to introduce micropayments.  “You can say, I want 5,000 satoshis per API call. You can have arbitrary pricing and surge pricing. You can go retrofit or build new applications that use bitcoin micropayments,” he said.  Those applications can then be marked to other users and developers that might need the apps. This marketplace, which 21 announced in March, allows anyone that owns a Bitcoin Computer to buy or sell applications. Today's software release expands the possible user base.  ""We’ve taken every computer and turned it into a Bitcoin Computer. It’s a new way to monetize online,"" he said.  Along with marketing these applications, Srinivasan explained that the software enables a dynamic pricing mechanism whereby different users can be charged different amounts.  “You can have lower prices for your family, you can do surge pricing [for high usage], and you can have totally dynamic pricing,” he said.  Before he ended his presentation, Srinivasan indicated that the company still has plans to pursue embedded mining – something that past investment materials have suggested was on the firm's future roadmap.

42426847,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAth,1462310591,Larry Summers: Blockchain Can Succeed Without Bitcoin,"Former US Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers took part in a fireside chat at Consensus 2016 today, in which he spoke in depth about emerging financial technologies such as blockchain and bitcoin and the impact such inventions could have both separately and together.  Moderated by Alan Murray of Fortune Magazine, the session found Summers bringing the dialogue of the bitcoin and blockchain worlds closer together, as he framed the ideas less as competitors, but possible outcomes of a larger change in economic processes enabled by technology.  Summers projected that there would likely be three outcomes from this evolution: That blockchains will co-exist with traditional fiat currencies; that blockchains will be enabled by bitcoin; that blockchains will eventually interact with digital currencies, but not bitcoin.  While Summers remains open-minded about the possibility that a digital asset could serve as a global currency or store of value, he predicts that the underlying technology is likely to be more impactful.  Summers told the audience:  ""Is the blockchain technology going to be fundamental? I think the answer is overwhelmingly likely to be yes. Is bitcoin going to be a valuable store of value, the same way as people use gold? I don’t know, but I think that certainly the answer is 'no' doesn’t seem like the right position to take.""  Summers went so far as to predict that this transition could play out in different ways in the wider financial system.  For example, he said that he believes we could see companies like JPMorgan accommodate bitcoin along side more traditional currencies like dollars and euros.  He suggested that this transition, however, depends on how quickly it gains traction in the market.  ""Bitcoin has the same character a fax machine had. A single fax machine is a doorstop. A world where everyone has a fax machine is an immensely valuable thing,"" he quipped.  Rethinking bitcoin  Still, while Summers wouldn't place a direct bet against innovators in the space, he said it was likely that the technology underpinning can be replicated by incumbents in potentially successful ways.  ""While there are arguments you can’t get all the benefits [of blockchain] without bitcoin, my suspicion is that ways will be found to get those benefits without the uncertainty in the value of bitcoin relative to the ways people hold money and denominate transactions,"" he said.  However, he noted in instances of disruptive change, new entrants are perhaps more likely to succeed in developing new technologies, and that he could imagine blockchain disrupting enterprise finance even if digital currencies fail.  ""I don’t have a prediction to make with confidence about current big financial institutions, or the aspiring ones represented in this room,"" he said, adding:  ""I think it’s not right to say that blockchain is the world of existing financial institutions, and bitcoin is the world of new financial institutions.""  But, Summers doesn't see this as being the responsibility of regulators to prevent, even if it impacts the economy.  He added: ""I don’t think we should designing our policies with the idea of maximizing employment in the financial sector.""

42426839,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAdh,1462298393,Shoot for the Moon or Take It Slow? Tech Giants Talk Blockchain,"Three massive tech companies and one of the most heavily funded startups in blockchain today debated the merits of deploying blockchain technology incrementally or going after moonshots with the power to shift entire industry paradigms.  Speaking on stage at this year’s Consensus 2016 conference in New York City, executives representing more than $571bn of market capitalization and $76m in venture capital engaged in a linguistic dual over which path was best, with the occasional point of agreement.  Austin Hill, founder and CEO of bitcoin blockchain startup Blockstream, expressed a lack of interest in firms that want to utilize portions of a blockchain to use in isolation.  Hill said:  ""We don’t look for use-cases that are just using a small part of the blockchain.""  If a company wants chooses that route to achieve incremental growth, Hill suggested, there’s probably a traditional solution better suited for the task.  Instead his company, which has raised $76m in venture capital is seeking out those potentially paradigm-shifting applications.  Important experiments  On the other hand though, there’s something to be said for breaking down the blockchain’s facets into smaller use cases, according to Lata Varghese, senior partner at Cognizant – a publicly traded IT firm currently valued at $35.37bn.  One value of these implementations, Varghese said, is to help employees put the technology in the current context of the company’s services. “I think the experiments that we’re doing, the proofs-of-concept, are important steps,” she added.  To Varghese, it is important that companies take stock of their existing enterprise apps and understand how blockchain might potentially help them, while at the same time being mindful of cohesive solutions.  She explained:  ""You want to simplify. You don’t want to add more blockchain spaghetti to your existing spaghetti.""  Although Microsoft’s global business strategist Yorke Rhodes agreed with Varghese, he warned of a potential downside of that approach, encouraging the audience to weigh the benefits of slow growth with paradigm-shifting ideas.  Yorke, whose company is currently valued at $397.58bn, said:  ""The interesting thing with starting small is you can have a quick win. The tough part is there’s not a lot of value.""  Working together  Providing a counterpoint to the debate was IBM’s Jerry Cuomo, vice president of the $138.8bn company’s blockchain technologies project.  Cuomo, who is a participant in the Hyperledger Project alongside Blockstream and others, told the audience how several of his clients had been trying to build with blockchain in a way he thought wasn’t necessarily suitable for the technology.  It turned out, that in order to get the projects funded, the clients believed the service had to be build with blockchain.  Cuomo advocated for a similar strategy to the one proposed by Varghese, adding that collaborative approaches to problem solving are another great way to learn.  While he agreed that small steps are important, he concluded:  ""You need to have your moonshot.""      Moon and buildings image via Shutterstock.

42426849,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAvh,1462293193,"What's Encouraging Blockchain R&D? Barclays, Citi and More Weigh In","Large financial institutions missed the boat with the Internet and don't intend on making that same mistake again with the blockchain, panelists at Consensus 2016's ""Internal Approaches for Blockchain Strategies"" panel agreed today.  Yet, while they are definitely thinking about long-term implementations within their organizations, their focus is, by and large, on short term victories. This point was echoed by panel representatives from participants as diverse as global banking giant Deutsche Bank and healthcare leader Philips.  Scott Manuel, vice president and head of product management at Thomson Reuters, told the audience:  ""Don’t lose the vision, but you really have to understand the nuts and bolts to make this what it can be.""  Echoing that point, Jeremy Wilson, vice chairman of Barclays Corporate Banking, added: ""There is stuff going on in the short term across our business, which may make it into the real big time. I think the longer-term issue is something we’re going to have to grapple with.""  This was discussed this morning with a full panel that included Deutsche Bank's Ed Budd; Ian Lee of VC firm Citi Ventures; Scott Manuel of media conglomerate Thomson Reuters; Philips' Bart Suichies; and Jeremy Wilson of UK powerhouse banking firm Barclays.  Encouraging internal work  While many in the C-Suite may only be learning about this technology now, Wilson explained that as you move down the funnel, more people understand it.  ""The people at the top have to say we think something is going on here, we are probably the last people to really understand the detail of this; it’s much more likely that lower down in our organization, there are people who get it,"" he explained.  But more importantly, he wanted to stress the importance of encouragement:  ""What we have to do as leaders is establish the latitude of our businesses and people. It’s a simple message, whatever you do, support your people when they move in that direction.""  Because of how widespread Philips is, it works with a steering committee with people from a wide variety of departments within the firm. Suichies explained that the ultimate goal is to get buy in from the entire company at all levels.  ""[Our legal department] immediately grasped the possibilities,"" he said.  Building momentum  Talking about ideas and actually getting things done, though, is proving different, however, because there are not enough people who understand the technology yet, the panelists agreed.  ""There is a premium on any engineer that puts blockchain in their resume,"" said Manuel.  He explained:  ""We found we could take great engineers we had internally. It takes about four to six weeks to get their head around it in real code and rolling up their sleeves, but before you know it, you’ve created a strong cadre of individuals who can execute.""  The incumbents recognized that while there are plenty of use cases, it's about finding the balance and giving freedom to innovate while also achieving success.  Suichies explained:  ""I think that translates into you have to create a roadmap that has this aspiration goal on one hand, but the steps you take, they are the biggest small steps you can as to not alienate the people you are working with.""  Ian Lee explained that finding the right project to work on can be half the battle, summing up the state of internal R&D.  He added: ""It can be hard to find where in the organization this technology applies with a 10x improvement.""

42426832,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAVh,1462290209,Craig Wright 'Will Move Bitcoin' to Prove He's Satoshi Nakamoto,"A representative for Craig Wright – the Australian academic and businessman who in recent days has sought to prove that he is bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto – says that he will provide further evidence through the movements of bitcoins.    As first reported by the BBC, Wright will seek to prove himself “by moving a coin from an early block”.      Nick Caley, head of corporate communications for London-based PR firm The Outside Organization, confirmed the plan when contacted by CoinDesk. Wright is being further represented by Milk Publicity, also based in London, which circulated press materials on Monday.    However, the plan seems to contradict statements given by Wright to The Economist, which reported that the Australian said he “can’t send any bitcoin because they are now owned by a trust”.  When asked about the discrepancy, Caley told CoinDesk that Wright will seek permission from the trustees to use one of those early bitcoin addresses, explaining:  “The trustees will not consent to move trust assets. However, Dr Wright is securing consents to move BTC into and then out of the early addresses, provided that the trust assets are not diminished.”  He added that the planned coin movement would take place “in the coming days”, but declined to comment when asked what steps would be taken if the trustees disapproved of the plan.  In a new blog article posted earlier today, Wright wrote that he will be releasing evidence beyond moving bitcoins.  ""So, over the coming days, I will be posting a series of pieces that will lay the foundations for this extraordinary claim, which will include posting independently-verifiable documents and evidence addressing some of the false allegations that have been levelled, and transferring bitcoin from an early block,"" he stated.  Wright’s efforts to prove that he is Satoshi – bolstered by supportive testimony from former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen and Bitcoin Foundation founding director Jon Matonis – have faced much scrutiny from critics, who argue that the proof offered by the Australian academic on his own blog is either false or fraudulent.

42399008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhylP,1462287893,Settlement Experts Predict Three Fates for Blockchain at Consensus 2016,"Two global banking leaders, a banking consortium and a newly minted limited-purpose trust company gathered onstage at the Consensus 2016 conference in New York City to discuss the future of blockchain technology among global financial institutions.  Moderated by business editor of The Economist Matthew Bishop, he lead the panel by proposing three possible futures of blockchain technology and asking the panelists to weigh in on the distributed ledger’s fate.  Bishop indicated he believes blockchain could either ""get rid of a lot of intermediaries"", lead to incumbents owning the technology, or lastly, that it could all be hype.  The former chief executive of SWIFT Americas and current business development officer for Digital Asset Holdings (DAH), Chris Church, said there’s more hype around blockchain than perhaps there should be, but said he didn't believe the third path was likely.  Church said:  ""There’s no smoke without fire.""  He told the crowd of about 1,200 people that, while blockchain is certainly not going to “destroy this institution or that institution”, as some have predicted, it still has the power to disrupt the industry.  Not just hype  Perhaps not surprisingly, most panelists didn't buy into the idea that blockchain technology was ""just hype"".  Brad Peterson, who came to Nasdaq from Charles Schwab told the audience that in five years blockchain will have amounted to more than just a bunch of hype. He contrasted the financial industry’s lackluster response to the Internet to its enthusiastic response to blockchain, adding that it won’t likely get caught reacting slowly to new technologies again.  CME Group’s head of digitization, Sandra Ro, broke down the type of responses into three categories: incumbents who adapt quickly to blockchain and ""get bigger"", others which will disappear altogether and the new players that will take their place.  Further, Charles Cascarilla, CEO and founder of blockchain financial services company itBit, took a middle line, saying ""it’s a bit of all three"".  To Cascarilla, blockchain may be currently deep into a hype cycle, but it still has the power to disintermediate the traditional institutions if they don't adapt to the threat their business models quickly enough.

42398999,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhydX,1462281680,Deloitte Unveils Five Blockchain Partnerships and 20 Prototypes,"One of the largest accounting firms in the world, Deloitte, says it has partnered with five blockchain startups and built a wide range of prototypes to service industries including insurance, employee management and cross-border payments.  The 'Big Four' accounting firm has built 20 working blockchain prototypes in partnership with startups BlockCypher, Bloq, ConsenSys Enterprise, Loyyal and Stellar.  Four of the prototypes will be demoed live on stage at the Consensus 2016 conference in New York City.  Deloitte partner Eric Piscini told CoinDesk that, while the companies represent a wide range of businesses, his company’s decision to partner with them was part of a global strategy to help push blockchain from theory into real-world applications.  Piscini said:  ""The expansion outside of banking is happening now in a big way. When you think about insurance or healthcare or retail or trade or commerce in general, you have a lot of opportunities.""  Talking as part of the Consensus event's 'Make it Real' section, Piscini said each of the 20 prototypes are fully functional. While details about the actual prototypes are forthcoming, he did break down the partnerships into three categories based on the types of products each has created.  Five partners  In the banking category, two startups are helping Deloitte build what it calls “digital banks” on a blockchain. While the banks aren’t built from the ground up on the blockchain, different components of the services have been constructed and are currently being marketed to banks.  One of Deloitte’s newest partners is California-based BlockCypher. The company which has raised $3.5m venture capital is providing Deloitte the core technology, an API layer, for multiple digital banking tools built on blockchains from Ethereum and bitcoin, as well as custom, private chains.  Based in New York, ConsenSys Enterprise is one of Deloitte’s earliest blockchain partners and is helping create a series of prototypes for financial products for sale to banks. The company is part of the ConsenSys hub of companies building a wide range of products on public and private versions of the Ethereum blockchain.  Piscini put both BlockCypher and ConsenSys in a category with the third partner, Bloq, reflecting his hopes that all three will help Deloitte scale blockchain on a global level. However, he distinguished Bloq from the other two because, instead of banking, the Chicago-based firm is working to help Deloitte launch a blockchain-agnostic insurance product.  The third category of partners is what Piscini described as applicable for specific use-cases. One startup, Loyyal, previously known as Ribbit.me, specializes in reward programs; the other, Stellar, in cross-border payments.  Loyyal, which raised $1.5m in venture capital when it was called Ribbit.me is building a blockchain-powered rewards platform. Piscini framed the prototype as a way to change employee behavior across a wide range of industries.  Piscini told CoinDesk:  ""It’s all based on blockchain technology and it’s a way to engage with your employees with the idea of doing a copy-paste of a platform for travel, retain, credit card, health insurance, a lot of places you can apply it.""  Stellar on the other hand is unique among the partnerships for being a non-profit foundation, designed to facilitate cross-border payments. The Stellar project with Deloitte is a financial services initiative that Piscini indicated is being built specifically for a bank outside of North America.  ""The client was amazed by how fast and how cheap those transactions were,"" he said.  Planning disruption  Piscini explained that the construction of each of the 20 prototypes depended on both halves of the partnership contributing to their creation. However, he added that no board members were exchanged as a result of the deals, and no financial investment was made as a way to maintain the parties' autonomy.  Piscini said:  ""You don’t want to be attached to one vendor because then you lose your independence and you don’t want to be dependent on one vendor, as well, from a scale and performance and expertise point of view. You need to have different vendors in order to deliver what you need to deliver.""  While the industries served by the partnerships are diverse, a single strategy on behalf of Deloitte brought them to the company, he said.  Instead of forecasting the potential revenue generated by each company, Deloitte broke down the potential disruption from blockchain by industry and by sector to determine where the largest potential lay. Then, the company reverse engineered their relationships to meet those potential demands.  For example, of Deloitte's ""huge library of use-cases"", the company believes that cross-border payments represents a $20bn disruption opportunity. Three of the five partnership are already generating revenue, although the company declined to reveal which.  Piscini, who is also an owner of Deloitte, said that the privately owned company is in no rush to turn a profit on these deals. “When you are a partnership, you don’t report to Wall Street every week or every quarter, we report to ourselves,” he said.  Getting ready for business  Deloitte last year generated $35.2bn in revenue, an increase of 7.6% in local currency terms. Earlier this year, CoinDesk published a report from Piscini suggesting that this year would be the year blockchain ""becomes a reality"", thanks to the work of consortia and “next generation” platforms like Ethereum.  In his latest conversation with CoinDesk, he said Deloitte’s clients have already asked for blockchain products covering aspects of insurance, oil and gas, and asset management. Later today, the Deloitte partner be giving a live demo of four of the 20 prototypes that are already fit for consumption – depending on what the customer needs done.  He said:  ""We are ready, of course, but I don’t want to say I’m ready until I know what they’re trying to do. If they are trying to put blockchain on the moon, then I’m not ready.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/05/03/deloitte-unveils-five-blockchain-partnerships-and-20-prototypes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b69fd07e0c45ae8e8cd0c542c068f27cc0dc9ad7-1500x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399012,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhyrJ,1462276479,Consensus 2016 Panelists Debate Blockchain's Business Impact,"Digital currency was the first application of blockchain technology – so it only makes sense that banks were among the first institutions to look into other applications.  But as those same institutions pursue blockchain trials and proofs-of-concept focused on finance, both startups and established companies are setting their gaze beyond the world of banking.  Speaking at today's Consensus 2016 blockchain conference in New York, leaders from those firms, alongside legacy players looking to build new products for their clients, painted a broad portrait of how distributed ledgers are positioned to change much more than how we control and spend our money.  Smart contracts  What could have easily become a competition for which platform is best for building smart contracts turned into a conversation about the importance of a diverse ecosystem to the nascent industry.  Speaking on the panel about how to make the most of smart contracts Ethereum consultant Taylor Gerring smiled when asked by the moderator which platform he would use if building a smart contract. Gerring acquiesced with the expected sales pitch for Ethereum and its Turing-complete architecture. The audience laughed with recognition of the obvious answer.  But, panelist Diego Zaldivar of open-source smart contracts platform Rootstock, which last month raised $1m, soon stepped in. ""For me it’s not a competition,"" he said. ""What we are doing is building a full new ecosystem, like we were doing back in the web.""  Gerring responded by pointing out that blockchains like Ethereum and bitcoin aren’t the only platforms for smart contracts, citing work from InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as an example of other even newer ways to write smart contracts.  Patrick Murck, of Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, interjected that during the early days of the smart contract ecosystem it was important not to rush to standardization too early.  ""The biggest risk is that we move too fast on standards and we don’t let people experiment,"" he said, adding: ""let standards emerge naturally.""  If smart contracts are given a fertile environment in which to grow, Peter Van Valkenburgh of Coin Center argues they will eventually give people an increased sense of control over privacy.  Currently, technology users are forced to accept the terms of lengthy privacy agreements with very limited options if any. ""It’s a desert right now,"" he said. But with smart contracts, users could in theoretically be empowered with the ability to tailor their privacy contracts.  Van Valkenburgh said:  ""With the proliferation of tools to have your data manipulated or not manipulated in any way…the consumer is potentially given much more choice.""  Emerging markets  The world’s underbanked are underbanked due to the cost it takes to serve them, according to Pablo Gonzalez, CEO of Bitso, a bitcoin exchange serving Mexico. Compared to the relatively tiny amounts of cash those users might deposit, the expenditure rarely generates profit for the bank. But as more and more of the world becomes connected, Gonzalez thinks that discrepancy will diminish.  ""The growth the the bitcoin network globally gives value to what we’re doing,"" said Gonzalez while speaking on a panel of entrepreneurs working to bring digital currencies to emerging markets.  Gonzalez was joined by Ola Doudin, CEO of BitOasis, a bitcoin exchange in Dubai, serving the Middle East and North Africa. ""It’s a fast growing market,"" she said. ""But underserved."" According to Doudin about 80% of adults and businesses in that area don’t have access to financial services. Like other members on the panel, she advocated for an update to national regulations that would make it easier to serve emerging markets. “It’s a huge opportunity for us,” she said.  Sunny Ray of Unocoin also sat on the panel, and said his company is working to bring banking service to the 200 million people without such services and Marcus Swanepoel of BitX spoke about his work to serve Southeast Asia and Africa.  Ben Gorlick of Blockstream stood out from the rest of the panel in that his company isn’t targeting any specific region, but is working to provide sidechain technology on the bitcoin blockchain for use by companies like those on stage. He told the audience that one of Blocksteam’s vision for the world is to create fungibility for any user no matter where he or she is from.  Gorlick said:  ""You want to be able to go all over the world and spend your money and feel like your money is your money.""  Innovations to insurance  Since the middle of last year, the potential applications of blockchain to cut costs and increase the efficiency of insurance products has become an increasingly discussed topic. Panel moderator Michael Fitzgerald of Celent addressed the crowd of about 300 people: ""I think it’s going to be good that someday when we die we’ll be on the blockchain somewhere.""  The four panelists discussing how to bring blockchain to insurance represented equal parts upstart disruptors and legacy players looking to keep their edge.  Enterprise innovation vice president of USAA, Darrius Jones, estimated that about two-thirds of the insurance and financial company’s efforts with blockchain are to ensure the company remains relevant in the eyes of its customers. The remaining one-third of its efforts are to increase procedural efficiency.  Jones said his company, which earlier today announced it has joined a blockchain policy group with Microsoft, didn’t have any problems insuring cars or other property owned by a single party. But as companies like Ford make plans to let multiple people own cars smart contract on a blockchain could help manage that complexity, he said.  Leanne Kemp, of blockchain provenance startup Everledger, added that when value is directly connected to an insurable asset’s value — as it is in the case of the diamonds with which she currently works — fraud is particularly harmful. Her company, helps track the the origins of diamonds which can be less valuable if they are obtained in unethical or uncertain ways.  For that reason she says: ""This industry more than ever wants to have transparency.""  Elsewhere, Gem's Micah Winkelspecht voiced belief that projects like his recently launched Gem Health have the potential to eventually ""remove reconciliation altogether,"" but that distrust of the technology by the government is slowing adoption.  Winkelspecht said:  ""It’s going to be a few years before we see any public infrastructure projects.""  Digital asset trading  The general consensus among members of today’s panel on how to upgrade capital markets was that bitcoin itself will eventual be valued more than gold.  ""I think it is fundamentally a new asset class,"" said Juthica Chou, cofounder of LedgerX. ""It offers utility as a method of payment that gold doesn’t."" Chou’s startup is currently awaiting regulatory approval from the CFTC to build an institutional trading and clearing platform with an eye to helping create a robust derivatives market.  While Chou thinks bitcoin will eventually be a more valuable asset than gold, she said it will always be limited by its market cap, which is about $6.8bn. But that might not be so big a problem if founder of Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert is correct.  Silbert predicts that $1tn dollars will flow into the digital currency asset class over the next 10 years. He added that much of that money won’t come from individual investors.  ""It’s primarily going to be central banks,"" he said, explaining that while banks won’t likely ever cap the supply or distribute their power much further than it is already, there is still a likelihood they might create a digital currency of their own. ""Some central banks are going to do it,” he said. “But it doesn’t mean its going to be better than bitcoin.""  For his part, the CEO of BTCC, Bobby Lee spoke about the impact of Chinese policy on the status of bitcoin as an asset and the Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, added that gold’s only advantage over bitcoin is its history of being an asset.  Moro said:  ""People of the world have a much better understanding of gold than they do of bitcoin.""  Identity and personal security  This humorous panel kicked off with talk about the possibility of protecting ones private key for accessing encrypted data by converting it to a QR and and tattooing it on a very private body part.  The moderator, David Birch of Consult Hyperion, was presumably being hyperbolic (though he provided no proof), but his point was well taken: protecting one’s identity can result in some extreme precautions.  Panelist Justin Newton of name-verified wallet-provider Netki told the crowd that protecting identity might not be a one-stop-shop in spite of the fact that most of us only have one identity. Newton said that ""one of the things we talk about when we talk about a topic as broad as identity is to think about what the use-case is"".  Panelist Vinny Lingham said he’s got a personal interest in protecting identity as the owner of a South African passport he says is so frequently counterfeited that many countries not loner accept them.  ""I can’t wait to get my US passport this year,"" he said. Earlier this year Lingham left Gyft after raising $2.75m for identity network startup Civic. ""We’re building this for a mass market consumer play, but we’re using blockchain to make it more secure.""  Another recently launched company, ShoCard has raised $1.5m to build its drivers license-based digital identity company. Panelist Armin Ebrahimi said his company is building a digital identity platform for mobile devices that sits on top of the blockchain where each party still owns their own data.  ""We use the blockchain as points of validation,"" he said  Also on the pnael, Case founder Melanie Shapiro spoke about how her company lets its customers user fingerprint biometrics to not only access their accounts but create the user-key itself, while Christian Lundkvist detailed ConsenSys' work to protect identities using the Ethereum blockchain.
