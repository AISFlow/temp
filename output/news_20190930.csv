42431037,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzNdh,1569884063,EOS Maker Block.One Settles With SEC Over Unregistered Securities Sale,"EOS maker Block.One must pay $24 million in penalties for conducting an unregistered securities sale, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Monday evening.  The SEC said in a press release that Block.One “raised the equivalent of several billion dollars” over a one-year period in an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO). (A total of $4.1 billion was raised.) Block.One agreed to settle the charges, according to the SEC.  The fine amounts to 0.58 percent of the initial raise.  Notably, the press release highlighted that Block.One’s token sale began shortly before the SEC released its DAO Report but “continued for nearly a year after the report’s publication.” The company did not secure an exemption from securities registration requirements and did not otherwise register the sale, the SEC said.  In its own press release, Block.One said the settlement only applies to the sale of the original ERC-20 token it sold. EOS holders swapped their ethereum-based tokens with the proper EOS tokens when the network first went live.  More significantly, Block.One's statement said that its ERC-20 token is no longer in circulation ""and will not require the token to be registered as a security with the SEC.""  The release added:  ""The SEC has simultaneously granted Block.one an important waiver so that Block.one will not be subject to certain ongoing restrictions that would usually apply with settlements of this type. Block.one believes the SEC’s granting of this waiver evidences Block.one’s continuing commitment to compliance and best practices in the United States and globally.""  Block.One declined to comment further to CoinDesk.  In a statement, SEC Division of Enforcement co-director Steven Peikin said the company “did not provide” investors with any of the information typically included in securities sales. The SEC's order echoes this complaint.  In June, Block.One announced the creation of a decentralized social network called Voice. Subsequent details on the launch of Voice, which also runs on the EOS network, have been sparse. As CoinDesk previously reported, the EOS blockchain has faced governance challenges in recent months.  Just last week, the commonwealth of Virginia gave Block.One a $600,000 grant to help build out its U.S. headquarters in Arlington, a suburb of Washington, D.C. The company has existing operations in Blacksburg, Va., as well as a major hub in Hong Kong.  According to the SEC press release, Block.One did not admit to or deny the regulator’s findings in deciding to settle.  Brady Dale contributed reporting.

The bunker, hidden in the Mosel River town of Traben-Trarbach, held multiple stories of servers as well as ""$41 million worth of funds allegedly tied to these markets,"" according to security researcher Brian Krebs.  ""Incredibly, for at least two of the men accused in the scheme, this was their second bunker-based hosting business that was raided by cops and shut down for courting and supporting illegal activity online,"" said Krebs.  Police also raided locations in Netherlands, Poland and Luxembourg in connection with the bunker's activities. The bunker held multiple dark web markets including the financial scam site “Wall Street Market,” drug portal “Cannabis Road” and “Orange Chemicals,"" a market for synthesized drugs.  Police believe the bunker belonged to Herman Johan Xennt and Sven Kamphuis, two hackers who originally ran a similar bunker in the Netherlands. After a fire caused by an explosion in an ecstasy lab, they had to shut down their original bunker and lost their ability to run their servers in the Netherlands. They moved into the new Cyberbunker in 2013.  “They’re known for hosting scammers, fraudsters, pedophiles, phishers, everyone,” said Guido Blaauw, director of Disaster-Proof Solutions, the company that sold the original bunker to the pair. “That’s something they’ve done for ages and they’re known for it.”  The whole operation was deeply secretive and connected to organized crime. Xennt himself was quite a character. The Irish Sunday World tracked him down in 2015 saying:  Xennt, who looks like a Bond villain, lives in the bunker. He is pasty, white-skinned and sports long blonde hair. He rarely shows his face in public, but when he does, it is to meet with his close friend [an organized crime figure] who has moved to an apartment in the town below.

42431019,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzJxh,1569869708,"Ethereum's Istanbul Upgrade Arrives Early, Causes Testnet Split","Ethereum test network Ropsten has forked into two separate chains following the activation of system-wide upgrade Istanbul.  “It appears there are two different chains mining the Ropsten test network. There are miners mining on the old [Ropsten] chain and miners mining the new one,” explained Ethereum Foundation community manager Hudson Jameson, adding in a tweet:  “This is what testnets are for! Be aware that Ropsten will be unstable until this all plays out.”  Originally expected to activate on Oct. 2 at block height 6,485,846, Istanbul was released two days earlier than planned – on Sept. 30 at roughly 3:40 a.m. UTC.  The reason for this according to Jameson was due to unusually fast block confirmation times.  Normally, miners on a proof-of-work blockchain like ethereum and test network Ropsten are required to manually upgrade their software in order to ensure the smooth continuation of a single chain.  According to Hudson, the majority of miners on the Ropsten blockchain did not upgrade to the latest software, since the time of the hard fork caught many developers off guard. This has resulted in a split of the test network between those mining on the upgraded chain and those mining on the outdated chain.  Last October, a similar event occurred after the activation of ethereum’s previous system-wide upgrade, Constantinople, which resulted in a temporary chain split on the Ropsten network lasting a few hours.  “The complicated part about proof-of-work test network is getting coordination between miners,” Jameson said in a call Monday afternoon. “Right now, we’re trying to run some miners to get Ropsten on the correct Istanbul chain.”  Jameson added that issues with the Ropsten network so far appear to be the result of poor miner communication, not flaws in the Istanbul upgrade code.  As such, how this temporary chain split will ultimately affect the activation of Istanbul on the ethereum main network is still to be determined. Ethereum core developers will have a call on Friday, Oct. 4 to discuss Istanbul’s testnet activation.

In a blog post, the foundation said one of its wallets, containing 10 million of the Fusion Network’s native FSN tokens and 3.5 million ERC-20 FSN tokens had been drained Saturday. The thief’s haul was worth an estimated $3.75 million as of press time.  The Fusion Foundation went on to suggest it may have been an inside job, writing:  “There is uncertain evidence showing that theft may have been caused by personnel related to the Fusion Foundation.”  The Fusion Foundation launched its mainnet last summer and has been migrating FSN tokens away from the ERC-20 standard. The interoperability platform aims to bring legacy financial institutions to the blockchain, by facilitating the transfer of stablecoins and other digital assets.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Chief Product Officer John Liu said the foundation has a good understanding of not only who the hacker is but how to de-monetize their loot.  “This is not a newbie hacker. This criminal has been preparing this in advance,” Liu said via phone Monday. “He was well prepared to implement this.”  Liu said the Foundation has been tracking the whereabouts of the coins and working to isolate them. To date, most of the stolen funds have gone through exchanges Bitmax and Hotbit. According to the foundation's blog post, crypto exchanges OKEX, Huobi, Bitmax, Citex and Hotbit have stopped accepting deposits and transfers of FSN.  As Liu told CoinDesk, the foundation’s methods for isolating the hacker's funds can not be disclosed until later. With about 25 percent of the Fusion Network’s coins having been stolen, a lot is on the line.

42431016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzK3h,1569857737,Ethereum's Istanbul Upgrade Will Break 680 Smart Contracts on Aragon,"A system-wide upgrade arrived on ethereum’s Ropsten test network on Monday. And while “Istanbul” should ultimately introduce network efficiencies, the testnet launch won’t be smooth sailing for everyone.  For governance platform Aragon, in particular, the code changes were expected to break roughly 680 smart contracts, according to Aragon One CTO Jorge Izquierdo. These smart contracts typically manage the governance of decentralized applications (dapps) running on the ethereum blockchain.  Izquierdo tells CoinDesk this means forced upgrades are required for the affected smart contracts in order to ensure decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) built on the Aragon platform continue to function smoothly.  “Up until now, DAOs could receive ETH from one another,” said Izquierdo. “This will no longer be possible after the Istanbul hard fork.”  Aragon One communications lead John Light says these fund transfers between DAOs on Aragon would effectively “run out of gas.”  Calling it an unfortunate “tradeoff” from Aragon’s point of view, Izquierdo said:  “The issue were going to have hasn't been deemed important enough for this hard fork not to happen, which from our point of view is unfortunate [but] it's a hard balance we understand.”  Indeed, for ethereum token-swap platform Kyber Network the system-wide upgrade only affects a single smart contract, according to Kyber Network co-founder Loi Luu.  Stepping back, the code change in Istanbul affecting certain smart contracts is known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1884 and is meant to address one downside of ethereum’s steady growth.  As the size of the blockchain has increased, the computational cost to recall data about the state of the network (such as account balances) has also increased. Gas prices, on the other hand, have stayed stagnant, creating what Ethereum Foundation security lead Martin Holst Swende calls “an imbalance between the price of an operation and the resource consumption.”  In order to mitigate the possibility of overloading the network, EIP 1884 increases the gas prices of three resource-intensive operations.  SLOAD down  The so-called SLOAD operation will face the greatest increase in cost for application developers building on ethereum, going from 200 gas per operation to 800 gas per operation.  This four-fold increase in SLOAD gas cost is what breaks Aragon smart contracts and jacks up prices for end-users of the Kyber Network.  “In one Kyber transaction, we actually use a lot of SLOAD operations,” said Luu. “So after [Istanbul] is in effect, the price of most of our transactions will go up by 30 percent.”  While this is not the first time gas prices have increased for the SLOAD operation, Luu says the previous increase from 50 to 200 gas back in 2016 occurred when there were fewer active users of the ethereum network and when ETH had a lower market value.  Now, Luu says, increasing the cost of SLOAD operations will have greater ramifications to both end-users and application developers.  “[Istanbul] is the kind of hard fork that’s going to break a lot of smart contracts,” Luu said earlier this month. “If we weren’t following the conversation between core developers, we would have missed [EIP 1884 information] and that would have been very bad for us.”  That said, blockchain researcher Mihailo Bjelic said Monday that ""bad developer practices"" are likely the cause of such hiccups, rather than the nature of the upgrade itself, adding:  ""Developers should definitely not be hard-coding assumptions about gas cost into their applications because these numbers can change at any point.""  Update (Sept. 30, 19:14 UTC): The Istanbul upgrade went live on testnet earlier than expected. This article has been updated to reflect that. Additional comments have also been added.

42431020,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzK7h,1569852002,Ether Outshines Bitcoin in a Gloomy Month for Crypto Prices,"September has been a rough month for bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market, but ether has weathered the storm better than most.  Bitcoin, (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, is on track to post a monthly loss of more than 16 percent – the biggest since November 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. As of writing, BTC is trading around $8,070, having hit a 3.5-month low of $7,838 earlier today.  Meanwhile, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has currently shed nearly 13.7 percent on a month-to-date basis, standing at $215 billion at press time.  Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency ether (ETH), however, is currently reporting a monthly gain of 0.30 percent. As of writing, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is changing hands at $174.  In fact, ETH is the best performing top 10 cryptocurrency of September, as seen in the chart below (note, the tether stablecoin has been excluded).  Bitcoin SV (BSV) is the worst performing cryptocurrency this month, with a 35 percent monthly drop. BSV fell to a six-month low of $75 last week and is currently trading around $84.  Six out of the top 10 are reporting double-digit monthly declines.  The broad-based losses could be associated with the risk aversion triggered by bitcoin’s recent slide.  Big drop for bitcoin  Bitcoin fell by $2,000 last week, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change on technical charts.  The month had begun on a positive note, with BTC picking a bid around $9,500 and clocking highs near $10,900 on Sept. 6.  The bullish momentum, however, ran out of steam in the following two weeks, leaving BTC directionless despite the strengthening narrative that the surging hash rate or computing power would draw bids for the cryptocurrency.  The consolidation ended with last week’s 20 percent slide – its biggest weekly drop of 2019.  Mixed fortunes  Ether also fell by 20 percent last week to register its biggest weekly loss in over two months. Even so, the cryptocurrency is currently reporting marginal monthly gains at press time.  This is because the last week's sell-off merely erased the gains seen in the preceding two weeks. The cryptocurrency had rallied from $178 to $222 in the 12 days to Sept. 19, before falling back to lows below $170 last week.  Ether's price rise seen in the second and the third week of September had seemed to bode well for other alternative cryptocurrencies. For instance, XRP clocked a one-month high of $0.32 on Sept. 18 before sliding to a 658-day low of $0.22 on Sept. 24.  Litecoin's corrective bounce also topped out at a one-month high of $79.45 on Sept. 18, before falling to $52.38 last week, the lowest level since March 6.  Most alternative cryptocurrencies are based on ethereum's blockchain. Hence, many observers often consider ether's rise, especially against BTC, a positive sign for alts.  ETH/BTC turned higher from Sept. 6 lows near 0.016 BTC and rose to a seven-week high of 0.02038 BTC on Sept. 19. As of writing, ether's bitcoin-denominated exchange rate is seen at 0.02145 BTC.

42431013,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzJth,1569848738,Coinbase-Led Group Aims to Help Crypto Firms Avoid Securities Violations,"Crypto industry leaders are taking the initiative to help firms in the space avoid running afoul of securities rules.  In a company blog post, Coinbase announced it has co-founded the Crypto Rating Council, a member organization purposed with assisting cryptocurrency companies determine if they comply with current U.S. federal securities law.  Coinbase is joined at launch by seven other firms: Anchorage, Bittrex, Circle, DRW Cumberland, Genesis, Grayscale Investments and Kraken.  As part of the effort, the council will issue a 1–5 rating for a given cryptocurrency or token's similarity to a security. Under the rating system, a 1 constitutes a crypto asset with few functional similarities to a security, while a 5 would be consistent with the definition of a security.  As of now, the council has rated 20 crypto assets, with the top cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin, rated a 1. Notably, XRP, maker (MKR) and polymath (POLY) landed scores of 4 or 4.5.  The Crypto Rating Council says the rating system – which it stresses is not investment advice – is based on past SEC guidance and case law, and the legal and technical experience of the firms making up the group.  'Complex' rules  The Blockchain Association's Kristin Smith told CoinDesk that Coinbase originally spearheaded the initiative.  “[It's] an effort by the industry to comply with the incredibly complex [U.S.] securities laws,” Smith said.  For now, only tokens listed by exchanges participating in the council have been rated and released, with more to follow. Assets that receive a 5 may never be disclosed by the Council, Smith told CoinDesk. All assets' assessments are liable to change, Coinbase's blog cautioned.  Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Brian Brooks later clarified to CoinDeks that the Council would not disclose 5 ratings – since member exchanges would not service these assets.  ""Since a 5 rating indicates that the asset can only be listed on a registered securities exchange or ATS, by definition those ratings wouldn't be published because the relevant assets aren't listed by any member,"" Brooks told CoinDesk.  If council members later get approved to operate ATS platforms by regulators like FINRA, that may change, he added.  However, CEO of the Binance exchange, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, was skeptical of the new ratings system, saying on Twitter:    The guys who score above 2 should form their own counsel and re-rate everything again.        — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) September 30, 2019      The council’s formation comes on the heels of payment network Ripple’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit of its XRP cryptocurrency. Ripple said in its filing that XRP is not a security, though this was not a core argument in its motion to dismiss.

42431018,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzJzh,1569844825,Uzbekistan Plans Massive Hike in Electricity Prices for Crypto Miners,"Uzbekistan's Ministry of Energy has introduced a new bill that threatens to stifle the cryptocurrency mining industry in the Central Asian nation.  Published on Friday, the draft bill would usher in a sharp hike in the power rates charged to miners – crypto industry participants who use powerful computers to record and secure transactions on blockchains.  The bill states (via translation) that ""to stimulate power saving, raise the effectiveness of power consumption in industries and the non-commercial sector, and to endorse the rational use of electricity,"" businesses working with crypto assets, including miners, will be obliged to pay a rate three times that currently charged for their business category, no matter their power capacity.  The price of electricity for general consumers is currently around 3.5 cents per kWh. With mining being very energy intensive, companies seek out jurisdictions with lower power costs in order to maximize their return on investment.  The draft bill is open for public comment until Oct. 12. According to the posting on the Uzbekistan government website, 9 comments and suggestions have been posted so far, with viewers able to vote on their preferred answers.  Salvar Rasulev, a commenter introducing himself as an IT entrepreneur, argues that raising prices by just a factor of two would scare miners away, effectively closing the country off to the industry. Yet, mining is actually beneficial for Uzbekistan, he says, as it brings foreign currency into the nation.  Rasulev writes:  ""Mining uses a lot of electricity but brings much more profit to Uzbekistan ... Instead of supporting a business that would allow Uzbekistan to get hundreds of million dollars in export, which our president and our economy is demanding, you're shutting down this opportunity and handing it over to other countries instead.""  Another respondent, Srapionov Vladimir Ashotovich, takes the alternate view, saying that raising prices for miners is the right thing to do as they ""don't provide any significant product or service for the country and society"" and are wasting valuable energy ""heating the atmosphere.""  However, by and large, most comments suggest the government should stimulate the crypto industry in the country and take a differentiated approach to the electricity pricing depending on which power sources miners use.  Uzbekistan is self-sufficient in power, having major oil and natural gas reserves. Like Russia and other countries that previously formed the USSR, it also has an abundance of industrial power stations left behind by the Soviet industrial machine.

42431026,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzKHh,1569841233,What Google's 'Quantum Supremacy' Means for the Future of Cryptocurrency,"Just like that, the promise of quantum computers overtaking traditional computers is one step closer to reality.  According to a recent report by the Financial Times, tech giant Google claims to have achieved “quantum supremacy,” meaning it has built a quantum computer able to solve formerly impossible mathematical calculations.  If proven true, this marks a major milestone in the development of quantum computers and possibly, the demise of blockchain technology as we know it today.  Since the advent of bitcoin, the threat of quantum computing has motivated researchers, technologists and, now, governments, to build software able to resist attack by even the most powerful quantum computers.  Quantum computers, while still largely theoretical, are thought to vastly speed up the process of solving complex computations. So much so that current calculations impossible for a current computer to solve in one human lifespan would take mere seconds for a quantum computer to crack.  As explained by data research firm CB Insights, quantum computers rely on “naturally occurring quantum-mechanical phenomena” known as superposition and entanglement.  “These states of matter, when harnessed for computing purposes, can speed up our ability to perform immense computations,” said the report.  Canada steps in  And this summer, the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada partnered with the University of Waterloo to launch a two-year research initiative for quantum-safe blockchain technology.  The research, led by University of Waterloo professors Srinivasan Keshav and Michele Mosca, is receiving a total of $180,000 over this two-year period to expand the team with other “highly qualified personnel,” said Nic Defalco, communications advisor to the NRC.  Among state governments, Canada is the leader in quantum computing research, according to Andersen Cheng, CEO of quantum R&D firm Post-Quantum.  “Other governments are trying to play catch-up,” said Cheng. “The U.S. is lagging behind quite a bit. The UK is putting a lot of money into quantum computing hardware and now, they’re just about to start thinking about post-quantum software and cryptography.”  U.S. President Donald Trump signed the National Quantum Initiative Act into law last December, allocating $1.2 billion over a five-year period to activities promoting quantum information science. In June, the UK’s National Quantum Technologies Programme received an additional $193 million of funding from the UK government, placing total investments in the program since 2014 at $1.2 billion.  Why the fuss?  Efforts in the private sphere are similarly increasing, according to CB Insights, which found the number of investments in private quantum computing startups has increased over 200 percent in the past six years.  All this, in the mind of Adam Koltun of the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) Foundation, speaks to a growing problem.  “A decade ago people said it would take 50 years to get where we are now with quantum computing. Five years ago, they said it would take 25 years to get where we are now. So quantum computing has this nasty habit of exceeding people’s expectations,” said Koltun, adding:  “The blockchain industry does need to grapple with this and be wary.”  Koltun’s group claims to have built the first blockchain that is secure against attacks from quantum computers.  Without proactive behavior to safeguard existing technologies from possible attacks, Koltun fears the future blockchain and cryptocurrencies – and also the internet at large – will be at risk.  Cautionary tale  There are actually a few different ways a quantum computer can snap a blockchain.  For one, blockchain transactions are secured with digital signatures based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). ECC coincidently is also used on the internet to encrypt user data and website traffic.  However, ECC is not “quantum-safe,” according to Post-Quantum’s Cheng, meaning that a powerful quantum computer could theoretically decrypt user private keys and forge transaction signatures on their behalf.  “Once that trust is broken, that will be the end of cryptocurrencies,” said Cheng, adding:  “If you can no longer tell whether [the right] people are signing transactions to you or not, then you have destroyed trust. This cryptocurrency world is based on a distributed, trustless environment.”  This is by far the most pertinent security issue for blockchains when it comes to co-existing in a world with quantum computers – especially given that researchers and mathematicians are already aware of a possible algorithm, called Shor's algorithm, that could be used by a sufficiently powerful quantum computer to break elliptic curve digital signatures.  “We’ve had the math available for us for decades in terms of what the first and second generation of quantum computers are going to look like,” said the QRL Foundation’s Koltun.  At the same time, Koltun did contend that quantum computers may vastly exceed scientist’s expectations and prove to make blockchain technology obsolete in ways not yet imagined.  Said Koltun:  “You should be wary of anyone who claims to sell you a waterproof watch or quantum-proof blockchain because we are not yet fully aware of the potential of quantum computers. … For someone to proclaim any technological product, blockchains or otherwise, as impervious to quantum computers would require them to know what these computers are entirely capable of, which we don’t.”  Fighting an enemy that doesn’t yet exist  Precisely because the full capabilities of quantum computers are not yet known, combatting their impact to existing blockchain platforms may sound like a doltish task.  As frequently explained by prominent bitcoin evangelist and author Andreas M. Antonopoulos, the threat of quantum computing in his mind is often overplayed.  “We can migrate quite easily to another algorithm,” he said last year during one of his monthly Q&As. “It’s not really as big a threat as people think it is.”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlzJyp3Qm7s  What’s more, while the capabilities of quantum computers might be vastly more extensive than currently imagined, they may also be vastly overstated.  “Google’s quantum breakthrough is for a primitive type of quantum computing that is nowhere near breaking cryptography,” said bitcoin core developer Peter Todd. “We still don’t even know if it’s possible to scale quantum computers.”  Still, if there’s a general understanding that quantum computing will be a problem for blockchain networks moving forward, Keshav, the professor at the University of Waterloo, asks:  “Shouldn't we be doing something about it today?”  Keshav said his newly commissioned research team would be looking into a handful of the most promising “quantum-safe cryptography” tools, including lattice-based cryptography and multivariate public-key cryptography. His researchers will initially begin testing on the enterprise-focused Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.  There are scores of others that the wider crypto space should be looking into, according to Keshav. Pointing to an ongoing competition hosted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Keshav said there have been over 80 different proposals submitted from researchers and academics for “quantum-resistant, public-key cryptographic algorithms.”  Having put forth his own proposal in NIST’s ongoing cryptography competition, Post-Quantum’s CEO Andersen Cheng said:  “You don’t need a quantum computer to come into existence to work out what is required to counter the threat from it. This isn’t trial and error because you can work out mathematically what is good enough or not.”  Model quantum computer image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/30/what-googles-quantum-supremacy-means-for-the-future-of-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0935e7180fd8b548d7301fc9541a47a3c4a2a901-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to The Korea Herald on Monday, fintech firm BK Global Consortium's deal to buy a majority stake in the major South Korean exchange has not yet been fully paid for.  In October 2018, BTC Korean Holdings had agreed to sell 51 percent of its share in Bithumb to BK Global Consortium for $333 million. Since the deal was brokered, BK Global reportedly made a down payment of $100 million.  However, sources close to the matter told the news source that BK Global pushed back the April deadline for completing the purchase on the condition that it would increase its stake in Bithumb from 51 percent to 70 percent. However, the report said BK Global has again missed a Sept. 30 deadline for the final payment.  The Herald said the firm has been seeking various partnerships or buyouts to secure the remaining capital for the acquisition.  One such investor, Cho Yoon-hyeong of electronic equipment manufacturer Cornerstone, is rumored to be contributing some $125 million toward BK Global's exchange purchase.  On Monday, Cho disputed that the deal would fall apart following the second extension.  “The deal is proceeding smoothly, and we’re working on details with BTC Holdings.”  A Bithumb representative concurred, stating “Bithumb has stable management, so there won’t be any impact should the deal collapse.”  Bithumb image via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/30/crypto-exchange-bithumbs-333-million-acquisition-may-be-in-jeopardy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11c022992a8439080e2658f142fc85776a0cc55a-1500x811.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431033,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzKVh,1569837608,Bitcoin Price Eyes Quarterly Loss After Hitting 3.5-Month Low,"View  Bitcoin has dropped more than 25 percent in the third quarter, neutralizing the bullish setup on the monthly chart.  With the weekly and the three-day charts biased bearish, the cryptocurrency risks falling to $7,500 in the short-term. A violation there would expose the next major support, currently at $7,070.  A corrective bounce may be seen before an extended sell-off to $7,500-$7,070, as the 4-hour chart is reporting a bullish divergence of the relative strength index.  A break above July's low of $9,049 is needed to invalidate the bearish setup on the long duration charts.      Bitcoin (BTC) is again flashing red, having hit a 3.5-month low earlier today and is on track to post the first quarterly loss of 2019.  The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $7,715 at 04:50 UTC today – a level last seen on June 11 – and is currently changing hands at $7,980 on Bitstamp, representing 2 percent losses on a 24-hour basis.  More importantly, BTC is currently down more than 25 percent from July 1’s opening price of $10,759. This is the first quarterly loss since the final three months of 2018.  Back then, the cryptocurrency had dropped by 44 percent, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin’s two-quarter winning run is set to end with a double-digit price drop.  The 27 percent slide witnessed in the July-September period is the second-biggest third quarter loss on record, the first being the 55.78 percent drop registered in the third quarter of 2011.  Prices rallied 10.9 percent and 162.69 percent in the first and second quarter, respectively.  The long-term technical charts had turned bullish following the second quarter's triple digit price rise and many observers were convinced that BTC may see a brief correction in the third quarter before challenging record highs near $20,000 in the final thee months of 2019.  The cryptocurrency did see a pullback to $9,100 in mid-July, having hit a high of $13,880 at the end of June and traded largely in a sideways manner around $10,000 in the following eight weeks.  With non-price metrics like hash rate hitting record highs, BTC was widely expected to chart a strong bounce from $10,000. Instead, the cryptocurrency dived below the psychological support last week and hit lows below $8,000, weakening the long-term bullish case, as seen the charts below.  Monthly chart  BTC created consecutive inside bar candlesticks in July and August, signaling indecision in the market place or consolidation.  September's red candle marks a bearish follow-through to the consolidation. Essentially, the sellers have come out victorious in a tug of war with the bulls.  The bearish inside bar reversal would be confirmed if prices close today (UTC) below $9,049 – the low of the first inside bar (July). With BTC currently trading at lows below $8,000, a bearish close is pretty much confirmed.  The latest monthly candle has poured cold water over the optimism generated by April's falling channel breakout. Moreover, a similar breakout in October 2015 had paved the way for a solid two-year bull run.  The bearish outlook would be invalidated if and when prices rise above $9,049.  Weekly and 3-day charts  BTC closed well below $9,533 on Sunday, confirming a double top breakdown on the weekly line chart (above left).  The breakdown has opened the doors for $7,500 (target as per the measured move method). Supporting the bearish case is the below-50 print on the relative strength index (RSI).  Meanwhile, the three-day chart (above right) indicators are also reporting bearish conditions. For instance, the RSI is hovering below 50 and the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending south.  Further, the 5- and 50-candle MAs have produced a bearish crossover and the 10-candle MA is about to cross below the 50-candle MA.  With odds stacked in favor of the bears, a drop to the 200-candle MA, currently flatlined at $7,070, looks likely.  Daily and 4-hour charts  BTC failed to take out the 200-day MA on Saturday, as expected, and fell back to 3.5-month lows earlier today.  Essentially, BTC created a lower high at the key MA, reinforcing the bearish view. The daily chart RSI continues to report oversold conditions, but would gain credence if and when signs of seller exhaustion emerge on the price chart.  However, on the 4-hour chart, the indicator is charting higher lows, contradicting lower lows on price. That bullish divergence indicates a corrective bounce could be seen before the drop to $7,500-$7,070, as suggested by the long duration charts.  Corrective rallies, if any, will likely face stiff resistance of the 200-day MA at $8,415.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Byrne – who left the firm in August after disclosing that he'd had a three-year affair with a Russian agent – is accused of selling his shares while in possession of adverse information not disclosed to shareholders. Former CFO Gregory J. Iverson, who resigned last week, is also accused of making ""materially false and misleading statements.""  The complaint also addresses previously public claims that Overstock had used its unusual crypto shareholders' dividend, in the form of a digital security issued via its subsidiary tZERO, to take ""revenge"" on short sellers.  The dividend was to be locked up for six months, effectively meaning it was ""impossible for short sellers to maintain their short positions.""  Ha's complaint states:  ""While defendant Byrne had previously, at different times, launched into public tirades over short selling and naked short selling, the tZERO Dividend was his secret plot to finally obtain hegemony over them – and it almost worked.""  However, the complaint alleges, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was working behind the scenes, telling Overstock that it would not allow the locked-up dividend. Meanwhile, some banks were also easing the situation for short sellers by saying they would accept a cash equivalent to the locked-up digital shares.  As a result, on Sept. 18, Overstock moved to restructure the dividend to end the lockup and allow the shares to be freely traded at issuance.  Briefly, the firm's initial announcements on the lockup had caused its stock price to bounce, at which time Byrne is said to have capitalized by selling his shares – even, it is alleged, while the SEC was telling the firm it would not allow the dividend in its current form.  As a result of his claims, Ha is asking the court for a trial by jury.

42431027,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzKFh,1569834023,Swiss Stock Exchange SIX Lines up Buyers for 'Initial Digital Offering',"The Takeaway:  Swiss Digital Exchange (SDX), a unit of stock exchange operator SIX, has organized a two phased approach: global consortium of financial institutions, followed by an ""initial digital offering"" (IDO).  The IDO is scheduled to happen by the middle of next year.  SDX has modified its business plan. Initially, it intended to tokenize traditional banking assets first and exotic assets like real estate and art further down the line. Now, it expects to do the reverse.  Six predicts efficiency improvements for products lacking standardization, new revenue opportunities from non-bankable (exotic) assets, leveraging the infrastructure (Network as a Service).  SDX's focus has switched to post-trade processing and custody, which, along with connecting to the Swiss interbank clearing system, are some of the main pain points causing delays.      Swiss Digital Exchange (SDX), the blockchain-based utility owned by Swiss stock exchange company SIX, has organized a global consortium of financial institutions to back its ""initial digital offering"" (IDO).  Now slated for the middle of next year, the IDO would be like a traditional IPO, except that the shares are to take the form of security tokens issued on SDX's platform.  Thomas Kindler, who recently took over as head of SDX, used the term “consortium” to describe the cohort of investors, which includes banks, buy-side firms and market infrastructure providers because the goal is to legitimize the technology as well as raise capital.  Kindler told CoinDesk:  “We are not just looking to Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund to give us money. We are looking at our clients to invest, but at the same time commit business and help us validate what we built and get it off the ground. The key focus is not money; it's money linked to business and validation of the business model.”  Kindler would not name any of the consortium members. Nor would he give any indication of how much money SDX was looking to raise. SIX would keep the majority of equity in SDX, he said.  “There is clearly interest in the market,” said Kindler. “What we foresee are two levels. On one large level ... we are looking at, say, four or five-ish large investors. Then potentially ten-ish smaller investors.”  SDX is wholly owned by SIX, an unlisted public limited company based in Zurich. SIX is itself owned by around 120 domestic and international financial institutions, which are also the main users of its services.  By debuting its own SDX security token, the blockchain-based exchange will be eating its own dog food, to use a well-worn expression.  “We want to set a standard so we would go live on our own exchange obviously, and that would be a native asset token,” said Kindler.  Tokenizing equity in the form of unlisted shares in a fully regulated environment is complex, a fact attested to by firms such as Nivaura, which has been working on this in the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s sandbox with the help of the London Stock Exchange Group.  The SDX digital equity token will be issued on a blockchain built using the enterprise version of R3’s Corda technology. Asked about secondary markets or how the tokens might connect to other consortium members, Kindler said he was limited in what can be divulged at this time.  “We are looking at a two-phased approach,” he said. “As a first step, we are looking at an international consortium of investors. The second step would be our own issuance.""  Delays  At the Sibos 2019 conference in London last week, SDX issued a press release about a prototype version of SDX, conceding that the full launch of the system, originally slated for summer 2019, had been pushed back until the end of 2020.  Before addressing particular reasons for this, Kindler gave a sweeping account of the difficulties being faced.  He told CoinDesk that “SDX is really end-to-end,” a property often touted by other blockchain solutions, but which in fact only comprise elements, such as a trading venue or custody of keys.  ""We are building a regulated CSD [central securities depository] for digital assets – and that is different from the ability for a bank to hold digital assets on behalf of a client,” Kindler said.  SDX finds itself in a “bizarre situation,” he said, since on the one hand, “we face high pressure in terms of time to market from the competition and stakeholders, but at the same time, there is no market. We are developing the market as we go.”  He also hinted that the banks which are SDX’s future clients may not be entirely comfortable with the brave new world of tokenized everything, saying:  “Just positioning the core infrastructure is challenging because it's cannibalizing existing business and it's a long shot from a bank perspective.”  Previously, SDX said the plan was to start by tokenizing things like unlisted shares followed by traditional assets such as bonds; further down the line more exotic assets like real estate and fine art could also be tokenized.  However, the plan now is to focus on those non-traditional tokenized assets first. Regarding the original plan to first tokenize traditional banking assets, Kindler said:  “That's what we thought from six to nine months ago. But that has really changed. And whether the traditional blue-chip equities business is moving into a digital world, I think that's still to be seen. Clearly we foresee that happening in the long run, but the banks are also looking at complementary solutions; not cannibalizing their existing business but creating new revenue opportunities.”  Custody battle  In a frank admission, Kindler said much of the major pain points which were causing delays were on the post-trade side, specifically areas like custody of assets and creating the blockchain-based CSD.  “So we have shifted our focus to post-trade; listing and trading have moved a bit more into the background for the time being. All this is evolving and we just need a bit more time,” he said.  SDX is customizing R3’s Corda to create its custody solution, rather than bringing in third-party custody providers to help build that part.  Kindler said critical elements include “customization, as in full asset lifecycle, but also integration into our existing connectivity.”  He added that there should be one connectivity for the client.  “Whether they connect to the traditional world or digital world, shouldn't matter,” he said.  Central bank money  Another piece of the puzzle is connectivity to the Swiss real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system and central bank money via the Swiss National Bank (SNB).  This piece, which is still to be added, goes above and beyond the scope of traditional custody solutions where you deal with commercial bank money, noted Kindler.  Digital fiat coming on-chain allows for instant exchange of cash and assets and is often seen as the essential fuel for blockchain-based transfer of value, at least within the wholesale banking arena.  Kindler said there are three ways the cash leg of trades might be done on SDX. Firstly, by SDX holding an account with the RTGS system (which parent company SIX happens to operate on behalf of SNB).  “So we have an account there and we can place central bank money, then on the back of that generate fiat tokens – always backed by central bank money. As a CSD we can guarantee we will not generate more cash than we have in the central bank account,” he said.  Another approach would be SDX “interfacing with the existing RTGS system in a way that we don't need cash tokens in our infrastructure,” said Kindler. “We only have asset tokens, if you will, and we have a real-time interface with the RTGS system and can deal with it that way.”  Lastly, the central bank could issue digital Swiss francs, he said – but “we are are not there yet.”  SIX image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/30/swiss-stock-exchange-six-lines-up-buyers-for-initial-digital-offering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b414892aee0fb29f5bdd3356bc74da17cc2ec630-1500x1101.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Algrim team will add six engineers to Ripple's ranks, with a focus on integrations with partner crypto exchanges. The team will work to expand Ripple’s cross-border payment corridors and contribute to the ongoing development of the company’s on-demand liquidity product, said Amir Sarhangi, Ripple's vice president of products. Ripple did not disclose the financial terms of the acquisition.  “It’s about expertise,” Sarhangi said. “This team hits the ground running as opposed to building out a team that has to gain this knowledge.”  The purchase is also the company’s first expansion into Iceland. Ripple has a physical presence in San Francisco, New York, London, Mumbai, Singapore, São Paulo and Sydney. The company wants to expand its ability to hire engineering talent as it moves into new parts of the world, Sarhangi added.  On-demand liquidity through Ripple’s xRapid cross-border payment service allows companies to transfer funds from one currency to XRP and from XRP to another currency. This allows enterprises to avoid opening a bank account in countries they want to send payments to, letting them avoid holding funds there for cross-border transactions. Ripple says it has more than a dozen customers using XRP for cross-border transactions.  Prior to the acquisition, Algrim developed a crypto trading platform that the firm integrated with more than 30 markets. Before that, the team built traditional trading platforms and foreign exchange trading algorithms for more than a decade. The firm was reportedly among the victims in Iceland’s ""Big Bitcoin Heist"" of late-2017.  The news follows Ripple’s announcement on Friday that its investment arm, Xpring, had purchased Logos Network. That move brought nine engineers to the Xpring team with the goal of building XRP-related decentralized finance (DeFi) products. Before joining Xpring, Logos was working to build a payments network inspired by the bitcoin blockchain, with a focus on a scalable, rapid network that still maintains high levels of security.

The companies signed a letter of intent to utilize blockchain technology to increase efficiency, improve the income of farmers, ensure the production of high-quality food and aid in the digitization of agriculture, according to a Sept. 25 announcement.  The agreement would bring together the portfolio and digital-farming technologies of Monheim am Rhein, Germany-based Bayer Crop Science, and the blockchain division of Hangzhou, China-based Ant Financial.  No information was provided about the size of the deal or the structure of the relationship.  ""Together with Bayer, our exploration of blockchain in agriculture will improve the transparency and responsiveness of its supply chain, and bring more value to consumers, farmers and the society,"" Geoff Jiang, vice president and general manager of Ant Financial's Intelligent Technology Group, said in the statement.  Ant Financial, founded in 2014, is 33 percent owned by Alibaba. Its brands include Alipay, one of the two dominant mobile payment services in China.  The company has made a number of blockchain-related investments and announcements in recent years. It raised $14 billion in 2018 to pursue new technological developments, including those related blockchain, AI and IoT.  Early this month, Ant Financial said that it was developing a blockchain system for charity platforms, improving the transparency of the process and preventing charities from inflating their fund-raising totals.  In May, the company invested in a $10 million Series A round for QEDIT, a developer of privacy solutions for the blockchain. In March, two new Shanghai-based companies were introduced, Ant Blockchain Technology and Ant Doublechain Technology, both owned by Ant Financial .  Ant Financial is also working to utilize the blockchain for remittances, last year introducing a system for the transfer of funds between the Philippines and Hong Kong.  Bayer Crop Science, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, has been actively working on the blockchain developments. Earlier this year, it signed a deal with BlockApps, a ConsenSys spinout.

42431028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzKJh,1569823205,Fidelity Digital Assets to Provide Custody for Bitcoin Derivatives Yield Fund,"An asset manager wants to have a go at a bitcoin-options-based fund as major exchanges make crypto derivatives trading more accessible to investors.  The Los Angeles-based Wave Financial has launched the Wave BTC Income & Growth Digital Fund, touting the fund to be the first crypto-derivatives-based yield fund on the market.  “I think what was missing in the crypto market is a lot of very solid traditional types of products, but with crypto assets,” Ben Tsai, managing partner of Wave Financial, told CoinDesk.  After several months of due diligence, Tsai said Fidelity Digital Assets is now on board to provide custody for the fund.  The idea is to capture part of a new market of yield products in the crypto space, building on creativity from traditional funds and the growth of the crypto derivatives platforms that underpin the technical aspects of these new funds.  The Wave fund plans to generate monthly income with the premium from selling call options with strikes 20 percent higher than the current price at the time. It aims to distribute dividend that is 1.5 percent net asset value of the bitcoin held in the fund, potentially resulting in an 18 percent annual yield.  The bitcoin income fund charges 100 basis points fixed management annually, and takes 30 percent of any returns above the 18 percent yield, putting the rest back into the fund, according to Tsai.  The new fund is currently open for subscriptions, but there haven't been any investors who have confirmed to subscribe.  ""We have a number of investors that have expressed interest and we are working to get them the actual private placement memorandum and subscription agreement,"" Tsai said.  One of the peer products in the equity option-based fund space is Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income Fund ( ETBhttps://funds.eatonvance.com/media/2286.pdf).  That $393 million fund’s total expense ratio is 111 bps including 100 bps management fee, which is on the lower end of the fee spectrum for option-based funds, according to Morningstar.  The average return in its option-based fund category is 1.25 percent over the last year, 5.1 percent over the three-year period and 10.44 percent year-to-date as of Sept. 17.  A risky game  One of the ways for this fund to work is to accurately identify mispricing in the call options market. However, it's tricky to achieve that given crypto derivatives such as options, Samuel Lee, financial advisor at Chicago-based SVRN Asset Management, told CoinDesk.  “They are a very new asset class whose market is not very efficient,” Lee said, adding:  “Skilled investors are going to take a lot more advantage of those who are less skilled in such markets when compared to more mature equity and fixed income markets.”  The financial advisor also said, while it is possible for the firm to realize 18 percent monthly yield, the fund’s total return should matter more to investors.  “A lot of income funds with very high yields are often sacrificing price returns,” Lee said. “While you are getting hefty premiums, you could be sacrificing all that upside potential.”  Focusing too much on yield would also risk meeting monthly income targets with investors’ principal in the fund, he added.  However, inefficiency in the options market could be an opportunity for crypto-derivative funds, Lee explained.  “The more inefficient the market is, which means fewer smart people are looking at it, the more mispricing there is going to be,"" he said.  Embedded transaction costs can also eat in the total returns of such funds, Lee added.  The wide bid-ask spread in the crypto derivatives market implies low liquidity and high transaction cost and there will also be taxes imposed on the income, according to Lee.  Built on derivatives  All of these funds are possible because of the operational simplicity today provided by major crypto exchanges offering new platforms to trade crypto derivatives.  This month, Binance acquired crypto exchange JEX to boost its crypto derivatives offerings for traders. The Seychelles-registered JEX offers spot and derivatives including options and futures trading in digital currencies.  In August, Crypto futures exchange Deribit said it has become one of the first crypto futures and options exchanges to provide large-volume trades of bitcoin and ether derivatives.  In March, Galaxy Capital-backed institutional trading and portfolio management platform Caspian launched trading in cryptocurrency derivatives including futures and options.  There are also more exchanges with plans to offer such services.  Derivatives marketplace CME Group announced in September that it will offer options on its bitcoin futures contracts starting in the first quarter of 2020.  Seed CX subsidiary Zero Hash – the company’s custodian and settlement service provider – will support derivatives transactions, and include options at a future date.  Will investors bite?  The prospects of new funds and structures may be exciting, but the jury is still out if the Wave fund will gain traction, as management waits for the first substantial investors to subscribe.  Tsai, who led alternative investments in the Asia-Pacific region at Alliance Berstein, said Wave Financial is approaching accredited investors and high-net-worth individuals, and it has been developing a distribution network across major international markets.  Several firms have expressed interest in distributing the fund, Tsai said, including one in Southeast Asia asking to be an exclusive distributor in the region.  Latin America is another region with potential, Tsai said.  “In my previous experience, the Latin American investors in the wealth management space actually buy similar products as Asian investors,” said Tsa, describing investors from these regions as being less risk-averse.  He said the fund offers investors a less volatile way to make money from bitcoin, as it earns premium as long as the BTC price increase is below 20 percent.  In addition, the crypto derivative-based fund could also diversify investors’ portfolios as it is uncorrelated to most traditional asset classes, Tsai said.

The software streamlines commodities trading with applications supporting every step of the process — pre-trade KYC, trade execution and post-trade risk management - while automated systems and smart contracts make these energy trades faster and more organized for users.  “When you encapsulate commodity trades in blockchain smart contracts, you essentially increase the speed of your trading activities, avoid data reconciliations and messy data interfaces,” an EnHelix representative told CoinDesk.

These tools provide the flexibility and mobility they need.  Enhelix's blockchain solutions  for the oil and gas sector comprise three major systems, Marketplace, Logistics and Settlement. Their Marketplace blockchain is for energy and commodity firms to transact ""using smart contracts in order to reduce paperwork and reconciliation for post-trade and order operations;""  The EnHelix Logistics Blockchain was ""created for midstream, cargo brokers, and logistics companies to streamline their scheduling, nomination, and billing operations"" via distributed ledgers.
