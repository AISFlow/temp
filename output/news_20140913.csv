42377635,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VYz,1410636939,"All Things Alt: Anon Reviews, Backslash's Beta and a Pink Partnership","September is in full swing and is starting to heat up, with the end of the summer season activity in the markets.  Will this be the season that altcoins rise to prominence? Keep an eye on the volume and chatter and you never know – this week’s gamble could be next month’s killer use case for digital currency.  Pinkcoin and Sync team up  Two prominent altcoins have recently established a partnership, setting the stage for long-term cooperation on both services and broader project support.  The teams behind Sync and pinkcoin have entered into a new agreement in which some of the investor benefits given to Sync users will also be extended to those who stake certain amounts of PINK. This includes enrollment in the membership program offered by the Sync Foundation, the trade organization built around the Sync project, and discounts on the group’s upcoming cryptocurrency gathering in Las Vegas scheduled for later this year.  Cooperation between coins is not new, though past examples like UNOCS have demonstrated that there are limits to broad organizations formed by ostensibly competing coins.  But according to pinkcoin developer CryptoCayce, pinkcoin and Sync have much to gain from working together. Calling the partnership a “win-win situation”, he told CoinDesk:  “Pink and Sync are not in competition in the same space within the altcoin world since Pink is so abundant with about 364 million coins and Sync is so scarce with about 1,100 coins we view Pink as having day-to-day usage whereas Sync is effectively the gold reserve.”  The pinkcoin team is currently working on the beta version of its online poker platform, and the partnership adds a level of support to the project. Among the services offered to eligible pinkcoin holders is a webinar with poker professional Danny Johnson.  Dogecoin web app Backslash enters beta Monday  Some have called dogecoin an easy way to get into digital currency, owing to its ease of use, robust community and family friendly image. One of the goals of the project is to introduce people to cryptocurrency who aren’t necessarily familiar with the technology.  Backslash  , which began development earlier this summer, is looking to make it even simpler to send DOGE from one person to another. The platform is an HTML 5 web app that hosts a series of wallets for users who want to quickly send DOGE to others, and will be entering public beta this Monday.  Users can send dogecoins via email or social media accounts, enabling recipients to create their own wallet via Backslash’s service. The team behind the project said that they took a similar approach to Coinbase in terms of coin management, which keeps their transactions off the block chain and, as a result, free.  CoinDesk spoke with Paul Benigeri and Roneil Rumburg, the co-creators of the web platform, who said that the goal is to make it easy to tip or donate dogecoin, which are arguably two of the key use cases for the coin.  While the infrastructure appears simple, the team goes to great lengths to make sure that private keys are kept away from potential fraudulent access. Rumberg explained that transactions are signed on a computer that is partitioned from the Internet, using a separate device to actually broadcast the transactions.  Rumburg told CoinDesk:  “What we’re trying to do there is air-gap the keys from the Internet.”  Though still in its early stages, the community reactions to Backslash’s alpha were mostly positive. According to Benigeri, the public beta will draw from past participants as well as those in the DOGE community that have been waiting for broader access.  Darkcoin undergoes anonymity review  The darkcoin development team has been working on a new version of DarkSend, its transaction anonymizing mechanism that helped spark a boom in production of anon-style altcoins.  DarkSend+ was submitted for review to cryptocurrency expert Kristov Atlashttp://anonymousbitcoinbook.com/, who later drafted a full summary of his findings.  The move is not a new one. Other coins built on the basis of anonymity have been subjected to public coin reviews, and most of these undertakings are intended to prove the veracity of the anonymizing mechanisms.  In the case of Atlas’ examination, he found that while there are vulnerabilities to certain types of attacks, darkcoin’s approach to hiding transactions works.  Darkcoin developer Evan Duffield noted in a response to Atlas’ report that some of the identified weaknesses have already been addressed. He acknowledged that some approaches, including those that target masternodes, are capable of succeeding.  However, he reiterated that DarkSend achieves its stated goals, explaining:  “Darkcoin solves the anonymity problem by making the block chain a fog. There are very few practical ways to attack our system, and at it’s core, most of the attacks listed were based solely on the fact that the merged transactions were using only two participants while in the test environment. This has always been a known issue and never was intended to be used beyond testing.”  Strange alt of the week  The plethora of altcoins in existence has given rise to certain projects, both serious and light-hearted, to somehow reduce the considerable supply through redemptive or outright destructive means.  While not the first to suggest using a proof-of-burn mechanism to produce coins in a network, ÇoinProLite is perhaps the most outlandishly presented as demonstrated by its Bitcoin Talk forum post.  Using a commonly attributed (if not decidedly scatalogical) term to denote coins that are of a poor quality, the ÇoinProLite developer says that the altcoin community at-large can help lessen or eliminate coins that are no longer in use, and that many a so-called bagholder can escape their “dire positions” with ÇoinProLite.  For a sales pitch that can only truly be experienced rather than described, ÇoinProLite has won this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  ÇoinProLite is expected to have a max supply of roughly 2.6 billion coins, though the final amount could change depending on the number of coins burned in the process. The coin’s “innards and guts”, in the words of its developer, provide multiple proofing systems, including a staking mechanism that generates a small interest rate.  Despite the loquacious style of the developer’s posts, the person behind the project seems to want to create a more inclusive environment for whatever community may emerge.  The developer says:  “Bear in mind for you guys sitting on the sidelines, there's plenty of room for maneuverability if there's some aspects you'll like to see incorporated that I've failed to mention or thought of yet, but suffice to say this'll be built with your best interest in mind, along with as much transparency as possible, allowing you to even dictate the terms. Simply voice your opinion, whereupon a dialog will ensue to further the cause.”  Images via Shutterstock, Bitcoin Talk  Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world?

42377633,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VaF,1410629422,The Top 5 US States for Bitcoin ATMs,"Bitcoin's popularity keeps growing by the day.  Even in the face of regulatory speed bumps and PR fiascos, the number of merchants accepting bitcoin, the number of bitcoin wallets and the amount of venture capital invested in the industry all continue to rise.  As the public's interest in the digital currency grows, bitcoin ATMs have proven to be critical for bridging the gap between casual onlookers and active bitcoin owners.  Bitcoin ATMs offer users the ability to instantly purchase the digital currency, which, for many first-time buyers especially, adds a touch of familiarity to an otherwise foreign experience.  While bitcoin ATMs are popping up almost everywhere around the world, it's safe to assume the powers of supply and demand help dictate where the machines are most concentrated.  Data analysis  To identify the areas where bitcoin ATMs are particularly popular, we analyzed data from CoinDesk's new bitcoin ATM map and calculated the US states with the most machines per capita.  Of course the term 'popular' is subjective by nature and there are countless ways to measure it, but for the purpose of this report, popularity is defined by the number of bitcoin ATMs per capita in each US state.  Our data  include a total of 51 bitcoin ATMs distributed across 20 states. Not surprisingly, the two most populous states – California and Texas – are home to nine machines each, accounting for 35% of all the country's bitcoin ATMs on record.  When adjusting for states' population, neither California nor Texas make the cut for the top five most popular states for bitcoin. Other states with multiple bitcoin ATMs that missed the top five include Missouri, ranked 7th with three ATMs; Michigan, ranked 14th with two ATMs; and New York, ranked 16th with three ATMs.  Here are the top five most popular states for bitcoin, ranked by the number of bitcoin ATMs per capita:  1. New Mexico  One bitcoin ATM for every 695,000 people  The southwestern state has three machines in our file and is the home of the US's very first bitcoin ATM in Albuquerque.  2. North Dakota  One bitcoin ATM for every 723,000 people  North Dakota's spot at number two on the list may seem unlikely, but having just one ATM had a big impact, as the state is one of the least populous in the nation.  3. Nevada  One bitcoin ATM for every 930,000 people  Casinos in Las Vegas have proven to be a popular place for bitcoin ATMs, and if some predictions about bitcoin's potential for the gambling industry come true, we can expect to see many more here.  4. Hawaii  One bitcoin ATM for every 1.40 million people  Tourists and residents of the picturesque island state have options if they need to buy some bitcoin: Hawaiin Island Stamp and Coin just launched the state's first ATM in its store in Honolulu.  5. Massachusetts  One bitcoin ATM for every 1.67 million people  Known for its many prestigious universities and generally progressive residents, it's not surprising that Massachusetts made the top five of all states – there's even a bitcoin ATM on MIT's campus.  As of now, the sample size of bitcoin ATMs in the US is quite small. As demand for the digital currency increases and more business owners invest in new machines, hopefully bitcoin ATMs become more ubiquitous in the States and abroad.

42377601,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72QsN,1410623739,iOS Users Get First 'Decentralized' Bitcoin Wallet with Breadwallet,"rs of iOS devices can now download a decentralized wallet app that connects directly to the bitcoin network, making it different from other server-based products on the market.  Breadwallet  is the first bitcoin wallet app of its kind on Apple's platform. Its creator says users are not vulnerable to server downtime or the hacking attacks that sometimes strike centralized providers, and wallet management remains straightforward enough for the average user.  It is now featured on the 'Choose Your Bitcoin Wallet' page at bitcoin.org, and has received favorable comments from users on Reddit. A video demonstration of the app is here.  Security features  Instead of running through central servers, Breadwallet accesses the bitcoin network directly, using 'simplified payment verification' (SPV). Developer Aaron Voisine said he prefers this to other iOS apps that are ""server-trusting"" or just ""wrappers around web windows"", building his own SPV backend from scratch.  Breadwallet is a BIP32 HD or 'hierarchical deterministic' wallet, which means all of a user's bitcoin addresses (public and private) and balances can be recovered with a single unique phrase. Provided you remember the phrase, users' wallets will never need backups and can be restored on other devices even if the original is lost, broken or stolen.  That being so, Breadwallet is staking a claim as iOS's first decentralized bitcoin wallet. The Android version of Hive wallet is built on Mike Hearn's bitcoinj and thus is listed as 'decentralized' by bitcoin.org, but its iOS version is not.  Hive does, however, use a similar deterministic tree structure (BIP39) to Breadwallet, meaning backup phrases from each app may be used on the other.  Choosing a more secure platform  Voisine said he chose iOS because he wanted to create an app that anyone could use relatively safely, without needing to know how to secure a desktop or Android device – something even more technical users often struggle to do properly.  He said:  ""As bitcoin grows to become a major world currency, malware theft is going to be a huge problem. Stealing digital cash is way more lucrative than turning people's machines into spambots or stealing credit cards.""  Apple's tight grip over its native platform was actually the best way to reduce the threat of malware, he added. Further, iOS is the only popular platform that hardware-encrypts the filesystem by default, giving added protection to users who lose physical access to their devices.  However, Voisine said that users of 'jailbroken' iOS devices should not install Breadwallet – or any kind of bitcoin wallet.  ""You're going to get robbed because you think you know more than you actually do. Any jailbreak app has total control of your phone and your wallet. I understand the temptation to use it with a little bit of money, but you will get lazy because it will be convenient to use right up until it isn't.""  He added that he wanted to make a wallet with a ""beautiful, convenient user experience that is also as secure as possible for people who have zero understanding of computer security.""  Bitcoin matures on iOS  Bitcoin users with iOS devices have seen a dramatic improvement in wallet options in just the past few months. No sooner had Apple quietly ceased its policy against bitcoin wallet and payment apps in June, than the first examples began to appear.  There are now over 10 wallet and payment options available on iOS, includng Blockchain, Gliph, Hive, Coin Pocket, Bity and GreenAddress.  Voisine, who has been a mobile developer for six years, was previously the lead iOS developer for Yammer, as well as co-founder of Lightt Inc.  He said he was convinced Apple would change its policy on bitcoin apps eventually, and set to work months before the decision was made in order to be ready to submit on the first day Apple allowed it.  The long head start turned out to be prudent – the biggest challenge Voisine faced was building the app's SPV mode bitcoin network client portion. No-one had written this for iOS previously, and it took him six months to complete, he said:  ""All the Android wallets that are SPV use Mike Hearn's bitcoinj, which took over a year to write.""  Breadwallet is free to download and use from the iOS App Store.

42377596,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72Qm5,1410604221,The ATM and the Battle for Bitcoin's Physical Interface,"Two years ago, Zach Harvey and his brother, Josh, were saddled with a failing guitar shop selling vintage and handmade pieces in New Hampshire. The guitar venture had once been a roaring success, but that had been in Tel Aviv, before the duo decided to move back to the United States.  On the verge of shutting down the company, the brothers started casting around for a new project to take their minds off the struggling business. They had come across bitcoin before, in 2011, but did nothing more with it besides deciding that they would accept bitcoin payments for their guitars.  Now, they decided to try and solve the problem of buying bitcoin. It was too complicated. They built a prototype of a machine that would dispense bitcoin in exchange for fiat. It was essentially a wooden box filled with components purchased on eBay. Harvey recalls:  ""We took it to a libertarian forum in New Hampshire and immediately people were all over the machine. Bitcoin became something that people were interacting with, that they could physically see. It kind of erupted at that point.""  The Harveys have parlayed that prototype into Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures, the bitcoin ATM manufacturer with the largest share of an exploding, and perhaps the most visible, segment of the cryptocurrency economy. While Lamassu may be on top now, its early rival Robocoin and well-funded new entrants are piling into this rapidly changing sector.  Pioneering manufacturers  The first bitcoin ATM to be used commercially was a unit by Las Vegas-based manufacturer Robocoin. It was installed in Vancouver's Waves coffee house at the end of October 2013, lending the place a sci-fi vibe as customers lined up to buy cryptocurrency.  A month had barely passed before the news got out that the machine had already grossed more than $1m Canadian dollars, breaking even for its operator after just 17 days. The bitcoin ATM gold-rush had begun.  At the start, ATM manufacturing was dominated by two firms, Robocoin and Lamassu, each with seemingly opposing approaches to the business.  Robocoin machines are large, freestanding, machines with built-in palm-scanners. They allow two-way transactions between fiat and bitcoin, with each machine costing about $15,000. Lamassu units are compact, white machines that sit on a table-top. They cost $6,500 each and only allow users to buy bitcoin.  The differences don't end there. While Robocoin machines require operators to use the Bitstamp exchange, Lamassu customers are free to choose an exchange. Robocoin also charges a 1% fee for transactions completed.  Robocoin has started modelling itself after a bank, calling its machines 'branches', while Lamassu has moved to an open-source software model.  Early stumbling blocks  Both pioneers have run into stumbling blocks as their machines left the factory floor to be installed in restaurants, cafes and bars around the world. The Robocoin machine in the Waves coffee house, for example, left dozens of angry customers with unprocessed orders in January as a problem cropped up with Bitstamp, which was the only exchange the machine could use.  Lamassu, meanwhile, inadvertantly turned a customer into a competitor when Tim Schuuman, owner of the eighth Lamassu unit, became unhappy because the firm wouldn't open-source its software. Upon receiving his Lamassu unit, Schuuman was sufficiently indignant to start work on his own open-source ATM, which is now the low-cost Skyhook machine.  One operator is Jonathan Harrison of London's SatoshiPoint. His favoured brand is clear: his firm owns four Robocoin machines and a Lamassu unit. Still, he said, things are changing:  ""Lamassu is sort of marching towards [Robocoin] and they're going to have to do something. We have to pay Robocoin 1% of every transaction as well. With Lamassu it's nothing.""  ATMs outside the bitcoin bubble  Even as the two incumbents were locked in a battle for market-share and to hit shipping deadlines, strong new competitors have entered the space, and no wonder, because the global ATM industry is a multi-billion dollar business.  There are 2.6 million ATMs in operation around the world, according to consulting firm Retail Banking Research (RBR). That number is accelerating, driven by huge demand from Asia. India, for example, grew its installed base of ATMs by 44% in 2012 compared to a year earlier, RBR has found.  You only need to look at the revenues of the handful of giant companies that dominate traditional ATM manufacturing to see the size of the opportunity for bitcoin's fledging makers.  The biggest of these is Ohio-based NCR Corporation, which commands 30% of the global installed base, according to RBR. Last year, the NYSE-listed company reported revenues of $3.1bn for its financial services segment, which includes ATM hardware, software and installations.  Its rival Diebold, also based in Ohio, reported sales of $2.3bn from its ATM business last year. Between them, the two companies employ 45,300 employees around the world.  Convergence with fiat ATM networks  Two of the most ambitious new entrants in the bitcoin ATM world are BitAccess, a Canadian outfit that recently exited the prestigious Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator, and Skyhook.  Haseeb Awan is one of four co-founders at BitAccess. The firm has 46 machines installed. Awan describes an ambitious strategy to tap existing ATM networks and big banks. He says the startup is already on its way.  Awan says his firm's model of providing a turnkey solution to operators will help it win business from operators of existing ATM networks. His firm will deal with compliance issues, the logistics of moving cash and the machines' hardware and software.  He said:  ""The traditional ATM industry is in danger right now, there are ATMs on every corner. Bitcoin machines can do huge transactions and they are more lucrative. We are in touch with all the major companies right now.""  Fiat ATM networks are operated either by banks or what are called independent deployers. Bank networks dominate the segment in most countries, with the notable exception of the United States, where independent deployers have just over half the market, according to figures from the National ATM Council.  Payment Alliance International, based in Kentucky, is the largest independent deployer in North America. The privately held company runs 60,000 ATMs or about 15% of the US installed base.  Open-source slashes prices  At the other end of the market is Skyhook, which offers the cheapest machine on the market, priced at $999. It's made in Oregon and runs on open-source software. The machine is relatively simple; it only allows users to buy bitcoin. It's a small white block meant for table-tops with a touchscreen mounted on it.  Schuuman, who co-founded the startup with Jon Hannis, believes that letting customers audit the code is the best way to grow the company and increase trust in bitcoin. Besides, it's cheaper to develop it that way and it's putting price pressure on other manufacturers.  He said:  ""We just have simpler hardware and open-source software. We likely have lower margins [than competitors], but if we do put downward pressure on other manufacturers – great. The more open and available technologies like this become, the more bitcoin as a whole benefits.""  For ATM operators like SatoshiPoint's Harrison, the stiffer competition among manufacturers is a welcome development. He said he's taking a close look at a BitAccess machine for the future.  ""I think these new machines that have shown up, they're a lot cheaper and they're being very aggressive with their pricing as well,"" he said.  The fiat ATM industry takes notice  The fiat ATM industry is starting to take notice of the cryptocurrency space. The ATM Industry Association released a position paper on bitcoin ATMs this month, calling for greater regulation and welcoming bitcoin ATM operators into the fold.  Bitcoin companies are biting. Michael Lee, who heads the association, said he expects several bitcoin ATM firms to become members in the coming weeks, following outreach efforts by his organisation.  ""Only through communication and relationship-building with innovators can we all seamlessly adjust to this new development,"" he said.  Felix Kronabetter, marketing manager at RBR, which publishes the definitive forecasts on the ATM industry, offered a less optimistic assessment of the budding bitcoin ATM sector, saying:  ""Bitcoin ATMs won't have any impact. My understanding is that the machines are not even proper ATMs made by the major manufactures, so it's a niche application at the moment.""  Will bitcoin ATMs stay relevant?  While bitcoin ATMs have played a crucial role in creating a tangible interface to the ethereal cryptocurrency economy, are they here to stay? Or will they go the way of transitional technologies of the past, joining the Minidisc, Dictaphone and Betamax video cassettes in the graveyard of once cutting-edge tech, as phablets and mobile wallets flourish?  Mitchell Demeter of Bitcoiniacs, which operates the first bitcoin ATM, at Waves coffee house in Vancouver, doesn't think so. He sums up the appeal of a machine specifically designed for buying a digital currency:  ""For a lot of people we’re the first contact they have with bitcoin. A lot of people do research online but they don’t have anyone physically to talk to. They find that a huge advantage.""
