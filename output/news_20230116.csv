Cronos’ trading volume has spiked by 301.28%, showing that the coin has attracted more trading activity. Generally, the crypto market has seen a slight price increase. Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has enjoyed a positive rally and has influenced the rise of altcoins such as CRO. Related Reading: Lazarus Group Transfers $64M ETH From Harmony Bridge Hack Cronos’ price surged by over 9% in 24 hours, continuing its impressive price action into 2023. The cryptocurrency’s wide range of applications in various spheres has also helped to push this crypto revival. What Is Behind This Rally? Cronos is an open-source blockchain that facilitates Crypto.com’s Pay mobile app payments. However, the Cronos blockchain, which is Ethereum compatible, has upgraded and redesigned the project focus to integrate Web 3 and NFTs. The asset’s price has benefitted from increased adoption, evident in the more than 100% spike in trading activity. Cronos network now supports activities on the Metaverse. NFTs and Games are part of the new projects adopted to keep up with modern trends. The network has also maintained its core objective of providing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Crypto users can carry out financial transactions on the blockchain fast and anonymously. Cronos has built a strong followership that interacts on social media channels. The launch of Cronos Chain, compatible with Ethereum, has put the project on the front foot. The Cronos chain allows the migration of DApps built on the Ethereum blockchain and supports the Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol. The IBC protocol lets Cronos connect to the Cosmos ecosystem and interact with its DApps. Cronos (CRO) Price Prediction What To Expect CRO is gaining in the market today, currently trading at $0.0806. The support levels for CRO are $0.070164, $0.071703, and $0.072919, while the resistance levels are $0.075674, $0.077213, and $0.078429. Cronos is currently trading above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) but is below its 200-day SMA. It implies that this price action could operate as a short-lived rally. On the price chart, the candles are in an ascending pattern. However, the candle for today has a long upper wick implying that the bears are trying to push the price down. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is bullish and in the overbought zone, at 79.27. It represents the massive spike in trading volume in Cronos. However, the RSI might retrace into the channel in the coming days. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD is above its signal line, which is also a buy signal. But, the MACD is showing minimal divergence, implying that there might be a trend reversal in the short term. Cronos will likely continue to trade in the green for a few days before slightly retracing. Related Reading: What Matters In Crypto This Week: Will Bitcoin Keep Pumping?

42394474,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8KUp,1673909289,How to Turn Your Community Into a DAO,"Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are changing the way communities organize and operate in Web3. The term refers to a group with a shared goal that is governed without a traditional centralized leadership structure. Essentially, members of a DAO vote on important issues related to the organization, such as how to allocate money or build new products.  This blockchain-based structure is designed to provide projects, businesses and communities with a more democratic management process, fostering better coordination among creators, developers and investors. But groups don’t necessarily need to start out as DAOs, and there are ways to integrate these concepts into an existing community structure.  Finding inspiration: DAO success stories  Since the first DAO (aptly named The DAO) was formed in 2016, the concept has expanded across industries, including finance, fashion, journalism and more. DAOs rely on smart contracts to automatically execute tasks when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries.  Several successful DAOs have sprung up in recent years, showcasing a variety of use cases.  Metaverse platform Decentraland, for example, created the Decentraland DAO to govern its native cryptocurrency MANA and virtual real estate parcels called LAND. Members of the DAO can bring forward and vote on proposals, allowing the community to shape the platform’s future collaboratively. The virtual world even threw away the private key that controlled the smart contract for MANA, fully decentralizing its governance token.  Other DAOs form decentralized community fundraisers around a shared goal. ConstitutionDAO, for example, sought to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution at auction. LinksDAO, which is focused on building the world’s greatest golf and leisure club, sold memberships to its future club as non-fungible tokens (NFT), netting millions of dollars without even owning a golf course.  Begin building your DAO  Understanding how DAOs work and modeling your structure after other DAOs can help you shift your existing community into Web3.  Aligning your DAO identity  The first step is setting your DAO’s purpose. This is your mission statement and unites your community around a common interest or goal. Work closely with your founding team to build a community where people want to be, and prioritize engagement over growth.  In line with having a common goal, DAO creation and management tool Aragon suggests that creating a distinct brand identity will help define your purpose. This is how you visually represent your ideas and it is key to developing your community, your user base, the amount of media coverage you receive and building your reputation in Web3.  Select the best blockchain for your needs  Choosing which blockchain to use is important in determining the direction of your organization. Because DAOs have no central leadership and voting on proposals often occurs on-chain, blockchain ledgers help keep the inner workings of the organization transparent and immutable.  Ethereum and Polygon are popular blockchain options for DAOs, and you should consider gas fees, security and scalability of the network when making a decision.  Define your governance process  Next, define how your DAO will make decisions and who can make those decisions. Creating an effective structure will determine how engaged your community is and how efficient and safe the process will be.  There’s no right or wrong way to structure your governance. Currently, DAOs allow members to vote based on the number of tokens they hold or via their crypto wallets.  Tokens are an effective way to create weighted voting – meaning, the more tokens a member holds the more weighted their vote. Wallet-based voting, on the other hand, gives each member one vote per wallet, minimizing the ability to simply purchase voting power.  According to Aragon, many DAOs start off with wallet-based voting before they create a governance token and evolve their process.  Mint and manage DAO governance tokens  If you decide to use a token-based voting system, you’ll need to mint and manage your tokens. Some projects choose to sell non-fungible tokens to allocate membership, while others choose to create a native token to simplify the process.  Once you decide on a name for your tokens, you’ll need to determine how many tokens you want to mint. This could be in the form of a fixed supply of tokens or a variable supply that can fluctuate over time. You’ll also need to consider the maximum supply of tokens that will be minted and the number of tokens currently in circulation, or the circulating supply.  Once minted, the tokens can be given to specific people or can be bought and sold on either a primary or secondary exchange. Funds raised by the community are often managed by a community treasury.  It’s important to note that in some parts of the world, your tokens may be deemed a security and may be subject to local regulation and taxes. It’s important to consider the legal implications of token-based voting before going down that route.  Creating a forum and proposal  A DAO proposal is an idea that a community or DAO member wants the DAO to consider. It usually consists of a document outlining an idea, how it will be put into practice and the necessary funds needed.  Proposals should be fully formed ideas that have moved beyond the brainstorming phase and are ready for the community to evaluate. These proposals should go on a forum where open discussion is encouraged for those who get to vote.  DAOs need to set a minimum participation of voters to be present for a vote to be valid, sometimes called a quorum, along with a pass rate, or the number of affirmative votes needed to pass a proposal. There should also be a voting period, or an amount of time where a vote is live, in order to fairly determine the result.  Determine DAO tools  The software, applications and smart contracts a DAO uses to run are referred to as DAO tooling. Your community won't be able to communicate, send money, pay contributors or organize legal documents without it.  There are a variety of tools available for different processes – for example, Discord is a tool commonly used for discussion and community management, while a Gnosis Safe is sometimes used as a multisig wallet for moving group funds.  Simply put, DAO tooling is how you manage your organization.  Coordination is key  Now that you’ve made major decisions for your DAO, it’s time to work with your community to achieve your common goal. Voting on important decisions will only grow more difficult as your community grows, so it’s important to organize and adapt strategies early.  If you're seeking more information on how to build your DAO, there exists a vast ecosystem of communities that can share tips and tools.",POSITIVE,MANA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MANA | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Lia Savillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-turn-your-community-into-a-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70c52367647e9e9405719d29d78dd7857d609e3d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Joining CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” from the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos 2023, Treat said that metaverse-enabled capabilities, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and the ability to tokenize “identity, money and objects,” can simultaneously shift business models and tap into new revenue streams.  In a survey earlier this year, the Dublin, Ireland-based consulting firm said that by late 2025, the metaverse is likely to fuel a $1 trillion opportunity for businesses.  Nonetheless, according to Treat, it comes down to building “architectural patterns” that establish trust with users in the event something does go wrong.  “That requires some governance, audit control and ability to think through the hybrid structures that we’re working with to do that in different creative ways,” Treat said.  The key step is portability, where users should be able to have a portable device that can be used across difference blockchains, according to Treat.  “I need to be able to bring that object, and the identity that I've received or my money and take it to a different digital context,” Treat said. “And if that's a different ledger with a different wallet, that's a pretty dystopian outcome.”  Read more: Self-Custodial Onboarding Will Be the Norm in Web3's 2023/ Opinion",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | WALLET | AR,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/16/accenture-exec-says-future-of-crypto-self-custody-will-be-portability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1f01e3d39b703b500cf426803f2a2bd45f6b720-2716x1246.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He said Sushi will release its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator in the first quarter.  The protocol will focusing heavily on DEX products this year as part of its previous broader plans toward making the protocol sustainable and profitable. ""Ultimately, we will provide deep liquidity, optimal pricing, sustainable tokenomics and an easy-to-use platform, placing you first in everything we build,"" CEO Jared Grey said in a blog post on Monday.  Read more: DeFi Protocol Sushi to Shutter Lending Product to Focus on DEX  The move comes after Sushi's chief technology officer, Matthew Lilley, said in a tweet thread on Jan. 3 that two of its products – the Kashi lending platform and MISO, a launchpad for external tokens – would be shuttered because of low public interest and the significant effort that went into maintaining the two. Lilley said Sushi developers would focus more on the protocol’s DEX product.  ""Our goal is to become a market-leading DEX by improving our product stack and delivering feature parity to provide a firm foundation enabling innovation, like biased LP routes via our aggregation router and concentrated liquidity coming in Q1,"" Grey said in the new blog post.  Sushi was created as a copy of Uniswap with added liquidity mining and governance features. SushiSwap, the DEX, had over $457.8 million in locked token value as of Tuesday, according to DefiLlama data. Some $329.6 million of that is locked on Ethereum-based assets.  SushiSwap (SUSHI), the native token of the SushiSwap decentralized exchange, has risen about 36% this year, compared to Ethereum's native token ether (ETH), which has climbed 33%, according to CoinDesk data.  Grey said that Sushi built its DEX aggregation router in ""stealth mode"" during 2022 which will ""help deliver the best user experience by serving users with optimal pricing."" DEX aggregation connects many decentralized exchanges' liquidity pools, helping to provide traders better price and liquidity. Some of the top DEX aggregators include 1inch, OpenOcean and ParaSwap.  Sushi is also expecting to launch its decentralized incubator – Sushi Studios – which will license the brand to launch independently funded projects to support ecosystem growth without burdening the decentralized autonomus organization (DAO) treasury, Grey said in the blog.  Grey, who was formerly CEO of DeFi platform EONS and CEO at crypto exchange Bitfineon, was voted by the Sushi community in October to be the CEO. Grey told CoinDesk at that time that he hoped to bolster engagement on the platform and improve the exchange's internal organization.

7652126,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516309,1673906888,Why A Morning Star Reversal Could Awaken A Monster Bitcoin Rally,"Bitcoin price is already turning heads after reclaiming $20,000 per coin, but if the current monthly candle closes on BTCUSD price charts, the top cryptocurrency will satisfy the conditions of a morning star reversal pattern. The last time the signal occurred at the bottom of a major downtrend, Bitcoin began a two-year-long bull run in cryptocurrencies and went on to climb more than 6,000% after the morning star confirmed. Bitcoin Reclaims $20,000: A Wake Up Call For The Bull Market Bitcoin is once again above $20,000, but a lot has changed since 2020 when it passed the key level for the first time. The number one cryptocurrency by market cap has declined by 78%, and altcoins have dramatically collapsed by as much as 99%. But markets are cyclical, and some signs are beginning to point to the end of a bearish phase in crypto and the possibility of a new bull trend blossoming. Top analysts are starting to wake up and take notice, and are now calling for a bottom and a cyclical low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Touches $20,000 For First Time Post-FTX Collapse Reaching above $21,000 has put BTCUSD above pre-FTX crash levels from two months prior. More importantly, the three-month period has resulted in a three-candlestick reversal pattern called a morning star. The morning star reversal pattern is a bullish Japanese candlestick reversal pattern, than when confirmed should result in three to five months worth of follow-through. A substantial shift from bearish to bullish would return Bitcoin to its previously bullish state. A morning star reversal pattern has formed | BTCUSD on TradingView.com What A Morning Star Reversal Could Mean For Crypto According to Investopedia, “a morning star is a visual pattern made up of a tall black candlestick,” a black or white doji, “and a third tall white candlestick.” “The middle candle of the morning star captures a moment of market indecision where the bears begin to give way to bulls. The third candle confirms the reversal and can mark a new uptrend,” an excerpt reads. Related Reading: “Parabolic” Signal That Triggered Past Bitcoin Bull Runs Reappears Analysts and traders should look toward technical indicators to confirm the signal. For example, the Fisher Transform is crossing bullish from extreme negative deviations, and could help provide confirmation of extended upside to follow. Is this confirmation of a new bull trend? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Historically, the Fisher Transform turning up combined with a 20% monthly bullish candle was enough to end each bear market in the past. The most direct comparison, took place in 2015, when another morning star reversal pattern helped trigger a new bull trend. In that instance, BTCUSD went on to climb by 6,000% in 24 months — after the signal appeared. Confirmation requires this month’s candle to engulf at least 50% of the black, November down candle. The more this month engulfs the November candle, the stronger the signal. Currently, the entire candle has been engulfed.

Joining CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” live from the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos 2023, Gordon said crypto has the potential to reach mainstream adoption, but that’ll depend on regulation that can then “generate confidence for retailers.”  “2023 for us could be a real inflection point in policy and a regulatory framework could be one of those things that helps to accelerate the accelerator side of the crypto downturn,” Gordon said.  Crypto adoption more broadly has been bogged down by the fall of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, which Gordon said has led some policymakers to feel “reticence to engage.”  One thing that is clear, Gordon said, is that the fall of the FTX crypto exchange “put crypto on all policymaker’s radar.” He predicted that primarily guardrails could be set by the G20.

Those efforts come as Coinbase looks to manage a 20% headcount reduction and a $100 million settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  With “recession fears and a softer landing coming to the fore,” it may finally be time for crypto to be recognized by the policymakers, he said.

From its all-time high of 9.1% in 2022 down to 6.5% in December of that year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a dramatic decline in the consumer price index (CPI) for the United States. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has been hiking interest rates to bring down inflation. This data suggest their efforts are working, and the market is feeling more optimistic as the chances of a monetary policy pivot are increasing, according to their expectations. According to additional data, MANA is one of the most popular “metaverse” platforms, with roughly 8,000 unique daily users. Improvements to avatars, profiles, and friend requests have recently been released for Decentraland users. It works toward making the platform more user-friendly. However, it was a time-consuming process before the platform started to recover. These essential factors have led to the price increase and burst in investor interest.

7646295,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516273,1673895647,Crypto.com Decides To Let Go 20% Of Its Current Workforce,"The crypto industry continues to stagger under a massive wave of layoffs that have been occurring in recent times. Among the recent companies from the sector, Crypto.com has planned on axing 20% of its workforce. The Singapore-based company, Crypto.com, has confirmed its decision via a blog post. According to Co-Founder and CEO Kris Marszalek, the platform must let go of 20% of its current employees. Related Reading: What Matters In Crypto This Week: Will Bitcoin Keep Pumping? Crypto.com has faced significant criticism after attempting to reassure investors that the crypto exchange is in good financial health and has nothing to worry about. The reason for the layoffs is the current economic headwinds and industry situation. This will be the second major layoff carried out by the company. Crypto.com laid off nearly 260 employees in 2022, accounting for nearly 5% of its workforce. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek stated: We grew ambitiously at the start of 2022, building on our incredible momentum and aligning with the trajectory of the broader industry. That trajectory changed rapidly with a confluence of negative economic developments. The exchange platform has not specifically mentioned the positions that were laid off. The decision to fire employees has been attributed to broader market weakness and the FTX crash. The crash caused a misappropriation of customer funds and eventually bankruptcy, which has gone on to affect the industry considerably. Crypto.com Says That It Continues To Perform Well Kriz Marszalek had initially mentioned that the exchange platform maintained adequate reserves for every single coin which the platform held. Two months after that statement, the exchange could not withstand the collapse of FTX without adopting measures to cut costs. Marszalek quoted: Today we made the difficult decision to reduce our global workforce by approximately 20 per cent. All impacted personnel have already been notified. These reductions were in no way related to performance, and we extend our deepest gratitude for all their contributions to Crypto.com. He additionally stated: Several factors played into our decision to reduce headcount. While we continue to perform well, growing to more than 70 million users worldwide and maintaining a strong balance sheet, we’ve had to navigate ongoing economic headwinds and unforeseeable industry events. Crypto.com Admits To Not Navigating Well After FTX Crash The Founder of Crypto.com has mentioned that even though Crypto.com was doing well, there has been a change in trajectory with a ‘confluence’ of negative economic developments. He spoke about the layoffs in July last year as the exchange could not navigate the macroeconomic downturn. It also could not gauge the damage the FTX collapse would have caused to the industry. Related Reading: Polkadot: Why Recent On-Chain Feats Could Trigger Strong Investor Sentiment The fall of FTX has been terrible for investors’ sentiments. The exchange now wants to focus on making prudent financial decisions to manage the company better, and layoffs are among such necessary measures. The exchange states that these additional reductions were mandatory to ensure that the company’s position remains profitable in the long term. At the moment, Crypto.com has 2,450 employees, and a 20 percent layoff from that population will mean that close to 490 employees lose their jobs.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Bradesco, Brazil's second-largest private bank, launched its first tokenized bank credit note on Friday.  The bank completed the transaction for a total of 10 million Brazilian reals – equivalent to $1.95 million – under a regulatory sandbox run by the Central Bank of Brazil, the company said in a statement, adding that it was the first financial market tokenization operation regulated by that monetary authority.  Other banks have also recently embarked on the Brazilian tokenization market. In December, also as part of the Brazilian Central Bank's sandbox, Santander issued 40 million Brazilian reals (US$7.8 million) in tokenized bonds to Indigo, a parking management company.  In July 2022, Itaú Unibanco, Brazil's largest private bank, announced the launch of its own tokenization platform, Itaú Digital Assets. In addition to tokenization, the firm also provides crypto custody and token as a service (TaaS) products.  This article was translated by Andrés Engler and edited by CoinDesk.

42413095,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7pFY,1673892726,A Large Crypto Market Maker Is Already Distancing Itself From New 3AC Venture,"Wintermute, the large crypto market maker, was quick to distance itself from a new fundraise by the co-founders of bankrupt hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), echoing similar sentiments from the community.  The co-founders of Three Arrows Capital, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies partnered with Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam, co-founders of crypto exchange CoinFlex – which is going through a restructuring process – to raise $25 million for a new exchange called GTX, according to a pitch deck seen by CoinDesk.  GTX said it plans is to create an exchange where users can trade crypto, stocks and debt claims on bankrupt companies like FTX. The founders sees a ""clear market need"" to unlock $20 billion of crypto claims, which GTX said it could ""dominate"" within two to three months, according to the presentation.  However, CoinFlex clarified in a blog that the new raise is part of its own potential rebranding strategy and the current name, GTX, is only serving as a placeholder for now. ""Any new funds raised will be used for operational growth, which we strongly believe will increase value for CoinFLEX creditors,"" the company said in the blog post.  ""This avenue will not only be an opportunity to serve a large number of existing crypto creditors but, in doing so, will also bring new volumes to the exchange through crypto trading,"" the blog added.  Both Lamb and Arumugam will remain as the new entities' executives, with Lamb continuing as the CEO, the blog post said, noting that it may add more key members to management to build and grow the company.  The crypto community was quick to convey their skepticism, with Wintermute's CEO being one of the prominent voices. ""If you are investing into coinflex/3ac 'exchange' you might find it a bit more difficult to work with Wintermute in future (on the relationship building side),"" the market maker's CEO Evgeny Gaevoy said in a tweet on Monday.  He also made it clear that his firm will not be investing in any projects, that includes 3AC's co-founders. ""Similarly, we are not going to be participating in venture rounds where these guys are about to enter the cap table, so founders beware,"" Gaevoy noted in another tweet.  A crypto market maker is essentially a trading firm that use their own capital to make bets on tokens and take the other side of trades on exchanges when other players are trying to get in or out quickly. A large market maker, such as Wintermute, which trades over $5 billions a day, distancing itself from GTX is likely to resonate with potential backers against investing in the new firm.  Read more: Crypto Trading Firm Wintermute Given Seat on Key FTX Creditor Committee  The Singapore-based hedge fund crypto hedge fund went bust in 2022, after being unable to pay off its creditors due to a wave of unforeseen liquidations, Three Arrows filed for bankruptcy protection in July. At the time, the hedge fund was $3.5 billion in debt.  The hedge fund's co-founders were largely silent for months after the liquidation started, but resurfaced in the public eye after crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy in November.  The new company is aiming to ""lead the global progression towards greater financial transparency, liquidity and certainty"" by initially soliciting claimants in the bankruptcies that have shaken crypto to trade their claims on GTX. These bankruptcies include BlockFi, which had lent money to 3AC and itself later went bankrupt, Celsius Network and FTX, according to the pitch deck.  The presentation doesn't specify if the users will also be able to trade 3AC claims. However, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing Zhu, that some 3AC creditors would have the option to convert their claims into equity in the new claim-trading company.  GTX is planning to charge 0.25%-0.50% in fees and estimates time to market is ""ASAP by end of February."" Once the claims trading has drawn people in, GTX said it will ""fill the power vacuum left by FTX"" by allowing its users to trade crypto, and eventually stocks, the pitch deck said.  The cynicism about the new venture reverberated throughout the crypto community, including Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund. ""Disgraced fraudsters teaming up with other disgraced fraudsters to trade claims from a collapsed fraudulent exchange sounds backable,"" Carter said in a tweet.

7644433,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516209,1673892005,"Will New Interchain Station Wallet Launch Spike LUNC Price, Any Possibility?","After the collapse of the popular blockchain network Terra, developers have been trying to revive it; many reforms have already taken place to sustain the Terra Classic (LUNC and prevent further collapse). Terra Classic, the original blockchain, was forked to create Terra (LUNA). Among these reforms is a recent integration with Interchain Station. The news boosted the Terra Classic (LUNC) price. According to Jared, lead developer at Terraform Labs, more integrations and reforms are coming to Terra soon. The sudden crash of Terra LUNA sent a cascade effect across the crypto industry, leading several firms to bankruptcy. Many investors are yet to recover from the loss incurred from the Terra implosion. There are still uncleared controversies surrounding the ecosystem’s sudden collapse. Some say Terra LUNA was a rug pull scheme by Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs, to launder and steal people’s money. Meanwhile, Do Kwon and his executives are still on the run from South Korean prosecutors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Hit 14-Month High – What Could This Mean For The Market Leader? More Integrations Coming To Terra Classic Network In a Twitter announcement, Jared revealed that the Terra Network would partner with other blockchains, including SEI, Juno, Osmosis, Mars, Pisco, and many more. He said the integrations aim to protect the network in the right direction and allow seamless cross-chain communication between Terra and other blockchains. Jared also told the Terra community to expect a rollout of more features while their main focus is to launch the wallet on mobile devices. The current station supports many mainnets including LUNC, LUNA, Osmosis, Juno, Kujira, Carbon, HuaHua, and Cresent. Terra’s interchain station wallet would simplify the complex process of interacting with multiple blockchain networks. The wallet would allow users to stake, vote, send, receive tokens, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) across supported chains. LUNC price soared by 3% on January 10 when Jared first shared news of the interchain wallet feature via his Twitter handle. Jared referred to the development as a breakthrough in chain integrations. This move comes after several attempts by the Terra Classic community to revive the sinking Terra Classic project. With the new station wallet, DeFi developers can now access oracle data from several chains through the interchain facility. Why New Governance Implementation Is Important To LUNC Community The Terra Classic blockchain saw a rough start in 2023 after being impacted by crypto exchange KuCoin’s December 30 move. On December 30, 2022, KuCoin removed (undelegated) 48 billion Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens from circulation. This issue reduced the voting power of KuCoin’s Terra Classic Validator by 0.25%, taking it up to the 44th position. The exchange later said it would continue pledging LUNC tokens after a 14-day lock period. However, the move caused a drastic reduction in on-chain activity and stirred much anxiety in the LUNC community, causing the price to fall. After Kucoin’s move, the community responded by approving and implementing new governance proposals to improve the overall operation of the chain. The Terra ecosystem also started burning tokens to stir up on-chain activity. The new governance proposals got overwhelming votes from the community with the support of major crypto exchanges. As a result, one of the new implementations is governance proposal 11242, which aims to stop the reminting of already destroyed LUNC tokens. Once the implementation is complete, it will ensure the effective elimination of tokens from LUNC’s circulating supply which will also boost its price. Presently, the amount of Terra Classic tokens in circulation is nearly 6 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Disciples: Only 43.5 Million Own The Crypto Globally, Study Shows After the reduction in on-chain activity in the past month, the developers published proposal 11242 at the beginning of January.

7644324,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516242,1673888585,Ethereum Hits Monthly High And Turns Deflationary Again,"The Ethereum price rally is on an upward trajectory since the last fortnight. Performing a little over Bitcoin’s growth, Ethereum gained 30%. On the morning of 16th January, Ethereum woke up to exciting news as Ethereum is riding high on the $1600 market price. This comes after several contributory factors play a role in the price increase. From the accumulation of assets, particularly by Shark Addresses, it crossed above $1400 for the first time since 7th November on 12th January. Related Reading: ETH Whales Scoop Up SAND – Up Nearly 80% – For Its Highly Bought Crypto Menu Shark Addresses are also the highest in this period, with Santiment observing 3000 new Shark Addresses, taking the total tally to the highest since February 2021. Ethereum Bullish Momentum Before The Shanghai Upgrade Ethereum is two months away from the Shanghai Upgrade, and the prices have surged to the highest in ten weeks. After this upgrade, Ethereum will implement EIP Proposal 4895, enabling consensus layer withdrawals. Following the Shanghai Upgrade, the users can withdraw staked ETH tokens on the Beacon chain for over 2 years. This upgrade is going to streamline the ETH withdrawal and will improve the exit process. This upgrade is going to benefit ETH liquid staking platforms. Simply put, liquid staking is locking up funds to generate rewards. However, in this, the users can still access their locked funds. Given the fact that with the upgrade, the users can withdraw their staked amounts, subject to the correct exit process, which will be an attractive factor. Lido is one of the platforms allowing liquid staking, and its performance is great. The amount of ETH staked on Lido crosses a cumulative value of $22.5 billion. Crypto experts believe that after the new upgrade, ETH will be staked to leverage better yield opportunities. More Ethereum Is Burning Than Produced Ethereum’s performance in 2022 was not good. However, come 2023, the ETH holders are in a celebratory mood as the coin’s price increases amidst a deflationary trend. As the on-chain fundamentals strengthen ETH issue goes into a deflationary mood as the current supply growth reduces by -0.10%, according to the latest trends by Ultrasound Money. According to the same source, 732,000 ETH was burned, and 622,000 ETH was issued. The overall trend in the market is still bearish, but seeing the current upward trend in ETH and its price increase, the market is expected to take a bullish turn. Moreover, with the gas price increase, the burn rate will increase further. Consequently, the higher deflation rate will lead to a shrinking supply. As compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum has a higher value settlement. This is an interesting trend for the future as ETH holders stand to gain more than BTC holders in the future when the contracts mature.

CeFi helping to keep DeFi #SAFU! 🙏 — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) January 16, 2023 The Group had been keeping its money in Tornado Cash, a service that helps keep people’s identities secret and is used by criminals to launder money in the crypto industry. The experts followed the funds through more than three hundred addresses. They concluded that Railgun had spread around 41,000 ETH among multiple receivers before the cryptocurrencies were deposited at various exchanges. He did not name the exchanges, but he did say that the Lazarus Group routinely makes rapid withdrawals from such platforms. Connections Between Lazarus And Harmony’s Attack Lazarus is now quite skilled at hiding their movements from law enforcement agencies while transferring illegal cryptocurrencies. For example, they were suspected of being behind the attack on Harmony Bridge in June 2022. In-depth information about the attack was published by Elliptic, a blockchain analytics service, at the time it occurred. Multiple large crypto heists, totaling over $2 billion, have been linked to the Lazarus Group. DeFi and cross-chain bridges became a new target in 2022, and the group was also suspected of being behind the $600 million Ronin Bridge attack. According to a recent report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, another North Korean hacker group BlueNoroff has expanded its illegal activities by posing as venture capitalists looking to invest in cryptocurrency startups. Kaspersky’s report shows the global attacks by BlueNoroff against cryptocurrency businesses were uncovered in January 2022 but slowed down until the fall. Theft of cryptocurrency has become a profitable business for North Korean hackers. According to information about their operations, South Korean spying services estimate that over $1.2 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen from the global community since 2017. In 2022, numerous companies, including FTX, were victims of cyberattacks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $20,800, up 21% in the last week. It is currently trading above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which indicates that the price will remain bullish in the short term.

7640691,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516199,1673884819,What Matters In Crypto This Week: Will Bitcoin Keep Pumping?,"Even though the next FOMC meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve is still more than two weeks away, there are significant macroeconomic as well as crypto and Bitcoin-intrinsic events this week that investors should keep an eye on. As in previous weeks and months, it is very likely that the macro environments will steer the sentiment in the crypto market. After the December 2022 CPI was released last Thursday at 6.5%, the crypto market turned strongly bullish. Bitcoin rallied more than 18% after the publication and stopped just short of the $21,450 level. The entire crypto is about to recapture the $1 trillion dollar market cap in the wake of this recovery. What Marcoevents Will Guide Bitcoin This Week? This week, China will announce the economic data for 2022, which probably won’t have that big of an impact unless there is a big surprise that affects the U.S. dollar. Still, it’s worth keeping an eye on China this Monday when the GDP growth rate year-over-year (YoY) is announced at 9:00 pm EST. Also, the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) interest rate decision could only become relevant if there is a surprise like last time. On Tuesday at 10:00 pm EST, the BoJ will announce its interest rate decision. The expectation here is that it will leave interest rates unchanged. When the Japanese central bank surprisingly decided to raise the benchmark interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5% on December 20, BTC experienced a green daily candle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Trigger Buy Signal, Has Miner Capitulation Concluded? In the U.S., the Producer Price Index (PPI) is likely to be the most important data point this week. Even though the PPI hasn’t had much of an impact on the overall financial market and Bitcoin in particular lately, the PPI could reaffirm bullish sentiment on rising inflation or provide a damper. The PPI data for December 2022 will be released on Wednesday, January 18 at 8:30 am EST. Watch Out For The DXY Perhaps the most important indicator at the moment of whether Bitcoin and crypto will continue to rally is the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the DXY has been particularly high in recent weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Accelerates Higher as The Bulls Aim $1,720 The latest Bitcoin rally was fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar. However, the DXY has fallen into a historically important support zone. If the DXY experiences a bounce out of the support zone, it is likely that BTC will experience a retracement – which would be healthy given its current oversold state with an RSI of 89 on the daily chart. Should the DXY fall below 101, the doors would be wide open for a sustained Bitcoin rally. In this respect, the macroeconomic situation probably remains the all-determining factor for the BTC price, provided there is no crypto-instinct catastrophic news. First and foremost, Digital Currency Group (DCG), Grayscale, and Gemini remain in the spotlight with their unresolved conflict over Gemini Earn client funds at Genesis Trading, which could derail a rally even if the DXY continues to fall. At press time, the BTC price stood at $20,861.

This has been the price action since the token has been rejected on the $6.5 price resistance range.

To start staking now 👇 — Polkadot (@Polkadot) January 13, 2023 The network also reached an achievement in the staking department. Nomination pools recently reached 1 million DOT bonded by pool members. Staking on-chain was made easier because of the ecosystem’s nomination pool system which allows users to stake a minimum of 1 DOT. With users on the platform having easy access to staking, DOT is expected to continue its momentous climb. How Will Polkadot React? The rejection at $6.5 is the only thing delaying the token’s climb to recover lost ground after FTX collapsed. If the token continues its current downward momentum, the bears will have an opportunity to test the $5.5 support in the next few days. However, if the token can reverse its momentum, a retest and a possible breakthrough on $6.5 price resistance level would enable DOT to regain lost momentum from last year’s FTX crisis. With the token riding the altcoin rally, DOT’s high correlation with Bitcoin would benefit it if BTC continues to break through crucial resistances.

Investors and traders should be cautious of the token’s overbought position which could strengthen its downward pacing.

Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has continued its price upswing as its breaks above its 200-day moving average. In addition, the market generally has recovered, as crypto enthusiasts believe the crypto winter is close to its end. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report has given Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency leverage. The consumer price index is an important metric that measures the monthly changes in prices paid by United State consumers. The CPI values also measure economic inflation and deflation using statistics from customer expenditures. Events over time have shown that macroeconomic factors such as inflation and deflation affect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. So when the CPI is high, it means that inflation is also high leading to a spike in interest rates that plummet crypto prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Hit 14-Month High – What Could This Mean For The Market Leader? So, with this new data, a Bitcoin rally is now possible as other altcoins, such as Ethereum, recorded improved figures. Whales Pushing Bitcoin Rally On Saturday, January 14, Bitcoin’s price surpassed the $21,000 level on the back of declining inflation figures. BTC gained 7.5% on that day and peaked at $21,299. Santiment, an analytic platform, states that the number of Bitcoin addresses holding between 100-1000 BTC is increasing rapidly, probably pushing BTC. Santiment also revealed that more than 416 addresses hold 100-1000 BTC. It is an increase of 3.04% in eight weeks. The whales’ influence in the market is critical as they control prices due to the size of their portfolios. In addition, the price increases caused by the whales have a wider-reaching effect on other cryptocurrencies in the market. Bitcoin Price Prediction, A Possible Bull Run? Glassnode data shows that Bitcoin is currently correlating with its previous market cycles. For example, after the 2018-2019 bear market, BTC traded under its 200-day Moving Average (DMA) for 386 days. Similarly, the BTC price traded under its 200 DMA in this bear market for 381 days till it broke above it. Since the turn of the year, BTC has recorded gains for twelve consecutive days. Santiment reports that it recorded these gains over the last eight weeks. Bitcoin short-term traders recorded their most profitable spending day on January 14 since April 2022. According to Glassnode, the BTC trading volume has increased in the past months. At the time of writing, BTC trades at 20,788. The support levels are $20,207, $20,392, and $20,624. Also, the resistance levels are $21,042, $21,227, and $21,459. It is currently trading above its 50-day SMA, which indicates that the price will remain bullish in the short term. Also, BTC is trading above its 200-day SMA, which shows a long-term price increase. The candle stick patterns on the chart are ascending, showing that the bulls are in control of the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading is firmly in the overbought zone reading, 86.53. Since the BTC whales are active, the RSI indicates a significant rise in buying pressure. The Moving Average Convergence/ Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line and showing divergence. It also indicates that BTC is worth buying since it will continue its ascent. BTC’s long-term and short-term outlooks are optimistic as the crypto market rallies.

7637732,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516197,1673879413,Glassnode Points Out This Bizarre Consistency In Bitcoin Cycles,"Glassnode has pointed out a bizarre consistency between the current and previous Bitcoin cycles in terms of a metric, here’s what. Bitcoin Breaks Above 200-Day Simple Moving Average Line A “simple moving average” (SMA) is an analytical tool that produces an average of any given quantity over a specific period of time. As its name already implies, it moves along with the quantity and changes its value accordingly. SMAs can be quite useful for studying long-term trends, as they smooth out the curve and filter out any short-term fluctuations in the relevant quantity that have no bearing on the longer trends anyways. As is usually the case with tools like these, an SMA can be taken for any length of time, but a few periods like 7 days and 30 days generally find the most use. According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, BTC has spent 381 days under its 200-day SMA curve in this cycle. The 200-day SMA is an important line for BTC as both the bear-to-bull and vice versa transitions have historically taken place with breaks above or below this level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Signs Of Dumping, Bad For Rally? Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 200-day SMA for Bitcoin over the last few years: The value of the crypto seems to have broken above the 200-day SMA in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin price had dipped below the 200-day SMA around the start of the bear market and had stayed there until very recently. In total, the crypto had spent 381 days below this level, before the latest rally came along and helped the coin finally escape above this line. In the chart, Glassnode has also highlighted the trend for the metric during the previous bear market. It looks like in that cycle as well, the crypto’s price had declined below the 200-day SMA as the bear began to take hold. Also, the eventual break above the level leads to the end of the bear market for the coin back then. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Increase as The Crypto Bulls Take Control However, the most interesting of all is the duration that Bitcoin stayed below this level in that cycle: 386 days. Amazingly, this is very nearly the same number of days (381) that BTC took to break above the line in the current cycle. If this bizarre consistency is anything to go by, then the latest push above the 200-day SMA could mean the current bear market might be done as well. The chart also shows data for an indicator called the “Mayer Multiple” (MM) which gauges the current distance between the price of Bitcoin and the 200-day SMA. Its value is simply calculated by dividing the value of the crypto by the 200-day SMA. Bottoms in the crypto have usually taken place below the 0.8 MM level, which BTC is now firmly above.

We highlight the factors driving the rally and why we expect it to continue. Despite the crypto sector scandals last year, Bitcoin is well-positioned to emerge stronger following a reset of expectations. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is trading back above the $20k level, up more than 30% from its cycle low as an impressive start to 2023. Even as BTC is still down nearly 70% from its all-time high, there is a sense that this latest rally is more than just a ""bounce"" considering the technical setup in the context of recent developments. Following a year defined by extreme volatility including the high-profile crypto sector scandals, Bitcoin stands out as a survivor of the ""crypto winter"", positioned to emerge stronger. The way we see it, the long-term bullish case for Bitcoin is as strong as ever with the added benefit of new macro tailwinds. We're bullish on BTC and expect more upside going forward. Why Is Bitcoin Rallying? Several factors help explain the newfound momentum in Bitcoin. First, we can bring up the improved market sentiment across most asset classes reflected in the strong rally in stocks over the last two weeks. From an environment of extreme pessimism at the end of December, the pendulum has sort of swung with the market assessing the most recent economic data. Solid December payrolls report, along with an encouraging inflation update showing the CPI declined on a monthly basis, has helped ease concerns over the most pessimistic scenarios. The setup is particularly positive for some of the worst-performing market segments in 2022, including the speculative side of next-generation technology and crypto. For all the things Bitcoin is and can be, it still represents a segment of high-beta tech through its connection to blockchain applications. A rebound from that side helps explains part of the current strength. Data by YCharts Separately, those signs inflationary pressures are easing have opened the door for interest rates to stabilize, working to drive a sharp reversal of the U.S. Dollar lower as a global theme. In this case, Bitcoin as a digital asset an alternative to fiat is rallying now by capturing similar high-level trends as foreign currencies, and commodities like gold ( GLD ). The point here is to say that the rally in Bitcoin isn't so much based on a single factor or headline but through a combination of several macro themes and market fundamentals. Still, we think there is a bigger story at play than BTC simply riding the tide in risk assets higher. Crypto sector-specific developments are also adding to the momentum. Finviz The Gold Standard of Cryptocurrencies If there was ever a time for the long-running calls among crypto skeptics for Bitcoin to crash and burn to zero, 2022 would have been it, but here it is standing firm. One of the biggest stories last year was the apparent overnight collapse of ""FTX"", once among the largest crypto exchanges in the world. The case we made in an article at the time was that the bankruptcy would ultimately prove to be positive for Bitcoin as it could mark a capitulation of the 2022 crypto sell-off and a final reset compared to the exuberance that got ahead of itself at the highs. That prediction is starting to look good now. In our view, the FTX fallout may have helped Bitcoin consolidate its place as the ""gold standard"" of crypto, with the real losers being the category of smaller crypto-alts and tokens which played a central role in the demise of 2022 crypto casualties including FTX and other examples like the case with ""Celsius Network"". We sense that efforts at new regulation being discussed by governments looking for tighter control of the crypto market will be directed towards that side of centralized exchanges and private coin offerings, which are a source of system vulnerabilities. There was a time in 2021 when any crypto-related startup could get away it just a flashy name. The difference now is that investors will be much more skeptical to jump on those types of ideas. That leaves Bitcoin as the first and largest cryptocurrency where its decentralized public protocol is bigger than any single celebrity character and has proven to be secure . By this measure, Bitcoin simply got caught up in the scandal headlines while not directly connected. To be clear, we still see a place for various other cryptocurrencies including the established majors like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), but the bigger takeaway is that the case for BTC gets reinforced. A growing understanding of its importance as a store of value and alternative asset bodes well for its continued demand as a form of money and payments, beyond the scarcity value assigned by both small and large investors. The upside potential in the long-term bullish case for BTC has only grown over the past year. Fast-forward, it's encouraging that more than two months since the FTX collapse, we haven't seen a wider financial contagion event taking place within crypto. In our opinion, the relative stability in the price of Bitcoin in the period since, reinforced by the current rally suggests the worst is over and that the market bottom is in. We can also bring up the reports suggesting the FTX bankruptcy proceedings are moving forward, with more than $5 billion in assets recovered, as a positive step in restoring confidence. BTC Price Forecast Through a reset of expectations and the total BTC supply consolidated among a smaller group of committed long-term ""HODLers"", we believe this rally has room to run. A bullish call for BTC from here will need the macro picture and broader risk sentiment to remain positive, which reflects our overall optimism going forward. Looking at the chart, it's encouraging to see BTC back above $20k and also climbing beyond the long-running downward trendline that had been in place through all of 2022. It's a break-out higher in our book, and we see the momentum building as more traders and investors come on board. At the same time, it's important to recognize there are key areas of technical resistance approaching. Ideally, we want to see BTC trend over $25k, which would signal a more significant shift in positive momentum, returning the market to levels from the first half of last year. To the upside, $30k would be the next major target as our initial year-end 2023 forecast. CoinMarketCap The other side of the discussion considers the ongoing risks. Even with a bullish outlook, it's not going to be a straight line higher. It's important to remember that BTC and ""crypto"" remain speculative, which translates directly into recurring volatility. On the downside, holding $19k will be important for the bulls to maintain control, while a break lower would force a reassessment on our part. The possibility of a deterioration of the macro outlook, including the possibility of a sharply stronger dollar would also be bearish trends toward BTC. We mentioned the ongoing discussions by governments globally to add regulations to the sector or even an outright ban. These sorts of headlines have the potential to undermine the bullish case and should be monitored.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570180-bitcoin-btc-rally-more-than-just-a-bounce-get-bullish?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7636726.jpeg

Bitcoin Miners’ Position Index Has Shot Up Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, miners may be putting selling pressure on the market currently. The relevant indicator here is the “Miners’ Position Index” (MPI), which measures the ratio between the miner outflows and the 365-day moving average of the same. The “miner outflows” refer to the total amount of Bitcoin that all these chain validators are transferring out of their wallets at the moment. Usually, miners withdraw coins from their reserves with the main purpose of selling them. Thus, a high value of the outflows can suggest that this cohort is dumping large amounts right now. As the MPI compares these outflows with their yearly average, the metric’s value can tell us how the current miner selling is compared with the mean for the last 365 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Hit 14-Month High – What Could This Mean For The Market Leader? When this indicator has a high value, it means miners are selling at a higher degree than usual currently, while the metric having a low value could suggest there is lesser selling pressure coming from these chain validators than the average for the past year. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MPI over the past year and a half: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin MPI has spiked up recently and has hit a value of about 4, the highest level that the indicator has observed since April of last year. The metric having such a large value would suggest miners are taking out way more coins than usual, and are therefore potentially putting extraordinary selling pressure on the market currently. From the chart, it’s apparent that spikes in the metric have usually been followed by declines in the price of the crypto. The most extreme example was back in April 2022, when the price saw a very sharp drawdown not too long after the metric recorded even higher values than now. The last time the indicator observed high values were back during the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX when the price once again saw a rapid downward move. Bitcoin has been busy rallying during the past week or so, touching as high as $21,000 so far, so these increased withdrawals right now would suggest miners want to take advantage of this profit-taking opportunity while they still can, and dump their coins.

The feature, called Binance Mirror, could be a major blessing for crypto investors trading in the leveraged markets as most crypto traders have to keep their collateral on the exchange for trading. However, using cold storage wallets means users can continue to trade crypto during volatile sessions without massive outflows on an exchange.  Users' assets would also be protected against on-chain hacks, to which hot wallets are vulnerable.

Its native token SAND is now going down the net of ETH whales as the altcoin rally continues into its third week. According to CoinGecko, the token has gone up by 76% in the past two weeks. ETH whales are also adding fuel to this fire, accumulating SAND and including the crypto on its top 10 tokens bought in the past 24 hours. Along with the recent release of Game Maker 0.8, The Sandbox ecosystem is expected to continue to be a dominant player in the GameFi space.

Looking at the charts, the token is up almost 80% in the past two weeks. This in turn made the token test the $0.7540 price resistance level. On top of the whale buying spree, the release of Game Maker 0.8 certainly has an effect on the token. According to the development team’s Medium post, this upgrade brought features that were requested by the community in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Disciples: Only 43.5 Million Own The Crypto Globally, Study Shows Image: BitIRA New multiplayer gameplay features, new lighting and post-processing effects, and the addition of audio and video streaming on the platform will certainly bring more attention to the platform and the GameFi space. With gaming companies noticing the power of Web3 development, platforms like The Sandbox will continue to rise in popularity. Is SAND Standing On Solid Ground? As the time of writing, the token is changing hands at $0.7044. With crucial support at $0.5015, this may be enough for SAND to sustain higher highs and higher lows. ETH whales should be careful, however, as a break below the $0.6327 support would delay a possible break above $0.7540. Bitcoin’s current strong momentum is being reflected by the token in the short to medium term as well. This means that if ever BTC – the world’s biggest crypto asset in terms of market cap – continues its momentous climb to breach the $21,500 resistance, SAND would see gains above $0.8626 which would wipe the losses that occurred when crypto exchange FTX collapsed. Related Reading: BONK Tumbles 66% – Can The ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Live Up To Its Name? A breakthrough like this would trigger a bigger rally. However, if the rally is met with resistance, investors and traders should consolidate above $0.6327 to support further bullish movement in the coming days and weeks. Improvements in the macroeconomic situation should also help SAND’s price to secure crucial consolidation levels. With inflation seemingly going down, the ecosystem and SAND would benefit from its high correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum. -Featured image: Screen Rant",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SAND,BTC | ETH | ICO | SAND | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/all/eth-whales-buy-sand/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Over 350 addresses linked to the attackers have been compiled in a list by ZachXBT.  The Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking group believed to be supported by the regime of dictator Kim Jung Un, is likely behind last year’s hack of Harmony Bridge, according to analysis by blockchain research firm Elliptic, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  The attack drained the service, which enables crypto assets to be traded between the Harmony blockchain and other blockchains, of $100 million worth of crypto, including ether (ETH), tether (USDT) and wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) on the morning of June 24.  The Harmony Bridge hack is consistent with other hacks attributed to the Lazarus Group, including the $635 million Ronin Bridge hack in March, which is so far the largest hack in the history of decentralized finance (DeFi).

The broker expects total crypto revenue to grow by sixteen fold in the next 10 years, from around $25 billion in 2023 to about $400 billion by 2033.  Of the estimated $400 billion revenue pool, Bernstein says that “decentralized blockchain-driven revenue” will account for nearly half of the total revenue pool from only 15% today.  Bernstein expects on-chain revenue to inflect from less than around $4 billion today to close to almost $200 billion in the next ten years, driven by “innovation in blockchain scalability and application growth across financial services and consumer tech segments.”  Consumer and finance applications are expected to account for about 75% of on-chain revenue from around 40% last year, the report said.  Within on-chain financial applications, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and structured/tokenized products are expected to be the lead revenue drivers, the report added.  Non-fungible-token (NFT) based gaming revenue is predicted to be the largest driver of growth within on-chain consumer applications, and for off-chain revenue, Bernstein expects institutional services - including prime broking, custody and market making - to be a growth driver.

7630897,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516160,1673866833,"Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Trigger Buy Signal, Has Miner Capitulation Concluded?","The collapse of FTX triggered a historic event for the Bitcoin market. In late November, the hash ribbons indicator signaled the beginning of a second wave of Bitcoin miner capitulation within one cycle. As NewsBTC reported, the hash rate dropped dramatically while some of the largest miners reported bankruptcy and dumped their BTC holdings on the market. However, this poor state of the Bitcoin mining industry and the associated pressure on the Bitcoin price may have come to an end. As the net position change of miners already indicated since the beginning of January, the selling pressure has decreased significantly. For the first time in over four months, miners had been hodling BTC instead of dumping the majority of their coins. The termination of the strong selling pressure from Bitcoin miners is now also confirmed by the hash ribbon indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Increase as The Crypto Bulls Take Control As the chart below shows, the hash bands are displaying a bullish cross. “Miners have stopped selling and are now plugging in machines at a sufficient rate to declare this period of miner capitulation over,” stated Will Clemente from Reflexivity Research. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? The hash ribbon is a market indicator that assumes BTC tends to hit a bottom when miners capitulate. Currently, the hash ribbons indicate that the worst of the miner capitulation is over as the 30-day MA of the hash rate crossed over the 60d MA. In other words: When the hash ribbons indicate a cross, it signifies a paradigm shift. This is historically an extremely good buying opportunity. As Charles Edwards once said, it may be the strongest buy signal of all. Why? Because the hash rate is a leading indicator for identifying capitulation to mining difficulty. Since the mining difficulty, unlike the hash rate, is not adjusted daily, but only every 2,016 blocks, the difficulty lags behind the hash rate by as much as two weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Hit 14-Month High – What Could This Mean For The Market Leader? Therefore, the difficulty is a somewhat lagging indicator of miner capitulation. But difficulty also shows the growing euphoria among miners. Bitcoin initiated a mining difficulty adjustment yesterday at block height 772,128. Mining difficulty climbed 10.26% to 37.59T, a record high. This also confirms the thesis that miners are increasingly plugging their miners back into the network. The hashrate of the entire network is now 269.02 EH/s, also approaching its highs again. Thus, miners are clearly signaling their bullish sentiment. The creator of the hash ribbon indicator, Charles Edwards, tweeted: Hash Ribbon buy confirmed. The signal date was the second lowest price in the last 48 days. Our December newsletter: ‘a price low typically forms during the capitulation and before we see hash rate recover. Sometimes the first candle of the miner capitulation is the price low.’ At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $21,118. On the daily chart, the RSI was at 89, indicating an overbought territory.

42414681,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDOuH,1673864086,Shiba Inu Developers Reveal First Look of Layer 2 Blockchain Shibarium,"Upcoming layer 2 network Shibarium will soon join the ever-growing fray of Ethereum-based blockchains, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, looking to solve the problems of scalability, speed and expense.  A beta testnet, or a blockchain that mimics real-world functioning, is expected to launch in the coming weeks.  Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain solutions (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1s that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. These bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load and fees.  In an introductory post on Sunday, Shiba Inu developers said Shibarium would have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications especially as the NFT sector is expected to heat up in the coming years, apart from Shibarium’s use as a cheap settlement for decentralized applications (dapps) built on the network.  The launch could contribute to strong fundamentals for shiba inu, formed in the previous bull market as a Shiba inu-themed meme coin that has since tried to position itself as a serious project with its own blockchain network and dApp ecosystem.  The move could further bolster the fundamentals of Shiba Inu’s three ecosystem tokens: shiba inu (SHIB), leash (LEASH) and bone (BONE), which together command over $5 billion in market capitalization.  Each transaction on Shibarium will burn a certain amount of SHIB tokens, but the specific amount has not been decided yet. Burns refer to the permanent deletion of tokens from the total supply.  How validators work  Shibarium’s validators will lock up BONE to run the Heimdall validator, software that provides an overview of transactions, and Bor block producer nodes, a program that allows the integration of Ethereum into other networks. Validators are entities that maintain and approve transactions on any blockchain network.  The number of validators are limited to 100 slots. Validators are also required to stake a minimum of 10,000 BONE and all rewards will be paid in BONE. “The onboarding of these Validators will be done taking into account the experience, trust, knowledge and ensuring that these validators are committed to the health and integrity of Shibarium,” developers said.  “The development team is currently evaluating potential gas fee rates for the blockchain network. The network's gas fees are expected to be lower than the current fees on the Ethereum mainnet,” they added.  Meanwhile, a forthcoming TREAT token will be launched to incentivize liquidity pools on ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange that uses SHIB, and provide users with low network fees and better rewards strategies, developers said in the post.

After the tragic fall of the exchange, everything about the exchange crashed, including its reputation. However, after a while, it seems as though a piece of the exchange is trying to stage a revival. Over the past months following the exchange’s bankruptcy incident, FTT had fallen from a ranging $25 market price to new lows of around $1. Though it may seem as if there is no hope for the token, some still find it useful as, in the past few days, traders have been seen accumulating the collapsed exchange’s crypto in an attempt to make quick gains. FTT Token Surges By Over 40% In 24 Hours Amid the refreshing green market, FTT has taken advantage of the “mini bull run” and has done more than 50% in the last 7 days. At the moment, the FTT token is still printing bullish trends. From an intraday low of $1.64, FTT has skyrocketed to higher highs during the morning hours of January 16. The sudden spike added over 150% to its value in the past 7 days. FTT is now trading at the highest level ever seen since the FTX fallout in early November. At the time of writing, the FTT token is still pumping hard, with a 24-hour high of $2.62 and a current trading price of $2.33. Related Reading: FTX Token Jumps 65% As SBF Returns Home, Can FTT Hold The Gains? A Revival Happening? Given the state of the FTT token prior to the pump and the sudden surge, the chances appear to be less of a revival but instead a manipulation by traders wanting to make a few extra bucks. When doing research, there seemed to be no significant news or reason behind the token pump except the theory of it in the process of a pump and dump scheme. Regardless of the pump, FTT is still way below its highest peak of an all-time high of $84.18 which was achieved during the good days of the exchange and amid the crypto market bull cycle in 2021. Overall, in the past month, FTT has fallen by more than 50% and even traded below $1 following the FTX crash. Furthermore, there’s yet to be any fresh news on Sam Bankman-Fried and his collapsed exchange, FTX, that could persuade a pump. So, therefore, the theory remains to be that FTT’s sudden surge is a pump-and-dump scheme that will eventually make the token probably reach new lows after the traders initiating the scheme are done. Related Reading: SEC Charges SBF Of Allegedly Conducting Fraud Schemes Meanwhile, FTT hasn’t been the only token pumping; other altcoins such as Binance coin (BNB), Fantom (FTM), and Solana (SOL) have also been seeing green over the past few days.

""This is a measure of market sentiment and flows, because it encapsulates what people are willing to pay to acquire an asymmetric payout on either the upward or downward direction of the market,"" Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange per trading volumes and open interest, said in an explainer.  Options are derivative contracts that give purchasers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predefined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while the put offers the right to sell.  Both short-term and long-term call-put skews have turned positive, the first such instance since 2021.  The demand for bullish calls tied to bitcoin picked up last week as the cryptocurrency's price topped its 200-day moving average for the first time since April. The cryptocurrency ended last week with a 21.9% gain, the biggest percentage rise since February 2021.  ""Calls [at] $18,000/$19,000 bought with the spot at $17,000 were the main trades,"" Amberdata's Gregoire Magadini wrote in the weekly newsletter published Sunday, while taking note of the positive skews.  ""The flow of options can give insight on the technical levels of support and resistance observed by market participants. In this regard, note the February purchases of $22,000/$24,000 [strike] calls at the break of $19,000,"" Magadini added.  The bullish sentiment is also evident from the renewed premium in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The front-month contract expiring on Jan. 28 gapped higher early Monday to hit a four-month high of $21,535 as the cryptocurrency's spot market price rose to $21,437, the level last seen in late October.  The positive turnaround is consistent with the recent improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop and risk revival in traditional markets. Besides, the cryptocurrency tends to gain ground in months leading up to the mining reward halving, a programmed code aimed at reducing the pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years. Bitcoin's fourth halving is due sometime in March 2024.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/16/options-flip-to-show-stronger-bitcoin-into-july,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9836a9ceecf41c51750f3ae27a12394daf64315-1422x623.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company is trying to quickly grow an Ethereum position to stake for network rewards through liquid staking products. Bit Digital has almost no debt and a strong cash position. Bit Digital ( BTBT ) is primarily a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining business based in the United States. I've previously covered Bit Digital for Seeking Alpha several months ago. At the time, the mining space was just starting to deal with issues from low BTC prices and counter party bankruptcies. In my view, this was a headwind for Bit Digital specifically because of its use of mining hosts. While the article probably read pretty harsh if you're a BTBT bull, the one positive thing that I did mention was how good the company's balance sheet was. With another quarter of performance and initiatives, we can see if things are getting better or worse for Bit Digital fundamentally. Balance Sheet & Production Bit Digital reported Q3 earnings on December 7th and disclosed $9.1 million in revenue, $2.6 million in gross profit, and a $12.9 million operating loss after administrative expenses and amortization. The good news is the company still has a strong portfolio of assets and virtually no debt: Q2-22 Q3-22 Cash and Equivalents $44.3 $32.3 Digital Assets $30.6 $33.0 Net Property and Plant $90.0 $80.7 Total Liabilities $7.0 $6.4 Source: Seeking Alpha Bit Digital's digital assets are made up of Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), USDC, and ETH derivatives. In Bit Digital's last production update , it shared a modest monthly mined figure of 130 BTC. For the quarter, the company mined approximately 427 BTC, down slightly from Q3's 429. Despite having exposure to third parties through the company's hosted mining approach, Bit Digital has been able to get through the miner margin squeeze without selling off a large portion of Bitcoin. This has not been the case broadly in the public miner space as other companies have had to fire sell Bitcoin stacks. Mining Company December BTC production BTC Treasury Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 475 12,232 Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) 161 9,086 Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) 659 6,952 HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) 214 2,348 Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 130 947 Source: company press releases, sorted by BTC Treasury Bit Digital's avoidance of risk has enabled it to claim the fifth largest public Bitcoin miner BTC treasury simply by not blowing itself up with leverage. Despite showing an ability to competently maintain a BTC position, Bit Digital might now be just as appealing for its ETH position and how the company plans to monetize it. Ethereum Staking Last month Bit Digital announced it had begun Ethereum staking through Blockdaemon's liquid staking solution Portara. Liquid staking is different from typical direct staking because it allows the staker to mint a liquid derivative token of the ETH that has been staked for further use in DeFi. ETH Liquid Staking (Dune Analytics/eliasimos) Liquid staking is a very popular way to stake on Ethereum because ETH stake withdrawals won't be enabled until the Shanghai upgrade which is likely coming in March. Because there is risk in staking an asset without a clear time expectation for withdrawal, roughly 43% of the ETH staked has been through liquid staking protocols. In my October article covering BTBT, I noted that the company would have to scale up its ETH position if it wants to generate meaningful rewards from staking: But if Bit Digital is to shift to a model where a large percentage of its revenue comes from Ethereum staking, it will likely have to ramp up the ETH in its treasury to generate a meaningful return as a new revenue segment. Bit Digital has certainly been able to do that as the company's ETH balance is now 8,799.9, up from 3,684 ETH at the end of August. So far, we know that 2,164 ETH have been staked from the company's total ETH stash as of December 20th. Though it is expected that most of the company's ETH will end up in stake whether directly or through a liquid staking application like Portara: The Company intends to continue accumulating Ethereum and stake substantially all of its ETH position over time Beyond what Bit Digital returns from an ETH reward standpoint, the company could consider putting the liquid derivatives to work as well through DeFi lending protocols. As an example, Lido Finance's ( LDO-USD ) stETH derivative token has generally returned somewhere between 4-5% APY since the completion of the merge in September: stETH APY Trend (DeFi Llama) The company could certainly try to do something similar with its own liquid staked tokens should it decide to participate in on-chain lending. Risks Liquid staking relies on asset pegs and trust in the ability to redeem. We've seen staked ETH derivative tokens trade at a discount before. As of article submission, Coinbase's ( COIN ) cbETH token trades a 1.1% discount to ETH. Bit Digital doesn't have a large debt position on the corporate balance sheet, but as the company ramps up its ETH staking footprint, it will be introducing counter party risk on the balance sheet through derivative tokens. Summary I like that the company is diversifying its business from just a Bitcoin miner to an Ethereum staker. In my view, the liquid staking approach is probably a good one for a publicly traded company because it allows BTBT to sell off the ETH derivatives should it have to in a pinch. I also think going with an institutional grade staking solution that offers slashing insurance and KYC-compliance like Blockdaemon is a responsible way to do liquid staking on Ethereum. I don't currently have any position in BTBT stock. That said, I do think the name is getting more interesting and there are probably worse ways to play a crypto equity relief rally.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | SPONSORED,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570115-bit-digital-now-an-ethereum-staking-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7620754.jpeg

42414684,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDOza,1673831011,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Surges on Inflation Tailwinds, Hovers Near $21K","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos continue to surge in weekend trading.  Insights: Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is correct in thinking that, despite market uncertainty, disruptive innovation technologies that address issues have gained traction.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,004.63 −4.3 ▼ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $20,868 −64.2 ▼ 0.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,554 +5.7 ▲ 0.4% S&P 500 daily close  3,999.09 +15.9 ▲ 0.4% Gold  $1,920 +1.9 ▲ 0.1% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.51% ▲ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Surges, Then Holds Near $21K  By James Rubin  Still riding the tailwinds of falling inflation and a more upbeat view of the economy, bitcoin cracked $21,000 in early weekend trading for the first time since early November before retreating slightly.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,830, roughly flat over the previous 24 hours but up a whopping 25% this year, most of the gains occurring since last Tuesday when BTC was still hovering near $17,400. The surge comes amid renewed investor confidence that the U.S. central bank is taming inflation without casting the economy into recession, a trend that has sent most riskier assets higher this year.  ""We see the current rally in digital assets as a market reversal and NOT a bear market rally,"" wrote Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, in an email.  In a weekly markets analysis on Friday, Connors wrote that an early January rally in altcoins, including SOL – which is up about 80% year to date – had ""rolled into core Layer 1s."" Noting recent, less hawkish comments by Fed governors, Connors added that ""the potential for a reduction in hikes and balance sheet reduction ... was a wink that the sharp reduction"" in money supply may be ending.""  ""Significant, as the reduction over the past 12 months was the largest since 1959,"" he wrote. ""This is relevant to digital assets as BTC is deemed to be a hedge against debasement, NOT inflation.""  Ether followed a similar pattern to bitcoin, continuing its late-week momentum into Saturday to hit a two-month high before falling slightly. ETH was recently changing hands above $1,550, approximately where it stood same time, a day earlier. Other major cryptos were mixed with some rising a couple of percentage points and others dropping, although FTT, the token of embattled crypto exchange FTX, recently jumped 35% to trade just over $2. Seven months ago, FTT was trading over $35. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, which has been rallying over the past few weeks despite its intertwining with the FTX debacle, fell back about 5%.  MANA, the token of 3D virtual reality platform Decentraland, was up more than 16%.  U.S. equity markets will be closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the late civil rights activist. Major indexes rose slightly on Friday to continue their own 2023 rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, are up more than 5% and 4%, respectively.  Still, the upswing in assets may be short-lived if economic news falters, as a number of observers are predicting.  In a Wall Street Journal quarterly survey, nearly two in three economists expect the U.S. to fall into recession this year, approximately the same percentage as in the previous survey, although many believe the economic contraction will be mild.  In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote warily that ""market participants should practice caution during such spikes and await more stability and cons.""  ""We continue to remain positive about accumulation at $18,000 and below, and our long-term outlook remains the same for 2023 – accumulating during range lows.""

The growth investor, and self-confessed bitcoin HODLer, saw her major funds like the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the ARK Next Generation Innovation ETF (ARKW) decline by over 50%. Crypto was chaotic, as well-documented by CoinDesk, and tech didn’t fare much better, with layoffs alongside a cooling venture capital market.  But Wood, in a blog post from Jan. 12, that all this worrying made us miss out on a lot, too.  “In my 45 years on Wall Street and more than 30 years in portfolio management, I have never seen markets this dislocated,” she wrote. “Plagued by fears of entrenched inflation and higher interest rates, the wall of worry in the equity markets has scaled to enormous heights.”  But despite the uncertainty of the market, she believes that disruptive innovation technologies that address issues have gained traction during turbulent times.  The market was too focused on carnage to notice all the advancements that happened in 2022, Wood wrote, pointing at disruptive tech like ChatGPT, a next-generation artificial intelligence platform, new developments in autonomous vehicles, the continued rise of digital wallets, and, of course, blockchain.  “Despite the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, underlying public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have not skipped a beat in processing transactions,” Wood wrote.  Not skipped a beat indeed: In the last month bitcoin has risen 25.6%, with the world’s largest digital asset experiencing one-day price jumps that haven’t been seen in months. It’s been a rather positive start to the year, with exchange volume trending upwards.  So too, has it for Wood’s exchange-traded funds. ARKK is up 18.2% since the year began, and ARKW is in the green at 8.2% on the month.  Tech is ubiquitous and it scales quickly. That’s why software is eating the world.  The market has shown that demand is still there for blockchain and crypto. If anything, the turbulence of 2022 was an exercise in shaking out bad actors and reinforcing the positions of good ones. Let’s just make sure that we don’t miss out on what the good ones are doing with this “wall of worry” in front of us.
