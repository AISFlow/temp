42430865,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJZh,1565990124,These Bitcoin Users Want DAI and DeFi – Here's How They Plan to Get It,"Summa co-founder James Prestwich wants to bridge the great divide: bitcoin vs. ethereum.  Now his firm is teaming up with fellow blockchain startup Keep to launch the Cross-Chain Working Group, which aims to create a protocol for using bitcoin on ethereum-based systems.  The group hosted its first meeting on Thursday with more than 40 participants, including curious representatives from interoperability protocol Cosmos and Ripple’s investment arm, Xpring.  “The goal is to provide a platform for developers, other than those employed by a base chain, who work across chains,” Prestwich told CoinDesk.  He said nearly 10 other companies have applied to join this group making tools for developers to work across blockchains, although official membership is yet to be determined.  “It’s a wrapper but it’s a fully decentralized wrapper. I’d actually call it a new sidechain mechanism,” Matt Luongo, CEO of Keep’s parent company, Thesis, told CoinDesk. “It gives your a trustless peg, a supply peg, between the two chains.”  In short, the bitcoin is deposited with a smart contract that requires multiple signatures to unlock funds. Key holders lock up crypto collateral, like ether, which the depositor can seize if the holders misbehave. In the meantime, the depositor is essentially given a crypto equivalent of ethereum-compatible tokens that represent the bitcoin, called tBTC.  As such, the user can conduct ethereum transactions like taking a collateralized debt position with MakerDAO’s stablecoin DAI, yet eventually cash out the results as bitcoin. There is clearly demand for dollar-pegged DAI loans, which are generally liquidated for fiat then paid back to unlock the crypto collateral. According to DeFi Pulse, there is roughly $256 million worth of crypto locked in MakerDAO loans alone.  “Now bitcoiners can get loans and get access to DAI,” Luongo said. “All of us being able to get access to the equity of our bitcoin holdings would be pretty powerful.”  It takes a village  Thesis investor Charlie Noyes of Paradigm told CoinDesk tBTC represents “a meaningful improvement over previous efforts to make bitcoin more extensible,” without compromising on bitcoin’s security or decentralized ethos.  The working group’s goal is to launch an ethereum-based tester app with access to bitcoin this fall and a tBTCmainnet by Q4. Keep investor Olaf Carlson-Wee of Polychain Capital told CoinDesk he sees this protocol as “critical infrastructure” for the broader ecosystem.  “Different blockchains, instead of being siloed, will be able to communicate with one another and interact with one another,” Carlson-Wee said. “When you think longer term, is the start of a universe of interaction across blockchains … where tokens can freely move across blockchains. This is the first step toward that inevitable future.”  Speaking of the motivation behind forming this group to make tBTCl, rather than both startups doing it proprietarily, Luongo concluded:  “We want other folks to be able to come in, contribute, and help launch this with us.”  Summa founder James Prestwich at the first Cross-Chain Working Group meeting in San Francisco (photo via Keep)",POSITIVE,BTC | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | DAI,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/08/16/these-bitcoin-users-want-dai-and-defi-heres-how-they-plan-to-get-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53814fcbe00298cf183a27106ebb016b59d8b8c4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430860,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJRh,1565985604,"Coinbase Reveals Password Glitch Affecting 3,500 Customers","Crypto exchange Coinbase disclosed a potential vulnerability Friday, announcing that a tiny fraction of its customers' passwords were stored in plain text on an internal server log. However, the information was not improperly accessed by outside parties, the exchange said.  In a post-mortem shared with CoinDesk, Coinbase outlined ""a password storage issue,"" impacting less than 3,500 customers (out of more than 30 million worldwide) that briefly resulted in personal information, including the passwords, being stored in clear text on internal logging systems.  ""Under a very specific and rare error condition, the registration form on our signup page wouldn’t load correctly, which meant that any attempt to create a new Coinbase account under those conditions would fail,"" the post explained. ""Unfortunately, it also meant that the individual’s name, email address, and proposed password (and state of residence, if in the US) would be sent to our internal logs.""  In 3,420 instances, the potential customers used the same password on their second signup attempt, which would be successful but would result in their having a password that matches the hashed version on the company's logs. Those customers were notified by Coinbase via email on Friday.  The bug occurred due to Coinbase's use of React.js server-side rendering on the signup page. Essentially, when a user visits the page to sign up for an account, React helps display the form that needs to be filled out.  ""Any user attempting to register needs to have JavaScript enabled, and needs to have that JavaScript load correctly,"" the post explained, adding:  ""In virtually all circumstances, both of these things are true, and React handles form validation and submission to the server. However, if a user had JavaScript disabled or their browser received a React.js error when loading, there was enough pre-rendered HTML that a user could fill out and attempt to submit our registration form.""  Because the HTML form ""was extremely basic,"" no ""action"" or ""method"" attributes were set. Due to default behaviors, this resulted in some browsers defaulting to ""GET,"" which encoded form variables as part of the log data.  The exchange fixed the issue by switching the default form method to ""POST,"" to ensure data is no longer logged.  While Coinbase searched for other forms ""with that problematic behavior,"" the exchange did not identify any.  ""We’re also in the process of implementing additional mechanisms to detect and prevent the inadvertent introduction of this sort of bug in the future,"" the blog post said.  In response to the discovery, Coinbase said it tracked the various location where the logs might be stored, which included a system hosted on Amazon Web Services and some ""log analysis service providers.""  ""A thorough review of access to these logging systems did not reveal any unauthorized access to this data,"" the post said, adding that access to each of the systems is ""tightly restricted and audited.""  Coinbase said it has also triggered password resets for any individual whose account was impacted. (The blog post added that it requires two-factor authentication on top of a password in order for users to log into accounts.)  ""While we are confident that we’ve fixed the root cause and that the logged information was not improperly accessed, misused, or compromised, we are requiring those customers to change their passwords as a best-practice precaution,"" the post explained.  ""As a reminder, Coinbase also maintains an active bug bounty program on HackerOne, which has paid out over a quarter of a million dollars to date. While this particular bug was discovered internally, we welcome security researchers to submit reports any time they believe they may have uncovered a flaw in one of our systems,"" the exchange concluded.  Coinbase's disclosure comes on the heels of Binance and Huobi suffering from actual data breaches.

42430839,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyFph,1565981111,Ethereum Coders Approve 6 Changes for Upcoming Istanbul Hard Fork,"Ethereum core developers finalized late Thursday a list of six different code changes to be activated for ethereum's next system-wide upgrade, Istanbul.  As agreed in prior meetings, Istanbul will be executed in two parts. The first, which will feature all six code changes, or ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs), is tentatively expected to execute on ethereum mainnet this October.  The second, which is scheduled for mainnet activation sometime in the first quarter of next year, will feature EIPs requiring further testing and deliberation from core developers. Those include a proposed mining algorithm change called ""ProgPoW.""  Speaking of the two-part structure of the Istanbul upgrade, core developer Péter Szilágyi said on Thursday's call:  ""We split Istanbul into two. One of them we can actually ship within weeks. [The other contains] two really big EIPs that would be nice to have but require some stuff that cannot be done within the two- or three-week timespan.""  Istanbul Part 1 will be the eighth hard fork to be activated on the $22 billion blockchain network. It is expected to boost chain interoperability with privacy coin zcash and help secure the broader network against replay attacks, among other efficiency improvements.  Developers behind major ethereum clients such as Geth and Parity now have exactly one week to integrate the newly affirmed list of six EIPs into their software and prepare to implement the full code on a live ethereum test network.  The last hurdle  While the original target date for Istanbul's testnet activation on ethereum testnet Ropsten was this Wednesday, Aug. 14, Szilágyi noted during Thursday's call that the target needed to be pushed back two weeks in order to give developers time to finalize the list of EIPs going into Istanbul Part 1.  Because that list has just now been agreed upon by core developers, Szilágyi said a hard fork activation date on Ropsten for Wednesday, Sept. 4 may have to be reconsidered and pushed back once more.  ""With previous hard forks, after everybody implemented [to their clients], we had literally months of testing before rolling out to the testnet. Now, we just came up with a final list of EIPs and we want to fork in two weeks? That's a bit brave,"" Szilágyi said on the call.  Other core developers agreed with this sentiment and decided that a targeted testnet activation date (at a to-be-determined block number) would have to wait until next week's meeting.  Testnet activation of Istanbul Part 1 will be the last major milestone before mainnet activation. As with any hard fork, ethereum miners must upgrade simultaneously to the latest software or risk causing a chain split in the network.  Speaking to the importance of a testnet release for hard fork upgrades, Ethereum Foundation community manager Hudson Jameson said:  ""The security and stability of the network are primary concerns when it comes to doing hard fork on mainnet so the testnet release is a vital step in making sure that mainnet release go smoothly.""  As such, Jameson affirmed that while delayed, a testnet activation of Istanbul Part 1 is something all ethereum core developers want to see happen soon.  ""[Ethereum] core developers are excited to get the Ropsten testnet hard fork going to make sure that everything's working correctly,"" said Jameson.

42430844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyFvh,1565980244,FinCEN Director Reminds Casinos of Crypto Compliance Requirements,"The director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said the casino industry needs to up the ante on reporting suspicious activities related to digital currencies.  Speaking at an Anti-Money Laundering Conference in Las Vegas on August 13, FinCEN director Kenneth Blanco said the agency has not received the amount of suspicious activity reports (SARs) expected.  “There is a misconception that just because FinCEN has not publicly issued enforcement action against a casino or card club since last year that FinCEN is not looking at this financial sector,” Blanco said. “Let me assure you, this is not the case.”  According to regulatory guidelines published in May, casinos and card tables are required to identify and report “red flags” that point to potential instances of money laundering, sanctions evasion, and other illicit financing purposes” using cryptocurrencies.  This is in light of casinos being targets for malware scams and ""business e-mail compromise schemes.""  “Casinos should be filing SARs (suspicious activity reports) when they encounter suspicious [convertible virtual currency] activity and any cyber events that affect, facilitate, or conduct transactions,” he said.  Additionally, casinos must set policies, procedures, internal controls, and risk assessments related to crypto assets.  Blanco raised several questions related to due diligence:  “How will you conduct blockchain analytics to determine the source of the CVC? How will you incorporate CVC-related indicators into your SAR filings as appropriate?”  Blanco further drew a distinction between registered casinos or card tables and online gaming sites that function as money transmitters. Licensed casinos, online or offline, must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and any laws related to money services businesses, and later called compliance “a national security issue.”  “We know the kind of significant information that casinos are able to develop on gaming customers. This information is extraordinary and relevant,” he said.  Kenneth hopes that casinos will create a “culture of compliance” where distinct entities share information among themselves and with the proper authorities.

As part of an ATO effort to warn against high-risk retirement investment strategies, 18,000 holders of Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs), a type of retirement account privately managed by individuals, were told they face penalties up to 4,200 AUD for breaching regulations, according to local media reports.  While the letter targeted any SMSF holder with over 90 percent of their retirement savings in a single asset – primarily in property – the ATO also singled out cryptocurrencies as a high-risk investment.  “We have already seen two instances of SMSFs losing significant amounts of their retirement savings through investment in cryptocurrency,” an ATO spokesperson told the Australian news site Micky.  To be clear, it's not the asset class itself the agency warns against, but being highly overexposed in any one asset.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) takes a similar line:  “Be wary of services offering to establish an SMSF for you in order to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. Not only does operating an SMSF involve significant time, skills and responsibility, you may also be putting your retirement savings at risk.”  Neither the ATO or ASIC responded to requests for comment by press time.

42430840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyFjh,1565968479,Bakkt Says It's 'Cleared to Launch' Bitcoin Futures Next Month,"Bakkt has been ""cleared to launch.""  The Intercontinental Exchange’s young subsidiary announced Friday that it had acquired a New York state trust charter through the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The approval clears the way for the company to begin offering its highly-anticipated physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts. The company intends to launch its products on Sept. 23.  Bakkt, first unveiled last August, has been working on regulatory approvals to begin offering the product over the past year. It intends to offer two types of contracts: a daily and a monthly contract. Both will be settled at the Bakkt Warehouse, a part of its New York-chartered trust company.  In a blog post Friday, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loefler wrote, ""Our contracts have already received the green light from the CFTC through the self-certification process and user acceptance testing has begun.""  ""With approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services to create Bakkt Trust Company, a qualified custodian, the Bakkt Warehouse will custody bitcoin for physically delivered futures,"" she said. ""This offers customers unprecedented regulatory clarity and security alongside a regulated, globally accessible exchange in a market underserved by institutional-grade infrastructure.""  She went on to add:  ""Uniquely, Bakkt bitcoin futures contracts will not rely upon unregulated spot markets for settlement prices, thus serving as a transparent price discovery mechanism for the benchmark price for bitcoin. The importance of this differentiator is only amplified by reports of significant manipulative spot market activity, and other concerns such as inconsistent anti-money-laundering policies and weak compliance controls.""  Monthly vs. daily  Loeffler told CoinDesk Friday that Bakkt’s daily contract will be margined, and can provide an alternative to unregulated spot markets for traders.  “The daily contract is designed to provide a margined instrument,” she said. “So when you think about transacting on the futures exchange you’re operating within a [federally] regulated exchange.”  Loeffler didn't say how much leverage would be available on the margined contracts. Such details are expected to be released in the coming weeks.  As for Bakkt’s monthly futures contract, which were first introduced in May, Loeffler said it added a “forward pricing curve” for investors.  The monthly contracts will let any investors take a view on bitcoin up to 12 months out, she said, adding:  “The other thing that’s important about a monthly contract is what it offers is the ability to take [snapshots] at different times throughout the next year so it adds spread trading ... and timing of, for example the halvening coming up next year, the contract, you’ll be able to look out into that time period in 2020.”  The core service Bakkt will offer is “secure regulated custody,” alongside its institutional-scale trading, she said. Bakkt itself is not an exchange, but rather will take advantage of its parent firm’s existing infrastructure.  ICE Futures U.S. will therefore provide the actual exchange services, while Bakkt and its warehouse will provide the custody services its physically-delivered contracts require.  Long road  The New York Stock Exchange’s sister firm initially intended to have the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approve its proposed contracts, and announced a December 2018 launch date when ICE first unveiled the company.  Regulatory hold-ups forced Bakkt to push the date back a number of times. Most notably, Bakkt announced in May 2019 that it had self-certified its futures contracts through the CFTC, departing from its previous goal of having the agency approve the product.  It announced a month later that it would begin user acceptance testing on July 22 -- essentially, ensuring that clients and clearinghouses could communicate with Bakkt’s infrastructure -- and begin working to onboard potential customers.  Loeffler said Friday that “we have customers and clearing members already in the test environment,” adding:  “We anticipate with the finalization of the Sept. 23 launch date user acceptance testing will accelerate and we will work with customers on onboarding and getting ready for day one.”  While Bakkt may be the first to market, the company faces competition: derivatives provider LedgerX and TD Ameritrade-backed ErisX are also looking to offer bitcoin futures contracts to investors. Seed CX and trueDigital are also working to launch forwards contracts, a similar product.

The island, which lies 282 miles south of Seoul and is also a province, announced on August 13th the establishment of the ""Global Blockchain Hub City Development Research Service,"" in which it will be investing 175 million won ($145,000) for research running through December.  The modest project will be carried out by Tilon, a Seoul-based company specializing in secure virtualization. Established in 2001, the company often works with local governments and a wide variety of public institutions.  Under the terms of the agreement, Tilon will analyze possible blockchain services suitable for the island and develop a model for blockchain on Jeju. A roadmap will be delivered. As part of the engagement, Tilon will examine advances in the U.S. and the U.K.  The goal of the project is to establish the island as another hub for blockchain in South Korea.  Jeju is in a unique position to achieve the relevant developments. Under a special deal with the national government, it has been self-governing since 2006. No other province has that designation. Jeju has considerable freedom in terms of local administration and legislation and has ambitions to use its autonomy to become a ""Free International City.""  In recent years, blockchain and crypto have become central to the island's plans. The Modified 2nd Comprehensive Plan Jeju Free International City, published in February 2017, makes specific reference to the creation of a virtual currency.  Since South Korea's Financial Services Commission banned ICOs in September 2017, Jeju has been attempting to use its special status as a way to circumvent the regulation and become the country's only area for these offerings.

42430849,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyG3h,1565966409,China’s Digital Fiat Wants to Compete With Bitcoin – But It’s Not a Crypto,"The Takeaway:  A review of over 50 patent applications submitted by the People's Bank of China shows the design of its central bank digital currency will only resemble a cryptocurrency in limited ways.  A senior official at the central bank said the effort will be helpful to ""restrain public's demands for crypto assets and to strengthen the country's sovereign currency.""  Far from emulating the decentralized aspects of ether and bitcoin, the official emphasized the issuance of the central bank's digital currency will stick to a centralized management model.      China may be about to launch a fiat digital currency, but in all likelihood, it will only resemble a cryptocurrency on the surface.  And it probably won’t use a blockchain. While inspired to some degree by bitcoin and the like, the effort is explicitly framed as a strategy to beat them back.  The project was thrust into the spotlight last weekend when a senior official from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) said at a closed-door conference that the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) is ready to launch.  In his speech, widely covered in the press, Changchun Mu, deputy director at the PBoC’s payments division, notably said:  “Since last year, the staff at the Digital Currency Research Lab have been working 996 to develop the system. We can say the CBDC is now ready to launch at one’s call.”  (996 is a phrase commonly used in the Chinese tech startup scene, referring to working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.)  The CBDC aims to replace M0, meaning cash in circulation, via a two-tier system: the central bank issues the digital yuan only to commercial banks, who will further issue it to the public, Mu said. This approach is perhaps unsurprising since Yao Qian, the former chief of the research lab, hinted at this design in an op-ed published in CoinDesk in 2017.  However, one comment from Mu that got overlooked by many is that he believes “the two-tier issuance system will be helpful to restrain the public’s demands for crypto assets and strengthen the country’s sovereign currency.”  Mu did not elaborate on how everyday users would interact with this proposed mechanism or to what extent the CBDC really employs distributed ledger technology. And it remains unclear when the central bank plans to test and roll it out or, upon its launch, whether it will be optional or mandatory for Chinese consumers.  But dozens of patent applications submitted by the research lab to China’s State Intellectual Property Office reviewed by CoinDesk offer a window into the PBoC’s thinking on how the system may function and its similarities and (more importantly) differences with crypto.  Crypto-inspired  The PBoC’s Digital Currency Research Lab was formally launched in the summer of 2017 and spearheaded by Yao Qian, although Mu indicated the work has been ongoing for five years. Yao left the position for a different agency around October 2018.  To date, the lab has filed more than 50 patent applications, all either invented or co-invented by Yao, and about 20 of those focus on design specifications of a so-called digital currency wallet.  Each document covers a specific technology feature of the proposed system, ranging from how to apply for and create a wallet, how to transfer money to and from saving accounts, how a peer-to-peer transaction is verified, etc.  The goal is to build a wallet to store digitized yuan that is unlike the electronic wallets of any bank or third-party payments application. Those wallets, one patent document says, are ""merely an extension of assets held in custody at a bank account."" As such, the approach borrows the idea from bitcoin of a peer-to-peer transaction system where users possess private keys to control the asset.  One patent application, entitled “a method and system for enquiring digital currency transaction information” filed on Dec. 28, 2017, describes a digital currency wallet that aims to bridge the gap between existing electronic wallets and “private quasi-digital currency wallets, like that of bitcoin.”  The former is not an independent wallet, which may incur security issues, and the latter, while allowing users to personally possess their assets, does so in an anonymous way with transactions of that can’t be reversed, the document further states.  Another patent application added:  “The emergence of digital currency is an inevitable trend. So far, privately issued digital currency bears the features of anonymity and volatility. Central banks must take their impacts on the payments, monetary systems and financial stability seriously. As such, it’s inevitable for central banks to push for digitized fiat currencies to optimize their circulation.”  KYC-ed digital yuan  And one crucial way to optimize such circulation appears to be stripping the anonymity feature of cryptocurrencies and including a know-your-customer (KYC) process required by other payment methods.  So far, physical cash is arguably the only form of fiat money inside China that can remain anonymous, compared to bank wire or third-party methods offered by companies like Alibaba or WeChat – both requiring real-name verification authenticated by users’ IDs and banking information.  “Existing M0 (banknotes and coins) are subject to counterfeit and money laundering risks. … The [CBDC] system should follow the existing rules about anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing imposed on cash, and should report to the PBoC on large amounts and suspicious transactions,” Mu emphasized during his speech.  His note echoes the design specifications entailed by various patent applications for the proposed peer-to-peer digital currency wallets.  For example, the patent application on how to apply and create digital wallets filed on Dec. 28, 2017 stated that the system lets users apply through their banks and the creation of such digital currency wallets will be registered at the issuance organization.  Another document detailing how to redeem the CBDC from saving accounts filed on June 26, 2017 explained that after a user sends a request to withdraw money from their saving accounts – similar to withdrawing from an ATM, except now it’s not cash but in a p2p wallet – the corresponding issuers will need to verify a user’s ID before granting the redemption.  And after that, when a user initiates a payment transaction from the independent digital wallet, a third party will verify who is sending how much to whom.  A third document detailing this method states:  “A sender would authorize a payment deduction request to a receiver’s digital currency wallet. The receiver would verify such request, which will then be sent to the CBDC issuance registration system. The payment will complete after the verification of such request [by the system].”  In addition, another document specifies a system that aims to customize a tracking solution to make the CBDC traceable even across multiple owners and layers.  All of this, of course, is a far cry from bitcoin, where there is no central authority, anyone can download software and create a wallet without presenting ID, and payments can be made without any middleman’s permission.  Decentralized no more?  Another open question is to what degree the PBoC’s digital currency system may include the features of blockchain, if at all.  One of the earliest patent documents filed more than two years ago detailed that the central bank did at one point explore the idea of using a distributed network to manage nodes for verifying transactions.  “This technology would empower smart contracts on a blockchain infrastructure to dynamically manage nodes in the network to ensure they share and transact the same data with security and scalability,” the doc stated.  Mu’s speech also alluded to this approach but added that the strategy has indeed changed over the years. At the very beginning, the research lab did build a prototype completely on blockchain infrastructure but later encountered the issue of scalability, he said, adding:  “Since we are using digital fiat currency to replace M0, to reach a retail-level adoption, the first issue that we can’t bypass is the demand for high-volume transactions.""  Mu used the example of a shopping holiday popular among young people in China to show how blockchains aren’t suitable for mass adoption:  “Our payments network during last year’s Singles’ Day sale at its peak handled 92,771 transactions per second. In comparison, bitcoin and ethereum handles seven and 10 to 20 transactions per second, respectively. [Facebook’s] Libra, based on its recently released white paper, is 1,000 transactions per second. For a country as big as China, it’s impossible to achieve high scalability by purely relying on blockchain. As such, we have decided to remain technologically neutral and do not necessarily rely on one fixed technological path.”  He concluded in his speech that although crypto assets have the natural feature of decentralization, the PBoC’s Digital Currency, under the two-tier system, must stick to a centralized management model.  “Only designated organizations can operate the redemption and needs to be centrally managed to prevent over-issuance and to ensure the central bank’s management position,” he said.

Nineteen-year-old Elliot Gunton was sentenced at Norwich Crown Court on Friday, having pleaded guilty at a previous hearing, according to a local police news report.  Police had found evidence on Gunton's laptop that he had ""offered to supply compromised personal data of individuals to others for them to use for criminal purposes"". The information included mobile phone numbers which could be used to intercept calls and texts in order to commit crimes.  Gunton was further discovered to be advertising hacking services in exchange for $3,000 in bitcoin.  While he had taken efforts to conceal his activity, police found portions of online chats in which Gunton discussed his criminal activity. Officers also tracked and seized £275,000 ($335,000) in cryptocurrency held by Gunton.  Probably unwisely, he had tweeted via one of his online identities – ""@Gambler"" – saying, “having lots of money is cool….but having lots of money without people knowing is cooler”.  The police said they had discovered the criminal activity during a routine visit to ensure Gunton was complying with a Sexual Harm Prevention Order imposed in 2016 for earlier offences.  Detective Sergeant Mark Stratford said:  “Gunton was exploiting the personal data of innocent businesses and people in order to make a considerable profit but he did not succeed in hiding all of his ill-gotten gains which enabled us to seize hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Bitcoin.""  Gunton was charged with breaching the Sexual Harm Prevention Order, hacking offences and money laundering, the police report said.  While sentenced to 20 months jail time, Gunton was immediately released as he had already served his sentence while in custody.  However, he must hand over £407,359 in ill-gotten gains and must comply with a 3.5 year Community Behaviour Order restricting his use of the internet, browsers, VPNs and cloud storage. He must also not use cryptocurrency, digital wallets or exchanges without informing police and passing over all details and addresses.

42430842,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyFth,1565960411,"This Crypto Asset Doesn't Exist Yet, But Soon You'll Be Able to Stake It","Perlin hasn't even had the token generation event for its PERL cryptocurrency, and already a leading staking-as-a-service startup has agreed to add it to the list of assets it supports.  Staked – which has the backing of some of the most notable funds in crypto, including Pantera, Winklevoss Capital and Coinbase Ventures – helps holders of proof-of-stake tokens maximize their returns.  Its new listing, PERL, allows access to a suite of applications designed to aid the international trade and trade finance industry, which is still very much bogged down by paperwork, according to Perlin CEO Dorjee Sun.  ""If you were to send a container to Indonesia, it takes two days for the container to go but five days for the paperwork,"" Sun explained in call with CoinDesk from Singapore.  Sun said the Singapore-based company raised $50 million last year from investors that include Arrington XRP Capital, FBG, BlockTower Capital and Global Brain.  Grassroots consensus  Underlying PERL is the Perlin-built Wavelet blockchain, which maintains consensus across various records held in Perlin's logistics applications.  Wavelet was designed to use what it calls leaderless proof-of-stake consensus. That is, one in which even users with small stakes have a chance to benefit from participating in the network's consensus.  A very simple way to think about how it works, according to Perlin, is to imagine thousands of nodes tracking transactions as they come in. Wavelet randomly surveys and re-surveys nodes at each block to verify that everyone agrees.  That way, it doesn't have to default to the largest holders of its cryptocurrency, ensuring the rich get richer and shutting out the small-time PERL holder.  Consensus rewards come from transaction fees paid by users of Perlin's applications. The current economic model of Perlin is fixed with its initial supply 1,033,200,000 PERL. It's currently selling a little under 86,530,500 PERL on Binance Launchpad, with a hard cap of $6.7 million.  Because Binance uses a lottery system, Perlin will distribute an additional 3,874,500 PERL to launchpad participants that do not come out with a winning ticket, in an airdrop.  That said, Sun explained that PERL is also a governance token, and if users want to change the economic model later (such as creating some kind of inflationary mechanism), they can do so.  Multi-pronged democratization  While the company argues it's not resource-intensive to run a Wavelet node, the company also believes joining a network like Staked further enhances its openness, by providing an option to take part for users who don't have the wherewithal (in time, skill or equipment) to set up a node.  For more technically minded users, though, Wavelet is built to work with WebAssembly. Not only does this make participating in consensus easier, but it opens up decentralized applications to almost any developer doing work with today's internet.  Vincent Zhou, founder of FBG Capital, said in a press release that both companies were inviting more people into crypto.  ""I believe their immense contributions to the space will raise up the entire ecosystem,"" Zhou said. ""Staked by making staking dead easy for investors and Perlin by vastly simplifying smart contract and dApp development with ground-breaking WebAssembly support.""  Staked currently supports Algorand, Tezos, Livepeer, Cosmos, Dash, Decred and others.  ""On Perlin, we were attracted by a big vision that we think has strong real-world potential,"" Staked CEO Tim Ogilvie told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It's also important that we support our customers' investments. Many of the Perlin investors are existing customers of ours.""

42430838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyFlh,1565957838,"Moscow Blockchain Voting System 'Completely Insecure,' Says Researcher","A blockchain-based system that will be used to allow Moscow residents to vote in municipal elections this autumn is very easy to hack, according to a research note from a French cryptography expert.  Titled, ""Breaking the encryption scheme of the Moscow internet voting system,"" the paper by Pierrick Gaudry, a researcher from French governmental scientific institution CNRS, looked at the encryption scheme used to secure the public code of the Moscow city government's ethereum-based e-voting platform.  Gaudry concluded that encryption scheme used in part of the code ""is completely insecure, explaining:  ""It can be broken in about 20 minutes using a standard personal computer, and using only free software that is publicly available. More precisely, it is possible to compute the private keys from the public keys. Once these are known, any encrypted data can be decrypted as quickly as they are created.""  To be clear, the issue is not with the ethereum code used as a basis for the platform. The encryption used in the Moscow system, the researcher said, is a variant of ElGamal and uses keys that are ""less than 256 bits long.""  ""This is way, way too short to guarantee any security,"" Gaudry said.  As stated on the city administration's website, voters from three constituencies can choose to use the system to elect deputies to the Moscow City Duma, or parliament, on Sept. 8.  For the trial effort, the site claims:  ""Moscow electronic elections guarantee complete anonymity and secrecy of the vote. No one can associate an electronic return with the name of the voter.""  In fact, Gaudry said, ""in the worst-case scenario,"" the poor level of encryption at present would mean details of all voters' choices ""would be revealed to anyone as soon as they cast their vote."" He added though that, not having read the protocol for the system, the consequences of a potential hack are hard to pinpoint.  To be fair to the development team, the system had been the subject of a ""public intrusion test"" aimed to spot any such issues late in July with Gaudry using the source code made available on Github.  Gaudry did reach out to the Moscow Department of Information Technology team developing the voting system about the security weakness. They acknowledged that the cryptographic keys are not currently sufficiently secure, and said they would be upgraded to 1,024 bits soon.

42430852,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyG9h,1565953813,"Bitcoin Defends Price Support, But Bear Case Still Intact","View  Bitcoin's repeated defense of the 100-day moving average signals seller exhaustion, but a break above $10,445 – the high of Thursday's hammer candle – is needed to confirm a bull revival.  A high-volume move above $10,445 would open the doors to re-test of $11,120.  BTC may have a tough time scaling $10,445, as the daily chart indicators are biased bearish.  The risk of a drop to $9,049 (July 17 low) remains as long as prices are held below that level.  Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced from key price support, but the outlook remains bearish as long as prices hold below Thursday's high of $10,445.  The leading cryptocurrency by the market value found takers near the widely followed 100-day moving average (MA) at $9,700 earlier today, but at time of writing had regained ground to around $10,060, according to Bitstamp data.  Sellers had managed to breach the 100-day MA in the early European trading hours on Thursday, but the breakdown was short-lived and BTC ended the day with 2.78 percent gains at $10,301.  In technical terms, the cryptocurrency created a long-tailed hammer candle on Thursday, implying seller exhaustion near the 100-day MA.  The recovery from the 100-day MA support seen today has further confirmed the weakening of bearish momentum.  A short-term bullish reversal, however, would be confirmed only if buyers make their presence felt today, pushing prices above Thursday's high of $10,445. That would validate the seller exhaustion signaled by Thursday's long-tailed hammer candle.  Long-tailed daily candles have consistently reversed pullbacks in the recent past, as seen in the chart below. So, there is a historical case to be made for a price rise above $10,445 today. That said, widely followed technical indicators continue to call a bearish move.  Daily chart  Bitcoin's pullback from the June 26 high of $13,880 ended with the cryptocurrency forming a long-tailed bullish hammer on July 2.  On similar lines, July 17's long-tailed candle marked an end of the pullback from the July 10 high of $13,200 and was followed by a rise to $11,120. Again, the cryptocurrency created a long-tailed doji on July 28, before rising to highs above $12,000 on Aug. 6.  So, if history is a guide, the cryptocurrency may post a strong follow-through to yesterday's bullish hammer candle.  However, technical indicators are biased bearish: the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending south, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is hovering below 50 and the MACD is producing lower lows below the zero line.  Going by the indicators, the cryptocurrency may have a tough time printing the necessary (for the bulls) UTC close above Thursday's high of $10,445.  Hourly chart  BTC witnessed a rising wedge breakdown earlier today. That bearish continuation pattern marked an end of the bounce from yesterday's low of $9,467 and a resumption of the sell-off from recent highs above $12,000.  That pattern is still valid, meaning the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Furthermore, the bounce seen in the last few hours is not backed by strong buying volumes (green bars) and could be short-lived.  All-in-all, the cryptocurrency looks likely to remain on track to test the $9,049 (July 17 low). Acceptance below that level would confirm a bearish reversal on the monthly chart, as discussed earlier this week.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

A project that was announced back in late 2017 after trials with blockchain tech had proved promising, the DLT platform is aimed to replace ASX's ageing CHESS settlement system using technology built by New York-based Digital Asset, then under the leadership of Blythe Masters.  The exchange said at the time it would build a similar payment messaging system to CHESS, but anonymized and accounted for on a distributed ledger, allowing a wide range of financial products that rely on automated settlement to be created.  ASX's yearly results, published Thursday, indicate that work is ""on track"" to complete the system (likely in 2021), which will ""will deliver upgraded security, resilience and performance"" for equity post trade services. It will also offer new functionality over and above what is currently enabled by CHESS, with a new messaging ISO 20022 protocol (an international standard for financial services) that ""aligns with local and global standards.""  The document sets out that there will be an option for institutions to access the upcoming system by hosting their own DLT node. That, the ASX says, will offer synchronized and standardized data across the permissioned participants on the network, advanced auditing and data analytics. It will also enable the market to build ""new, innovative"" applications.  The ASX also indicates that it's investigating DLT application use cases with ""multiple parties"" related to equities and more.  As far as costs go, the ASX's capital investment in infrastructure, including the DLT system have cost $75.1 million in financial year 2019. That also includes work on a new secondary data center, ASX Net communications infrastructure, a data analytics platform called ASX DataSphere and an effort to speed up corporate transactions.  Overall the firm said it's had a ""strong"" 2019, with revenue at $863.8 million – up 6.5 percent on a like-for-like basis. Underlying profit after tax and expenses was $492 million, up 7.7 percent from 2018.  Back in May, the ASX said it was already allowing clients to test its DLT system. Via a Customer Development Environment (CDE), customers are able connect to the system via a blockchain node and experiment with the tech. Once connected, users can design, build and test system changes, as well as access some of the new business functionality.

42430836,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyFfh,1565928953,A Big Four Audit Firm Lost $1 Million In Bitcoin. Victims Are Losing Patience,"The Takeaway:  QuadrigaCX’s former users are running out of patience with Miller Thomson and EY, the court-appointed companies tasked with recovering their missing funds.  The users want more transparency into EY’s investigation of Quadriga’s missing funds, as well as a better understanding of how the audit firm accidentally lost 103 bitcoin (now worth over $1 million) earlier this year.  Some users are contemplating finding new legal representation due to their frustrations with Miller Thomson.      Former QuadrigaCX users are losing patience with their court-appointed lawyers and looking for answers about how more than 100 bitcoins were “inadvertently” lost.  QuadrigaCX, once Canada’s largest crypto exchange, collapsed virtually overnight earlier this year after CEO Gerald Cotten died while traveling in India. An affidavit filed by Cotten's widow said the exchange owed customers as much as $190 million ($250 million CAD).  The Nova Scotia Supreme Court, which is overseeing the company’s unwinding, appointed Big Four auditor Ernst & Young (EY) as monitor to try to recover funds for the exchange’s customers, and law firms Miller Thomson and Cox & Palmer (Miller Thomson's Nova Scotia-based local partner) as counsel to represent these customers’ interests.    However, some of these creditors believe Miller Thomson and EY are failing to keep costs down or recover user funds. Much of this frustration stems from the 103 bitcoins that were accidentally transferred into wallets whose passwords were known only to the late founder, several creditors told CoinDesk. Unless the passwords are recovered, there’s no way to get the bitcoin back.    The blunder occurred in February, and at the time, the lost bitcoin was worth some $375,000 ($500,000 CAD). The coins are now worth about $1.03 million ($1.37 million CAD).  Six months on, EY has not provided much in the way of detail explaining how the bitcoin was transferred to what are effectively locked wallets. In a report published in late February, the firm said the transfer occurred due to a ""platform setting error.""  ""This sounds like gross negligence to us and many of us want to hold EY accountable for what happened,"" Ali Mousavi, one of the creditors, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Instead of giving us the details, they [struck] a deal with [Miller Thomson] to keep the details confidential and [are] making it harder for us to hold EY accountable.""  EY, he said, was tasked with the court to recover funds, ""and EY was not able to return [the funds].""  Frustrated with Miller Thomson’s failure to hold EY's feet to the fire, creditors are even discussing their options with outside counsel. ""A lot of people want [Miller Thomson] replaced,"" creditor Xitong Zou said, ""although I don’t think that’s going to happen.""  Miller Thomson declined to comment on the record. EY did not respond to a request for comment.  See no evil?  Some creditors said they feel they’ve been taken advantage of.  Matt MacPherson told CoinDesk that to him, the most disappointing aspect of the situation is that Miller Thomson ""won’t even acknowledge any fraud whatsoever took place,"" referring to EY reports that Cotten used customer funds to margin trade cryptocurrencies like dogecoin and omisego, as well as purchase personal items.  Mousavi specified that creditors are looking for more transparency about how fees are spent and what exactly EY's investigators are looking at.  EY has not asked for any input from creditors and, according to Mousavi, is not sharing its investigation with any law enforcement agencies. To date, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and U.S. FBI have confirmed they are investigating the matter, and MacPherson said Australian authorities are also involved.  ""EY does not seem like they want to explain what happened when that's the very least they could do,"" Zou said. ""It was our money, after all.""  Creditors are not even necessarily looking for compensation for the lost bitcoin – just an explanation of how the goof occurred, he said.  Mousavi added that it looks as if the creditor committee – a group of seven individuals appointed to guide the law firm’s work – cannot direct EY on its investigation, or tell the firm which potential lines of inquiry it should prioritize.  ""It appears that whatever Gerald didn't manage to steal, EY and MT are stealing,"" Mousavi said, adding:  ""This might not be true but when you hide the details and charge us millions that's how it feels.""  ""Millions"" may be a slight exaggeration of the two firms’ revenues from the case – for now.  So far, EY has recovered about $25 million ($33 million CAD), with a judge awarding $1.6 million in fees and costs to all the firms involved in the case. EY is looking to raise up to another $9 million ($12 million CAD) by selling assets from Cotten’s estate (including luxury vehicles, a boat, a personal aircraft and 16 Nova Scotiaproperties) that EY claims were bought with customer funds.  The $1.6 million in fees are part of the restructuring process Quadriga entered in January. But the exchange is now unwinding as part of a bankruptcy process. This means EY, Miller Thomson and other firms will have additional fees at some future date.  Creditors looking to recoup funds have until Aug. 31 to file claims with EY.  Staying on message  In a public Telegram group for Quadriga creditors, Miller Thomson associate Asim Iqbal repeated the line that “it was a platform-setting error” that caused the 103 bitcoin to be accidentally transferred to the inaccessible wallets.  Iqbal provided little in the way of additional detail, citing non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and other confidentiality concerns.  ""We have provided the detail we are able to provide based on the NDAs and court orders the committee’s and our ability to delve into further details,"" he told the Telegram group.  The identity of the individual responsible for the slip-up, referred to as the “Quadriga Representative” by Iqbal, won’t be disclosed, he said. (One of the previous reports by Miller Thomson indicated that an individual associated with Quadriga was responsible.)  Iqbal pointed to a public statement by the creditor committee on why Miller Thomson won’t be pursuing any further information or action on the missing bitcoin.  He told the Telegram group:  ""This issue has been addressed by the committee and a statement has been released explaining the rationale for the decision. The funds remain where they were inadvertently transferred. EY has cold wallets for the balance of the funds, which was also disclosed in the second report.""  The statement, attributed to the committee (but posted on Miller Thomson’s website), does not address how or why the bitcoin was transferred, instead only saying ""it is not in the best interests of affected users"" to pursue any claims related to the matter.  One creditor in the Telegram group asked Iqbal to ""please provide us with some reading or context on how we can replace representative counsel.""  Iqbal would not do so, saying in the chat: ""We take instruction from the official committee.""  While he would not comment for this article, Iqbal acknowledged the creditors' concerns Thursday.  He wrote:  ""It’s hard to defend myself in a public forum like this. I can understand if some users are frustrated and wish to vent those frustrations here. It’s not appropriate for me to engage on those criticisms. I’d appreciate if you left committee members out of it. They volunteer their time to do the best they can and deserve appreciation.""

Coinbase said in an announcement on Thursday that the deal will help expand its custody business and will increase its assets under custody to be more than $7 billion.  According to a Fortune report on Thursday, Coinbase acquired Xapo's institutional business for $55 million after beating another strong contender, the investment giant Fidelity.  Coinbase Custody's CEO Sam McIngvale indicated in the report that the exchange could look into crypto lending business in the future. “Fundamentally, we have to help our investors earn a return on their assets. You can imagine lending out bitcoin and earning interest on that,” McIngvale was quoted as saying.  Launched in 2013, Xapo is known for its wallet services including physical vaults stationed in Switzerland that are used to store customers' crypto assets in an offline environment to ensure the safety of private keys.  Fortune's report added that with this deal, most of Xapo's biggest clients have already decided to move their crypto assets to Coinbase, which will now store more than 514,000 bitcoin for Xapo's customers, worth $5.3 billion at its current price.  In May this year, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 event that Coinbase Custody had just crossed $1 billion in assets under management at the time with 70 institutions.  The report today said if Coinbase would be able to onboard remaining customers of Xapo, then its custody service will have more than 860,000 bitcoin in total under custody, worth over $8 billion.

42430851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyG7h,1565915455,Brave Browser Adds Access to New Crypto Wallets,"More wallet features are on their way to the Brave browser.  Support for native cryptocurrency wallets was added to Brave Nightly per a posting yesterday in the official Brave subreddit, r/BATProject. Brave Nightly is a test and development version of the Brave browser.  Brave's three-part marketing system rewards content creators, advertisers, and viewers through its native token, the basic attention token (BAT).  Image via Reddit  The update allows other cryptocurrency wallets to be used with Brave's BAT in new capacities. All users still undergo know your customer (KYC) requirements via Uphold, a wallet Brave partnered with for BAT.  Lack of support for other non-Uphold wallets has been a common complaint on Brave community threads since the token's launch. This bottleneck was self-designed, however. Brave wanted the token's use case, content creation tipping, to take-off. More importantly, perhaps, are the KYC services Uphold provides.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Brave co-founder and CEO Brendan Eich said KYC concerns remain a top priority due to regulatory concerns.  ""[Brave] can't let fraud bots with Ledgers or Trezors take us to cleaners, and we have to avoid going to jail if some Office of Foreign Asset listed evildoer were to take out BAT that way,"" Eich said. ""BAT is compliant via Uphold, and I'll defend that decision readily by citing our growth numbers, [both] publishers and users.""  Eich said Brave added support for peer-to-peer wallets not to undercut regulators but lead the community forward. Adding wallet support helps adoption while keeping Brave's nose clean, Eich said:  ""We have no illusions that raw crypto is not for most users -- it is unusable and way too technical. We do want the users who are able to use it to have integrated crypto wallets in Brave. These users innovate and may collaborate with us, sites and channels, hardware wallet vendors, proxied fullnode services, and even their favorite blockchains at core protocol and implementation levels, to innovate beyond what we alone, or the blockchain projects alone, can do. We like 'lead users' and provide extra options for them""  The wallet update comes days after untargeted ads were added on Brave Nightly for 21 new countries including Argentina, Denmark, Italy, Korea, and Singapore.  UPDATE (16, August 23:00 UTC): An earlier version of this article stated each Uphold transaction required know your customer (KYC) checks and identified the incorrect wallets Brave's update targeted.
