42398573,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDKj,1439139053,Bitcoin Exchanges Kraken and Bitfinex Cut Services in New York,"UPDATE 9th August 21:00 UTC: An earlier version of this article indicated that Bitstamp, not Bitfinex, had withdrawn services from New York.      Kraken and Bitfinex, two of the largest bitcoin exchanges by investment funding and daily trading volume, have indicated they will not be applying for licenses to operate in New York.  The development is the latest in the ongoing debate over the BitLicense, New York's state-specific regulation for bitcoin businesses, which continues to be a lightning rod for criticism from both within the bitcoin community and more widely among mainstream technology advocacy groups. State regulators had previously set 8th August as the submission deadline for business already serving consumers in the third-largest US state by population.  So far, more well-capitalized exchanges including Bitstamp have applied for a BitLicense. Smaller businesses including merchant processor GoCoin and altcoin exchange Poloniex, however, recently revelead they would not continue efforts to reach customers in the state.  Based in San Francisco, Kraken and its executives have long had a contentious relationship with US regulators, withdrawing services from the domestic market in early 2014 and stopping all US dollar services until October. US dollar trading is still not available for US residents.  The exchange wrote:  ""While we’re sure that the protection from New York law enforcement is valuable, it comes at a price that exceeds the market opportunity of servicing New York residents. Therefore, we have no option but to withdraw our service from the state.""  In statements to CoinDesk, Powell suggested the move was likely to affect the ""several thousand"" clients of the exchange. Despite the sometimes political rhetoric, however, Powell implied there were also strong business motivations behind the action.  ""The increasing competition in the US did play a role in the calculation,"" Powell said. ""We don't see the entire NY exchange market being worth the costs associated with compliance with the BitLicense, and we sure don't see the point in bleeding out over a red ocean.""  Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex was more straightforward with its announcement, quoting from the BitLicense before indicating it would be ceasing services in the state as of the 8th August deadline.  Both exchanges indicated they would continue to monitor the regulatory situation in New York with the goal of re-opening services.  Political ammo  In its blog post on the subject, Kraken used exaggerated language to impart its stance on the law, characterizing it as a ""foul"" and ""cruel"" beast that was more formidable than the mythological creature whose name the exchange has adopted.  The informal introduction aside, Kraken suggested it did not apply as the BitLicense does not guarantee bitcoin companies the ability to obtain banking services, offer protection from unlicensed competitors or come with an exemption from traditional money service business (MSB) licensing. To operate in New York, exchanges must either receive a New York banking charter or be more broadly registered in the country as an MSB.  Notably, the company characterized New York as a market too small to justify the expense of the licensing process.  Applications for the BitLicense cost $5,000, a figure that doesn't include additional charges for document preparation and personnel allocation.  In light of the cost, Powell implied Kraken simply saw moving its focus on customer growth abroad as a better way to allocate its spending.  ""We'll spend our money on blue oceans and green pastures and maybe get back to New York when sanity has emerged and we've got a bigger bankroll,"" Powell remarked.  Fund withdrawal  Bitfinex indicated it would modify its terms of services as a result of the decision, stating that customers would need to withdraw funds by 21:00 BST on 15th August.  The exchange also detailed how its process will be modified to reduce its liability for unlawful deposits from New York residents.  ""We strongly encourage New York residents to specify ‘Locked Withdrawal Addresses’ that we will use to automatically sweep any funds that may be sent to one of your deposit addresses in the future,"" the exchange wrote. ""Failure to set these Locked Withdrawal Addresses will result in the automatic liquidation of future deposits.""  Those with funds in the exchange, it said, will have any cryptocurrency converted to US dollars after the 15th August deadline.  ""The resulting USD balance will be available in customer accounts for customers to access at any time,"" the post said.  New York residents will be unable to use any of the exchanges services, including its fiat and digital currency trading services.  Bitfinex did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

42398562,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDCr,1439128825,Will Regulation Dictate the Location of the World’s Bitcoin Hub?,"Jean-Louis Schiltz is a guest professor at the University of Luxembourg and legal advisor to several virtual currency companies (since his first involvement with bitcoin through MIT Media Lab). He is also a former Cabinet minister in Luxembourg. In this article, he examines whether it is possible for one place to emerge as the world's bitcoin hub and whether regulation will have a hand in this.  Bitcoin and its regulation have been hot topics in and around the financial industry for some time now.  In the early days, the focus was (to repurpose a Shakespearian quote): to regulate or not to regulate?  Now, a small number of jurisdictions, such as the UK and New York, have moved to the next step: either they are in the course of determining what parts of bitcoin businesses should be regulated and how (as is the case in the UK), or they have recently adopted a regulatory framework specifically for virtual currencies (as is the case in New York).  Other jurisdictions decided quite some time ago to regulate large areas of bitcoin activity. One example of such a jurisdiction is Luxembourg.  Bitcoin regulation in Luxembourg  Luxembourg’s regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), has been at the forefront of the move towards regulating bitcoin, in that the CSSF announced – on Valentine’s Day 2014 – that professional bitcoin actors must be regulated.  Firstly, it stated that virtual currencies are considered money just like fiat currency and, secondly, it recalled that no financial activity can be carried out in Luxembourg without authorization from the financial regulator.  One key message from the CSSF to the bitcoin community – almost two full weeks before Mt Gox went bankrupt – was to warn them not to try to set up businesses in Luxembourg that would not pay attention to regulation.  Bitcoiners have since been on notice that they would not be allowed to develop their business in a Wild West environment in Luxembourg.  A recipe for success  Perhaps more importantly, by issuing its statement more than 15 months ago, the CSSF gave bitcoin companies the basic regulatory recipe for success.  In its statement, the CSSF outlined a number of basic principles that remain valid and might now even be considered mainstream principles for digital currencies in the light of the recent New York regulations.  This is particularly true with respect to the regulatory status of exchanges. Despite the fact that the term 'exchange' cannot be found in the CSSF statement, the Luxembourg regulator describes possible categories of regulated activities such as issuing means of payments, provision of payment services and setting up markets or platforms.  Moreover, in the final sentence of its statement, the CSSF advises bitcoin actors to define their business purpose and activity in such a way that the regulator would be able to immediately determine what categories of regulated activities the entity would need to be licensed to conduct its business in an orderly fashion.  While perhaps slightly elliptic, this final bit of advice does not only constitute a clear pro-regulation statement, but also establishes that, depending on their activities, bitcoin actors might well become payment institutions, electronic money institutes, markets or multilateral trading facilities under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or possibly even banks in a few months or years.  Applying existing rules  It is also interesting that, unlike New York, the CSSF did not put in place or invent one or more new categories of regulated entities, but rather applied existing EU rules to new types of businesses.  Further, its statement implies that risk mitigation, in general, and anti-money laundering concerns, in particular, are better addressed in a regulated environment than in a non-regulated one.  The same is true for consumer protection, even though we are never going to have a zero-risk world for bitcoin consumers. But, risk exists in the real world (as opposed to the virtual world) and in the old e-commerce world, too.  Remember, no one is obliged to do business, or get involved as a consumer, with virtual currencies, and that is a major difference between virtual currency and fiat currency.  One hub  While I have the impression that some jurisdictions seem to think they are in a race to become the one and only bitcoin hub, I do not believe there can, or will be, just one such hub.  For obvious regulatory reasons, hubs will first arise on both sides of the Atlantic and probably in Asia, too.  Those hubs may well arise in the places where key financial actors in Europe and in the US already conduct business. As for Europe, I predict that one or two hubs will emerge within the Eurozone and another will develop outside the Eurozone (perhaps even outside the European Union).  That said, and assuming more and more bitcoin and other virtual currency actors follow the payment rail route (that is concentrate on business-to-business activities aiming at facilitating payments, thus putting the correspondent banking system under attack), there could well be more than a few virtual currency hubs around the world in the very near future.  Digital currencies will then be everywhere. Whether it is going to be bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency that will be in the lead is a different question.
