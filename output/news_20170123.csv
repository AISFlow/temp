42427292,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Enh,1485214566,Proposed 'Ethereum' Investment Vehicle Sparks Controversy,"The non-profit Ethereum Foundation that holds the trademark for the name 'ethereum' said today it is ""addressing"" New York-based Grayscale Investments' newly revealedhttps://grayscale.co/ethereum-investment-trust/ Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trust proposal.  A subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Grayscale plans for the investment vehicle to provide a means for accredited investors to gain exposure to a publicly traded digital asset called ethereum classic (ETC) by creating an open-ended, titled security.  The problem: While there's one trademark, there are two versions of the cryptocurrency network bearing a variation of the ethereum name, one of which is not the so-called ""official"" version of the software.  Following a hard fork last June that resulted from the infamous collapse of The DAO, supporters of ethereum classic continued development on ethereum's original blockchain (ETH).  In the early days following the fork some influential members of the ethereum community supported the existence of the competing blockchain. But more recently others have alleged that ETC's existence contributes to confusion over which software is supported by the platform's creators.  Though no formal actions have been taken by the Ethereum Foundation to stop ethereum classic's use of the name, potential confusion over the newly unveiled plans for an ethereum classic trust may force their hand.  It was only last month that the Ethereum Foundation officially received the ""ethereum"" trademark, and today a representative for the organization told CoinDesk that its legal team is once again involved:  ""The Ethereum Foundation is aware of this issue and is addressing it.""  Details about what exactly that response might be are not currently being revealed, but ideas about possible directions forward are beginning to emerge.  ""The Ethereum Foundation has heard the concerns of the community,"" the representative went on to say.  'Nothing to rename'  At this stage, however, it remains to be seen how the situation will play out – and how much will spill over into the public domain.  In an email to CoinDesk, Digital Currency Group founder and CEO Barry Silbert downplayed concerns about the potential name confusion.  Silbert reiterated that the formal name of the trust includes the ETC designation, an abbreviation that he said clearly denotes ethereum classic, and not ETH, the designation for ethereum.  The founder added that the since the trust has not yet launched, ""there is literally nothing to rename"".  Nevertheless, the response on social media has been strong, with influential members of the ethereum community calling for the Foundation to enforce its claims on the trademark. At press time, a social media campaign had even been launched to raise awareness of the issue.  Joe Lubin, an ethereum co-founder and founder of startup ConsenSys, went so far as to warn on Twitter that if the foundation doesn't protect its trademark, it may lose it.  In an email sent to CoinDesk, Lubin clarified that he is not personally pursuing any action against Grayscale.  He added that he believes a cease-and-desist letter could prove sufficient to resolve the dispute prior to the foundation taking any formal legal action.  Lubin added in a separate email:  ""I and ConsenSys have no involvement. It is an Ethereum Foundation issue.""  Gray area at Grayscale  Yet, the dispute between the Ethereum Foundation and Grayscale highlights previously existing concerns that, perhaps, the trademark isn't enforceable in this context.  In a lengthy blog post on the site of the Berns Weiss law firm in September, managing partner Jeffrey Berns reviewed the potential grounds for a dispute based on both copyright and trademark, considering that ethereum classic is actually running on the original blockchain.  Berns wrote at the time that those who ""have advocated that the Foundation pursue intellectual property claims against ethereum classic, do not have a strong understanding of US intellectual property law.""  In conversation with CoinDesk, Berns, who has also taken up a fight against the IRS on behalf of Coinbase customers, argued that the Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trust ""appears to have chosen its name for the purpose of causing confusion"" between the two blockchains.  Berns continued:  ""As a law firm that has dedicated its practice to protecting the rights of consumers and investors, we are concerned that this investment trust is attempting to use the ethereum name deceptively to stimulate investment in a competing technology""  Uncertain timetable  Regardless, Silbert told CoinDesk the open-ended trust won't launch until ethereum classic's monetary policy is finalized.  In particular, he noted uncertainty about a potential ""hard cap"" on the amount of ether classic that can be created in the future, a feature that he said could determine how work proceeds.  As part of that effort, a development team is being recruited for ethereum classic by blockchain developer Igor Artamonov, with further refinements to the ethereum classic improvement protocol being conducted by Snaproll, according to Avtar Sehra, who presented at the ETC monetary policy event in London last year.  Ethereum classic project coordinator Arvicco told CoinDesk that the monetary policy discussion is still ""ongoing"" with forthcoming events planned in China this month and next month, likely resulting in ""some kind of consensus"" by March.  Still, Arvicco downplayed the idea that the dispute is one that would result in any changes on what has been announced.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Since [the] Grayscale announcement made it very clear beyond any doubt that it is ethereum classic that is the focus of their investment fund, I find the claims that it is somehow misleading quite ridiculous.""

42427286,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Ebh,1485208817,'Lack of Interest': Freelance Market Fiverr Drops Bitcoin Payments,"Freelancer marketplace Fiverr has discontinued bitcoin payments, citing a lack of interest.  The marketplace made headlines in early 2014 when it partnered with Coinbase. At the time, the company said that it “will be in the forefront of marketplaces embracing this new digital currency and security standards”.  Nearly three years later, the marketplace is calling it quits.  Redditors spotted the change over the weekend, highlighting how Fiverr had dropped bitcoin as a payment option. An email reportedly distributed to users suggested that the move was effective 19th January.  When reached for comment, senior PR manager Sam Katzen confirmed that Fiverr was dropping the option.  He told CoinDesk:  “Our removal of bitcoin as a payment option was due to an unfortunate lack of interest.""  Launched in 2010, Fiverr enables job outsourcing, with gigs being offered for contracts as low as $5. When it first adopted bitcoin payments, Fiverr joined a nascent yet promising ecosystem for freelancing, which included companies like Coinality and a subreddit dedicated to the use case.

42427293,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Ehh,1485204310,Bitcoin Devs Are Feeling More Optimistic About MimbleWimble,"Work is advancing on a highly anticipated bitcoin project originally proposed by an anonymous cryptographer going under the French name of Harry Potter's nemesis.  Named after one of the book series' spells, MimbleWimble has quickly became one of the more anticipated bitcoin R&D initiatives, since it is believed it could help improve upon the scalability and fungibility of bitcoin in a unique way.  One of the major downsides of the original design, however, was that despite granting greater privacy and scalability, it looked like it might not support many of bitcoin's more complicated scripts (which allow users to use more advanced transactions).  But, it looks to be progressing on that front.  Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra provided the update on the MimbleWimble mailing list, where he dives into the possibilities of the proposed change.  For the non-technical, the gist is that it might be possible to plug many of bitcoin's current capabilities into the new style of transactions. (The proposed change amounts to adding support for hash pre-images, a cryptographic tool that could enable a few fancier transaction types).  Although, the plan is still likely to implement it as an altcoin or a sidechain.  Poelstra went into some more detail about some of the capabilities MimbleWimble could potentially support, such as zero-knowledge contingent payments (which allow users to buy information privately), and cross-chain atomic swaps (which let users exchange cryptocurrencies in a decentralized way).  But, it's a new idea, and none of the details are set in stone yet.  Poelstra mentioned that this would require a small change to MimbleWimble, but that it might be worth ""a full paper with more detail.""

42427300,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Erh,1485192970,Montréal Bitcoin ATM Stolen in Late-Night Robbery,"The late-night robbery of a Montreal grocery store last night resulted in the apparent theft of an on-site bitcoin ATM.  According to information provided to CoinDesk, the Euromarché grocery store on Rue Lachapelle in Montréal was targeted around 10:30pm EST. A store representative reported two unidentified individuals were involved with the theft.  Camera footage was taken of the incident and provided to local authorities with a formal report, the representative said. The store was closed when the theft took place.  The ATM was a Lamassu brand machine, operated by vendor Instacoin (which runs machines in cities like Toronto, Ottowa and Montréal, according to CoinATMRadar.com). Instacoin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The representative said that the ATM had been located at the store for roughly three years, and that this is the first crime to occur in conjunction with its operation.  The theft comes more than a year after thieves struck an Atlanta smoke shop, an incident during which one of the assailants fired their gun at the floor. Further, it follows reports that as many as 70 bitcoin ATMs in the US Midwest have been attacked as part of a dispute between two rival firms.

42427294,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Eph,1485183620,Nasdaq Declares Blockchain Voting Trial a ‘Success’,"Exchange operator Nasdaq has released its conclusions about a blockchain e-voting trial it conducted in Estonia last year.  A new Nasdaq report, published today, details the project, which it unveiled in February 2016. At the time, the company's officials said they hoped to reduce both the complexity and cost of organizing shareholder votes as part of a bid to boost overall participation.  Overall, it concluded: ""This model successfully demonstrated how a blockchain could be used for something other than transaction settlement.""  Nasdaq leveraged information from Estonia’s e-Residency platform as a basis for creating voting accounts.  Working with blockchain startup Chain, Nasdaq developed a system in which digital assets signifying voting rights – and tokens to be used to actually cast votes – were distributed to shareholders. Nasdaq first announced its partnership with the startup in mid-2015.  Here’s how Nasdaq describes the system as it functions:  ""The system uses the blockchain in the traditional way to record the ownership of securities as reported by the CSD. Based on those holdings, the system also issues voting right assets and voting token assets for each shareholder. A user may spend voting tokens to cast their votes on each meeting agenda item if they also own the voting right asset.""  Feedback from the test was positive overall, the firm said. At the same time, participants highlighted the need for more mobile support, specifically a dedicated app through which votes could be cast.  Among those testing the solution were LHV Group, which has explored the tech in the past, developing a digital wallet that uses bitcoin as a payment rail.  Elsewhere, a number of exchanges worldwide have been exploring the same concept in recent months, along with proxy voting firms like Broadridge. Nasdaq's next steps include applying the framework and lessons learned from the Estonia project to other areas.  ""We will explore how this successful [proof-of-concept] can potentially be applied to other Nasdaq internal and client-facing solutions,"" the company said.

42427287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Edh,1485180905,Bitcoin Options Firm LedgerX Crosses Key Launch Hurdle,"The wait is almost over for LedgerX, a New York-based bitcoin swaps startup with a board boasting a who's who of financial sector bigwigs.  After two years of building, the firm that had already raised $1.5m from Google Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and others, says it is now ready to push for its final approval from the US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  If granted, LedgerX would be able to launch a federally regulated bitcoin options exchange and the first clearing house to list and clear fully collateralized, physically settled bitcoin options for the institutional market.  In fact, LedgerX quietly overcame what its team believes is its last hurdle toward that goal in December.  The problem was, to protect LedgerX’s future customers, the startup was required to hold a minimum amount of capital relative to its expected business volume – cash the startup didn't have. In response, LedgerX managed to raise an undisclosed amount of capital from Miami International Holdings, Inc.  The startup's co-founder Juthica Chou told CoinDesk the cash infusion was the last piece of the puzzle that needed to fall into place before the CFTC could make its final decision.  Of course, the regulatory body that oversees US futures and options markets could still say no.  Speaking with CoinDesk at LedgerX's New York headquarters, Chou explained why her company raised the capital, and what a federally regulated clearing house for bitcoin could mean for the stability of the cryptocurrency's price.  She said:  ""It's really been our focus to really have a clearing house for bitcoin. Because it is a bearer asset, clearing and settling is riskier, and we think that having a regulated clearing house, under a great federal regulator like the CFTC, will bring legitimacy to the ecosystem and allow a lot of new sets of institutional customers to participate.""  An industry first  While bitcoin-to-bitcoin derivatives already exist, as do cash-to-cash derivatives, this suite of investment products would be the first to let US dollars settle to bitcoin, according to Chou. Such a product could potentially help decrease price volatility for the cryptocurrency, which has a current market cap of $16.1bn.  Initially, LedgerX plans to release physically settled 'puts and calls' – the most basic, or 'vanilla' options that a swaps execution facility (SEF) can offer – for a tenure of between one and six months.  Though the firm isn’t allowed to take on customers until after it receives CFTC approval, Chou said she breaks down her potential clients into three categories: institutional companies that are naturally long on bitcoin, institutions that are naturally short, and traders that sit in the middle to provide liquidity.  In the end, though, one of the most valuable side-effects of receiving the CFTC license could end up being the data generated by LedgerX, according to Chou.  Currently, she said, industry data is focused on realized volatility data. But with LedgerX's emergence on the market, the company could launch options products that result in potentially valuable implied volatility data.  She said:  ""I think that data will be important to LedgerX, but also really important to customers.""  Competitive ecosystem  While LedgerX may indeed achieve a series of industry firsts, it is by no means alone in offering bitcoin swaps.  New Jersey-based TeraExchange, for example, was granted a temporary registration as a swap execution facility (SEF) in September 2013. Since settling with the CFTC for failing to enforce certain prohibitions, the platform now offers a short-term bitcoin forward, settled in US dollars, as well as offering a bitcoin price index.  While TeraExchange tends to focus on linear swaps, LedgerX hopes to list options which could allow customers to monetize bitcoin's volatility, even while possibly minimizing that same volatility.  Another distinction Chou makes is that, if LedgerX is approved, customers will be able to receive actual bitcoin as settlement and not just dividends in US dollars equal to the value in bitcoin.  TeraExchange declined to comment for this report.  The newly confirmed acting chairman of the CFTC, Christopher Giancarlo, laid out his plans to only lightly regulate blockchain-related products last week at the SEFCON conference in New York, dedicated to the swaps industry. Notably, LedgerX co-founder Paul Chou sits on the CFTC tech advisory committee, while former CFTC commissioner Mark Wetjen sits on LedgerX's board of directors.  Perhaps the biggest impact an eventual CFTC approval could have on the market is the creation of an SEF that is also a derivatives clearing organization (DCO). As a DCO, LedgerX would become the first federally regulated entity to guarantee bitcoin clearing and settlement of trades.  Juthica Chou said:  ""The round was designed to help us meet minimum financial requirements necessary to become a derivatives clearing organization and a swap execution facility of the CFTC.""  A more stable bitcoin?  The result of an increasingly diverse derivatives market could be a less volatile bitcoin price, according to Chou and other industry observers.  ARK Invest analyst and blockchain products lead Chris Burniske is quick to point out that there are many kinds of swaps that LedgerX and others could build, and not all of them would necessarily result in increased liquidity.  But over time, a more diverse ecosystem of bitcoin derivatives could give institutional investors and traders more control over their risk, increasing ""appetite for volatile assets like bitcoin"" and resulting in deeper bitcoin market liquidity, he said.  ""More liquid markets generally work to decrease volatility,"" said Burniske, ""as order books can better absorb buy and sell shocks.""  And while Chou says LedgerX plans to start 'vanilla', she added that the firm expects to expand its offering once the license is granted and business stabilizes.  Chou concluded:  ""I think we’ll see a number of interesting derivatives products, some of them not completely reinventing the wheel, and some of them pretty different than what we’ve seen in any other commodity.""

42427296,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Evh,1485179436,Deloitte Officially Opens Dublin Blockchain Lab,"Deloitte has officially opened its Dublin-based blockchain lab.  Announced in May, the EMEA Financial Services Blockchain Lab is based in Dublin’s so-called ""Silicon Docks"" neighborhood, a hub for startups and companies in Ireland that has been attracting increased interest in the wake of the UK's exit from the European Union.  Deloitte's existing blockchain development team in Ireland – numbering some 25 developers – will relocate from Deloitte Ireland's headquarters to the new offices. The firm plans to grow the size of its development team to as much as 50 over the course of 2017.

But it is becoming increasingly clear that this technology is transforming the infrastructure underpinning financial services and other industries. It is bringing dramatic improvements in efficiency and customer experience.""  The opening comes days after Deloitte launched a New York-based lab for blockchain development.  Based in the Wall Street district, the lab – along with the just-opened Dublin spot – form part of a broader network of development hubs Deloitte is aiming to assemble.

42427290,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Ejh,1485172813,China's Bitcoin Exchanges End No-Fee Trading in Market Shake-Up,"China's 'Big Three' bitcoin exchange businesses are taking new steps to ""curb speculation"" and ""prevent volatility"" in the nascent digital currency market.  Announced this weekend, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin – the country's largest bitcoin trading platforms by volume – jointly revealed their intention to end their years-long practice of offering no-fee bitcoin trades, introducing a 0.2% fixed-rate fee on all buy and sell orders for bitcoin and the alternative digital currency litecoin beginning 24th January.  The announcement is the latest that finds China's major bitcoin trading platforms responding to apparent regulatory pressures from the People's Bank of China (PBoC).  Following bitcoin's rise to near all-time highs at the beginning of this year, the startups have faced new scrutiny from the central bank, which appears to have taken a more active interest in their offerings. News came just days after all three exchanges ended margin trading, and talk soon followed that pricing changes could be forthcoming.  BTCC, the most vocal of China's major exchanges since discussions were made public on 6th January, said it is reconsidering how it would price trades.  Over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong indicated his belief that the policy shifts will impact liquidity in the markets by making high-frequency trading less appealing, changes that he foresees having affect on other exchange users.  Yet, Zhao cautioned he believes the move could be temporary, telling CoinDesk:  ""The price suggested is even higher than most foreign bitcoin exchanges. I don't think Chinese exchanges will insist on such high fees due to market competition, especially if there are other exchanges that charge zero fees.""  At press time, the announcements did not seem to be having a negative impact on the price of bitcoin, which (while volatile) traded higher on 22nd January than it did over much of the proceeding week.  Elsewhere, the decision was greeted with enthusiasm. Broad and Bright partner Roland Su, legal lead for the China-based blockchain consortium Hyperledger, told CoinDesk he believes fees will help the market become less speculative.  ""The trading volume will drop, but won't hurt the price too much,"" he predicted.  The cop effect  In interview, China-based traders and market representatives preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of the recent announcement, and how, while the central bank has yet to ban bitcoin trading, it had made clear that change was required.  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, said that the announcements represented a recognition by exchanges that the PBoC was concerned about prices rising ""too high, too fast"", and that this, as well as suspicions it may be used for capital flight, helped spark the action.  ""The regulators have their opinion, they want more real volume. We got together to be one step ahead,"" Lee said.  Lee went on to note that bitcoin is not yet regulated in China, and that as such, the PBoC is also fairly restrained in how it can oversee the nascent industry. Overall, he compared this to the arrival of a cop on a highway, noting that the natural reaction of drivers is to slow their speed in such a scenario, even when no action is taken on behalf of law enforcement.  Likewise, representatives from Huobi indicated that most of its customers understood the reason for the decision and that it met customer expectations.  The exchange also sought to downplay concerns that it could face new business pressures as a result in the change in fees, with a representative stating:  ""Huobi's service is as good as before and it still attracts an international market.""  Representatives from OKCoin declined further comment, emphasizing the firm's written statements.  Market reactions  The reactions from general enthusiasts and traders were more mixed, however.  On social media, some praised the news as a way to bring exchanges – as well as bitcoin as a technology – more in line with expectations from local regulators. Others celebrated what they considered to be an end to practices that they believe to be contributing to an overrepresentation of China-based exchanges in global exchange volume.  Still, other observers said that international exchanges could move to lower fees in a bid to stoke competition.  When asked if there was any agreement that China's exchanges would hold to the pricing model for a set time, Lee provided no firm answer, stating that it remains to be seen whether certain ""behaviors"" will be required of domestic exchanges.  ""I think the future will tell us. I don't know the answer,"" he said.  Other more obscure theories abounded as well, with market analyst George Samman stating that he believes the new fees could push China-based traders toward alternative digital currencies and blockchain-based assets with higher potential returns.  Sticking with the plan  Notably, the announcement will not affect another bitcoin exchange that had just last week promised to follow what it called China's successful no-fee policies.  In statements, representatives from London-based Coinfloor said the exchange remains committed to the offering and that the exchange is excited about winning new business.  ""We always rethink things but we came to the same conclusion – no trading fees is the way to go,"" founder Mark Lamb told CoinDesk.  Such statements suggest bitcoin's exchange market could see more changes in the days and weeks ahead as the market adjusts to the news.

42427285,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1EZh,1485169240,Why a New Small Business Blockchain is Actually a Big Deal,"Efforts to apply blockchain in the supply chain took an interesting turn last week.  I'm speaking, of course, about a piece of news that at first seemed pretty ordinary: a group of European banks announced they would band together to develop a blockchain-based trade finance solution.  This one, though, is unusual.  Rather than tackle large-scale global transactions that cross oceans, the project focuses on intra-European trade, and, more importantly, between small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  Why is this interesting? It's not because SMEs make up the vast majority of the world's businesses (although that certainly does make for a compelling use case). Rather, it's because of what it says about the evolving nature of trade finance.  We have seen many blockchain projects take a run at the subject, and the application seems obvious. Transactions across borders generally involve significant documentation, a process that itself generates numerous errors and gross inefficiencies.  Reducing the burden associated with getting goods from one place to another has to be a good thing, right?  Let's take a look.  Starting smaller  Most of the projects to date have focused on large international corporations, which is understandable, given that over two-thirds of world trade originates with global enterprises.  Where both the pain and potential promise are most acutely felt, however, is not in conglomerates, but in SMEs. In part, it's because of their sheer number, but mainly, it's due to financial trends.  Approximately 80% of global trade is now conducted through open account transactions, not via traditional channels using letters of credit. This means that there is no bank guarantee of payment.  The buyer pays when it's time to pay – usually well after the product has been delivered.  For many large corporations, this shift reflects tighter restrictions many banks are facing on lending and guarantees, as well as a desire to improve working capital and reduce administration and financing costs.  For most SMEs, open account is their only option, since over half of SME trade finance applications are declined.  Win-win situation  In open account transactions, trust becomes a huge factor. This is an issue when initiating a new commercial relationship, especially for SMEs with patchy or non-existent credit histories.  Without going into the details of how the new platform will work, the ability to see, in real-time, the status of the transaction at each step should make trust more transparent. Accelerating the process from order to settlement will increase liquidity.  The incorporation of the management of the respective banking functions (payment, factoring, etc) aims to facilitate the procedure even further, and could increase margins for both the banks and their participating clients.  Seen from the exporting SME's point of view, the project could be a way to overcome obstacles created by the shifting sands of finance and politics. And from the banks’ point of view, not only will it help to retain and support SME customers, it is also an effective way for banks to re-intermediate themselves into the trade finance process.  Starting within the relatively ""safe"" confines of the European Union gives the project a chance to test the process of cross-border trade before venturing into more complicated territory.  What's next  If things go according to plan, we shouldn’t have to wait long to see how the project fares with target users. It is already a working proof-of-concept, developed last year by Belgian bank KBC.  Opening it up to six other European institutions is an obvious step toward scalability, presenting a way to test cross-border relationships within a manageable group before it's global.  The team will start to seek regulatory approval within the next few months, with a view to going ""live"" before the year's end.  Looking forward, the compelling advantage of lower transaction costs and stronger commercial relationships could help to partially offset the uncertainty and potential price of rising interest rates and shifting trade barriers.  It's not hard to see how projects like this could help to prepare businesses around the world for the changes ahead, and to adapt to not only current trends, but future ones as well.
