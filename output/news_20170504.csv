42427540,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVwRh,1493928351,"Bitcoin Drops $100 in One Hour, Slowing Torrid Price Growth","The price of bitcoin took a sudden nosedive at 18:40 UTC today, dropping $100 from $1,594 to $1,495 over the course of just an hour of trading.    At press time, the price of bitcoin had recovered to $1,511 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), which charts the average price of bitcoin across major exchanges.    Still, the decline put a damper on what was the technology's run-up to $1,600, as the price peaked just shy of that milestone. Despite the declines, however, bitcoin was still up 2% at time of writing, less than a day after crossing the $1,500 line.  CoinDesk reported earlier today that bitcoin had climbed above $1,500 for the first time ever, buoyed by bullishness among the world's digital currency traders. Positive sentiment out of Japan in the wake of legislative actions around the tech has also been cited by some.  The move also caps a month of progressive price gains in bitcoin markets, having hovered around an average price of $1,143 on 4th April – signifying a jump of roughly $450 in just over a month.

Even as bitcoin surged above $1,500 late last night – and crossed the $1,600 on several exchanges this afternoon – the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies as listed by market capitalization have seen price increases of at least 8% today.  Ripple's XRP token is emerging as the early winner, rising more than 40%, with an average price of about $0.079 across exchanges. Likewise, litecoin – which has already seen significant price rises in recent days ahead of an expected adoption of the scaling solution SegWit – is up about 22% on the day.  And ether, the cryptocurrency underlying the ethereum network, is up about 14%, at an average price of roughly $89 to reach an all-time high.  As reported by CoinDesk, the development comes amid a larger shift in the cryptocurrency markets that has seen an increasing diversification away from bitcoin. At press time, the Bitcoin Dominance Index, a measurement of the percent of the total market cap invested in bitcoin, had fallen below 60% for the first time in its history.  Still, analysts were largely short on comment when reached.  While some pointed to the technical benefits of various platforms, others were at a loss for words, responding with simple statements such as ""WTF"" or crediting the increases to ""pumping and FOMO"".

The government pledged more than a year ago to solve the policy dilemma, wherein Australian businesses are liable for goods-and-services (GST) taxes on any bitcoin sold – as well as taxes should they take them as payment. It's a point of criticism expressed for years by the country's bitcoin community, culminating with last year's commitment.  According to statements published today, the government is consulting with its fintech advisory group on the matter – though it cautioned that any material changes would depend on action on the provincial level.  The policy document, released by Minister for Small Business Michael McCormack, explained:  ""Any change to the GST treatment of digital currencies is subject to formal state and territory agreement.""  As for when those changes might be in place, the government didn't offer a firm deadline.  In the document, the government also reiterated its support for Australia's digital currency space, declaring that its plans to regulate exchanges under existing AML/KYC statues would help foster development in the sector.  ""The Government is committed to facilitating innovation and growth in the digital currency sector and considers that appropriate anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regulation will aid that development,"" it said.  It's the latest sign that Australia's government wants to create an accommodative environment for both bitcoin and blockchain activities.  Indeed, the country has seen a number of key blockchain developments in the past year, including a bid by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) to explore the tech (in partnership with blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings) for use as a possible replacement to its existing settlement systems.  ASX told investors this week that the project is ""on track"", and it intends to make a decision on whether to adopt it for full-scale use later this year.

Hundsun, according to data from Thomson Reuters, provides software services to financial institutions such as banks, brokers and exchange operators.  The firm is partly owned by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, who founded e-commerce giant Alibaba, after Ma spent more than $500m in mid-2014 to buy a controlling stake, per reports at the time Past statements from Hundsun indicate that it has been looking to invest in financial technology startups since as early as January.  When reached, a representative for Symbiont declined to comment on the amount Hundsun invested in Symbiont. In addition to providing the funds, Hundsun will gain a board observer.  The partnership between the two firms will see Hundsun opening up Symbiont’s smart contract software to its Chinese customer base. In particular, the partnership will focus on ""[streamlining] business processes in both public and private securities markets"", according to Symbiont.  Guan Xiaolan, Hundsun's executive president, said in a statement:  ""We selected Symbiont because of its superior, mature and highly differentiated DLT stack. Its data layer is protected by market-leading security and privacy solutions, and its smart contracts have a proven ability to automate complex business logic, such as highly tailored employee compensation waterfalls for private companies.""  The investment comes just under two years after Symbiont raised $1.25m in seed funding.

42399828,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyonG,1493901910,Yours May Have Just Sent The First Real Bitcoin Lightning Payment,"Best known as one of the more ambitious technologies for increasing bitcoin's throughput, implementations of the Lightning Network have yet to launch, partly because they depend on a yet-to-be-implemented protocol upgrade, known as Segregated Witness (SegWit).  That's where the version put forth by Yours aims to stand apart.  It's one of the only Lightning-style projects that doesn't require this feature. (One other is Teechan, though it takes a very different direction with the help of secure hardware.) And, as such, it's perhaps the only version that offers a basic form of payment routing that works with bitcoin's current code – a necessary piece of the puzzle for micropayments to work as the project has advertised.  For those who are new to the idea, Yours mirrors the popular blog platform Medium, but adds a paywall that requires a tiny fee to access each post. So, it's no surprise then that making bitcoin micropayments easier is key to the firm's business model.  The major caveat to the project's version is that the transactions are not as smooth or trust-minimizing as those envisioned for the other alternative implementations of payment channels.  Still, Yours CEO Ryan X Charles believes that's a noteworthy achievement in its own right.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This is the first routed micropayment with a trustless layer-two system on bitcoin that actually works on bitcoin right now.""  However, Charles acknowledged that his implementation, too, would be better served by the SegWit upgrade that other versions of Lightning are waiting for. The payment experience is not as seamless without it, he said, and Yours intends to add support for the upgrade, if and when it's added to bitcoin.  Payment test  During an interview and system preview last week, Yours sent CoinDesk a test micropayment – perhaps one of the first Lightning-style transactions using bitcoin – through its test website.  Overall, the experience replicates how the project will encourage consumers to access content with small micropayments, or create content, such as blogs, tutorials or news articles in exchange for those payments.  Charles stressed that the interface is a work in progress (the demo isn't open to the public yet). Yet, it offers an interesting look at how micropayments for content might work on Yours in the future.  The default value to charge readers is $0.10, but authors can change it to any micropayment amount.  To test the service, I put together a short post about cats. Charles then clicked the '10¢ Purchase' button to unlock the rest of my story.  Issues remain  However, while the demo works, the user experience is a bit wonky – at least for now. Charles argued that this is partly because, with the growing demand for bitcoin in recent years, the network has seen a rise in average transaction fees.  Before our call, Charles set up a payment channel with $10 in value to ensure that he would be able to pay for blog content, as well as the transaction fees required to open and close a micropayment channel.  It's the same story for 'cashing out', or redeeming your bitcoin as a content author. In order to make the payment 'worth' the fees, Yours recommends that users wait until they have enough money to send a larger payment.  ""Fees matter a lot for how well the Lightning Network will work,"" Yours co-founder Clemens Ley said, adding that there are about five total fees needed in the micropayment channel lifecycle.  Although my cat content only cost him $0.10, Charles said that he needed to send me enough micropayments to close the channel on the bitcoin blockchain. He needed to then click the '10¢ Purchase' button over and over again, until it reached $4, highlighting one of the potential limits to the user experience.  ""This is not our fault, it's bitcoin's fault,"" he said.  Differing visions  For now, this desire to have a version that's ready today is making Yours a bit of an outlier among Lightning projects.  Most developers working on the concept so far favor creating implementations that are SegWit-compatible, since they believe it offers significant improvements (read up on the details here). Going against the grain, Yours prefers making Lightning-style micropayments possible in the short-term, just in case SegWit never gets implemented on bitcoin.  Ley further noted that his firm's implementation is written in JavaScript, meaning the software can run in the browser, which in turn makes incorporating the channels into web apps easier.  Charles and Ley also perhaps have a slightly different long-term scaling vision than other developers. Charles, at least, is a vocal supporter of on-chain scaling – that is, increasing bitcoin's transaction capacity by making changes to its consensus rules.  One popular vision for the Lightning Network depends on the expectation that users will open and close channels just once or twice per year, and then funnel transactions to many different vendors through the same channel.  However, Charles said it's possible that Yours users will have reason to open channels more often than that, which he believes on-chain scaling could help with.  The trouble with tips  The CEO further sought to differentiate Yours from past 'micropayments for online content' attempts, such as ChangeTip, the shuttered social media tipping service, and bitcoin-powered video platform Streamium.  Besides implementing an advanced micropayments service into the platform, Yours also uses a paywall model, meaning that readers cannot access the content unless they pay.  ""Tipping just doesn't encourage people to pay,"" Charles argued.  His idea is that everyone wins with a content paywall, because the creator and buyer are making an exchange that they both value.  He concluded:  ""You don't have to rely on just goodwill. You don't have to beg people to pay you.""

42399810,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyoUZ,1493893801,"Bitcoin Needs More Politics, Not Less","Jim Harper is a vice president at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. A former counsel to committees in both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, he served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014.  In this opinion piece, Harper discusses the longstanding developer conflicts that have come to define bitcoin's governance, arguing that just because there haven't been any results yet, doesn't mean there won't be.    Two years ago today, politics invaded the world of bitcoin development. It's been non-stop controversy ever since.  But Gavin Andresen's essay series, ""Time to Roll Out Bigger Blocks,"" didn't introduce politics to bitcoin. And the cure for what ails its highly controversial development ecosystem isn't getting rid of politics.  Bitcoin actually needs more and better politics. How bitcoin politics are practiced is up to the community, which might take some lessons from principles of good government.  When Andresen 'went public' with his arguments for bigger blocks, that was the result of political failings on all sides that long predated his writing.  Put simply, there are many competing visions for bitcoin's optimal uses, its future, the risks it faces and how to manage them. While minor improvements to the code continue, nobody so far has been a good enough politician to get their broader vision for bitcoin widely adopted.  So, what gets people to abide by difficult group decisions, even when the decisions go against them?  Lessons from government  The US Constitution requires 'due process' in both the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. That means that US citizens and residents are supposed to get fairness of two types from their governments:  Systems designed to produce correct answers  The right to participate in decisions that affect them.  Elections operate along the same lines, giving everyone, including the losers, a say in who will operate the government. Bitcoin is meant, in part, to help people escape the grasps of hugely fallible governments, of course.  But, you might ask, isn't bitcoin an apolitical system that resists governance?  Governance and government are not the same. Every human system, including bitcoin, has governance. Bitcoin governance is whatever influences or directs the community's decision-making and the software's many encoded policies.  Bitcoin is also inherently political. Politics is essentially human relations at scale. When politics are practiced well, we don't notice it. It's politics done poorly, or running against our interests, that we speak ill of, along with the politicians who practice it.  With a few noisy exceptions on the social media margins, everyone involved in bitcoin protocol and software development is a good faith actor. So, why are their efforts to move forward drawing heaps of derision and failing to advance their visions? It may be the failure to respond to the demand for due process.  Theory of open-source  Bitcoin is a category buster, so let's talk about due process in terms of economics.  In theory, markets work because a large number of buyers and sellers have perfect information, products are homogeneous, transaction costs are low or non-existent and everyone is rational. In practice, buyers and sellers are under-informed, transaction costs are often high and the decision-making of humans is driven away from correct choices by psychological, social, cognitive and emotional factors.  There's a 'perfect markets' theory for open-source software development, too, and it especially fails with respect to bitcoin.  It holds that developers will perfectly perceive the needs of the community and respond to them, that miners will clearly recognize their economic interests and act in accordance with them, that bitcoin users will all oversee this process well, guiding the other sectors of the bitcoin ecosystem toward its highest and best use.  It turns out that everyone isn't an expert in coding, in economics and in perceiving their own interests in an uncertain cryptocurrency future.  Miners and users don't follow the 'perfect governance' script very well themselves, but bitcoin development seems to diverge from theory the most. Developers, it turns out, are humans, who have limited time, information and capacity for cognition. Nobody could incorporate the information necessary to advance the bitcoin project consistent with all the goals held for it across the ecosystem. These fascinating 'developer-humans' exhibit human behaviors like trusting people they know and discounting information from people they don't know.  That's no basis for criticizing any developer, of course, but the leading development team, Bitcoin 'Core' sometimes seems to speak with a unified voice, and sometimes seems to vanish behind the theory that open-source development is just uncoordinated people from which coding decisions emerge.  The solution  In a system with worldwide usage and strong network effects, that makes a lot of people feel they are being denied due process. A lot of people feel they aren't getting a say in a project they feel passionate about. It's easy, despite the fact of good faith all around, to fall into thinking that the process is not designed to produce a correct outcome.  As a congressional staffer in the 1990s, I participated in a meeting where some academics suggested what the future of telecommunications regulation would look like. ""Bits – everything will be bits,"" they said. The direction of communications technology was obvious already, and perpetuating its regulation was not my preferred goal.  But, the meeting was bemusing because in Congress, knowing the right answer is 10% of the problem or less. Getting people convinced of the right answer is the other 90%.  There are many right answers for bitcoin's future. Perhaps, if there were more bitcoin politics, more people could be brought on board with one or more of them.

42399809,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyoVY,1493888401,All Systems Go? Ethereum Domain Effort Prepares for Launch (Again),"After a failed initial launch, an effort to create a decentralized domain register on top of the ethereum blockchain is ready for round two.  The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a leaderless domain system spearheaded by Ethereum Foundation employees Nick Johnson and Alex Van de Sande, originally opened back in mid-March, but when two critical bugs were found at the last minute, the team shut down the launch to regroup, fix problems and hunt for overlooked issues.  Now, two months later, after a thorough post-mortem, including a formal independent audit and the launch of a bug bounty program, the new service is kicking off again. Hopefully, the relaunch will go without a hitch and users could soon begin bidding on domain names using the service.  But, still, the team is remaining diligent should anything else go wrong.  In a recent blog post, Chris Remus, ENS community launch manager, wrote:  ""The team will watch the relaunch closely. Contingency plans are in place to alert the root key holders of the need, if any, to take further action to address unexpected critical bugs.""  What's in a name?  So, why does ethereum need a name service anyway?  The idea is that humans naturally don't do well with hexadecimal addresses. Such addresses are long, too difficult to type out and simply not user friendly.  For example, it will be much easier to do simple things like send ether (the token of the ethereum blockchain) to 'alice.wallet.eth' or pull up content on Swarm (etherum's decentralized storage space) by typing 'alice.swarm.eth', rather than cutting and pasting, or worse having to type, '0x123f681646d4a755815f9cb19e1acc8565a0c2ac'.  Johnson told CoinDesk:  ""It is too easy to make a mistake, accidentally mislay funds or interact with the wrong thing. Being able to type in a human recognizable name and verify it as the correct name is a huge advantage.""  The ENS will come in handy for a number of ethereum resources, for example, smart contracts, wallet addresses, data storage project Swarm hashes, public keys on ethereum's privacy-minded messaging layer Whisper and more.  You could think of ENS as a crucial piece for building decentralized apps on ethereum. Startup project Aragon, for instance, plans to incorporate the system to make DAOs on the platform easier to search for.  In summary, the ENS does two things. It allows users to register domain names, which are then run by smart contracts, which spell out the rules for letting users create subdomains. And it works like an address book, resolving those names with their underlying machine identifiers.  'Slow launch'  Once the initial ENS becomes active on the main blockchain, anyone will be able to register a top-level domain name ending in ""eth"" using an open auction.  But because ENS is undergoing a 'soft launch', not all the names will be available at once. Instead, names will gradually become available over an eight-week period. Short names (anything less than seven characters) won't be available at all for about two years, until the system is upgraded.  In choosing a name, you initiate an auction. The auction has two parts: a three-day sealed bidding period, where you enter the most ether you are willing to pay, and a two-day reveal, where bids become publicly viewable.  A hidden bid ensures that people will not lay in wait and overbid you in the final moments of an auction. New bids are prohibited in the reveal stage.  You won't lose money on the bids. Any ether used to purchase a name are held in a separate deed account against your name. Deeds become transferable only after a year. Once you relinquish a name, you get your deposit back.  As Johnson explained to CoinDesk, the purpose for the auction and deed program is to avoid a ""land rush"" whereby speculators grab popular names and hold on to them for resale. And to establish a fair price for names.  With this plan, Johnson is confident the launch will be a success this time around, concluding:  ""I think we've crossed all the Ts and dotted all the Is.""
