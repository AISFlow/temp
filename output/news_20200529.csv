42431979,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8gHh,1590787370,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Slides, Stocks Tread Water on Trump China Comments","Bitcoin declined for the first time in three days as traders in digital-asset markets and more traditional stocks considered the implications of U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest broadsides against China on the coronavirus and Hong Kong.      Bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $9,400 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping less than a percent over the previous 24 hours after a two-day rally when it rose to $9,600 on Thursday from $8,800 early Wednesday.      Some analysts had warned Trump’s White House press conference might include announcement of draconian actions against China that could lead to a deeper rift (giving traders the jitters earlier Friday). That didn't happen, however. While he announced new, targeted sanctions against Chinese officials and directed his administration to revoke special trade exemptions for Hong Kong, he said he would keep a ""phase one"" trade deal with China intact.      Stocks fell as Trump started speaking Friday afternoon and recovered as he wrapped up his comments and stepped away from the microphone.

In the United States, the S&P 500 index was up by less than a percent.      Bitcoin’s price is holding above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages. Traders studying price charts saw the resilience as bullish, but the anemic trading action could ultimately damp sentiment.      In Europe, the FTSE Eurotop 100 index of the largest stocks by market capitalization ended down 1.7%. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index was little changed.      Henrik Kugelberg, an independent Swedish crypto trader, said heightened U.S.-China tensions might not be all bad for bitcoin because some Chinese investors might look to shift some of their local currency into alternatives, which could provide a boost for the cryptocurrency.      “The Chinese are buying gold and bitcoin,” Kugelberg noted.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly in the green Friday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), gained 2% in 24 hours as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET).      Cryptocurrency winners on the day include ethereum classic (ETC) climbing 6%, cardano (ADA) up 3% and nem (XEM) in the green 1%. All price changes were as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET) Friday.

42431977,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8gBh,1590784577,Amazon Patents Blockchain-Based Product Authenticator,"Amazon, a kingmaker of e-commerce and shipping, has patented a distributed ledger-based (DLT) system for proving the authenticity of consumer goods.      The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office approved the Seattle tech giant’s nearly three-year-old “Distributed ledger certification” filing on Tuesday. The patent describes using DLT to infuse “digital trust from the first mile of an item's supply chain” to the last.      Amazon’s system compiles data from distributors, manufacturers and shippers on an “open framework” that builds a product provenance across information silos. This data could be neatly packaged for the consumer, as shown in the patent drawings.      In a brief that waxed unusually philosophical for dry patent filings, Amazon derided the “proliferation” of “systems and databases that can often lack transparency, coherency, referential integrity or security” – all potential eroders of trust.      These “patchwork” technologies also fail to encompass the global supply chain, Amazon wrote. Amazon is growing ever more critical to that chain: Its own couriers delivered 3.5 billion packages last year, 46% of the total.      Against those existing tech deficiencies, Amazon argued distributed systems offer a compelling solution. It said DLT can protect data from alteration, remove single points of failure and avoid the managerial problems of centralized authority, like bottlenecks.      See also: Big Tech Signs Rare Open Source Pledge to Boost Supplies During COVID-19      Amazon said in the patent that Hyperledger could be one form of DLT used.      Patent filings do not necessarily indicate that a company is using a technology.    Earning trust    “Trust is earned,” wrote Amazon, whose gargantuan e-marketplace is awash in counterfeits, according to the U.S. government. “Once trust is lost, it can often be difficult to regain.”      Last year, Amazon launched a counterfeit detection initiative called “Project Zero” that attempts to intercept phony goods. Amazon officials told the Wall Street Journal in 2018 the company would spend billions of dollars fighting fakes. It was unclear at press time Friday if DLT has played a role in either effort.      U.S. lawmakers remain wary of Amazon’s counterfeit product problem. The buying public is decidedly more trusting. Nearly 39% of respondents to a Morning Consult poll said they trusted Amazon “a lot.” Only the United States Postal Service, which delivers 30% of Amazon's packages, ranked higher.",POSITIVE,없음,WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/29/amazon-patents-blockchain-based-product-authenticator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/171d351706e184d1539fccf764db10ad207b5151-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383890,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ywJX,1590777612,"To Get Serious About Decentralization, We Need to Measure It","Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a PhD in Business Economics from Harvard.      On May 15, Decrypt reported that six weeks after being acquired by Binance, the crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap updated the method by which it ranked exchanges on its site. This update, perhaps unsurprisingly, moved Binance into the top spot. Critics argued CoinMarketCap was basing its rankings on factors that had little to do with the fundamental quality of exchanges, such as liquidity and security. The COO of CoinMarketCap competitor CoinGecko added that CoinMarketCap would need to ""go deeper to get a more holistic picture of things.""      This was not the first data scandal for the popular site, which has committed to refining and expanding its ranking metrics in light of the industry outcry. But it added to a general feeling of frustration regarding the availability of reliable, fair crypto industry metrics. Eustace Cryptus, writing for bitcoinist.com, lamented: ""Will CoinMarketCap ever provide accurate crypto data?""      See also: Stephanie Hurder - How Blockchain Tech Can Make Coronavirus Relief More Effective      Determining a set of metrics that will be used to compare projects, companies or national economies can be a fraught exercise. Even the most stalwart measures of national accounting come with controversy. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had immediate and vocal opponents after its introduction in 1934. Critics of the unemployment rate argue that excluding anyone who is not actively seeking work from the base population misrepresents the status of the labor market. Yet, both of these measures remain widely applied and newsworthy because they provide insight into important dimensions of the health of the economy.      Despite inevitable controversies, it is essential not to abandon the endeavor of measuring economic systems. It would be far more challenging to grasp the novel coronavirus's unprecedented impact on the U.S. labor force, for example, without weekly unemployment reports from the Department of Labor.    Investors benefit from a standard set of measures that gauge these fundamentals and evaluate whether systems are working as intended.    This is true for blockchain as much as it is for state and national economies. Blockchain-based systems are economies written in code. The value of a protocol, and any native tokens, depend on economic fundamentals. As such, users, validators and investors benefit from a standard set of measures that gauge these fundamentals and evaluate whether systems are working as intended.      Consider decentralization. Most protocols list decentralization in mining to be a core goal of their project. But pressed to define what this would be more rigorously, they cannot. Some aim for a minimum number of participating miners – say, 100 – while others suggest gauging decentralization indirectly through profitability or governance. Without an agreed-upon framework, the industry talks past itself.      Economics can provide the framework for the rigorous measurement of outcomes such as decentralization. Measures such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index are widely used in the study of industries to capture the distribution of market power of participants. Applied to block production, these metrics gauge to what extent miner influence and rewards are decentralized in practice.      The OAN, or the Open Application Network, used these frameworks to evaluate the impact of a recent protocol change on mining decentralization. Originally a Proof-of-Work protocol, the founding team was concerned a small set of mining pools had an outsized influence on block production. They launched a combined Proof of Work-Proof of Stake consensus mechanism in November 2019 but until recently had few tools to quantify to what extent their decentralization efforts had succeeded. Applying economic metrics, the OAN team determined the inclusion of Proof-of-Stake reduced block production centralization substantially, transforming them from a highly centralized platform to more in line with industry leaders Ethereum and Bitcoin (see Figure 1).      Having concrete numbers implies projects can be honest about their degree of success in achieving decentralization. It also means the industry can be frank with its overall state. Ethereum's level of mining decentralization, while moderate, is still closer to the dynamics of having a handful of major block producers than a vast, highly decentralized network. An industry that espouses a goal of hundreds of miners should be aiming for concrete metrics that confirm the achievement of this goal. For the leading protocols, this is still a ways away.      The benefits of measurement – and the dose of truth it can bring – apply to more than just mining decentralization. While blockchain projects differ in the design of their tokens, consensus and governance, they share common objectives of creating widely used and valuable tokens, democratizing influence and control, and broadening access to capital and data. It may take several months – or years – before the industry converges on a common quantitative framework for measuring progress toward these goals, but the effort is well worth the investment.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | BNB,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/29/to-get-serious-about-decentralization-we-need-to-measure-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae1247441a4113042e37bcbe4ffbcd5c486002fd-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383877,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yw4R,1590774321,Behind 'Prime Broker' Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms,"It’s probably no coincidence that three major crypto firms – Coinbase, Genesis Trading and BitGo – have almost simultaneously announced plans to become prime brokers, a kind of fixer when it comes to financing and facilitating trades for institutional investors.      This type of vertical integration happens in every business, whether that’s Amazon running the internet or Coinbase trying to own the crypto space. Given the long road of the last couple of years, it’s maybe surprising there hasn’t been more M&A activity in the blockchain world.      The big news this week was Coinbase’s acquisition of trading technology and execution platform Tagomi. BitGo Prime also launched its recently announced lending business and bolted on tax-reporting company Lumina. Last week, Genesis Trading (a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent firm Digital Currency Group) bought crypto custody provider Vo1t and spun up “Genesis Prime.”      Read more: Coinbase Buys Tagomi as ‘Foundation’ of Institutional Trading Arm      From starting out as a retail-focused cryptocurrency exchange, or a wallet provider, or an OTC desk, the ambitions of these firms (and others) to become crypto’s prime brokers is aspirational at this stage, as observers like BlockWorks Group co-founder Jason Yanowitz have noted. Indeed, the term “prime broker” is suddenly the latest buzzword in crypto, observed Max Boonen, CEO of cryptocurrency liquidity provider B2C2.      “What puzzles me a little bit is that some people are getting into prime brokerage, not based on a vision, but really because they are looking for the next big thing – and they don’t know what it is. So they are going after the buzzword,” said Boonen.      In traditional capital markets, the term “prime broker” refers to a set of three or four features or components that are normally provided by investment banks to their hedge funds clients.      Top of the list is the financing prime brokers supply to hedge funds to get leverage into their positions, and lending where people running a long/short fund are able to borrow the shorts. Operational efficiency in the traditional world is perhaps overshadowed by the importance of custody in the crypto space, and the final component is providing “best execution,” achieved by tapping a range of liquidity providers and exchanges.      Before Coinbase’s acquisition of Tagomi, there were “precisely zero” firms that had all of the above components, said Dave Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, a trading technology and execution provider in the same vein as Tagomi.      “If I were in [Kraken CEO] Jesse Powell’s shoes, or if I were Bitstamp or the Winklevoss twins, I would look at the Coinbase-Tagomi deal and say, ‘Hmm, this is the technology we need,’” said Weisberger.      An obvious question is, why now?      “There is sort of a coincidental element that all of this happened to land in the same week or two,” said Genesis CEO Michael Moro, “but from an industry trend and directional perspective, I think it makes all the sense in the world.”    Deep pockets    No doubt there are gaps in Coinbase’s growing institutional franchise that have yet to be cinched together, noted Weisberger.      “But when it comes to trade execution, Tagomi has that and also the tech to facilitate lending,” he said. “Coinbase has deep pockets and, with custody, the ability to have lendable coins. So they just have to combine all that intelligently.”      Boonen of B2C2, which is listed as the top liquidity provider on the Tagomi platform, pointed to financing and leverage as the crucial piece of the puzzle still missing from Coinbase’s plans.      “One of the things that a lot of participants say is missing from Tagomi is the provision of credit, and it’s also something that Coinbase doesn’t do,” said Boonen. “It’s a friction at Coinbase because of their regulatory setup, which obviously has benefits in one sense, but on the other hand it limits them in terms of providing leverage.”      In order to be a full-fledged prime broker, this obvious gap has to be plugged.      “One of the core drawbacks with Tagomi, is also not a strength of Coinbase. I do feel at the moment it’s aspirational in terms of being a prime broker,” Boonen said.      Read more: Crypto and the Latency Arms Race: Market Microstructures      Genesis Trading, which has loaned digital assets valued at $6.2 billion to institutional borrowers since launching its lending business in March 2018, said the availability of credit is more important than smarts, especially for firms that are used to trading on margin.      “We are building all of those fancy trading systems in-house; there’s no question that we are,” said Moro. “But that’s secondary to what we do and certainly not the reason somebody would use Genesis.”    Crypto conflicts    Tagomi’s management has informed its clients it will not deviate from the overarching business plan, including routing orders to multiple liquidity sources, Boonen said. Tagomi aggregates exchanges such as Bitstamp, Gemini and Binance US, as well as a handful of over-the-counter market makers, to scout out the best prices for its clientele of traders.      It’s possible to run a best-execution agency as a separate entity, but prime brokers have a privileged position with their customers including access to their trading strategies and material, non-public information about them.      Technically, a conflict of interest can be avoided, said Boonen. The question is whether it will be done in practice.      “It’s also about whether other exchanges being aggregated still want to do that,” Boonen said. “Obviously, you are happy to work with Tagomi because they are an independent business, but what does it mean when they belong to Coinbase, which is a direct competitor to you?”      Weisberger of CoinRoutes said there are information barriers and procedures that can be put in place to remove any conflict of interest but it remains “a very interesting discussion” that speaks to a broader disparity between crypto and traditional markets trading.      Read more: Crypto Long & Short: Innovation Cycles, Crypto Venture Funds and Institutional Investors      “If I were Binance US, I would have no qualms about Tagomi providing liquidity and accessing liquidy on Binance US; if I were Bitstamp I’d have no qualms,” said Weisberger. “I would, moreover, expect that they would then go over to Coinbase Pro and say, ‘OK, guys, we want to have a unit that can access liquidity on your platforms.’”      The growth of exchange groups like Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) or Nasdaq in the equities markets was because these firms had to allow their competitors to access their quotes and had to allow their competitors to route business to them, Weisberger pointed out, and in the end the whole market benefits as a result.      “Wall Street and the City of London are thought of as the most bare-knuckle capitalists out there,” said Weisberger. “But there are areas where people work with their competitors to make the overall business better, and areas where they compete like hell. Silicon Valley has a different mentality where you have to simply out-compete everyone, and the crypto industry may be the same right now.”      Binance and Bitstamp did not reply to requests for comment.    Last man standing    Technical and regulatory challenges around the safe storage of crypto assets have seen numerous custody providers spring up with various solutions and services on offer. It’s probably going to be the case that more of these highly specialized firms will be snapped up by bigger players, similar to the Vo1t acquisition.      “I think standalone custody businesses are going to be difficult to sustain,” said Moro of Genesis. “Custodial fees are shrinking; it’s a race to zero. So I think standalone custodians are going to partner up with companies that have other business lines, or they will look to start other business lines.”      Nick Carmi, BitGo’s head of financial services, agreed consolidation is well underway.      “This is exactly what happened in the financial markets as well, where custody is provided by few very large custodians,” he said.      Read more: BitGo Cements Hold on Institutional Market With Lumina Acquisition      As far as broadening out, Carmi said BitGo Prime was always part of the vision, driven by optimism in crypto as much as anything else. Taking a jab at Coinbase’s Tagomi deal, Carmi emphasized the importance of not being an exchange when it comes to offering brokerage services.      “We are not an exchange, we enable connections to multiple exchanges and market makers on a full non-disclosed basis. It is important to partition certain functions in order to have a secure and efficient financial infrastructure for digital assets,” said Carmi.      BitGo acquired some trading capabilities from last month’s purchase of Lumina, Carmi said, without disclosing any trading or lending volumes.      Meanwhile, some firms are still operating on the premise this is the Wild West and they will make a lot of money, said Boonen, but as the crypto market tightens and becomes more efficient it will be the professionals that are left standing.      “There are firms hoping to charge five basis points per trade through some sort of intermediary they are calling a prime broker,” said Boonen. “No one is going to pay that. The problem is, you can charge half a basis point on $100 billion a year in volume, but until you get there it will seem like a very long road.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/29/behind-prime-broker-buzzword-lies-a-complex-strategy-game-for-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb4b57c80cd2dcdd9d424098eb6f9e225ee6e0d0-1500x974.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383896,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ywNJ,1590771690,Money Reimagined: What CoinDesk's Style Debate Says About Crypto as Public Tech,"To “B” or not to “B”?      CoinDesk editors are currently reviewing our style guide’s capitalization policy.      Should every blockchain project be written in lowercase, uppercase or a mix? Should we differentiate between “bitcoin” the currency and “Bitcoin” the protocol? Should the standard differ by project, depending on how decentralized, permissionless or corporate the organizational structure? Maybe it’s “ethereum” in one case and “Libra” in another. And what’s the threshold for decentralization? Do we have the authority to make that judgment call?      The internal conversation has been surprisingly spirited, so much that we’re taking the next natural step for a decentralization debate and canvassing opinions from outside CoinDesk. (Feel free to let me know your thoughts on this stuff.)      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      Why does the otherwise mundane issue of crypto writing standards generate so much division?      I think it’s because it touches on inherently contentious matters around control and ownership. How we label blockchains highlights the ingrained tension between an ostensibly public infrastructure and the private interests that profit from it.    Non-government, for-profit but public    One problem is the distinction between private and public in crypto is complicated, certainly if you try to apply the pre-crypto taxonomy that traditionally determines matters of journalistic style.      But at CoinDesk, it’s our purpose to bring clarity to these issues. We aim to generate a deeper understanding of how decentralized, permissionless blockchains function. That understanding isn’t helped by many mainstream commentators who lazily describe all blockchain projects as “private” schemes, regardless of how decentralized they may or may not be.      To rely on a dichotomy that lumps organizations into either a government-run “public sector” or a corporate-managed “private sector” is an outdated mindset. In an international digital economy where communities fluidly form across borders and where non-human bots – many of them unleashed by governments – feed mass disinformation, we desperately need non-government public spaces on the internet. That’s what the best blockchain projects aspire to create.      How well each rises to that level is open to debate. But for the sake of argument, let’s take the (mostly) non-contentious position that Bitcoin and Ethereum pass muster as public blockchains. (Here I’m sticking with current CoinDesk policy, capitalizing the protocol but not the currency.) What should that mean for our style guide debate?      One could argue a lowercase “b” or “e” would be constructive for both because it would underscore these blockchains’ status as public, open base-layer platforms. Private entities need not seek permission from anyone to access the Bitcoin or Ethereum code to build applications on top of it, for profit or otherwise. The situation is, in this sense, analogous to the internet – which the Associated Press stylebook stripped of its uppercase “I” in 2016.      Alternatively, one could say these platforms should be treated much like non-blockchain open source codebases, whose software is freely published and developed by non-profit entities. These tend to get uppercased – as with the Linux operating system – offering a reminder that capitalization does not necessarily signal an entity is proprietorial or profit based.      We could go one further: If profit were the distinguishing factor, one could argue Bitcoin and Ethereum should be capitalized. Private profit is integral to how these permissionless blockchains function. Miners are driven to honestly validate transactions by the self-interested pursuit of token rewards. Profit incentivizes each one to independently contribute to the collective production of a secure and ostensibly immutable record of transactions, one that’s openly accessible to all users.      No wonder many journalists struggle to categorize these projects. It sounds like a contradiction in terms: a form of public infrastructure that’s entirely developed and maintained by private participants competing for profit.      Yet, it’s precisely the profit factor that makes these decentralized systems public. Those who protect the blockchain “commons” – as with Bitcoin – are incentivized to do so absent either the direction or permission of a potentially corruptible centralized authority. The upshot is neither they nor any other entity can restrict access or alter data.    It’s complicated    I would posit, then, that truly decentralized, permissionless blockchains should be viewed as an entirely new form of public infrastructure. Sadly, that doesn’t resolve CoinDesk’s style guide dilemma. We still must decide whether lower- or uppercase letters apply to such projects.      Also, defining which blockchains earn the “public” label is no simple matter. Yet, because of the profit factor the distinction with private projects is vitally important. The same motivator of good public outcomes in permissionless blockchains can fuel abuse within those that fall short of that ideal. Giving a “public” label to entities that should be deemed “private,” whether directly or indirectly via a style guide decision, could enable that abuse by fostering misguided trust among users.      Where do you draw the line? Even a small degree of unchecked control over the network creates an unlevel playing field with which privileged participants can extract greater token gains at the expense of others.      It all comes down to the core design and structure of the blockchain. But, sadly, that’s not a cut and dry matter, either.      I have no trouble saying the TRON protocol – maybe it should be “Tron,” but definitely not “tron” – is too centralized to be called a public blockchain. But what about EOS, the ninth-largest blockchain by market cap?      Forget that the founders’ all-caps branding decision tends to force editors’ hands around the naming style; the bigger issue is whether EOS’ delegated proof-of-stake model, designed to increase transaction speeds, produces a sufficiently decentralized model. It has been critiqued for fostering a concentration of power among Chinese block producers. And when TRON CEO Justin CEO – yes, he describes himself as the CEO of a blockchain – seized control of EOS predecessor Steemit, forcing steem OGs to set up a rival chain, it raised serious doubts about dPOS’ capacity to protect users.      It gets more complicated. Some would argue the presence of a pre-mine or an initial coin offering should disqualify a blockchain, including Ethereum, from being described as public. Even Bitcoin is periodically criticized for being too centralized – either because of its concentration of mining power or because of the involvement of companies such as Blockstream in core development.      There is no easy answer, in other words.      But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be asking the tough questions. Trying to ascertain each blockchain project’s capacity to serve the public over private interests and then determining how to categorize them helps society decide what to keep and what to discard.      Believe it or not, the nagging questions of unsatisfied journalists matter.    Africa: Battleground for the Future of Money    Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy, is experiencing a severe dollar shortage (which appears to be contributing to a continued surge in regional demand for bitcoin, according to Useful Tulips). This kind of monetary crisis will play into China’s hands because Beijing is expected to use leverage it has developed over a decade of heavy African investment to encourage governments and businesses to use its forthcoming digital currency. As that would happen in place of dollars, it’s a challenge to U.S. interests in Africa and other emerging market regions (see below).      So, what’s the state of U.S. influence in the region? This chart from Johns Hopkins’ China-Africa Research Initiative says it all. While Chinese investment into Africa has grown, U.S. foreign direct investment into Africa has plunged over the past decade. Since 2016, net FDI flows have been in negative territory. An American retreat.    The Global Town Hall    U.S. officials express little public concern over China’s currency challenge. But it’s a rising topic in Washington, as two articles in Foreign Affairs, the influential journal of Council of Foreign Relations, one of most powerful think tanks in Washington, D.C., demonstrate. One is by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, architect of the massive bank bailouts in 2008, who argues the threat from China makes it imperative the U.S. contain its ballooning debts lest it undermine confidence in the dollar. The other, by Aditi Kumara and Eric Rosenbach, two directors of the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School, details the many ways a digital yuan could enable cross-border payments without the intermediation of U.S. banks or oversight of U.S. regulators. Don’t be fooled by the COVID-19 hunger for greenbacks worldwide; it isn’t by choice. Self-fulfilling dollar dependence means businesses are compelled to scramble for them. Would they prefer a different system? You bet. They’re just waiting for an alternative.      Even if it never launches, Libra’s legacy is assured. As reported in Kumara's and Rosenbach’s article (above), it’s now widely recognized that Libra’s announcement expedited China’s move to a digital currency. Even if the Facebook-founded project were to never launch, it will have played a catalytic role stirring central banks into action. But its real impact will be measured by adoption.      It’s worth asking, then, whether Facebook rebranding its Libra wallet and advancing its WhatsApp and Messenger interoperability this week achieves what newly named Novi described as its “long-term commitment to helping people around the world access affordable financial services.” And if so, perhaps we should not be looking at the Western world but to places like the Philippines. In a CoinDesk opinion piece, Leah Callon-Butler writes that “it’s not hard to imagine how fast libra could become the preferred tender of Filipinos everywhere.” She notes, “While very few are banked – only 22.6 percent of adults have a formal account – the number of mobile phone subscriptions is greater than the number of actual people who live here.”      Private digital currency issuers need not compete with central banks. Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli, the IMF’s deputy division chief in the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, believes there’s a great opportunity for private-public partnerships in which firms issue digital tokens backed by the liabilities of a central bank. He calls them “synthetic CBDCs” (central bank digital currencies), which are different from traditional CBDCs where the issuance and minting is entirely managed by the central bank. I like this idea. Private wallet providers can innovate in ways that central banks can’t. And if their reserves are stored with a central bank rather than in a commercial bank account, they will be viewed as more secure and free from fractional reserve risks. This private-public partnership model sounds a lot like the kinds of relationships a Barbados-based company called Bitt has developed with central banks in the Caribbean. In its little corner of the world, Bitt has been trailblazing the development of CBDCs and stablecoins since 2015.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

Meanwhile, decentralized identity service Magic has raised $4 million from heavy-weight investors including Naval Ravikant, SV Angel and Placeholder, and the Digital Dollar Project is making its case for updating the U.S. dollar with its first white paper. Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top Shelf    Big Tech U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday targeting Twitter and other social media platforms after Twitter fact-checked two of the President’s tweets, which seeks to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Lawyers and technologists think the order is likely to fail, though it could have positive effects for the emerging decentralized web. Meanwhile, Twetch's Twitter account was suspended Thursday without warning, according to Twetch co-founder Josh Petty, and has since been reinstated without a follower count. Twetch offers alternative microblogging platform and actively markets itself against the San Francisco firm run by bitcoin enthusiast Jack Dorsey.      Digital Identities Magic raised a $4 million seed round from investors including Naval Ravikant, SV Angel, Placeholder, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Volt Capital to build a decentralized online identity and log-in service. Nuggets, a digital identity and payments platform, has developed a way to accept deliveries without needing a physical signature, using biom      Regulatory Matters The Digital Dollar Project is proposing a framework for the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The group published its first white paper detailing how a digital dollar could help the U.S. maintain the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. Around a dozen companies have a Gibraltar distributed ledger technology license, though the process is difficult, ZUBR, a crypto exchange, said. ZUBR’s approval is conditioned on addressing some of the regulator’s feedback by the time it gets its license. Meanwhile, Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX) Group’s digital securities platform has tokenized the shares of a client for the first time.      Open Finance Users of the Compound lending platform will begin earning COMP tokens in mid-June, pending the public review of the decentralized finance firm’s distribution plan. Roughly 42% of the total supply of the governance COMP tokens will move into a reservoir pool and begin daily distributions to users of the protocol for the next four years. Coinbase Pro is adding support for MakerDAO’s native MKR (Decrypt) and expanding its Tezos staking service to the U.K., Spain, France and the Netherlands.      Crime Doesn’t Pay BitClave, a California startup whose Ethereum-based search engine raised $25.5 million in a 2017 token sale, will pay back its 9,500 investors in a settlement with the SEC. A New York City man has been indicted for allegedly stealing and selling reams of payment card data, the proceeds of which he laundered in bitcoin.      Funded Through Crypto Telegram messenger founder and CEO Pavel Durov reportedly donated about 10 bitcoin, approximately $90,000, to help alleviate the financial burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia. A new series about blockchain project Dragonchain is premiering on Discovery, and it’s been fully financed with $1 million in crypto. Production house Vision Tree Media said Friday that its new “Open Source Money” documentary series, which will track crypto project Dragonchain, would debut on Discovery Science, a U.S. TV channel run by Discovery Inc., who also owns the Discovery Channel.    Opposite Editorial    How Contact Tracing Can Be Effective While Guarding Privacy Vipin Bharathan, chair of the Hyperledger Identity Working Group, looks to decentralized technology as a solution for contact tracing’s divisive debate between public safety and privacy. “To preserve the privacy of users and to be useful at the same time is a challenge. Privacy is enhanced by decentralization, by key schedule design and minimal collection of data,” he said.      What Goldman Gets Wrong About Bitcoin (From Someone Who Used to Work There) Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnis and co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, examines all the ways Goldman Sachs abandons reason when denouncing bitcoin as a suitable investment. “It’s not worth detailing every misconception or failed bit of logic in the report. But a few are worth mentioning. Goldman’s argument that cryptocurrencies are not a scarce resource due to the ability to fork into “nearly identical clones” represents a shocking failure of research into the immense technical and cultural differentiations between the three examples that they offer (bitcoin, bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv),” she said.    Market Intel    Consolidating Gains Bitcoin’s bulls are taking a breather amid jitters in the traditional markets over rising tensions between the U.S. and China. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency is trading near $9,400 at press time, having posted an eight-day high of $9,620 on Thursday. Prices have gained 8% so far this week. While bitcoin looks to be consolidating on recent gains, major European stock markets are flashing red for the first time this week. Leading the way lower is Germany’s DAX, down 1.5% on the day, followed by France’s CAC, which is reporting a 1% decline. Across the pond, futures tied to Wall Street’s equity index S&P 500 are down 0.5%.      Exchange Exodus The total number of bitcoins held in cryptocurrency exchanges wallets dropped to an 18-month low just above 2.3 million on Monday. The decline marks an 11% year-to-date reduction in the number of bitcoins held by exchanges. “People are accumulating aggressively, and the market participants seem to have a higher time preference these days,” said Avi Felman, head of trading at BlockTower Capital.

42383874,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yw1v,1590769741,"Russia Is About to Drop the Crypto ‘Iron Curtain,’ Industry Warns","Russia's crypto industry is pushing back against a set of bills that would make it more difficult to operate in the Eurasian country.      Russian lawmakers introduced a set of draft bills regulating digital assets earlier this month, which would effectively ban any transactions using crypto within the country's borders. In response, the crypto community has filed a number of protest letters.      If the proposed regulation is passed, the Russian economy could lose up to $10 billion in taxes annually, which the crypto industry would otherwise be able to pay if it could operate legally, says a letter by crypto lobbying group RAKIB to the bills' sponsor, Anatoly Aksakov. A copy of the letter was also sent to Maxim Reshetnikov, head of the Ministry of Economic Development.      Aksakov, a member of the Russian parliament (the State Duma), previously told news agency Interfax that Russians would be able to purchase cryptocurrencies on exchanges registered abroad but not in Russia, and they will have to report their crypto for tax purposes at home.      RAKIB's letter says one of the bills introduced prohibits the issuance of cryptocurrencies using servers located in Russia and web domains registered in the country, which means local crypto businesses will have to leave for other jurisdictions.      In addition, Russia will lose the opportunity to maintain technological leadership and “build a new Iron Curtain” cutting it off from the global tech infrastructure and force young tech talent to work abroad.      Read more: Russia Considering Draconian Rules for Illegal Crypto Operations      The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an advocacy group for companies in various industries in Russia, sent its own letter to the parliament. This letter was referenced in the Telegram channel of Elina Sidorenko, the head of the Working Group on Estimated Risk of Cryptocurrency Turnover in the Duma.      The letter points out the ban on any economic activities with crypto contradicts Russia’s policy on the digitization of the economy, which was announced by President Vladimir Putin in 2017. Plus, the suggested regulation “contradicts the main international rules for regulating the digital assets,” the letter says.      The Duma’s own expert council for digital economy and blockchain, in turn, sent a letter to Putin’s counsel for protecting the rights of entrepreneurs, Boris Titov. The group warned the new regulation would endanger the constitutional rights of Russians and provoke abuse of power by law enforcement agencies. This letter has been also shared by Sidorenko.      The draconian sanctions for merely facilitating crypto transactions and providing information about them, including in the mass media, will freeze digital economy growth in Russia and scare away potential foreign investors, this letter says.      ""In the crisis time in particular, such measures are inappropriate,” the document reads.      Another crypto advocacy group, the International Digital Economy Organization, sent a letter to the parliament suggesting that instead of a ban, crypto-related enterprises should be recognized as a legitimate kind of business and the government should only ban transactions related to money laundering and the financing of crimes, with the threshold for suspicious transactions above 200 million rubles (about $283,000). Mining and exchanging crypto for fiat should be taxed at a 4% rate, the letter says.      Read more: Bank of Russia Wants to Put Mortgage Issuance on a Blockchain      Sidorenko believes the reactions reflect thinking in the industry at the moment the proposed regulation is not yet ready to be adopted. One of the issues with the draft package is the ban on crypto has been introduced to the parliament as an addition to an earlier bill on digital securities, which has already passed through a first hearing in Duma.      This means all the new bills will go straight to a second hearing, speeding up the legislative process. If the lawmakers agree with the feedback provided by the Russian crypto community, they will have to push the entire legislative package back a step to a first hearing, Sidorenko said. In that event, the new regulation would not be considered before autumn because the Duma is about to break for the summer.      Another government official, Dmitry Marinichev, the president's counsel for the protection of entrepreneurs' rights in the Internet, believes the draft should simply be rejected.

42383880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yw8D,1590763664,"In Trump Versus Twitter, Decentralized Tech May Win","U.S. President Donald Trump signedhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/ an executive order Thursday, seeking to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 prevents social media companies from civil liability for the content posted on them. The order targets Twitter and Facebook after Twitter fact-checked two of the President’s tweets.    The text emphasizes Trump’s “commitment to free and open debate on the internet.” Trump said that “we are here today to defend free speech against one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history” before going on to identify that threat as a “small handful of social media monopolies.”      Lawyers who reviewed the order say it’s unlikely to accomplish Trump’s goals. Trump was misunderstanding the law, they said, and had little chance of achieving genuine reform of Section 230 without Congressional help.      Campaigners for a repeal of Section 230 said Trump’s intervention might derail their cause. But it also might offer an opening for decentralized technology, allowing innovation to substitute for government action on issues around misinformation, censorship and the power of social media (see below).    Misunderstanding 230    “Trump neither understands nor cares about the law, whether it's the First Amendment or Section 230,” said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at Miami Law School, author of ""The Cult of the Constitution"" and who has written about Section 230 extensively. “All he cares about is power, and he knows that the only way to disguise this is to pretend he is being persecuted.”      Robert Corn-Revere, partner at Davis Wright and Tremaine LLP, who focuses on first amendment issues, said the executive order is not well informed about how Section 230 works – or even what it says – much less how it has been interpreted by courts over the past two decades.      “It is a novel concept, to say the least, to suggest that the President, by executive order, can amend or modify an act of Congress, override hundreds of judicial rulings and instruct independent federal agencies to take actions that exceed their jurisdictional mandates,” said Corn-Revere in an email.      “And these problems arise even before getting to the obvious First Amendment issues raised by seeking to punish or regulate social media platforms for their editorial decisions.” [Disclosure: Davis Wright and Tremaine carries out legal work for CoinDesk.]      See also: Handshake Exchange Sees $10M in Token Trades as Race for Censorship-Resistant Websites Heats Up      Twitter responded to the order, saying the executive order was a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law. “#Section230 protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it’s underpinned by democratic values. Attempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms,” it said.      Friday morning, the company flagged another of Trump’s tweets for “glorifying violence” after he suggested protesters in Minneapolis, Minn., could be shot.    One casualty of this tantrum is any serious consideration of longstanding and legitimate critiques of Section 230    Public debate around 230 centers around whether these platforms are publishers. To some, a decision to add a fact-check counts as editorializing, making such a platform a publisher. But this is a misreading of the powerful and unilateral immunity Section 230 offers, says Preston Byrne, a prominent crypto law partner (and CoinDesk columnist).      In a blog he said Section 230 does two things only: 1) ensures platforms and users are not liable for content and 2) that, if you complain about a platform moderating your content, don’t expect much legal recourse.    Good faith    Trump’s order goes after the “good faith” requirement for removing “objectionable content” which could encompass whatever the platform chooses to amend.      There's no ""good faith"" requirement the platform (termed interactive computer service in the section) or user of that platform be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another user. If someone says something defamatory about you, you can’t sue me or Twitter over it, you sue the person that said it.      “You can't treat an online intermediary like a publisher,” said Franks, even if it acts like a publisher.      She’s critical of latitude to exercise ""good faith"" in taking down any content the intermediary finds ""objectionable"" and makes pretty much any parsing of ""good faith"" a moot point. It’s all up to the company. In any event, Twitter didn't take down any content in relation to Trump, she said, they merely added to it.      Section 230 has allowed platforms to flourish, and those same platforms to share disinformation, profit from the eyeballs that come with each cycle of outrage and deeply affect public discourse.      See also: YouTube Temporarily Bans Two Popular Crypto Channels Claiming Policy Breach      The order calls on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to re-evaluate the “good faith” requirement. In a statement Thursday Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel (one of two Democrats on the committee) said turning the FCC into the President’s “free speech police” was not the answer.      The process of putting the order together was hastily conducted, and included adapting an old order that had been floating around the White House for years, according to Protocol.      “One casualty of this tantrum is any serious consideration of longstanding and legitimate critiques of Section 230,” said Franks. “It's an intentional hijacking of the principled calls for reform.”      However, Gigi Sohn, a former counselor at the FCC, said Section 230 is not “inviolable,” meaning Congress could choose to address criticisms of the law. Amending this rule could improve online accountability, she argues, but also put upstart networks at a disadvantage. If moderation is now required, Twitter and Facebook are more likely to have the resources to do it properly.      “The little guys are already behind, and they will be even further behind if you keep carving out protections granted by Section 230,” Sohn said. “This points out the incredible power of a handful of companies. The power to determine what people see, what people think and what people believe. That should not be.”    Decentralization    Whatever the fate of Section 230, technology offers a potential way forward without the need for new laws.      Sohn supports major internet platforms “opening” their services to competitors and making themselves interoperable.      Denouncing ongoing efforts to break up big tech platforms, which are toothless due to decades of antitrust law attrition, Sohn said. “I’d rather see something like making them interoperable.”      “That’s the way you quote-unquote break up Twitter and Facebook. You make them open up their APIs [application programming interface] and policies to competitors to make use of,” she said. “I’d like to see it become mandatory.”      Forcing companies to decentralize or move to open standards would spur the creation of new businesses. “The way you handle the power of a company like Twitter is by making sure it can be competed against,” she said.      A mandate to decentralize has some historic precedence, too. It’s akin to what the Telecommunications Act of 1996 did for telephone companies, Sohn said, referring to a bill that required communications operators to open their networks for competitive use.      “Unbundling” online networks, and distributing the influence that one microblogging platform holds over the public conversation, would likely “get them out of this constant criticism,” she said.    If platforms want to make the error of enforcing their political biases on their users, let the free market provide competitors    Twitter is working on a decentralized standard called Blue Sky, though not much has been revealed about the project since announced in late 2019. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.      Other networks, sometimes appended to a blockchain, already exist and are thriving. ""[W]ith the recent politicization of [F]acebook, [G]oogle, and other bigtech social media giants, the web3 thesis for crypto has never been as underrated as it is now,"" Su Zhu, CEO of hedge fund and cryptocurrency investor Three Arrows Capital, tweeted.      See also: InterPlanetary File System Is Uncensorable During Coronavirus News Fog      LBRY, for one, cites the wanton power to censor and deplatform that centralized platforms like Twitter wield as one of its motivations for existing. LBRY’s neutral protocol enables anyone to post content without reprisal, and stores this information on an immutable blockchain. The company’s CEO, Jeremy Kauffman, said LBRY has seen three million active users in May, nearly doubling the count from preceding months. It also receives a number of new users anytime a crypto personality is banished from a big tech platform.      “The President is right to be concerned about the neutrality of companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube,” Kauffman said. But he doesn’t agree with making the government – as Trump just attempted – “the arbiter of truth.”      “If platforms want to make the error of enforcing their political biases on their users, let the free market provide competitors like LBRY that make this problem obsolete. Innovations like LBRY make it so that the interference of Twitter and YouTube is technologically impossible,” he said.      To be sure, there are issues with decentralization. Crypto Beadles, a prominent crypto YouTuber, tried the platform and found it wanting.      “There are currently no fully decentralized social media platforms I know of that work even remotely as well as the first version of YouTube,” he said. He painted the picture of a platform with the network effects of Twitter, guided by the principles of LBRY.      For his part, Kauffman said if Twitter were to decentralize, “the biggest effect this would have on LBRY is the potential to slow our growth…if it forces these companies to behave more responsibly. But they misbehave in so many other ways, I doubt this will happen.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Benjamin Powers, Daniel Kuhn",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/29/in-trump-versus-twitter-decentralized-tech-may-win,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b789ade94ca2baa08f00a03a5829064e74224824-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Production house Vision Tree Media said Friday its new ""Open Source Money"" documentary series, which will track crypto project Dragonchain, would debut on Discovery Science, a U.S. TV channel run by Discovery Inc., which also owns the Discovery Channel.      While the five-part series, scheduled to start July 4, will center around Dragonchain, Vision Tree added it will do so against the backdrop of the broader cryptocurrency industry. The firm name-dropped former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce and companies including Facebook and Disney as the big names interviewed for the series.      On its website, Vision Tree says the ""successful launch of the Open Source Money series is critical because it will help put cryptocurrency and blockchain technology on the map, as well as in the hands of more people passionate to make a change in the world.""      See also: This Bitcoin Documentary From Africa Is Streaming on Amazon Prime      When CoinDesk asked how the series was funded, Vision Tree said the million-dollar budget came from its own ""Coiin"" cryptocurrency.      The DRGN token has been languishing not far above record lows for over a year, following an early post-ICO spike to nearly $5 in 2018. Prices at press time were just below 10 cents per token.      ""The limited documentary series features the untold, heroic story of Dragonchain,"" gushes the press release. A spinout from Disney, Dragonchain allows enterprise users to securely store data on a blockchain. It raised more than $13.7 million in a sale of its DRGN token in late 2017.      A trailer for the new series shows one of the documentary's main themes is the darkening regulatory environment toward crypto projects in the U.S. Back in 2018, Dragonchain forced one of its affiliate projects to return investor funds – but didn't say why.      A Vision Tree spokesperson didn't say why the series focused specifically on Dragonchain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED,"Sebastian Sinclair, Paddy Baker",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/29/discovery-science-to-premier-crypto-funded-tv-series-about-dragonchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/425294540de78f21a0ba55565d2a614ae719b79c-2048x1151.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That’s why the San Francisco-based startup Magic just raised a $4 million seed round from investors like Naval Ravikant, SV Angel, Placeholder, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Volt Capital, just to name a few. SV Angel in particular has a complementary portfolio, including Coinbase, Stripe, Airbnb and Doordash.      ""Magic points the way towards a world in which user identity and authentication is decentralized and not subject to control by the tech giants,” Ravikant said in a press statement.      Plus, Magic CEO Sean Li said his startup already works with some decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap and RadarRelay. As such, Chicago DeFi Alliance member Volt Capital also represents a strategic pairing. After all, DeFi’s biggest onboarding challenge is the user experience, not any lack of demand for low-barrier loans and global currencies.      Read more: Chicago’s Trading Firms Look to DeFi With New ‘Alliance’      Volt Capital partner Imran Khan said Magic’s delegated key management service lets app developers create custom sign-on experiences without touching the user's private keys.      “I think the recession will increase their business,” Khan said. “Startups are going to look to be more efficient. They’ll use platforms like Magic to cut costs.”      Most importantly, Khan added, Magic serves clientele beyond the crypto industry because it can authenticate based on whatever protocol the platform is using. Placeholder Capital co-founder Joel Monegro agreed, adding that enterprises are also looking for secure ways to grant employees remote access to permissioned networks.      “That might be a way we see more adoption in an enterprise context,” Monegro said. “It’s bridging the gap between the traditional web authentication paradigms and the crypto authentication paradigms.”      Any company with a login and a website could use Magic as a door without needing to rebuild a customized onboarding solution in front of the house, so to speak. Monegro said, at the end of the day, authentication is all about making “key management” approachable.      “This is a way for users to not have to give up their data,” Khan added. “Magic is using blockchain as a backend infrastructure, in a way that any platform can easily integrate.”    Simplifying keys    Stepping back, private keys are basically really long and complicated passwords that users can’t reset.      Most internet users opt to trust platforms like Facebook in exchange for the convenience of a simplified username and password, plus the option of recourse if the password is forgotten, rather than retain full control over the asset or profile information.      Read more: Torus Launches to Bring One-Click Login to Web 3.0      “The key represents the singular piece of identity. You can use it in conjunction with 3Box to manage the data associated with that identity,” Li said, referring to the ConsenSys-backed startup 3Box. “We’re going to be working together on this authentication product.”      Magic is also aiming to serve developers, especially decentralized application (dapp) makers from the ethereum community. Li estimated 5,000 developers and teams are currently using the tool, including Democracy Earth and TokenSets.      “We can manage keys within the browser without having to rely on Chrome extensions,” Li said, offering the example of a shopper. “The private key never passes through the Magic backend and goes straight to Amazon.”      He said this early-stage startup is still on track to make more than $500,000 in revenue this year, despite the recession. And with the customer-facing sector of the industry saturated in wallets, service providers and apps, Li is betting instead on selling to the businesses that already have users rather than needing to attract a massive audience to turn a profit.      “I think only a few niche things will eventually explode,” Li said. “The majority of [crypto] adoption will happen with mainstream companies gaining access to crypto applications.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/29/passwordless-login-startup-magic-raises-4m-from-naval-ravikant-placeholder,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a358f24cbb7730ca9b2f3d2f3e0503058e3383e0-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383878,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yw6x,1590757203,Digital Dollar Project Calls for 2-Tiered Distribution System in First White Paper for US CBDC,"The Digital Dollar Project is proposing a framework for the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC).      The group published its first white paper Friday, detailing the need for a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar and some potential avenues for building this system. A digital dollar could help the U.S. maintain the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency while serving a broader array of individuals and entities than the current financial system, the paper says.      The group is helmed by former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Chris Giancarlo, Gattaca Horizons CEO and former CFTC Chief Innovation Officer Daniel Gorfine, Accenture Senior Managing Director David Treat and Pure Storage CEO Charles Giancarlo, with contributions from a number of Accenture analysts and directors. The Digital Dollar Foundation, which is working with Accenture on the project, was launched earlier this year.      “What we’re hoping to be is a catalyst for a discussion here in the United States about what role the U.S. will play in this ongoing and accelerating global debate over the future of money in a new digital age,” Chris Giancarlo, now senior counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, told CoinDesk.      Read more: Chris Giancarlo’s Digital Dollar Project Names Ex-Treasury, CFTC Officials to New Board      As such, the paper explores the current U.S. financial system and advocates for a digital dollar that utilizes a “two-tiered distribution architecture,” with commercial banks and other regulated entities acting as intermediaries between the Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank) and end users.      These commercial banks would distribute the funds much the way ATMs distribute cash to customers, the paper said.      The digital dollar envisioned by the paper could even operate alongside private stablecoins, the paper said.      “When we do big things in the United States as we did with the space program, as we did with the internet, it’s almost always a very healthy partnership with the private sector and the public sector, with each learning from each other, with the private sector … bringing innovation to bear and the government looking out for core principles of privacy and individual rights and liberties and getting that balance,” Giancarlo said.    Two-tiered system    Any U.S. CBDC should maintain the existing two-tier banking system, the paper said.      “A two-tiered banking system preserves the current distribution architecture and its related economic and legal advantages, while inviting innovation and accessibility,” it explained.      Under this model, the Fed would issue digital dollars to banks, while users could either store funds in their accounts or hold onto these tokenized dollars in their own digital wallets.      The bank would be able to lend against the funds held in accounts, the paper said.      “Unless the digital dollar is put into a safe deposit-like storage or custodial solution, once exchanged for balances in a bank account it is fungible with other monies as it is on a banks’ balance sheet,” the paper said.      Read more: How the COVID-19 Crisis Revived the Digital Dollar Debate      This type of system will ensure that individuals and entities store funds at commercial banks, the paper said.      “These deposits underpin the U.S. entire economy by enabling banks to lend funds to borrowers for activities such as buying a home, building a new factory and everything in between,” the paper said.      Treat told CoinDesk that part of the Digital Dollar Project’s work would be helping stakeholders understand this proposed system – basically understanding where the tokens are moving within the ecosystem.      The two-tiered system would also need to be able to satisfy both individual privacy concerns and regulations around financial transactions, including anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (AML/KYC) rules, he said.      “To have the end points of where the tokens can move be a regulated wallet infrastructure we think is likely the best answer, and part of what we’ll test,” he said.    Accounts vs. tokens    The paper also contrasted the concept of a token-based digital dollar with an account-based digital dollar, with a preference for a tokenized system.      A tokenized dollar would be more broadly applicable, Giancarlo said. In reference to a series of bills introduced earlier this year by U.S. lawmakers that proposed account-based digital dollars, he said a tokenized version would be more broadly applicable.      While the digital dollar proposals laid out before Congress refer specifically to stimulus payments meant to benefit American taxpayers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the group’s view is the digital dollar should be more broadly applicable.      Read more: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to Congress      “We think a true U.S. CBDC addresses that problem but then so much more, including building a new architecture for money for generations to come that will serve not just under-banked populations here in the United States during a crisis ... abroad and [spur] financial inclusion globally,” Giancarlo said.      The tokenized dollar should be faster, more efficient, less costly and able to extend the dollar’s utility, he said.      Here, too, it’s important to firmly define what’s being discussed, Treat said.      “One thing that we’re trying to do with the paper and in our talks is introduce a set of language to just be crystal clear or make the conversation more clear,” he said. “Part of what the paper is doing is working on definitions and that lexicon for everyone. The basic notion of the interplay [of] an accounts-based system and a token and a token-based system, I think, is incredibly important.”    Pilot programs    The next step for the project is to develop a series of pilot programs and tests for a number of potential use cases outlined in the paper. The use cases are broadly categorized as being either part of domestic payments, international payments or government benefits, and range from direct peer-to-peer payments to issuing government aid in response to disasters.      Giancarlo said the pilot programs may be evaluated based on a number of factors including the proposed token’s impact on the money supply, technological choices, privacy from both government intrusion and commercial exploitation, impact or use in sanctions and compliance with AML/KYC laws, among other concerns.      “What about the ledger itself? How permissioned or permissionless, or is it a distributed ledger at all?” Giancarlo said. “All of these issues need to be worked out so that we can come to the table with a lot of events.”      Read more: To See Libra’s Potential, Look at the Philippines, Not the US      Even after all of the theoretical planning, the proposed tokens would still need to be tested in real-world scenarios, he added.      Past the planning stage, it’ll require lawmakers and policymakers to actually execute any potential digital dollar solution, Treat said.      “We’re here to get the conversation going, to provide thinking, experience and expertise, and we will leave it to the policymakers to set the pace,” he said. “So our ability to comment on what’s possible, the value of it, where it’s headed and the importance in the long term is the most important part.”      This process will all take time, Giancarlo said. He projected that the process of building a digital dollar could take five to 10 years, but added, “we’ve got to start now.”      “We very much say the dollar is way too important to try to be done overnight or something over the weekend,” Giancarlo said.",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | WALLET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/29/digital-dollar-project-calls-for-2-tiered-distribution-system-in-first-white-paper-for-us-cbdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43816fba4653ec42e034c0af78eadf5fc3ca202b-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The bullish market reaction shows crypto traders largely shrugged off Goldman's bearish commentary, doubling down on bitcoin while spewing vile condemnations and ridicule of the analysis on Twitter.      On Thursday, bitcoin rose more than 2% to about $9,400. The price is now up 33% in 2020, versus a 6.2% decline on the year for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks. Goldman's own shares are down 12%.      One cryptocurrency trader even speculated Goldman may have weighed in on bitcoin because the Wall Street firm's clients were begging to know whether they should jump in – or put another way, if they were at risk of missing out on future rallies.      The global backdrop is that investors are desperately seeking ways to make money these days, with interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds close to historic lows. Buoyant stock-market valuations don't seem to reflect the economic devastation from the coronavirus. (A report Thursday showed more than 40 million jobless claims have been filed since early March.)      Bitcoin might be getting a closer look from big money managers and rich families following reports earlier this month that the legendary hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II is now betting on the asset. Investors also might be looking at the year-to-date returns and wondering why Goldman didn't steer them toward bitcoin sooner.      ""Goldman Sachs would not have put together this fancy presentation without demand or questions about crypto from the clients,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based digital-asset firm Bequant.      Patrick Lenihan, a Goldman spokesman, said the presentation ""speaks for itself,"" declining to comment further.      Invented just 11 years ago, bitcoin has already smeared egg on a lot of prominent naysayers' faces. Past performance, of course, is no guarantee of future success. But the list of casualties includes the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who in February described the cryptocurrency as having ""no value,"" only to see the shares of his own conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, tumble 18% this year as bitcoin rose.      It goes without saying, as Goldman's investment analysts pointed out, that bitcoin prices can be extremely volatile.      That might just be the nature of new technologies: Volatility isn't uncommon among many small-cap tech companies whose stocks were taken public by investment bankers working for Goldman and its Wall Street competitors.      Amazon.com shares tumbled 80% amid the dot-com crash of 2000 – long before the internet-commerce giant eclipsed department stores including Sears, which filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Another U.S. department store chain, J.C. Penney, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, as sales diminished because of coronavirus-related lockdowns.      But many big, sophisticated investors are comfortable with risk, as long as the potential rewards look attractive enough; long-term growth is the goal.      On that count, bitcoin's market capitalization has grown 11-fold since the end of 2016 to $173.7 billion. Over the same period, Goldman's own market cap has fallen to $69 billion from about $95 billion.      Jill Carlson, co-founder of the Open Money Initiative and an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures, wrote Thursday in an op-ed for CoinDesk that Goldman's report contained so many flaws that ""it's not worth detailing every misconception or failed bit of logic."" According to her LinkedIn profile, she worked as a credit trader at Goldman in the early 2010s.      That representatives have not adequately articulated the ""defining attributes and uses of this paradigm-shifting technology"" might be a fault of the crypto industry, Carlson added.      Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, addressing questions about the proposed libra stablecoin at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, noted how slow the traditional financial system had been to upgrade the plumbing behind payments.      The infrastructure around payments ""hasn't been updated in a very long time,"" Zuckerberg said.      The broader question might be whether Goldman risks falling behind a fast-evolving digital-asset industry that, by some accounts, aims to disrupt Wall Street and potentially displace it.      Or if the firm's clients risk missing out on a big rally, with quick-to-pivot Wall Street eventually embracing cryptocurrencies as a promising asset class.      Those clients have certainly missed out on the rally so far this year.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,394 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,621 | 24-Hr Low: $9,008      Trend: While bitcoin has gained over 8% so far this week, it's still lacking clear directional bias.      Prices are yet to move out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart represented by trendlines connecting the May 10 and 25 lows, and May 7 and 18 highs.      A break above the upper end of the contracting triangle, currently at $9,780 would imply a continuation of the rally from the March low of $3,867 and could lead to a convincing move to the February high of $10,500.      On the other hand, a UTC close below the lower end of triangle at $8,782 would confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change. That could cause more sellers to join the market, leading to a deeper price decline toward $8,000.      Both the falling wedge breakout and invalidation of a lower-highs setup confirmed earlier this week on the four-hour chart indicate scope for a rise to the triangle resistance at $9,780. Further, demand for bearish bets or put options is weakening, as evidenced by a recent decline in the one-month put-call skew from 22% to 6%.      On-chain activity suggests the big players are accumulating. The number of addresses holding at least 100 BTC rose as prices dipped from $10,000 to $8,630 in the seven days to May 25, according to data provided by Glassnode. That may be a sign many investors are long-term bullish.      At press time, bitcoin is trading near $9,400, having risen from $8,800 to $9,620 in the last two days.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/29/first-mover-bitcoin-rally-shows-traders-dont-care-that-goldman-hates-their-asset-class,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/825b76dd5479b8d986e97868f6dc837d4d6e17ab-1500x897.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ywH1,1590754635,Bitcoin Rally Falters as Stocks Drop Ahead of Trump's China Speech,"Bitcoin's bulls are taking a breather amid jitters in the traditional markets over rising tensions between the U.S. and China.      The world’s biggest cryptocurrency is trading near $9,400 at press time, having posted an eight-day high of $9,620 on Thursday. Prices have gained 8% so far this week, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      While bitcoin looks to be consolidating on recent gains, major European stock markets are flashing red for the first time this week. Leading the way lower is Germany’s DAX, down 1.5% on the day, followed by France’s CAC, which is reporting a 1% decline. Across the pond, futures tied to Wall Street’s equity index S&P 500 are down 0.5%, as per Investing.com.      Markets look to have become cautious ahead of President Trump’s response to China’s decision to implement a national security law in Hong Kong, putting the jurisdiction’s autonomy in doubt.      “We’ll be announcing what we’re doing tomorrow (Friday) with respect to China. And we are not happy with China. We are not happy with what’s happened,"" Trump told reporters on Thursday. Trump warned earlier this week it would impose sanctions on China if the law is introduced.      The expectation is Trump will announce some symbolic sanctions against individuals and companies. That said, with the presidential elections due in November, a bigger action cannot be ruled out. The resulting geopolitical tensions could bode well for bitcoin as many analysts and investors consider it a safe haven asset.      ""I expect serious anti-Chinese rhetoric in the coming days/weeks/months as Trump tries to use nationalism/protectionism and anger towards China/COVID as a major catalyst for support,"" Phillip Gillespie, CEO of B2C2 Japan, told CoinDesk in an email. ""I am personally bullish [on bitcoin] due to a combination of excess stimulus from all the major central banks (ample liquidity in the system) and pick-up in geopolitical risks.""      Meanwhile, analysts at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, believe the geopolitical tensions have created a ""perfect storm"" for the cryptocurrency.      In fact, they suggested in a weekly report on Thursday that the cryptocurrency's week-to-date gains are the result of increased haven demand fueled by the U.S.-China tensions and the slide in the yuan.      “Previously back in 2019, similar fears have driven Chinese investors to move their onshore RMB (China’s yuan) out of the country, where speculators reckon a part of that has trickled into Bitcoin given the increased demand over the same period,"" according to the report. ""We are observing similar price action currently as Bitcoin has rallied 6.2% since, from $8,700 to $9,250 level, once again breaking out from its 2019-2020 daily trendline.“      Also read: Slipping Chinese Yuan May Boost Bitcoin Price, Past Data Suggests      It remains to be seen if the geopolitical tensions escalate and lead increased haven flows into bitcoin. The cryptocurrency did rise by over 30% in the first half of January when Iran and the U.S. conducted airstrikes on their respective bases in Iraq, injecting geopolitical uncertainty into the financial markets.      Some might argue that bitcoin failed to perform as a haven asset during the height of the coronavirus crisis in March. While that is true, almost every asset, including classic safe haven asset gold, took a beating back then as investors fled for cash.      Aside from President Trump’s China speech, bitcoin analysts are also keeping an eye on the May expiry of cash-settled futures and options contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).      ""23k bitcoin equivalent futures and 10k bitcoin options are set to expire this Friday on CME. Approx 50% of open interest for each product,"" crypto derivatives research firm Skew tweeted earlier this week.      Price volatility tends to pick up around the time of expiry of futures and options activity due to increased trading activity.      However, CME’s contribution to total futures open interest listed across the globe is only 11%, according to Skew data. Similarly, the Chicago exchange's contribution to total options open interest is also quite low, so the expiry – due Friday at 15:00 UTC – may not have a major influence on prices.

Using biometrically verified contactless delivery technology secured with blockchain technology, the London-based firm wants to equip consumers with the means to provide verified proof of identification while still maintaining the social distancing required under coronavirus measures.      Nuggests says the contact-free signing system would help counter a rise in delivery fraud and chargebacks amid the pandemic. Since customers no longer have to sign for deliveries in order to maintain distancing, fraudulent chargebacks are skyrocketing. Citing figures from the U.K., Nuggets also said failed deliveries have also cost courier firms as much as £1.6 billion (US$2 billion).      “Merchants are so overstretched with increased orders, staffing issues and supply chain fulfilment problems that having to dispute chargebacks ends up at the bottom of the list,"" said Nuggets CEO and co-founder Alastair Johnson.      See also: FATF Releases Guidance on Global Digital IDs as Use Cases Grow      During a delivery, the courier would use an app to scan the receiver's digital ID (issued by Nugget) to verify they are indeed the customer who ordered the item(s).

Nuggets said the system ""guarantees verified delivery of a package to the right recipient,"" while using a blockchain allows for the secure communication of customers' biometric and payment information.      E-commerce has seen a huge boost in recent months, due largely to coronavirus stay-at-home orders.

42383881,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yw9T,1590739200,"It's Tough Getting Approved in Gibraltar, Says Green-Lighted Crypto Derivatives Exchange","Receiving regulator approval to operate in Gibraltar is anything but easy, crypto derivatives exchange ZUBR told CoinDesk.      ZUBR, which began trading in March, said Wednesday it had received in-principle approval from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider. The approval is on the condition the exchange addresses some of the regulator's feedback by the time it gets its license.      But just getting to this point has proven difficult.      ""From day one we realized 100 percent...that we would have to sacrifice a lot to get into the regulated space,"" co-founder Oleg Ravnushkin said. Even before the regulator provided feedback, ZUBR capped its maximum leverage at 20x and introduced high entry barriers to ensure it only served professional, not retail, clients.      The GFSC has offered DLT licenses since the beginning of 2018. Based on nine very general principles – including one clause that an applicant ""must conduct its business with honesty and integrity"" – the license provides a broad-stroke and flexible regulatory framework for any activity that comes under the umbrella of DLT, such as to transmit or store value on behalf of others.      Around a dozen companies have a Gibraltar DLT license, including the blockchain subsidiary for the Gibraltar Stock Exchange. Ravnushkin said there's probably another 12 more entities going through the application process, alongside themselves.      See also: Crypto Derivatives Platform Gets Nod From London Stock Exchange’s Software Tester      Nine principles may seem like an overly simplistic framework, but ZUBR disagrees.      ""It took us a preliminary application to go through to a full application stage; to go through to a set of interviews with key [GFSC] personnel, [then] a set of presentations of our business model and a number of rounds of follow-up discussions and additional requests made by the regulator to have clarity on very specific questions,"" ZUBR's chief legal officer, Olga Okuneva, said.      ""It's not that straightforward to just come and get a Gibraltar license...[Y]ou cannot just, you know, switch to Gibraltar,"" Ravnushkin said. ""We had to be comfortable with a lot of additional, you know, checks and outsourcing providers to make sure that the trading was transparent and that the market structure was solid so there's no manipulation whatsoever.""      ""It's going to be 10 principles pretty soon,"" he added.      Neither Ravnushkin nor Okuneva described the regulatory feedback as ""changes,"" but rather ""more of a fine-tuning of something we have discussed thoroughly with the regulator,"" Okuneva said.      Ravnishkin said this could include relocating more of their staff to Gibraltar, but added: ""I cannot obviously comment on the exact nature of this.""      See also: Hong Kong’s First Regulator-Approved Bitcoin Fund Targets $100M Raise      But Ravnishkin confirmed none of the changes will affect its core business model. That's probably a relief. ZUBR forked out £30,000 (~US$37,000) just for the application fee for the category three license, which covers companies dealing with complicated assets, including crypto derivatives.      Having first submitted its license more than 12 months ago, Ravnushkin reckons ZUBR will still have to wait for a few months before it receive its full license.
