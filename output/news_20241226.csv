38160224,https://crypto.news/?p=14322491,1735257123,"Ethereum at $3,300 level while 1Fuel outpaces ADA in presale growth","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors look to 1Fuel as Cardano (ADA) Ethereum (ETH) struggle. Table of Contents ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum ADA faces high-selling pressure Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Conclusion With the current retracements, some altcoins have found it difficult to regain momentum. Ethereum, which rose to $4,000, nearing its ATH of $4,792, has declined drastically. Cardano trails a similar path, falling below $0.91. Should there be more retracements, analysts suggest they might consolidate at their current values or experience further decreases. However, a new token, 1Fuel , has been gaining traction and recording an increase in sales. Currently, in its second phase selling at $0.012, 1Fuel has raised $835,000, with experts ranking it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy for 2025. ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum In the past 24 hours, ETH has struggled to break out of $3,477 resistance and has assumed a bearish state with a high chance of ETH dipping below $3,300 before a rebound. ETH’s long/short ratio — a metric to track the ratio of buyers to sellers in the market — is at 0.98 and on the verge of entering 1, a bullish sign. This means that investors believe that ETH still has the potential to increase, allocating more funds to it. However, if ETH reverses from its current price, there’s a possibility of it dipping to $3,000, which will result in a massive loss for these investors. The uncertainty surrounding the ETH’s rally has caused investors to eye 1Fuel because of its potential offerings. 1Fuel has recorded a massive increment in its token presales, and it’s set to change the investment narratives in the cryptocurrency market in 2025. ADA faces high-selling pressure ADA is currently trading at $0.86. The token has seen a 9.63% decline in its trading volume. This indicates that there’s high selling pressure, pushing ADA’s price downwards. ADA may gain momentum if it drops into the $0.73–$0.63 range, where buyer interest is anticipated. However, investors should exercise caution, as market volatility could push prices below this range, leading to potential losses. Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Experts predict at least a 500% surge in price after 1Fuel launches on top cryptocurrency exchanges. Notably, investors will get a 30% APR on all their staked coins, meaning they can earn passively. 1Fuel will also support P2P trading on its platform, giving room for users to trade directly with other users at low fees. Furthermore, with 1Fuel, users will get a built-in AI-powered feature that will make all the functions in the cryptocurrency wallet easy for them to use, facilitating seamless transactions. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market regains momentum, coins like ETH and ADA have been finding it hard to join the bullish trend. However, 1Fuel is set to create a buzz in the altcoin market. The new crypto is currently selling at $0.012 but is expected to surge more than 100x once it hits top cryptocurrency exchanges. To learn more about 1Fuel, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

38159538,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667333,1735255852,"Who Profited During Bitcoin’s $100,000 Surge? Analyst Breaks Down the Data","Bitcoin ongoing price movement has sparked intense analysis as it continues to hover below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching an all-time high above $108,000 last week, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain upward momentum ever since. With this performance, BTC’s on-chain data has been brought to the spotlight to uncover the factors driving recent selling pressures and investor behavior. One key focus has been the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) indicator, which provides valuable insights into Bitcoin holders’ activity based on their holding periods. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? Who Cashed Out Their Bitcoin Gains? According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Yonsei Dent, data reveals that Bitcoin investors who bought their holdings between six to twelve months ago were the most active sellers during the recent price surge. This group largely entered the market during the initial excitement surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in the year. While this selling activity exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, the asset has managed to stabilize within the $90,000–$100,000 range. Interestingly, long-term holders, defined as those holding Bitcoin for over a year, have shown minimal selling activity. Historical trends suggest that these seasoned investors are likely anticipating elevated price levels before considering substantial profit-taking. Meanwhile, Dent pointed to the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric showing a noticeable decline in older Bitcoin being moved in December compared to November. Historically, reduced activity from long-term holders during price corrections often signals market resilience and potential for future upward momentum. The analyst wrote: The ‘Binary CDD’ indicator at the bottom of the chart shows a decline in the selling of older Bitcoin in December compared to November. This suggests that many long-term holders may anticipate even higher prices before selling. Binance Reserves Signal Market Confidence Speaking of higher prices, another crucial metric suggesting a significant move brewing for Bitcoin comes from Binance’s Bitcoin reserves, which have been steadily declining since August. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlighted that Binance’s reserves recently hit their lowest level since January. This trend is significant because a similar decline earlier in the year preceded a 90% surge in Bitcoin’s price. The reduction in exchange reserves typically indicates that investors are moving their Bitcoin holdings away from centralized exchanges and into private wallets. Such behavior suggests reduced selling pressure and a preference for long-term holding strategies. Historically, declining reserves on exchanges have often aligned with periods of strong market optimism and price rallies. Notably, as BTC currently still trades at a price of $95,567 down by 2.7% in the past day, the confluence of these factors—long-term holder confidence, reduced activity from older wallets, and declining exchange reserves—presents a cautiously optimistic picture for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.

Table of Contents Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments 3 promising altcoins for last-minute Investment Lesser-known altcoins for last-minute investments As the cryptocurrency market approaches the end of 2024, investors are keenly observing altcoins that exhibit the potential for significant growth before the year’s close. While established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have garnered substantial attention, newer entrants like Pepe (PEPE) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are also capturing the market’s interest. This shift in attention underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where new projects can rapidly gain prominence, influencing trading strategies and market trends. Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments Investors are seeking final chances in the crypto marketplace hoping to earn cash before a new year. This period usually shows extra moves in the market with traders eager t͏o improve their stash for end-year outcomes. One way that is noticed is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves saving a set amount of cash at normal times, regardless of the market condition. This method reduces the impact of market rises and falls and cuts down the risk of making poor choices from fast market shifts. Another is Market Cycle Investing, which refers to timing funds on the crypto market’s circular nature. By checking old data and market trends, investors seek to buy when the market is down and sell when it’s up. There’s also a mix of investments. By spreading money over different types of digital coins, investors can handle risk and raise the chance for gains. Mixing helps to balance the ups and downs found in the crypto market. It’s key to know that while these me͏thods can work, they also have risks as the crypto market is always changing.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the project says it has been working closely with a respected asset manager to create a FLOKI-based ETP for European inventors, set to launch in Q1 of next year. “We’ve been actively working with a respected asset manager and an ETP issuer to launch a Floki ETP for quite a while now. After months of due diligence and painstaking effort, we’ve been told that the Floki ETP is on track to go live in early Q1, 2025. This proposal is to have the Floki DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) approve liquidity for the Floki ETP!” An ETP allows investors to expose themselves to specific assets without the need to actually purchase them. In the proposal, the Floki team says the ETP is already in its advanced stages and will become tradable on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland, as soon as next year and become the second meme coin in the world with a live ETP. “When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way. This is a big move that is almost unprecedented in this space, because Dogecoin is currently the only memecoin in the WORLD, with a live ETP, and Floki could become the next memecoin with an ETP besides Dogecoin.” The proposal also includes provisions for burning FLOKI tokens as well as providing liquidity for the ETP. “The purpose of this DAO proposal is to seek approval from the Floki DAO for providing liquidity to the ETP… We currently hold 16,310,285,772.6 FLOKI tokens in [a crypto wallet] and propose using a portion of them to provision liquidity for the ETP while burning the remainder on the day the ETP launches.” FLOKI is trading for $0.000177 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

That’s $166 million an hour, $2.7 million every minute, and a mind-numbing $45,000 a second. It’s a figure so obscene yet it’s the reality of America’s financial position. This reckless spending has pushed the U.S. Debt-to-GDP ratio to 121%, a level not even reached during World War II. In comparison, it was just 60% in 2008, back when the Great Recession first hit, because yeah, it came back last year. Since 2020, the U.S. has added $13 trillion to its debt. That’s a 57% increase in under five years. Meanwhile, as 2025 approaches, prediction markets are betting there’s a 36% chance the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) might trim $250 billion from federal spending. Sounds like a lot, right? Except it wouldn’t even scratch the surface of the deficit problem. The dollar’s grip on global finance Despite this insane financial chaos, the dollar isn’t going anywhere. For decades, doomsayers have warned about the dollar’s downfall, but it keeps flexing like an undefeated champ. From the oil crisis of the 1970s to the rise of the euro, from Japan’s economic ascent to China’s manufacturing takeover, the dollar has seen it all—and survived. Why? Because the world has no other choice. Right now, over 60% of global reserves are held in dollars. About 90% of all foreign exchange trades involve the greenback. International trade invoices? Mostly in dollars. And let’s not forget U.S. Treasuries—the so-called “safe haven” for global investors. Other currencies, like the euro or the Chinese yuan, have tried to make a play for the top spot, but they just don’t have the same liquidity or trust. China, often hyped as the dollar’s biggest threat, has its own issues. The yuan accounts for a tiny fraction of global transactions and is tightly controlled by Beijing. Investors don’t trust a currency that can’t flow freely. Meanwhile, the euro had a strong debut but lost credibility after a series of debt crises rocked the eurozone. These problems have left the dollar as the last man standing in a very shaky financial world. The dollar’s dominance is woven into the fabric of global trade and finance. The U.S. can borrow at levels that would bankrupt any other country because the dollar is still the world’s default currency. But how long can this game go on? Debt: The privilege and the price For decades, the U.S. has leaned on what economists call its “exorbitant privilege.” Basically, the world trusts the U.S. government to pay its bills, so investors keep buying Treasuries no matter how much debt America racks up. This allows Washington to borrow trillions for wars, stimulus packages, or even public-health emergencies. But that trust isn’t unlimited. Critics warn that America’s debt addiction could eventually blow up in its face. The sheer scale of the debt—combined with those $4 billion-a-day interest payments—has people wondering how much longer the U.S. can live beyond its means. And it’s not like anyone has a plan. Barack Obama tried to rein in spending with a high-powered deficit committee, but their recommendations went nowhere. Donald Trump once called the dollar both “too strong” and “too weak” while pursuing massive tax cuts that ballooned the debt even further. Joe Biden hasn’t fared much better, pushing pandemic-era spending packages that added trillions more to the tab. What’s the long-term strategy here? No one seems to know. U.S. is the dollar’s worst enemy But even countries that criticize America’s policies rely on the greenback. China, for instance, might talk about “de-dollarizing,” but it still issues dollar-denominated bonds to attract investors. Saudi Arabia recently sold $2 billion in dollar bonds. Even the much-discussed BRICS currency is years away, if it happens at all. Until something better comes along, the dollar will stay on top. But let’s not pretend this is a good thing. The dollar’s dominance allows the U.S. to print money and pile on debt without facing the kind of crises that cripple other nations. This creates a dangerous feedback loop: Washington borrows because it can, and the world keeps enabling it because they don’t have another option. The real question isn’t whether the dollar will collapse—it’s what could trigger its decline. Some economists argue that America itself poses the biggest threat to its currency. Excessive sanctions, for example, have already pushed some countries to explore alternatives. If the Oval overplays its hand, it could accidentally speed up the search for a credible dollar rival, just as Russia’s president Vladimir Putin predicted.

38158458,https://crypto.news/?p=14322487,1735253590,Top crypto pick for those who missed SHIB and PEPE,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing Rexas Finance as a top pick for those who missed SHIB and PEPE. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Presale achievements Components: A unique ecosystem Ensuring investor benefits Conclusion Many investors who got in early on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have become extremely rich. But for those who missed these two tokens, there is a new token that has the potential to provide massive gains — Rexas Finance (RXS) . Rexas Finance shows great future promise due to its unique real-world asset features, strong tokenomics, and upcoming presale stages. This, along with a Certik audit completion and planned exchange listings, make it a great option for high returns. Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Rexas Finance is at the helm of the tokenization process. Interested users will easily access high-value assets like real estate, fine art, and collectibles via blockchain tokenization through its platform. This method of investing will fence off a huge proportion of the market previously occupied by the affluent, making it possible for the average investor to join in. Instead of having the purchase barrier of millions to buy a piece of real estate, users will be able to buy fractionalized real estate with RXS tokens. To increase liquidity and lower costs, tokenization allows for filling a growing asset digitization shift that the market is seeing. The immense market potential that Rexas Finance promises, combined with its presale, makes it stand out. Presale achievements With a total of over 364 million tokens sold, the RXS presale has been immensely successful, raising more than $30 million through its stages. The presale started at $0.03 in Stage 1, growing over 400% to the stage 10 price of $0.15. The investors’ trust is quite clear from the performance of this presale. It shows that the fundamentals and the vision of the project are sturdy. Many other crypto projects get a lot of funding from VC firms, but Rexas Finance has managed to do well without a single VC firm, allowing a fairer start for early investors. The growth witnessed without any external support reiterates the strength of the project’s future. You might also like: This altcoin is poised to make $83250 from $450 in 100 days, could be the next Dogecoin Components: A unique ecosystem Rexas Finance is far more than a token, it is designed to fill various gaps in the market via an entire ecosystem: Rexas Token Builder: This will enable users to generate custom tokens for both personal and corporate use. Rexas Launchpad: This is meant for upcoming blockchain-based ventures that need exposure and assistance. Rexas Estate: Focused on real estate tokenization in a manner that will involve fractional ownership and more accessibility. Rexas Treasury: This will serve as a reliable source of investment for future development of the platform. These features will help mitigate challenges in the blockchain space, giving RXS the capacity to be a good and practical investment. The application of utility gives the platform a competitive advantage over other conjectural meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. Ensuring investor benefits Investing in cryptocurrency should be done with great consideration, as security comes first. RXS has been certified by Certik, ensuring that it adheres to safety and transparency measures. Many investors become hesitant about crypto owing to the prevalence of terms such as rug pulls and scams. However, with Certik’s backing, Rexas Finance seeks to be a more reliable investment. Additionally, Rexas Finance offers early investor giveaways worth up to $50,000 in RXS tokens just by referring friends or engaging with the community on social media. Unlike other obscure cryptocurrencies with lengthy processes, Rexas Finance is easy to buy. Connect a MetaMask wallet and use USDT or ETH to purchase RXS tokens. Investors have a fantastic opportunity to participate in the project during its low-cost presale rates. Conclusion As Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin were hyped years ago, Rexas Finance is a new promising investment. The combination of real-world tokenization, outstanding tokenomics, and a successful presale suggests a massive increase in value. With its planned $1 million giveaway and anticipated listings in 2025, Rexas Finance could be among the best cryptocurrency investments for those seeking life-changing results.

38158277,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633665,1735252844,Is Microsoft harassing users with AI assistant Copilot?,"Microsoft is not asking for your permission to integrate its AI assistant Copilot into your life—it’s just doing it. The company recently forced Copilot onto Microsoft 365 users in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. And as if the decision wasn’t irritating enough, they slapped a price hike on top of it. In these regions, Microsoft 365—known for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—now includes Copilot whether customers want it or not. Users like Alistair Fleming, a YouTuber in Australia, are discovering that their monthly bills have surged. “It went from A$11 to A$16,” Fleming reportedly said, and all he got was a hyperactive AI assistant that wouldn’t leave him alone. “Every time I finished a line, its rainbow logo popped up, offering to ‘help.’ It’s annoying.” A desperate decision to profit from AI This aggressive rollout is all part of Microsoft’s plan to milk its massive investment in AI. Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s tech, is a key piece of CEO Satya Nadella’s strategy to expand the company’s software dominance. Earlier this year, Microsoft launched the premium consumer version of Copilot in the United States at $20 a month, on top of the standard $7 Microsoft 365 subscription. The company claimed it was a game-changing assistant, capable of generating emails, summarizing meetings, and creating entire PowerPoint presentations. But whether it’s worth the extra cash is a hotly debated question. Here’s the thing: people are not exactly lining up to use Copilot. Between May 2023 and mid-December, Copilot’s chatbot app was downloaded 37 million times, according to Sensor Tower. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT raked in a mind-blowing 433 million downloads in the same period. Microsoft might call this a “success,” but let’s not pretend Copilot is winning any popularity contests. For businesses, Copilot comes with an even heftier price tag—$30 per user. Corporate clients are Microsoft’s bread and butter, but the response to Copilot has been lukewarm at best. Many companies have doubts about its accuracy, data security, and whether it actually adds value. A Microsoft spokesperson refused to comment on how happy (or unhappy) corporate customers are, sticking to the usual “we meet global privacy standards” script. Microsoft wants to ditch OpenAI (sort of) While Copilot relies heavily on OpenAI’s technology, Microsoft is already working on alternatives. Reuters recently reported that Microsoft is building its own AI models, like Phi-4, and customizing open-weight models to power Copilot. The goal is to reduce costs and gain more control. This is a noticeable change from Microsoft’s earlier fanfare about its partnership with OpenAI. Back in March 2023, the company proudly announced Copilot’s reliance on OpenAI’s GPT-4. Now, Microsoft seems eager to tone down that reliance. It’s not cutting ties entirely though. OpenAI is negotiating to remove a clause from its agreement with Microsoft that limits the latter’s access to future artificial general intelligence (AGI) models. If this happens, Microsoft could maintain access to cutting-edge OpenAI tech without restrictions, even as it builds its own systems.

38158172,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633691,1735252719,US stocks tumble as Bitcoin remains stuck at $95k. Is the Santa Rally already over?,"Wall Street’s so-called Santa Claus rally seems to have tripped over its own feet, while Bitcoin, the supposed king of volatility, is just sitting there like a lump, stuck at $95,000. Is this how we’re ending 2024? Flat stock performance, stagnant Bitcoin, and investors gnawing on their nails instead of celebrating a year-end windfall? The Dow barely scraped together a gain of 0.04%, the S&P 500 dipped by 0.02%, and the Nasdaq went completely nowhere. Treasury yields? Through the roof. The 10-year note hit its highest point since May, sitting at 4.58% before a late-day pullback. This surge in yields is a big problem for growth stocks, especially tech giants, which have propped up the market all year. Now, the “Magnificent Seven” are wobbling, and with them, the hopes of a December rally. Santa Claus rally hits a brick wall For those who don’t obsess over market quirks, the Santa Claus rally is a cute little phenomenon where stocks rally in the final trading days of the year, thanks to low liquidity, year-end bonuses, and tax-loss harvesting. It started to look promising earlier this week. Then reality smacked Wall Street upside the head. Mixed economic data, hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical tensions quickly killed the buzz. The Fed is holding firm on its less-than-dovish outlook for 2025, with way fewer rate cuts than markets were hoping for. Higher yields are squeezing growth stocks, which is terrible news for a market dominated by mega-cap tech. The S&P 500’s top ten stocks now account for 40% of the index’s market cap, a level that blows past the peak of the Dot-Com bubble. If these giants stumble, the rest of the market doesn’t stand a chance. New U.S. jobless claims data added to the tension. Initial claims dropped slightly, which sounds great, but ongoing claims climbed to their highest levels since 2021. Translation: People are losing jobs, and they’re struggling to find new ones. Combine that with uncertainty surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, and you’ve got a sense of the market chaos. Bitcoin’s glory days feel like ancient history Meanwhile, Bitcoin is sitting there doing absolutely nothing. It’s been bouncing between $92,500 and $96,000 for days now, a far cry from its December peak of $108,268. As of press time, it’s down 3.6% on the day, trading at $95,693. That’s a drop of over $3,500 in 24 hours, and the market capitalization is down to $1.89 trillion. Trading volume isn’t exactly inspiring either, clocking in at about $39.59 billion. This isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The entire crypto market feels sluggish. Analysts blame profit-taking after Bitcoin’s monster rally earlier this month, as well as tighter liquidity driven by the Fed’s hawkish cut. Still, there are glimmers of life. Institutional interest hasn’t dried up. MicroStrategy, always the Bitcoin cheerleader, added another $561 million worth of BTC to its stash. Bitcoin ETFs are still pulling in cash, with weekly inflows topping $300 million even in this downturn. But for the average trader, this kind of stagnation is painful. The Fear & Greed Index, which measures investor sentiment, is sitting at 54—smack in the middle of neutral territory. Will the Santa Claus rally make a last-minute comeback? Can Bitcoin escape its $95,000 prison? Or are we staring at the start of a rough 2025? No one knows.

The transfer will take place on March 8, 2025, marking the culmination of DMM Bitcoin’s liquidation process after a devastating $305 million hack in May 2024. Liquidation and Transfer Process In a December 25 notice , SBI VC indicated that customer accounts would be ready by the transfer date, and they would not have to register afresh but would instead be transitioned automatically by the company. Both fiat and cryptocurrency held by former DMM users will be transferred to SBI, with the company inheriting reports of all transactions conducted on the fallen exchange. The Tokyo-based firm initially offered 24 virtual assets for trade on its platform, but its acquisition of DMM Bitcoin will add an extra 14 cryptocurrencies to its books, including Tron (TRX), The Sandbox (SAND), Algorand (ALGO), and Maker (MKR). Additionally, as part of the deal, SBI will take over all leveraged trading pairs previously offered by DMM except those it already provides. The company also clarified that it would not transfer any open positions in leveraged trading. Per the notice, staking stocks will be automatically triggered, with customers that held Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Oasys (OAS), Flare (FLR), and Hedera (HBAR) on DMM eligible for staking on SBI. They are expected to receive their first staking reward in April 2025 if they continue holding the assets. Hacking Fallout DMM Bitcoin announced its decision to stop operations after months of recovery efforts from a multi-million dollar attack at the end of May failed. The platform lost more than 4,500 BTC, valued at around $305 million, in what is Japan’s second-largest crypto breach after another exchange, Coincheck, lost $523 million worth of NEM tokens in a 2018 incident. The DMM hack is suspected to have been carried out by threat actors linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), known as TradeTraitor. In July, investigators revealed that over $35 million stolen from the exchange had been laundered via the infamous Cambodian online marketplace Huione Guarantee. At the time, pseudonymous on-chain detective ZachXBT likened the laundering techniques to those used by another DPRK-linked outfit, the notorious Lazarus Group. Soon after it was exploited, DMM immediately pledged to make affected customers whole. However, even after borrowing 50 million yen to reimburse users, the damage to its operations proved too great, leading to the decision to transfer all assets to SBI VC Trade. The firm confirmed the acquisition in a December 2 announcement, insisting that it would work to ensure a smooth transition for clients.

The purchase is the start of a strategy to put up to 90% of the company’s surplus cash into cryptocurrency, as pioneered by industry leaders like MicroStrategy, and also it represents a larger corporate trend toward embracing digital assets. KULR’s Bitcoin treasury plan According to an announcement on Thursday, the coins were purchased at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. This is only the beginning of many more purchases since KULR plans to invest up to 90% of its available cash into Bitcoin. KULR has selected Coinbase Prime to provide custody solutions and self-custodial wallet services for its crypto assets. Following the announcement of the Bitcoin strategic reserve, the KULR stock value increased by 40%. KULR Technology Group is led by its CEO, Michael Mo, who discussed in an interview that he took inspiration from the way MicroStrategy approaches Bitcoin. Mo said , “ He calls BTC digital energy, which really resonated with our mission because we are an energy management company for batteries and space applications are our core.” The link between KULR’s core business and Bitcoin’s fundamental technology is a strategic alignment in their investment strategy. To confirm the support of shareholders for the initiative, KULR undertook a survey to assess the endorsement of this novel financial approach. The feedback was predominantly favorable. Cryptocurrency as corporate cash Mo continued, “We received an overwhelming ‘Yes.’ Here we are buying our first block of BTC and entering into the future of money.” Additionally, he expressed his strong belief in Bitcoin, asserting, “We believe that BTC is the future of money.” KULR now adds to the growing list of companies embracing BTC as part of there treasury reserve. On December 23, a Canada-based company, Matador Technologies, announced it will top up its balance sheet with $4.5 million in Bitcoin, as part of a long-term strategy for capital preservation. Quantum BioPharma, a biopharmaceutical company, also joined the trend by investing $1 million in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on December 20. In Japan, Metaplanet recently bought its largest Bitcoin to date, acquiring nearly 620 BTC. The phenomenon of corporate acquisition of Bitcoin was first brought into the limelight by MicroStrategy, which initiated its investments in Bitcoin back in 2020. Currently holding over 444,000 BTC, MicroStrategy is looking to increase its cryptocurrency holdings, aiming to buy more Bitcoins worth $42 billion more in the near future, pending the approval of shareholders. KULR’s Chief Executive Officer expects a future in which the integration of high-tech technologies creates a new corporate structure. He outlined this vision: “ We envision that the future of a dynamic corporation is based on three pillars: super intelligence through AI, an automated workforce through robotics, and the future of money through BTC, he added. “I believe the whole industry is still at the very early stage of figuring out how to tie them together,” suggesting that KULR’s Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader, long-term vision for corporate evolution.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

38156893,https://crypto.news/?p=14306305,1735250474,From physical rewards to solar power: How DePIN works,"DePIN has come to the world, providing the opportunity to create defi projects that reward actions in the physical world. What is this technology about, and how does DePIN work? Table of Contents What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? What are the DePIN options? Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? Theoretical studies in cryptocurrencies have long predicted that encryption tools currently implemented in the blockchain will be used on the Internet and impact the physical world sooner or later. Nick Szabo noted at the end of the 20th century that smart contracts can automatically manage physical objects. More than 25 years have passed, and the blockchain is firmly embedded in our lives. This is primarily due to cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to break records and is supported by significant physical infrastructure. At first glance, this confirms an actual physical presence in our world. However, the boundaries of decentralized technologies continue to expand with the advent of solutions such as DePIN. What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? DePIN meaning a Decentralized physical infrastructure network. Blockchain participants use a public ledger and cryptocurrency to build and maintain specific, real-world infrastructure projects. Simply speaking, DePIN involves using DePIN blockchain to run and sustain decentralized networks of equipment that can serve a common purpose. This enables the network to be built on decentralized, horizontal connections rather than the hierarchical approach typically seen with large infrastructure projects such as bridges or roads. Building and managing physical infrastructure networks is expensive and complex, so historically, they have been the domain of large corporations or governments with capital and resources. In contrast, DePIN encourages voluntary cooperation among participants. People can participate in DePIN networks by using their own hardware or purchasing specialized hardware for specific tasks. Options range from simple hard drives to weather stations. However, DePINs are typically built around capabilities that are available to the general public. Max Thake, co-founder of peaq, explained crypto.news that DePIN uses tokens to incentivize people to use connected hardware to offer services to other people: “Let’s imagine a smartphone-focused DePIN like Roam Network. The smartphones, owned by regular people, are the hardware component, the data on local connection quality they gather is the goods. Telecom companies looking to improve their services buy this data on a Web3 marketplace, which is where the smart contracts come into play, enabling the value exchange between the supply and demand sides.” Max Thake, co-founder of peaq You might also like: DePIN early-stage fundraising has grown 296% YoY: Messari What are the DePIN options? There are two types of DePINs: Physical Resource Networks (PRN) and Digital Resource Networks (DRN). PRNs are decentralized networks where providers give hardware resources (such as sensors or internet access), and these resources are tied to a specific location. Their contribution to the network is location-dependent, therefore they are not interchangeable. DRNs are networks where providers provide resources determined by their function, not location. Here, location does not matter. Examples of such resources include computing power, bandwidth, and storage. DePIN Sector Map | Source: Messari Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN DePIN can theoretically wholly transform how we manage and interact with physical infrastructure. Using blockchain and smart contracts , this model increases the efficiency and transparency of systems, allowing the community to make decisions independently. DePIN can be considered a kind of “industrial DAO ,” where all participants have equal opportunities and ensure the independence of the infrastructure. The system is flexible and can be scaled horizontally. With the successful attraction of motivated users, the creation of a decentralized physical infrastructure can be significantly accelerated. The pricing model in DePIN crypto systems is also considered more accessible and fair since infrastructure assets are publicly owned, and the cost of services is determined not by the company’s benefits but by availability. Rewarding participants in the form of tokens allows users to receive regular passive income with the benefit of society. However, significant disadvantages should be considered: Vulnerability to hacks and errors. High volatility of tokens. There is a need for technical knowledge to maintain a decentralized infrastructure. Nevertheless, with DePIN, blockchain powers real-world DePIN use cases and value exchanges, it is inherently linked to real-world supply and demand, which makes this segment uniquely positioned for sustainable, healthy growth. “People won’t stop using navigation apps, ordering food, or using the Web because Bitcoin took a dive. DePIN merges web3 with real value instead of speculation and offers it a chance to live up to its promise of changing the world.” Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? According to Messari analysts, in 2023, the DePIN ecosystem grew to more than 650 projects, and the number of nodes increased by 600,000. Researchers noted the main trends in the development of DePIN in 2024. Experts believe meme tokens will contribute to massively adopting projects like the BONK airdrop for Solana Saga smartphone users. Analysts also consider Asia to be the region with the most significant potential for the rapid development of decentralized infrastructure, expecting that some of the most influential projects in the sector will appear here from 2024 to 2025. The first development in the DePIN field appeared about ten years ago. During this time, the number of projects increased significantly. The sector’s market capitalization is more than $20 billion, excluding RWA and blockchain oracles, according to experts from Messari. Source: Messari Speaking about the future of DePIN, Thake expects it to become an industry staple alongside the entire supporting stack, from DePIN-crowdsourced data for training models to decentralized compute and Web3 federated learning markets for AI agents. “Some of the most exciting implementations of the DePIN model will be in the energy industry, especially when it comes to green energy, which requires flexible and decentralized grids, while most old-school ones follow the centralized model. People will soon earn by harvesting solar energy and contributing to the power grid.” However, DePIN projects are not yet popular even among participants in the cryptocurrency industry, let alone the widespread adoption of the concept. Implementing decentralized infrastructure may take time since DePIN faces problems that must be solved. However, experts are confident that this system will play a key role in shaping the future and changing the principles of operation of physical infrastructure.

Is a 1000x Move Possible?,"Dogecoin has been a major player in the crypto market since its launch, rivaling other memecoins with its wide community adoption and celebrity endorsement. However, its recent downside has faced challenges from emerging DOGE killers like PropiChain . Its revolutionary approach to tackling major real estate loopholes like inefficiencies, fraud risks, and high transaction costs has been a propeller of its token presale, which continues to attract attention from major investors. In this article, we will discuss how PropiChain could outrank the Dogecoin price and make over a 1000x move when it launches, as well as the unique features that make it stand out as a formidable competitor. The Widespread Community Adoption of Meme coins and its Impact on the Dogecoin Price Dogecoin’s continuous dominance in the market has been attributed to its passionate community, celebrity endorsements, and widespread adoption as a tipping currency. With these communities’ most loyal community support and guidance, the Dogecoin price has seen significant highs through community takeovers (CTOs) and Cabals spearheading them. Dogecoin has also experienced real-world use cases as legal tenders for charitable donations, service payments, and a niche in micropayments. However, despite its enduring popularity, Dogecoin entering a critical level has spiraled the growth of projects like PropiChain, which combines utility and innovation, to challenge its dominance and the Dogecoin price trajectory. How PropiChain Could Make a 1000x Move After Launch PropiChain’s signal to investors as one of the most prominent altcoins to outpace the Dogecoin price as a beam of hope during this critical level. Below are some unique features and how they propel its price trajectory to make over 1000x after launch. Advanced AI Technologies: PropiChain AI tools are designed to offer provisional assistance to users as they navigate the platform by providing predictive market analysis, which encompasses real-time evaluation of market trends, identification of emerging patterns, and prediction of future market behaviors. Its property filtering tools also provide sophisticated filters that consider anticipated market growth, investment potential, and properties’ historical performance irrespective of location. Metaverse Capabilities: The platform allows users to explore and invest in virtual real estate, bridging physical and digital assets. Through its virtual tours, stagings, and meetings, international investors can experiment with different layouts and designs in an immersive virtual environment and interactive experience surpassing traditional methods. RWA Tokenization: PropiChain’s approach to tokenizing assets involves digitizing properties in small and large proportions, ensuring seamless virtual transactions on a secure blockchain network. This further reduces fraud and streamlines complex processes that demand physical documentation as it democratizes access to highly valued assets to everyday investors rather than large-scale investors. Conclusion The Dogecoin Price is at a crossroads, facing challenges from innovative projects like PropiChain . With its presale already raising nearly $1M, crypto insiders are bullish about its roadmap and price trajectory to surpass DOGE. PropiChain is offering investors a chance to purchase the PCHAIN token for $0.004 in its round two presale, the lowest it will ever be before it surges after its launch. Moreover, its BlockAudit review and CoinMarketCap listing provide additional reassurance for investors. So if you are investing $1000 now, your portfolio is expected to see a massive gain of over $100,000 as it replicates the 2017 Dogecoin price, especially when it continues to gain momentum. Hurry now, and be a part of this transition before it’s too late!

38156844,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667361,1735250431,Bitcoin Reserve Idea Sparks Cautious Response From Japan PM: Report,"According to a recent report by Japanese cryptocurrency publication CoinPost, Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has taken a cautious stance on the proposal to establish a national Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. Ishiba Hesitant On Bitcoin Reserve Plans While some policymakers in Japan are advocating for the country to follow the lead of nations like the United States in exploring cryptocurrency reserves, Ishiba has expressed reservations, citing a lack of sufficient information to make an informed decision. The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve in Japan gained momentum after Satoshi Hamada, a member of the Japanese House of Councilors from the Party to Protect the People from NHK, floated the proposal during recent parliamentary discussions. Hamada argued that Japan should explore diversifying its foreign exchange reserves by including crypto assets like Bitcoin, in line with what is reportedly being discussed in the US. Hamada stated: I think Japan should follow the example of the United States and consider turning some of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets such as Bitcoin. Responding, the Japanese Prime Minister said that his government simply lacks enough information about the US and other countries’ plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. As a result, Japan cannot commit to creating a BTC reserve just yet. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Push Price Above $1 Million, Expert Predicts Ishiba reportedly said that he does not have enough understanding of the “movements” taken by the US with regard to establishing a Bitcoin reserve. He concluded, saying that “it is difficult for the government to express its views.” Further, with regard to the idea of converting some of its foreign exchange reserves into digital assets such as BTC, Ishiba cleared the air saying cryptocurrencies do not fall under the foreign exchange category. A Strategic Reserve May Shoot Up Bitcoin’s Price Earlier this month, Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the Fed itself cannot hold Bitcoin. However, reports suggest that the incoming administration under Republican president-elect Donald Trump may push forward with plans to establish a Bitcoin reserve. The Bitcoin Act of 2024, introduced by pro-crypto American Senator Cynthia Lummis, advocates for the US Treasury and Federal Reserve to acquire 200,000 BTC annually over five years, ultimately amassing one million BTC. Such a move could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market by reducing Bitcoin’s circulating supply, potentially driving up its price. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Could Push Price To $500,000: Expert Bitcoin price can go even higher if other countries around the world create their own BTC reserves, culminating in an unofficial international race among nations to accumulate as much BTC as they can. The world is already seeing nations attempting to add BTC to their treasury reserves. Recently, SkyBridge Capital Founder and Managing Partner, Anthony Scaramucci, stated that if the US goes ahead with its plans of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, there is no way that China will not create one of its own. At press time, BTC trades at $95,503, down 3.3% in the past 24 hours.

Current Republican commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda will be the only ones remaining after SEC Chair Gary Gensler steps down. This shift could signal a change in the agency's approach to the crypto industry, according to Peirce. Speaking at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit, Peirce emphasized that the SEC has various tools at its disposal , though enforcement has often been the go-to method for regulating crypto. She suggested that with new commissioners, the agency might see a different mix of cases and strategies moving forward. Uyeda pointed out the need for transparency in policymaking, noting that most discussions at federal agencies like the SEC occur privately. He stressed the importance of the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows public feedback on regulations and ensures accountability. However, some policies, such as SAB 121 , have bypassed public input, sparking criticism. SAB 121 required digital asset custodians to report liabilities and matching assets on their balance sheets. While Congress voted to overturn it, President Biden vetoed the resolution , leaving the policy in place. Both Peirce and Uyeda expressed a desire for more opportunities for public engagement in shaping SEC regulations. Peirce acknowledged the challenges of shifting the agency’s current trajectory, emphasizing the need for collaboration between regulators and the crypto industry to rebuild trust. She addressed the crypto sector directly, stating, “It will take effort from both sides to move forward, but it’s achievable.” These changes reflect a potential turning point for the SEC, particularly in how it manages the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/sec-may-shift-approach-to-crypto-under-new-leadership,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38156722.jpeg

The court unanimously rejected his claims, citing legal shortcomings in his arguments and supporting a prior ruling favoring extradition. The final decision now rests with Montenegro’s justice minister, who will determine whether Kwon will be extradited to the United States or South Korea. Reports suggest extradition to the US is more likely , reflecting the justice ministry’s stance. Kwon faces serious charges related to the collapse of Terraform Labs’ crypto ecosystem, including the TerraUSD and Luna coins. The market crash in May 2022 erased nearly $40 billion in value, making it one of the largest financial collapses in history. The failure of the UST stablecoin also triggered the infamous ""crypto winter"" of 2022, exposing malpractice at platforms like FTX and Celsius. This collapse has drawn global regulatory attention to stablecoins and decentralized finance. In March 2023, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro while attempting to travel with a forged passport. His case is seen as a precedent for international collaboration in prosecuting cryptocurrency-related crimes. Earlier this year, Terraform Labs settled with the SEC for $4.47 billion, the largest financial settlement in the agency's history. This included $3.6 billion in disgorgement fines, $420 million in civil penalties, and $467 million in interest. Kwon himself was ordered to pay over $200 million, consisting of $110 million in disgorgement fines , $80 million in civil penalties, and $14.3 million in interest. Reports also suggest Kwon has potential political ties in Montenegro, raising questions about his influence on the legal process. In 2023, Montenegro's prime minister called for an inquiry into allegations that Kwon financially supported the Europe Now party, led by Milojko Spajic, a political rival. This ruling has brought Kwon closer to extradition, setting the stage for a major legal showdown .

Marszalek highlighted the significance of this step, emphasizing the US and Canada as two of the most crucial markets in the crypto space. The launch aligns with Crypto.com’s strategy to innovate and expand its offerings, solidifying its presence in a rapidly evolving market. Based in Singapore, Crypto.com has been growing its footprint globally. This year has seen significant progress, including securing various regulatory approvals worldwide. The launch of the US trust company follows the acquisition of Watchdog Capital, a US SEC -registered broker-dealer, further strengthening the company’s position in North America. Earlier this month, Marszalek visited President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, signaling Crypto.com’s willingness to collaborate with the upcoming administration . In a related development, the company dropped a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had been filed in October following a Wells notice about potential enforcement action. Crypto.com indicated that withdrawing the lawsuit was part of its effort to work cooperatively with regulators to establish a robust framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Despite regulatory hurdles, 2023 has been a positive year for the company. Notable achievements include becoming the first cryptocurrency sponsor of the UEFA Champions League in August, a move that boosted its global visibility through stadium promotions, broadcast features, and other marketing campaigns.

38156521,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633643,1735249252,Why are whales secretly accumulating Bitcoin?,"Bitcoin transactions have risen significantly over the last two years, and with that increase, private transactions, especially CoinJoin transactions, have tripled. While some attribute the rise of CoinJoin transactions to hackers laundering funds, others point to increasing whale accumulation. The bitcoin market has seen a major shift in the behavior of transactions. So-called CoinJoin private transactions have tripled, according to data from CryptoQuant. However, Chainalysis presents evidence that the surge in CoinJoin transactions has nothing or less to do with illicit activity; it might be part of another trend dominating the Bitcoin ecosystem. Per Chainalysis, crypto hacks have only summed up to $2.2 billion this year. Though this is a great number, it translates to less than 0.5% of the inflows of Bitcoin into Realized Cap for the same period, which stands at $377 billion. BTC whales are privately accumulating CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said whales are buying Bitcoin through stealth buys, which are surging. The whales normally use privacy-enhancing methods in asset transfers, particularly with new institutional investors. This trend is marked by a massive inflow of Bitcoin to accumulation addresses connected to exchange-traded funds (ETFs), MicroStrategy, and custodial wallets. More than 1.55 million BTC in 2024 alone have entered using these accumulation addresses, which is the greatest testament to the interest of institutions growing in Bitcoin. The whales typically have strong reasons for keeping their transactions private so that large capital flows will neither upset the market prices of such transactions nor reveal identities. The CoinJoin tools are friendly in this aspect and hide the flows of funds in a manner that would otherwise be traceable on the Bitcoin blockchain. Source: CryptoQuant Who are these Whales? While sometimes the market has been kind enough to provide some resemblance of transparency, a significant amount of Bitcoin has not been traced yet. It is estimated that between 240,000 and 420,000 BTC is held by unknown people. So, just who are these whales? These mystery accumulators indicate that there is a division of ownership of Bitcoin. Institutional players like ETFs and companies like MicroStrategy are often given the limelight as they make large purchases. So, that unknown parties are accumulating Bitcoin, reveals that other private investors or institutional entities have a reason not to reveal their positions. It says that major investors are pretty keen on having their portfolios somewhat private so they aren’t getting too much attention in the markets. It’s unique that bitcoin’s ownership is pretty diversified with more big players getting in, such as companies and institutions. However, a lot of them do so secretly, such as with MicroStrategy; most keep it under wraps so no one knows what’s happening. As Bitcoin continues to grow, with all these CoinJoin transactions getting bigger and more institutions jumping in, it shows how this currency is slowly fitting into a more advanced setup.

38156074,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=27193,1735248841,NexQloud’s Innovative NXQ Token System Turns CPU Devices into Profit Centers,"Why NXQ Tokens Could Revolutionize Cloud Computing and Set New Standards for Crypto Projects Enter the next era of cryptocurrency with NXQ Tokens, the official currency of NexQloud’s cloud computing platform. Tailored for enterprises utilizing Kubernetes for containerized orchestration, this platform is designed to seamlessly meet the needs of modern businesses. Driven by real-world demand and innovative tokenomics, NXQ Tokens offer a compelling opportunity to invest in a tangible, utility-driven asset with significant growth potential. NXQ Token Overview NXQ Tokens are the currency of NexQloud’s decentralized cloud computing network, balancing increasing demand with shrinking supply to drive long-term value. They serve as the utility token distributed to QloudNode operators who provide the specialized hardware required to run the decentralized cloud. Businesses require NXQ tokens to access NexQloud’s services, creating a self-sustaining cycle where token demand and value grow organically. As more enterprises adopt NexQloud’s cost-efficient and environmentally friendly cloud solutions without compromising security or availability, the demand for NXQ Tokens is expected to increase in line with their rising computing needs, projected at a compound annual growth rate of 16.3%. Concurrently, the supply of NXQ Tokens tightens due to a Bitcoin-inspired halving mechanism that reduces daily token distribution every four years. This, combined with increasing competition among QloudNode operators, further restricts token availability, while NXQ’s fixed supply ensures lasting scarcity. Maruo Terrinoni, CEO of NexQloud, explains, “This distinctive blend of increasing demand and limited supply establishes NXQ as a utility-backed token with considerable growth potential, presenting an appealing opportunity for both investors and QloudNode contributors.” NXQ Tokenomics Advantage: Supply and Demand Platform Growth: Every new business onboarded to NexQloud adds to the token demand, creating a cycle of increasing adoption and revenue reinvestment. NexQloud brings a dynamic market presence to the trillion-dollar cloud industry, which is growing at a 16.3% Compound Annual Growth Rate. Enterprise Adoption: Businesses require NXQ tokens to access NexQloud’s decentralized cloud services. As more enterprises switch to NexQloud for its cost-effective and scalable solutions, the demand for NXQ increases. Growing enterprise workloads amplify token usage as companies scale their operations and computing needs. Speculative Interest: NXQ’s proven scarcity model and real-world utility attract crypto investors seeking a stable yet growth-oriented asset. NXQ Supply Decreases Through Scarcity Mechanisms Bitcoin-Inspired Scarcity Mechanism: The total supply of NXQ tokens is capped at 21 million, ensuring a finite asset that becomes increasingly valuable as demand grows. Halving Events: Every four years, the daily token distribution (3600 NXQ tokens daily until 2028) to QloudNode operators is halved, mirroring Bitcoin’s approach to driving value appreciation over time. Increased QloudNode Competition: As more QloudNode operators join the network, competition for daily token rewards intensifies, making NXQ tokens harder to acquire. Fixed Supply: With no ability to mint additional tokens, the token supply remains immutable, safeguarding against inflation. The Supply and Demand Impact This system ensures that as NexQloud scales and enterprise adoption grows, NXQ tokens remain scarce, increasing their value. The result is a predictable scarcity-driven appreciation in token value, offering investors a stable, utility-backed asset with significant long-term growth opportunities. “By aligning our tokenomics with enterprise cloud demand, NXQ delivers a compelling opportunity, blending the best of cryptocurrency innovation with practical, real-world utility,” says Terrinoni. “We are not just creating a decentralized platform; we are influencing a trillion-dollar industry to recognize the real-world impact and long-term value of blockchain technology.

38156839,https://blockworks.co/news/sol-bearish-december-market-cap,1735248600,SOL’s market cap slips amid bearish December,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Roughly a month ago, SOL set a new all-time high at $263. Since then, it’s been down-only for the asset, which retraced all the way below $190. The 25% slide knocked Solana down a couple of rungs on the cryptocurrency leaderboard. SOL is now the sixth-largest cryptoasset by market capitalization, trailing bitcoin, ethereum, tether, ripple and BNB. Some have pointed to the flashy new exchange Hyperliquid as a SOL competitor, but other market watchers say Solana is likely to keep running after a slight drawdown. For context, all cryptos have had a rough week after the most recent FOMC meeting somehow left investors feeling bearish despite another rate cut . Still, of all the major tokens experiencing a Santa slide, SOL showed “particular weakness,” FalconX head of research David Lawant wrote on Friday. Memecoins like SHIB and DOGE performed even worse, perhaps indicating that the more volatile the crypto, the harder it fell. While SOL is far from a memecoin, it is certainly higher-beta than BTC or ETH. That hasn’t stopped XRP and BNB from rallying past Solana however. Solana investors may partly be pricing in a $2.1 billion SOL token unlock that’s slated for March 1, 2025 and could put downward pressure on the asset if the unlocked tokens are sold. SOL’s price may also be struggling due to a newfound competitor in Hyperliquid peeling away some investors, Quai Network co-founder Alan Orwick said. Hyperliquid is a decentralized-ish layer-1 and crypto exchange focused on perpetual futures trading. Its HYPE token airdrop earlier this month was one of the largest in crypto history. HYPE is already the 25th-largest crypto token by market cap. Because Hyperliquid is very fast, some have started calling it a better version of speed-focused Solana — although its momentum has stalled somewhat in recent days amid speculation that North Korean hackers are plotting an exploit of the blockchain. Orwick added that a pro-crypto Trump administration and potential SOL ETF approval could be bullish for the asset next year. Plus, there are always memecoins. The launchpad and major driver of Solana onchain activity pump.fun “probably won’t get shut down by the Feds until 2028,” CFX Labs co-founder and CEO Nick Chicago said. “Wouldn’t be surprised to get major brands doing memes.” Chicago was bullish for anecdotal reasons as well: His mother-in-law, who typically buys cryptos at the very top, “has not deployed yet.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The community gathered 1.69T tokens, which were burnt from the DAO’s multi-sig wallet. Bonk (BONK), one of the leading Solana meme tokens, decreased its supply by 1.69B tokens after a community vote. The token burn by Bonk DAO aims to further decrease the supply and spark value growth for BONK. The token burn further limits the supply down to 91T from an initial creation of 100T tokens. The burn was achieved in a single Solana transaction and recorded for the community. Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion ❗️❗️❗️ #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 BONK aims to be a community-owned token, where users agree to hold and keep the asset deflationary for long-term appreciation. The current burn mixed various forms of social media and ecosystem engagement, adding more exposure for BONK on social media. The BONK burned is valued at over $52M in notional value, and represents around 2% of the total supply. After the burn, the wallet of Bonk DAO still holds 9% of the total supply and is the biggest singular entity on the chain. The DAO wallet even surpasses the BONK holdings on Binance. The BONK staking pool locks up an additional 4.8% of the token’s supply. Bonk DAO still holds 9% of the total token supply. | Source: Bubblemaps The recent token burn was a continuation of the 2023 Bonkmas event. The supply burn also marks the second anniversary of BONK. The vote aims to boost participation across the ecosystem, as the project’s main goal is to boost Solana usage through memes. The initial intention was to burn 1T tokens, but the community extended the deposits to a much larger pool. Two years ago, BONK was focusing on airdrops and reaching a wider community of holders. Later, BONK aims to engage those holders and strengthen its position as a long-term meme. BONK was one of the memes to help Solana leave behind the meme market. However, BONK is also not favored by influencers like Murad Mahmudov, who are more interested in cults created in the past year. BONK will plan similar events in the future, while trying to offer better real-time reporting to motivate the community, remarked top ecosystem contributor Nom . The burn proposal was accepted with 99% votes in favor. The burn campaign lasted from November 15 until December 25. Part of the burn was based on social media interactions, including messages on X and followers on Instagram and TikTok. Additional BONK was set aside for burns for engaging with selected ecosystem partners. BONK still awaits to recover its higher price range Even after the burn, BONK did not rally immediately. The asset traded near a one-month low at $0.000031, after peaking at $0.000053 on November 22. BONK open interest is near a three-month low at $8.32M, after traders rolled over to other assets. However, the lowered position sparks expectations of an eventual rally from the lows as BONK starts to appear undervalued. BONK remains one of the low-cost tokens aiming for meme influence and community cohesion while attempting to grow its influence against other memes. The recent token burn also aims to boost attention for BONK, after other Solana assets started to displace the former leader. BONK has previously lost its leading position to DogWifHat (WIF), though for a brief period of active trading. This time around, BONK is no longer the leading Solana meme token, after the native Pudgy Penguins token (PENGU) was added to the list. PENGU was categorized as a meme token, and its market capitalization above $2.4B put it ahead of BONK. The original meme still has a chance to recover its leading position, attempting to ride on its wide community appeal and long trading history. BONK is part of the 2022 crop of memes, with more than 370K followers. Its prominent status and listings on major markets put it ahead of newer meme trends. BONK has already spread to 11 chains, with more than 770K reported holders.

Here we delve into its current status and what the technical indicators suggest. Unusual Wallet Activity in a Dynamic Market Bitcoin’ s price volatility is notable, particularly its recent slip from $108,000 to $97,000. Amidst these shifts, dormant bitcoin addresses are suddenly active. For example, a wallet inactive since 2015 recently moved nearly 60 BTC, shifting from legacy to modern addresses. In total, about 100 BTC, valued at nearly $9.7 million, relocated through these actions, captivating the on-chain analysts’ community. Further, on a memorable Saturday, a November 2012 wallet stirred, transferring 105 BTC. Initially valued at $1,200 back then, today this movement represents over $10 million. These movements, primarily to modern secure addresses, indicate a strategic adjustment from seasoned investors, highlighting the balance between anonymity and traceability within blockchain transactions. Bitcoin’s Technical Landscape: An Analysis Bitcoin is currently valued at $95,528. Despite remaining the largest crypto by market cap at $1.89 trillion, it faces bearish pressure. Notably, it has retraced 50% from its recent highs, with the $98,300 mark now acting as a resistance point. This retracement aligns with the descending trend line, signaling potential downward pressure. Immediate resistance levels include $98,330, $102,175, and $104,954. Conversely, support levels are pegged at $92,105 and $89,418. A breach below the $95,000 mark could catalyze further declines, whereas surpassing $98,330 might rekindle short-term bullish prospects. Key Technical Indicators: Fibonacci Resistance : Bitcoin struggles at $98,300, a pivotal retracement level. Critical Support : Downside risks include the $92,105 and $89,418 marks. Indicators : With an RSI of 42.84 and the 50-day EMA near $97,831, the bearish outlook persists. Bitcoin’s technical dynamics suggest a phase of consolidation, with crucial levels outlining potential future paths. Traders should monitor these resistance and support points for actionable strategies. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 Flockerz Presale Surpasses $7.9M: Last Hours to Join With just over 26 days remaining, Flockerz ($FLOCK) has successfully surpassed its original presale target, raising $7.94 million.

Analysis Company Founder Shares","According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the cryptocurrency market has become accustomed to the steady accumulation of Bitcoin by large holders, commonly referred to as whales. Whale news that moved the market just a few years ago is now considered routine, reflecting a shift in market dynamics. In a recent statement, Ju noted that the prevalence of whale congestion has become a daily topic of discussion: “Just 2-3 years ago, news of whale congestion would send shock waves through the market. Today, this is no longer breaking news, but just expected, routine information.” According to Ju, this normalization is due to the relative absence of individual investors and the dominance of whales in the Bitcoin market. Ju believes this dynamic is widely accepted within the crypto community. Related News: Two Giant Whales Panicked at the Recent Drop: They Dumped This Altcoin Immediately Addressing concerns about a potential bubble, Ju defined a bubble as a period when the market price, as measured by on-chain data, significantly exceeds the actual capital inflow. Comparing this to the current state of the market, Ju cited the weekly on-chain capital inflow of $7 billion as evidence of an ongoing bull market. “We are clearly in a bull market right now,” Ju said. He suggested that the muted reaction to the whale accumulation news could be due to consistent bull market calls from analysts, including himself, over the past two years. However, he noted that the bull market is not over and a true bubble scenario would be characterized by analysts’ widespread warnings of a cyclical top. Ju rejected the idea of an imminent bear market, calling on those predicting a downturn to back up their claims with data: “I would like to hear the reasoning of those predicting a bear market. One thing is clear: they are not looking at on-chain data.” While the analyst acknowledged the possibility of a correction, he downplayed its potential impact within the current bull cycle. He predicted that any decline would likely be less than 30% and short-lived, with the potential for a strong recovery. *This is not investment advice.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT.

In a research paper, CoinGecko says that the majority of crypto interest in 2024 hit the memecoin sector, which saw an expansion from dog-themed tokens to other animal and personality-themed digital assets. “The most popular crypto narrative in 2024 was by far the memecoin narrative, which captured a combined 30.67% of global investor interest across the main memecoin narrative and 25 memecoin trends. In other words, almost a third of crypto narrative interest this year was focused on more speculative opportunities with less emphasis on fundamentals, as the market expanded rapidly from dog-related memecoins to other animal-and personality-themed memecoins. Specifically, the main memecoin narrative ranked 1st with a 14.36% share of crypto narrative interest. This represents a 6.04 percentage point increase from the memecoin narrative’s 8.32% share of interest last year.” CoinGecko also finds that smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) – known for being rife with memecoin activity – also drew a significant amount of trader interest in 2024. Base, the blockchain of top US-based crypto exchange Coinbase, also drew notable interest. “Solana-related narratives captured a combined 14.30% share of investor interest, putting it close behind the AI narrative in terms of popularity. While Solana memecoins drove almost half of attention towards the chain, investors continued to be interested in the broader Solana ecosystem, which ranked as the 5th most popular narrative with 5.78% of investor interest… Meanwhile, two Base-related narratives also entered the top 20 rankings this year, on the back of the chain’s strengthening popularity. Altogether, the Base ecosystem and the Base memecoins narratives accounted for 4.87% of investor interest.” SOL is trading at $199 at time of writing.

To read full editions, subscribe . Stocks traded sideways — stalling their pre-Christmas rally — and cryptos dipped Thursday, making one of the final trading days of the year a relatively quiet one. The S&P 500 was down 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.02% at 2 pm ET. Bitcoin and ether were down 3% and 3.8%, respectively, over the past 24 hours at that time. The post-holiday moves came as investors unpacked one of the only economic data reports of the week: initial jobless claims. There were 210,000 first-time filers for the week ended Dec. 21, marking a slight decrease from the week prior and coming in lower than median expectation of 224,000. Continuing claims, however, came in at 1.9 million, slightly higher than the anticipated 1.88 million. The mixed report did not budge odds of an interest rate cut from the Fed next month. Fed funds futures markets on Thursday called for a 91% chance central bankers hold rates on Jan. 29, per data from CME Group. “One factor that pressures equities is the behavior of the fixed income market,” Pepperstone research strategist Quasar Elizundia said. “The continued rise in bond yields, driven by the reassessment of less restrictive monetary policy expectations, creates some concern.” Stocks are going to face additional headwinds, Elizundia added, given that investors seem certain interest rates in 2025 will not fall as much as previously anticipated. On the crypto front, the real market-movers in 2025 are likely to revolve around regulatory news . New leadership at the SEC and CFTC, combined with a Republican-majority Congress and campaign promises from President-elect Donald Trump, could set the stage for a breakout in the first half of the new year. Still, though, it would be foolish to count out the role macroeconomic conditions and monetary policy have on crypto prices, so we’d suggest keeping an eye on just about everything (or at least your inbox) next year.

38154917,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314233,1735246526,"Bitcoin Cycle Top ‘Still Seems Far Off,’ According to CryptoQuant CEO – Here’s His Outlook","The chief executive of market intelligence platform CryptoQuant says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) still has a ways to go before reaching its cycle top. In a new thread on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says that those predicting an upcoming bear market for the crypto king are likely ignoring on-chain data that shows BTC has been in a bull market for the last two years. According to Ju, crypto whales accumulating large amounts of the top crypto asset by market cap has gone from being a newsworthy event to a routine one, proving the bull market isn’t over. “The narrative of whale accumulation on Bitcoin has become so common that it’s now daily chatter. Just 2-3 years ago, news of whales accumulating would send shockwaves through the market. Today, it’s no longer breaking news – it’s just expected, routine information… Right now, we’re clearly in a bull market, with on-chain data showing $7 billion in weekly capital entering the market… News of whale accumulation no longer moves people – maybe because analysts, including me, have been calling it a bull market for the last two years. But the bull market isn’t over. If Bitcoin enters a bubble, all the analysts would be screaming about the cyclical top.” Ju goes on to say that BTC is not in a “bubble,” which he defines as when an asset’s market price significantly exceeds the capital flowing into it, noting that its cycle peak is not close. “For now, it’s obviously not a bubble. Sure, corrections can happen, but amid a bull cycle, it’s very unlikely we’ll see more than a 30% drop. Even if such a drop happens, it would likely be short-lived, with prices potentially going up more than 30% after the correction. The peak of this Bitcoin cycle still seems far off. For those predicting the start of a bear market, I’d like to hear their reasoning.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Bitcoin is trading for $96,387 at time of writing, a 1.9% decrease over the last 24 hours.

He added that BTC ETPs added 561,786 BTC in 2024 globally. The report suggests that 859,454 BTC has been bought by ETFs and public companies during the year.

He went to X to demand answers following the release of results from the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) survey, which looked into this situation. Crypto Market is the Target of Debanking Traditional alternative investment managers like real estate did not experience this same trouble with the banks. Notably, AIMA discovered this after surveying 20 other alternative investors who were not dealing with cryptocurrencies. None of them had issues while receiving basic banking services. AIMA has made an action call, asking for a collaborative effort to stop this challenge the crypto industry faces. The association thinks that working closely with the incoming Donald Trump administration will serve as a solution . Already, Trump demonstrated his animosity towards this anti-crypto sentiment during his campaign. AIMA Survey Report Supports Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The AIMA survey report gives credence to Operation Choke Point 2.0 and the redacted documents published by Coinbase in its case with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It furnishes them with new statistical grounds. For context, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is a debanking campaign allegedly targeted at the digital assets industry. US regulators wrote to banks discouraging them from using banking services to access crypto-related firms. The end game of this move is to suppress the crypto industry in the United States. Coinbase Seeks FDIC Pause Letters Coinbase has been pursuing this matter , seeking documents that prove to the court and the public that the FDIC made such requests of banks. In the process, the American cryptocurrency exchange came across some redacted “pause letters,” showing efforts of the FDIC to restrict crypto banking services. Noteworthy, the letters were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Each “pause letter” explicitly instructed banks to suspend crypto asset-related activities. They were also heavily redacted, preventing Coinbase from accessing a few other pieces of information. According to Grewal, “The letters that show Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory. FDIC is still hiding behind way overbroad redactions. And they still haven’t produced more than a fraction of them.” The post Coinbase CLO Reacts to AIMA Survey Results appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Coin Rise,https://thecoinrise.com/coinbase-clo-reacts-to-aima-survey-results/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/38155404.jpeg

As the blockchain world evolves, so do the opportunities to invest in projects that could redefine finance, technology, and community engagement. This December, savvy investors have their eyes on coins like Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), alongside the innovative Qubetics ($TICS). While Bitcoin remains the gold standard of crypto and Ethereum dominates smart contracts, Qubetics stands out with its user-friendly blockchain development tools, which are currently gaining traction during its presale. From Bitcoin’s proven track record to Ethereum’s revolutionary dApps, these giants hold their ground. Yet, Qubetics, with its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE and game-changing approach to blockchain creation, presents a rare chance for early adopters to secure significant ROI. Let’s explore these top cryptos to buy in December 2024, starting with the revolutionary Qubetics. 1. Qubetics: The Best Blockchain Development Tool for Early Adopters Qubetics ($TICS) is revolutionising blockchain development with its proprietary QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment that makes creating decentralised applications easier. The platform allows developers to drag and drop pre-built components directly into their projects, such as user authentication and token management. Users can define logic and smart contract parameters using form-based configurations without writing complex code. Additionally, the IDE includes a vast library of pre-written code snippets, empowering even beginners to integrate advanced blockchain functionalities effortlessly. Qubetics bridges the gap between technical innovation and user accessibility, setting itself apart in the crypto space. Currently, Qubetics is in Presale Phase 14, with weekly price hikes of 10%, culminating in a massive 20% increase in the final stage. Right now, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037, with over $7.8M raised, 11,800+ holders, and 377M tokens already sold. The next phase is just around the corner, promising a substantial ROI potential of 563.81% before the token reaches its post-presale price target of $0.25. Analysts anticipate the token hitting $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. Early participation in this presale could be a golden ticket to financial success, with Qubetics leading the list of top cryptos to buy in December 2024 . 2. Bitcoin: The Original Cryptocurrency Powerhouse Bitcoin ($BTC) is the undisputed pioneer of the crypto world. Launched in 2009, it introduced the concept of decentralised, peer-to-peer transactions secured through blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its scarcity, with only 21 million coins ever to be mined. It serves as a store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" As institutional adoption increases, Bitcoin remains a key player in investment portfolios worldwide. Its consistent performance and increasing scarcity make it an undeniable pick among top cryptos to buy in December 2024. Why Bitcoin made this list: Its reliability and dominance in the crypto market. 3. Ethereum: The Smart Contract Leader Ethereum ($ETH) redefined blockchain technology by introducing smart contracts, enabling developers to build decentralised applications (dApps). Launched in 2015, Ethereum’s network is the foundation for countless innovations, from DeFi projects to NFTs. The platform has become more sustainable and scalable with the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Its ecosystem continues to thrive, cementing its place as a cornerstone of the blockchain industry. Why Ethereum made this list: Its unmatched versatility and robust dApp ecosystem. Conclusion: Why These Are the Top Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to buy in December 2024 are Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin ($BTC), and Ethereum ($ETH). While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the cornerstones of the crypto world, Qubetics is carving out its niche with groundbreaking tools and an unmissable presale. At just $0.037 per token and with staggering ROI potential, Qubetics offers unparalleled opportunities for those ready to invest now. Don’t wait—seize the moment and secure your $TICS tokens before the price climbs even higher. The next phase is fast approaching, and this might be your best chance to ride the wave of innovation.

The analyst provided an in-depth analysis showing that XRP has a much higher multiplier than BTC and ETH. XRP Price To Outperform Bitcoin And Ethereum In an X post, Egrag Crypto predicted that the XRP price would outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum as he envisages XRP’s market cap could reach between $619.61 billion and $1.56 trillion. With XRP’s dominance and market potential, the crypto asserted that it has a much higher multiplier than the two largest coins by market cap. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Analyst Puts Target Above $0.37 Egrag Crypto went further to explain why an explosive surge in the XRP price’s dominance is imminent. The crypto analyst noted that XRP’s dominance is currently at 3.93% above the Fibonacci 0.382 level, and if the crypto closes above Fib 0.5 (5.57%), then XRP could witness a double-digit dominance ahead. Egrag Crypto mentioned that the XRP price’s VRVP is showing a void above 4.30%, meaning less resistance and a smoother road to an all-time high (ATH) and beyond. The analyst remarked that the “Kaboom green zone” starts at Fib 0.50, signaling a big move ahead for the crypto. Egrag Crypto added that the XRP price’s smaller market cap offers higher upside potential. This means the crypto could enjoy faster dominance growth as it catches up with the broader altcoin rally and takes Lion’s share. The crypto analyst highlighted three key levels to watch for XRP’s dominance. This includes Fib 0.0702, which puts the XRP price’s dominance at 11.44%, and Fib 0.786 and 0.888, which puts the dominance at 15.22% and 21.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst predicts that the total crypto market cap could hit $5.42 trillion or $7.25 trillion if it reaches Fib 1.414 and Fib 1.618, respectively. This would put XRP’s market cap at $1.16 trillion or $1.56 trillion if the crypto hits a 21.5% dominance. A Rally To ATH Remains The Short-Term Target Having already enjoyed a year-to-date (YTD) gain of just over 200%, the short-term target for the XRP price is a rally to its current ATH of $3.80. Crypto analyst Javon Marks suggested that XRP could soon reach this target as he predicted a rally to a new ATH of $4.8. Related Reading: Possible Deep Correction Could Push Cardano Price To $0.43, Here’s How He noted that the XRP price touched the $2.47 target and broke above it briefly before dropping this resistance level again. However, with this representing a low time-frame bull signal, movement above this resistance level could be imminent, which Marks predicted would pave the way for a rally to $4.8. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.19, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

38155014,https://blockworks.co/news/fed-dovish-hawkish-2024-conduct,1735245000,Recapping the Fed flip-flop of 2024,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . I sit reflecting on the year and what has transpired, especially in relation to the recent FOMC meeting that surprised hawkish and shocked markets . Over one year it felt like we’ve been through five different versions of the Fed. In the winter of 2024, the Fed got spooked by surprisingly elevated inflation prints in the first quarter. This led them to reverse their dovish inclinations they had set up in the fall of 2023. Then, in June, the FOMC surprised the market with a hawkish dot plot that implied hardly any cuts in 2024. Then, a concerning jobs report in August flipped the entire narrative on its head. The Fed became concerned about a growth scare and losing the labor market, and once again flipped dovish, climaxing in a September cut of 50bps to kick off the rate-cutting cycle. We’ve now had 100bps of cuts and the Fed has once again flipped hawkish. The outlook for 2025 is uncertain, with a forecast of only two cuts occurring next year. If that all sounded like a rollercoaster of confusion, trust your instinct — it was. Now, with January priced for a pause and no meeting in February, I’m once again expecting another flip-flop as we head into the new year. Additionally, I see the potential for more cuts than what is currently expected in 2025 to be priced in during the first quarter. So as we head into the new year, I give you my parting thoughts: Expect to continue hearing the noise of flip-flops in the distance. Enjoy the holidays and see you in 2025!

38154261,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322906,1735244551,"People Want To Hold More Bitcoin, Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith Says","Blockchain Association Kristin Smith CEO told CNBC’s Squawk Box Thursday that people are looking to hold more Bitcoin ahead of the new year as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith During her December 26 appearance on the program, Smith indicated that Bitcoin’s growing popularity and the rise of potential Bitcoin reserves could be positive markers for its future. “Having that change of attitude at the top makes a tremendous amount of difference,” says @KMSmithDC on Trump’s pro-crypto leadership picks. “We’ve got to strike while the iron is hot here, we need to work on getting the appropriate legislation done.” https://t.co/t0uJLrJpI9 — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) December 26, 2024 “People are looking to hold more Bitcoin, not less,” Smith said. “Having that change of attitude at the top, having a president who says ‘hey, we want the U.S. to be the capital of this industry, we want to fight for you… makes a tremendous amount of difference.” Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, largely campaigned on enacting crypto-friendly regulations when he returned to the Oval Office – a move that Smith noted aligns with the desire of key crypto industry players. “They want to have a government with some oversight to ensure there aren’t conflicts of interest, that things are running smoothly, that there isn’t any funny business at that level,” Smith continued. Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Post Donald Trump Election The trade association leader’s comments come as the Satoshi Nakamoto-created cryptocurrency’s value begins to cool following a post-election surge that saw the coin skyrocket to an all-time high of $108,000. The anticipation of a United States Bitcoin reserve and Trump’s desire to instate a crypto-friendly regulatory framework seem to catalyze the crypto currency’s remarkable growth. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Trump’s predicted restructuring of the federal agencies responsible for overseeing digital assets and the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to what appears to be a growing interest in crypto investments from the traditional finance sector. “You have a lot of people who are learning about Bitcoin for the first time and I think that as more and more retail financial advisors are advising their clients to do this, I think we’re going to see more people coming into Bitcoin,” Smith continued. However, it’s currently unclear how exactly Trump’s time in office will shape the regulatory direction of Bitcoin and its mainstream interest.

38154109,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633645,1735244422,Jupiter to award 200M JUP as variable rewards and incentives during Jupuary airdrop,"The long-awaited Jupuary airdrop by Jupiter DEX aggregator revealed its incentive structure. A total of 700M JUP will go toward both old and new ecosystem participants. Jupiter, the leading DEX aggregator on Solana, announced the structure of its Jupuary reward and incentive system. The event will distribute 700M JUP in early January, after a discussion about incentivizing older holders versus new users. The latest distribution schedule will grant 500M JUP on a fixed basis per wallet. The remaining 200M will go toward new users, in a double system of ‘carrot’ and ‘good cat’ incentives. This schedule is still a draft and may change before the actual airdrop. Jupuary 2025 🪐 Here is the first Overview of the upcoming Jupuary distribution. Team decided to go with a split between Users & Stakers and Carrots & Good Cats. This way we are trying to appreciate everyone in the Jupiverse! Note: This is a Draft, Subject to change 💡 pic.twitter.com/mbGNy3QxSe — Jupiter Uplink (@jup_uplink) December 26, 2024 The wallet allocation will favor older users and stakers, as requested by the community. The Jupuary event will have a detailed look at swap wallets, spreading rewards into five tiers. Regular swap users need proof they are human, plus a minimum of $1,000 in swaps. Around 2M wallets are eligible for this airdrop. Around 320K expert trader wallets will also be eligible, requiring more complex trading actions, liquidity injections perpetual futures, DCA operations, and ‘ape’ investments. Jupuary will have five regular trader tiers, depending on JUP held and trading activity, and five corresponding tiers for expert traders. The tiers may see some changes, as the Jupiter community noticed a significant disparity in rewards. Based on the draft plan, wallets with 50 JUP balance will be eligible for an airdrop if they also show trades valued at $800, but the next tier, those with 250 JUP, may receive an airdrop only after achieving $29,000 in trading activity. Overall, the airdrop will favor trading activity ahead of stakers, to avoid passive JUP holders and older whales. Still, the event will distribute 75M JUP to stakers, while setting aside 425M JUP for active users. For those that still prefer the staking and governance route, the Jupuary event will offer rewards for simple staking in a separate group. For those who also use active staking with the right to vote, governance will bring extra rewards. All intended allocations will be subject to change, as the community discussion continues. Jupuary itself was decided after two votes and community discussion. The end goal was to establish the parameters of the event, and then repeat a similar airdrop in early 2026. The current airdrop plan will still go through a community discussion to discover the preferred mode of distribution. JUP slides despite Jupuary and heightened activity JUP is one of the tokens that moved against the trend, sliding from its yearly peak at $1.40. Despite the success of Solana DEX trading, JUP has been sliding for the second half of the year. The token now trades at $0.82, with an accelerated downward trend in the past few days. JUP trading volumes have also slowed down to $81M in 24 hours. JUP open interest has also fallen toward $66M, near a three-month low. Previously, the Jupuary hype has helped boost JUP market prices. The token is also volatile and has gone through multiple cycles of sliding under $1, then recovering to its higher range. Jupiter DEX increased its baseline for aggregated volumes in Q4, driven by meme token swaps on Solana. | Source: DeFi Llama The price action does not reflect the usage of the aggregator. Jupiter increased its activity in the last quarter of 2024, reflecting the growing interest in Solana meem token swaps. Jupiter also added personalized tools for token activities, including DCA buying or finding the optimal route for trading tokens. Jupiter is the second most widely used app on Solana after Raydium, either for routing or direct swaps. Aggregated volume on Jupiter peaked in the week ended November 17, when the aggregator handled $39B in trading volumes. Since then, weekly aggregated activity shifted to a lower baseline of $24B. JUP is one of the tokens where activity and value locked remain much lower than the total market capitalization. However, the main fear is that the new Jupuary event will flood the market with more tokens, leading to a lower market price.

But if you’re one of the folks who missed that golden opportunity, don’t panic—there’s still hope for you. BTFD Coin is here, and trust me, it’s got all the right moves to be the next big thing in the meme coin world.

So if you missed out on Brett Coin’s ICO, don’t let this one pass you by! The Missed ICO: Brett Coin’s Rocket Ride to Glory Let’s take a moment to talk about Brett Coin and its legendary ICO. If you were one of the lucky early birds who bought in, you were likely sipping margaritas by the time Brett Coin’s price shot up faster than a rocket on a sugar high. Launched at a low price point of only $0.000125 last February, the ICO for Brett Coin was the ultimate “get in while it’s cheap” moment. You could almost hear the sounds of high-fives and fist bumps as Brett Coin’s value climbed to a crazy $0.085 by the end of March, leaving those who hesitated shaking their heads in disbelief. Brett Coin wasn’t just another meme coin—it exploded onto the scene, becoming one of the most talked-about tokens of the year. Investors who snagged coins during the ICO watched their portfolios soar as Brett Coin entered the mainstream, fueled by hype, a tight-knit community, and a relentless marketing push that had everyone saying, “I should’ve gotten in sooner.” Unfortunately, for those who missed the ICO, it’s like trying to catch a wave that’s already crashed.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

While the global push for Bitcoin grows, skeptics are becoming advocates, Japan remains hesitant to join the trend. Japan Cautious About Bitcoin Reserves According to a report by local news outlet CoinJP, Japan remains cautious about adopting Bitcoin as part of its national reserves due to concerns over security, liquidity, and volatility. In an official response dated December 20, the Japanese government clarified that crypto assets like Bitcoin do not fall under the legal framework of foreign exchange reserves. As such, the government stated that these reserves are intended to stabilize foreign currency-denominated assets and bond markets, and the volatility of Bitcoin is inconsistent with this system. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, responding to a question from Satoshi Hamada of the Party to Protect the People from NHK, said that Japan currently lacks sufficient information about the strategic plans of other nations, including the United States, regarding Bitcoin reserves. Ishiba noted that discussions in these countries are still in their early stages, which essentially makes it difficult for the government to express a definitive view on adopting such reserves. Hamada had previously suggested that Japan should consider following the example of the US by converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets like Bitcoin. However, the government reiterated its stance that the special account operation, which is tasked with governing foreign exchange reserves, prioritizes ensuring safety and liquidity. Although the Japanese government itself does not directly hold Bitcoin, its Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), which manages over $1.5 trillion in assets and is one of the largest pool of retirement savings in the world, is exploring Bitcoin as part of a broader portfolio diversification plan, Bitcoin Reserves Gaining Momentum President-elect Donald Trump and key Republican lawmakers are advocating a Bitcoin reserve in the country. Several states, such as Ohio , have also rallied behind this concept. Notably, the US already holds significant Bitcoin reserves, totaling 207,189 BTC, which is roughly worth around $20 billion in today’s price. This stash has been primarily acquired through criminal seizures, including from the Silk Road case. Earlier this month, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev proposed creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve while citing Bitcoin’s potential as a stable alternative to volatile traditional currencies. Tkachev’s appeal to the Russian Finance Minister outlined the benefits of cryptocurrencies, especially for countries facing sanctions.

38153419,https://finbold.com/?p=223244,1735243261,Ripple v. SEC end of 2024 case update,"As 2024 winds down, the long-standing legal battle between blockchain company Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is still hanging in the balance. However, there are signs that a resolution might be on the horizon. The case is at a critical point, with key deadlines looming. Specifically, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit set January 15, 2025, as the date for the SEC to submit its opening brief in the Ripple appeal. This filing is pivotal, as it will outline the SEC’s legal arguments. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has entered an Order that the @SECGov ’s brief must be filed on or before January 15, 2025. pic.twitter.com/E3TE5tBDAy — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) November 1, 2024 Meanwhile, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, has clarified that the appeal isn’t about whether XRP is a security. Notably, back in 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP isn’t a security, which was a big win for Ripple and the broader crypto community. “The case is not about whether XRP, in and of itself, is a security. XRP is uniquely situated as having clarity (alongside BTC) in not being classified as a security. The SEC is not challenging that ruling which stands as the law of the land,” he said. Ripple has also filed a Form C for a cross-appeal, but Alderoty pointed out that the review will stick to the current record. From early on in the case, he’s been quite vocal about what he sees as the SEC’s “lawless tactics.” While there is no final verdict, the industry is optimistic about a possible settlement ending the four-year saga. XRP security status After the initial victory in 2023, the likelihood of XRP being reclassified as security has significantly diminished, especially after Judge Torres ordered Ripple to pay a fine of $125 million in August 2024 for violating securities laws, far from the SEC’s $2 billion demand. Importantly, there was no finding of fraud or investor harm. If the case gets stayed, it might push the SEC to drop its appeal, potentially setting a precedent for how XRP’s programmatic sales are viewed in the U.S. digital asset market. At the same time, Ripple has questioned the relevance of the 1946 Howey Test for today’s cryptocurrencies. Some say it’s outdated, while others praise its adaptability, which allows quicker regulatory response without new laws. Ripple has insisted that XRP, like Bitcoin ( BTC ), enjoys a clear legal status in the crypto world and is not classified as a security. Impact of Trump win on Ripple case Adding a twist to the legal drama is Donald Trump’s election victory , and his promise to support crypto might change the outlook for the case. Industry insiders and legal experts are optimistic about how a Trump administration could influence this case. There’s talk that the SEC might rethink its strategy under Trump. In this line, if Paul Atkins, known for his pro-crypto stance, gets the SEC nod, he might push for dismissing the case or at least negotiate a more favorable deal for Ripple. Attorneys like Jeremy Hogan and Fred Rispoli have suggested that new SEC leadership might review ongoing crypto lawsuits, including Ripple’s. Hogan believes that non-fraud crypto cases could be settled. At the same time, Rispoli sees a settlement as likely but not a complete dismissal, predicting new leaders might find the case “idiotic” and settle on easier terms. Notably, Alderoty has urged the upcoming administration to “cleanse the lingering stain of Hinman” from the SEC. The reference to William Hinman, the former SEC director, points to the ongoing criticism of Hinman’s 2018 speech, which has been a contentious point in Ripple’s legal defense. Ripple contends that inconsistencies in the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrency classifications have harmed innovation and market clarity. XRP price analysis At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.15, down over 3% in the last 24 hours and 5.6% on the weekly timeframe. XRP one-week price chart.

38153668,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633584,1735243238,Is Russia planning to replace the US dollar with Bitcoin?,"Bitcoin and BRICS are considered to be helpful for reducing Russian dependence on the US dollar. Russia began international dealings through Bitcoin. Russia trusts digital currencies to make inter-nation trade easier in ways that can protect it from US sanctions and give greater control over global trade with and over the US dollar. Russia has been trying to wean itself off the US dollar, especially due to international sanctions from the United States. This makes it challenging for Russia to do business with other countries because most transactions worldwide are still carried out in the US dollar. Hence, Russia is exploring alternative means of substituting the dollar, one being Bitcoin and other digital currencies to make international payments. Russia seeks other ways around the US dollar to settle trade balances with foreign parties and shun the American banking system, which leaves its hands open for freezing or blocking transactions. It finds such alternatives in Chinese yuan or even Bitcoin – purely electronic money that is highly secured and, hence easy to exchange. In the case of Russia, the BRICS grouping seems to be an arrangement where the country protects itself more than it challenges the US dollar in power. Russia’s economy isn’t strong enough to replace the dollar as the main global currency. Its move is merely symbolic; it shows defiance against the sanctions that have cut it off from global finance. Due to not being able to access the global bank and markets, Russia must opt for other alternatives such as trading in local currencies of allied countries and even using their gold reserves. The entire shift is not to get rid of the dollar altogether, but Russia is trying to be more self-reliant and less vulnerable to further economic pressure. What would this mean for Russia? Switching to Bitcoin, BRICS, or digital currencies would be helpful for Russia’s financial independence, avoiding interference by the US in its trades, and reducing dependency on the US financial system. But there are also some challenges. Not all countries are ready to use Bitcoin, and not all of them trust digital currencies. The security issues of Bitcoin and the value of Bitcoin are also part of the challenges. If Bitcoin or BRICS becomes a major medium of payment, Russia must establish a robust support system and educate businesses and its people on how to use digital currencies safely. And there are also speculations that Russia will launch its Bitcoin Reserve soon since that is one reason. What does it Mean for the US? Russia’s stepping away from the US dollar will be an issue. The dollar is used for a lot of international trade and as a store of value, making the US pretty powerful in matters of economics around the world, such as imposing sanctions. The Russian Ruble (RUB) is weaker compared with the US dollar and it’s not commonly used in international trade. This has allowed the US to have substantial control over global trade. If countries like Russia use Bitcoin for transactions instead of the dollar, it would possibly allow the country to boycott sanctions. Global Impact With more countries, including Russia, embracing Bitcoin, international transactions could become cheaper and faster as it eliminates the need for banks or middlemen. On the other hand, the price of Bitcoin is volatile and might cause economic uncertainty in the future if used as a major currency. Also, since many countries are not regulating Bitcoin entirely, it leaves much room for fraud and security concerns. Although Bitcoin has the potential to reduce reliance on the US dollar, it still has a number of challenges, such as price instability and lack of wide acceptance. Russia is also trying to use Bitcoin in international trade and make digital currencies more accessible. It is unlikely that the US dollar will be replaced by Bitcoin in the near future because Bitcoin is still unstable and not accepted everywhere. While Russia aims to reduce its reliance on the dollar, Bitcoin’s volatility and the lack of infrastructure to support it make it a risky alternative. If more countries follow suit, we could see a gradual shift away from the US dollar, but it remains the dominant global currency for now.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-russia-planning-to-replace-the-us-dollar/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38153668.jpeg

Today, December 27, 2024, the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment appears to be experiencing a price decline, encompassing major assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP. This price decline in major assets has completely shifted market sentiment towards a downtrend. Cardano (ADA) Current Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.864, having experienced a price decline of over 6.9% in the past 24 hours. Amid this price decline, the altcoin has reached a crucial level. If this level fails to hold, the asset could tank by 15%, falling below the $0.75 mark. This bearish price action has infused fear among traders and investors, leading to a decline in trading volume. According to CoinMarketCap data, ADA’s trading volume has dropped by 16% in the past 24 hours. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has recently broken down from a bearish head and shoulders price action pattern. Over the past seven days, it has been consolidating below the pattern’s neckline. Amid the recent price decline, ADA’s price has reached the lower boundary of the consolidation zone and is on the verge of a breakdown. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if the altcoin breaches this level and closes a daily candle below the lower boundary of the zone, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 15%, reaching the $0.77 mark in the future. ADA’s bearish thesis will only hold true if it closes a daily candle below the $0.85 level, which constitutes the lower boundary of the consolidation zone. Otherwise, the bearish scenario may fail to materialize. On-Chain Metrics Reveals Mixed Sentiment Despite this bearish outlook, long-term holders appear optimistic, while traders seem hesitant to establish new positions, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $4.7 million worth of ADA, suggesting potential accumulation and buying pressure.

Ostrovskis noted the growing interest of corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and traditional institutions to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset. “I think that’s going to be a pretty big driver next year as institutions as well as corporates move into Bitcoin,” Ostrovskis said. “You’ll probably see SMEs coming in as well.” This trend has been largely fueled by MicroStrategy, a commercial IT firm that has purchased over $10 billion worth of Bitcoin and plans to purchase another $42 billion, leveraging its equity capital to fund the purchases. Related News: Will Donald Trump Really Make All Bitcoins Made in the US? What Will Be the Outcome? Here's the Truth Ostrovskis cited Bitcoin mining giants Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms as examples of firms issuing convertible bonds to fund Bitcoin purchases. Earlier this week, tech firm Metaplanet announced plans to raise $31.8 million through a bond issue to accelerate Bitcoin purchases. “People talk about the impact of ETFs, and the main driver of that is that now pension funds and sovereign wealth funds can invest cash,” Ostrovskis said. “But there’s another pool of capital in corporates that’s probably a little bit freer and probably moves faster than waiting for pension funds to come in and buy Bitcoin ETFs.” “It’s probably only a matter of time before someone does the same thing and turns themselves into an Ethereum investment vehicle,” he said. “At that point, you become the MicroStrategy of that world.” *This is not investment advice.

Citing new central bank data provided by the office of Democratic Party Rep. Lim Kwang-hyun, Yonhap News Agency reports the number of people who hold crypto in South Korean exchanges exceeded 15.59 million in November, up by 610,000 from 14.98 million in October. The figures, based on the number of investors who have accounts in the five leading domestic exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coin One, Cobit, and Gopax, represent more than 30% of the estimated 51.23 million people who live in the East Asian nation. The report says the number of crypto investors has been on the rise likely as a result of market optimism following the victory of US President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to support the virtual asset industry. The number of domestic crypto investors rose by 14.74 million in July, 14.82 million in August, 4.88 million in September and 14.98 million in October, increasing by around 100,000 per month.

The amount of average daily transactions likewise surged from 2.9 trillion won ($1.972 billion) in July to 14.9 trillion won ($10.132 billion) in November.

38153595,https://thecoinrise.com/russia-moves-to-tighten-security-to-combat-digital-ruble-fraud/,1735241266,Russia Moves To Tighten Security to Combat Digital Ruble Fraud,"The Bank of Russia has recently made a bold move to safeguard its citizens and organizations against digital ruble and currency fraud. The financial institution has announced a new rule that empowers commercial banks to block digital ruble transactions suspected of fraud temporarily. The measure, set to take effect on February 23, 2025, marks a pivotal step in the country’s rollout of its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Russia Applies Swift Action Against Suspicious Transactions Under the new rule, banks can suspend suspicious digital ruble operations for up to 48 hours. If flagged, the bank will notify the account holder and provide a 24-hour window for the customer to confirm or reject the transaction. Without a response, the funds will remain secure in the user’s digital wallet until further clarification. According to the central bank, this system mirrors fraud prevention strategies already employed in traditional payment systems. This move demonstrates Russia’s commitment to ensuring the digital ruble is as secure as its cash and non-cash counterparts. The Road to Digital Ruble Adoption Russia launched its digital ruble pilot program in August 2023, aiming for nationwide use by mid-2025. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has stated that the mass rollout is targeted for July 2025. The adoption process will span several years to ensure smooth integration. The digital ruble is designed to complement, not replace, existing forms of currency. This alleviates concerns among citizens wary of losing cash as a payment option. However, Nabiullina noted that a full transition may take several years. Russia’s approach draws inspiration from China, a forerunner in CBDC adoption. In Changshu, civil servants are already receiving salaries in digital yuan to accelerate usage. Learning from these efforts, Russia plans to fine-tune its digital ruble strategy while tackling its own economic and financial challenges. As digital currencies become more prevalent, ensuring robust security measures is crucial. The Bank of Russia’s latest actions demonstrate a commitment to safeguarding users while embracing financial innovation. The Rise of CBDCs: A Global Phenomenon Central banks worldwide are increasingly embracing CBDCs to modernize financial systems, improve payment efficiency, and strengthen monetary sovereignty. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), over 130 countries are at varying stages of CBDC exploration. Countries like China, Nigeria, and the Bahamas are leading the charge.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-solana-memecoin-will-skyrocket-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 104,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could plummet nearly 27% from its current value if it fails to remain trading above $93,806. The crypto analyst uses the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Realized Price Distribution (URPD) model to determine the key support levels. UTXO keeps track of the number of existing coins that last moved within a given price range. “From an on-chain perspective, a Bitcoin price correction to $70,000 is possible, understanding that below $93,806, it is pretty much open air all the way down to $70,085.” The analyst believes some investors are suddenly preparing for a bearish trend by sending their BTC to exchanges for possible selling. “Some savvy investors appear to be aware of such a bearish scenario, and they have sent over 33,000 Bitcoin to exchanges over the past week, valued at more than $3.23 billion!” Source: Ali Martinez/X He also says other investors are already selling ahead of a possible collapse. “Others are also booking profits. For instance, on December 23rd alone, more than $7.17 billion in Bitcoin profits were realized.” Source: Ali Martinez/X He says bearish sentiment is further evident from a more than 13% decline in the number of traders betting on Bitcoin rallying using the top crypto exchange Binance. “Moreover, the percentage of traders on Binance with open Bitcoin long positions recently dropped from 66.73% to 53.60%.” Source: Ali Martinez/X For the bearish outlook to flip bullish, the analyst says Bitcoin needs to convincingly reclaim $100,000 as support on the daily chart based on the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric. The IOMAP classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even or losing money to determine support and resistance levels. “Bitcoin recently broke below one of its most significant support zones at $97,300. So, for the bearish outlook to be invalidated, BTC must reclaim this critical area of support and, more importantly, sustain a daily close above $100,000!” Source: Ali Martinez/X However, the analyst says a reignited Bitcoin rally could send the flagship crypto asset to $168,500 based on the Mayer Multiple, an oscillator that uses several ratios between price and the 200-day moving average. “If Bitcoin can sustain a daily close above $100,000, we could be looking at a new leg up toward $168,500.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $95,855 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

Smith said there has been a noticeable shift in investor sentiment, saying, “People want to hold more Bitcoin, not less.” He attributed this trend to the growing awareness of Bitcoin as an asset, with both retail investors and institutions exploring its potential as part of their portfolios. Smith noted that while Bitcoin is classified as a commodity and largely immune to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight, the lack of a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges has hindered its wider adoption. “Institutions view Bitcoin as unregulated, and that discourages participation,” he said. Establishing a regulated market structure similar to traditional financial assets could attract more investors, Smith said. He also called for regulatory clarity on token classification and custody, saying exchanges and brokers should have a clear path for registration. According to Smith, this will not only promote market stability but also ensure transparency and trust. Related News: Following Gensler's Resignation and the Trump Administration, the SEC's Cryptocurrency Stance is Projected to Change: What's the Status of the Crypto Lawsuits? Smith noted that the current political climate, which includes a pro-crypto Congress and a supportive administration, presents a unique opportunity. “These moments are rare,” Smith said, urging the crypto industry to seize the moment to push for comprehensive legislation and regulatory frameworks. The Trump administration has tapped Paul Atkins, a known crypto advocate, to lead the SEC, a move that is expected to mark a departure from the stricter regulatory approach of Gary Gensler, who served as SEC chairman during the Biden administration. Smith pointed to the global trend of governments and institutions building up Bitcoin reserves, saying he believes the move reflects growing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. While acknowledging concerns that Bitcoin’s success could challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar, he argued that stablecoins backed by U.S. Treasury bonds are more directly tied to maintaining the strength of the dollar globally. Despite Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, Smith expressed optimism, noting that the asset has become mainstream in a relatively short period of time. He predicts that demand will continue to grow as financial advisors increasingly recommend Bitcoin as part of their retirement portfolios. “Bitcoin has become something that institutions can’t afford to ignore,” Smith said. “It’s a one-way street, and over time, more and more people will see the value in holding Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

38151648,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667261,1735239629,Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over? What This Legendary Metric Says,"Here’s what the historical trend of the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio suggests regarding whether the current bull run is over or not. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Could Hint At Where BTC Is In Current Cycle In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju shared a chart showcasing the past pattern in the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio. The MVRV Ratio refers to a popular on-chain metric that, in short, keeps track of how the value held by the BTC investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the value that they initially put into the asset (the realized cap). Related Reading: XRP Jumps 4%, Whale Reacts With $69 Million Coinbase Deposit When the value of the ratio is greater than 1, it means the investors as a whole can be assumed to be in a state of profit. On the other hand, it is under the mark, implying the dominance of loss in the market. The version of the MVRV Ratio posted by Young Ju isn’t the ordinary one, but rather a modified form called the “True MVRV.” This variation takes into account for only the data of the coins that were involved in some kind of transaction activity during the past seven years. Coins that are older than seven years can be assumed to be lost forever, either due to being forgotten or because of having their wallet keys misplaced. As such, the True MVRV, which excludes these coins that are probable to never return back into circulation, can provide a more accurate picture of the sector than the normal version of the metric. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the history of the cryptocurrency: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin True MVRV has climbed to relatively high levels during this bull run. This implies the average investor is carrying notable profits. Historically, the higher the holder gains get, the more likely they become to participate in a mass selloff with the motive of profit-taking. Thus, whenever the MVRV Ratio rises high, a top can become probable for BTC. From the chart, it’s visible that the tops during the past cycles occurred when the indicator surpassed a specific line. So far, the metric hasn’t come close to retesting this level in the latest epoch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Greed: More Cooldown Needed For Bottom? According to the CryptoQuant founder, the reason the market cap hasn’t overheated relative to the realized cap yet is that there is still $7 billion in capital inflows entering the Bitcoin market every week. If the current cycle is going to show anything similar to the previous ones, then the True MVRV being high, but not extremely high, could potentially suggest room for BTC left in the current bull run.

Why Everyone Is Talking About the Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) Competitor","The crypto market is heating up, and all eyes are on the Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale , offering early adopters the chance to get in at just $0.003 per token. With projections of an incredible 18,985% ROI by 2025, LCAI is positioned to outpace major players like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, LCAI isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a game-changing disruptor. Don’t miss the opportunity to be part of this revolution during the Lightchain AI Presale ! What Makes Lightchain AI Stand Out Among Competitors? While Ripple and Cardano focus on specific niches like cross-border payments and sustainable blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI combines the best of blockchain and artificial intelligence, offering unparalleled utility and scalability. 1. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) At the core of Lightchain AI is its AIVM, which enables developers to deploy AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Ripple and Cardano, LCAI extends blockchain’s capabilities into predictive analytics, natural language processing, and real-world automation, creating value across industries. 2. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Ripple uses consensus to facilitate fast payments, while Cardano employs Proof of Stake (PoS) for eco-friendly blockchain operations. Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI) , a revolutionary mechanism that rewards network participants for performing meaningful AI computations. This innovation ensures LCAI’s blockchain remains productive and energy-efficient. 3. Deflationary Tokenomics Unlike XRP and ADA, Lightchain AI features a deflationary model by burning a portion of transaction fees. This creates scarcity, ensuring long-term value appreciation and making LCAI an attractive option for investors looking for sustainable returns. How LCAI’s Growth Potential Compares to Ripple and Cardano Ripple and Cardano have already achieved significant milestones, but their mature status limits their growth potential compared to early-stage projects like Lightchain AI . Ripple (XRP) Primarily focused on cross-border payments and financial institutions. Current growth potential depends on legal battles and regulatory clarity. Cardano (ADA) Known for its research-driven development and eco-friendly PoS model. Faces stiff competition from other Layer 1 networks like Ethereum and Solana. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Combines blockchain with AI for broad utility across industries. Early-stage project with massive upside potential, projected to rise from $0.003 to $20 by 2025. Why Experts Predict an 18,985% ROI for Lightchain AI 1. Early Adoption Opportunity Presale investments often yield the highest returns, and LCAI’s entry price of $0.003 offers a ground-floor opportunity. Analysts project that as adoption grows, LCAI could reach $20, delivering returns exceeding 18,000%. 2. Market Trends Favoring AI Integration The growing adoption of AI in blockchain applications positions Lightchain AI as a leader in this high-demand sector. Industries like finance, logistics, and healthcare are actively seeking AI solutions, giving LCAI a competitive edge. 3. Institutional and Whale Interest Reports indicate significant whale activity during the presale phase, underscoring the confidence of major players in LCAI’s long-term potential. Why LCAI Could Be a Better Bet Than XRP and ADA Ripple and Cardano have made a name for themself as trustworthy and good projects in the blockchain field but their chance to grow is getting less due to market fully packed and tough rivalry from other well-known cryptocurrencies. Both plans have made strong bases and big groups, but their sk͏ill to bring new change has kind of stopped in the present market view. Lightchain AI, on the other hand enters the stage with a new look and top features; using smart artificial intelligence tech to give special answers. This new method not just solves current problems in the blockchain world, but it also has great charm for both small buyers wanting to grow and big investors searching for space and ease. Lightchain AI—The Crypto to Watch in 2024 and Beyond With its revolutionary technology, early-stage potential, and projected exponential growth, Lightchain AI is undoubtedly a project to watch in the crypto market. As industries increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions and blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, LCAI is poised to be at the forefront of this intersection. Investors looking for high-growth opportunities and a chance to be part of an innovative disruptor should keep a close eye on Lightchain AI’s development and progress. With its unique combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain, LCAI could potentially outpace major players like Ripple and Cardano in terms of both utility and value appreciation. Don’t miss the opportunity to get in on the ground floor with Lightchain AI during the Presale and be a part of this game-changing revolution in the blockchain industry. So, keep an eye on LCAI, and join the movement towards a more intelligent and efficient future with Lightchain AI!

What Will Be the Outcome? Here’s the Truth,"As President Donald Trump accelerates his bid to return to the White House, his promise to ensure all Bitcoin is “made in the USA” has drawn both interest and skepticism from the cryptocurrency industry. This ambitious promise, announced on Truth Social in June following a meeting with crypto mining executives, shows Trump transforming from a crypto skeptic to a staunch industry ally. But experts say this suggestion is far from realistic. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is one of its key features, making it impossible for any one country to dominate its production. “It’s a Trumpian comment, but it’s absolutely not based on reality,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer of Luxor Technology, a Seattle-based firm specializing in crypto mining services. With more than 95% of Bitcoin already mined, the remaining tokens will be minted over the next century via a global network of miners. These miners, who typically operate massive, energy-intensive data centers, compete to verify transactions and earn Bitcoin rewards. But the mining industry is increasingly global, with operators from Russia, China, Africa, and the Middle East vying for a share of the market. The U.S. has emerged as a major hub for bitcoin mining in recent years, driven by rising coin prices and large-scale investments from companies like CleanSpark and Riot. But American miners account for less than 50% of the global computing power needed to keep the bitcoin network afloat, according to industry analysts. Related News: Following Gensler's Resignation and the Trump Administration, the SEC's Cryptocurrency Stance is Projected to Change: What's the Status of the Crypto Lawsuits? Meanwhile, international competition continues to grow. In Eastern Europe, countries like Kazakhstan are seeing a surge in demand for mining infrastructure. China is reportedly seeing renewed activity despite its 2021 crypto mining ban. Africa, with its abundant hydropower, is fast becoming a hub, especially in Ethiopia. Even US-based mining firms like MARA are expanding overseas, including plans for a large-scale facility in Abu Dhabi. Trump’s promise also faces domestic and international hurdles. Rising U.S. energy costs and potential trade conflicts with China could increase miners’ operating expenses. Most of the Bitcoin mining equipment is made by China’s Bitmain, making American miners dependent on foreign supply chains. Additionally, Trump’s campaign rhetoric could inadvertently impact miners who offer hosting services, where customers from around the world rent capacity in U.S. facilities to mine Bitcoin. Despite the obstacles, many in the industry see Trump’s support as a net positive. His pro-energy stance and criticism of the Biden administration’s environmental regulations have won him favor among U.S. miners. During the last campaign, the crypto industry contributed $135 million to Trump’s fundraising efforts, the most of any industry. *This is not investment advice.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

Like a true champ, this first-ever all-sports meme token has fought its way through the bear market with fearless momentum and shows no signs of slowing down. With eyes set on a roaring 9,900% growth, XYZ is destined to leave the 2024 meme coin triumphants like BOME and WIF trailing in its wake. Own the field, earn while the crowd plays XYZ is more than just a benchwarmer in the meme coin game; it’s creating the ultimate playing field with XYZVerse, where the thrill of sports meets the energy of meme culture. With a roadmap equipped with entertainment dApps, prediction markets, and sports betting options, XYZ is poised to draw in millions of gamblers ready to join the action. Remember Polymarket’s massive $1 billion trading volume during the US election betting fever? XYZ is gearing up for an even bigger win in the GameFi arena, letting its stakeholders cash in on the perfect combo of meme coin vibes, sports hype, and crypto mass adoption. Missed meme coin supercycle? By capitalizing on the ever-expanding gambling niche, XYZ is set to become the G.O.A.T of meme coins. BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally are now relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 9,900% from its current price by the TGE and outshine its sensational predecessors. Get in the game early to secure your spot – currently undervalued, XYZ is going the distance to break new records! Rallying the community, securing the win XYZVerse will be the MVP in this bull run, giving the community the control to call the plays and steer the ecosystem’s direction.

With rock-solid tokenomics and plans for both CEX/DEX listings, XYZ is positioned for a championship run, ensuring a steady revenue flow and consistent token burns to keep the scoreboard in favor of a strong price and a thriving community. >>The XYZ presale is live – don’t miss out on this knockout 9,900% opportunity! Sei (SEI) Sei is making waves as the first blockchain designed specifically for trading. By focusing on this sector, Sei aims to give exchanges an edge over competitors. Its platform is built to handle a massive number of orders each second, with transactions finalizing in just 380 milliseconds. This speed is a game-changer for traders who need quick and reliable execution. Looking ahead, some projections suggest Sei could grow by 323.76% by 2030 if it reaches its upper price targets. Its commitment to security and backing by large institutions add to its appeal. In the current market, where speed and security are paramount, Sei stands out among cryptocurrencies. Compared to other coins, Sei’s specialized approach could offer unique advantages in a competitive space. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain that blends security with the openness of decentralized networks. Built for institutions and developers, it meets real-world regulatory requirements. This means it’s ready for applications that need to follow laws but still want blockchain benefits. MANTRA uses the Cosmos SDK, making it compatible with other blockchains. Supporting up to 10,000 transactions per second, it’s fast and scalable. With tools to create and manage compliant real-world assets, it aims to make blockchain more accessible. In the current market, MANTRA’s OM coin stands out by focusing on compliance and user experience. While many blockchains struggle with regulations, MANTRA embraces them. This could attract institutions wary of legal issues. Compared to other coins, OM offers a unique mix of security and openness. With the trend towards regulatory compliance in crypto, MANTRA could be ahead of the curve. Its technology and focus might make OM attractive for investors seeking innovative and compliant blockchain solutions. Ethena (ENA) Ethena is introducing ENA, a synthetic dollar built on Ethereum. Unlike other digital dollars tied to traditional banks, ENA offers a crypto-native solution. It’s designed to be a stable form of money that doesn’t rely on the regular banking system. Ethena also brings the ‘Internet Bond’, a savings instrument that’s accessible worldwide and denominated in dollars. This means anyone, anywhere, can save and earn with a stable, digital asset. In the current crypto market, stability and accessibility are crucial. ENA stands out by providing a stablecoin that isn’t dependent on banks, which can be a big advantage. As trust in traditional financial systems wavers, a crypto dollar like ENA could gain popularity. The Internet Bond adds an appealing way to save and earn interest, similar to holding a bond but in the crypto world. Compared to other coins that may be volatile, ENA offers stability and the potential for steady growth. For investors looking for a reliable option in the crypto space, ENA might be an attractive choice. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is making waves in the crypto world by connecting different blockchains. Imagine sending value and data between Bitcoin and Ethereum without any middlemen. That’s what Polkadot does. It uses a technology called parachains to make transactions faster and more scalable. This means it can handle more transactions per second than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token lets holders play a role in the network’s development and verify transactions. Created by Gavin Wood, one of Ethereum’s founders, Polkadot promises a future where blockchains work together more efficiently. In today’s market, Polkadot stands out with its focus on interoperability. While many cryptocurrencies build their own ecosystems, Polkadot aims to connect them all. This could be a game-changer as the crypto space grows and the need for cross-chain communication increases. Compared to other coins, DOT offers a governance model that gives holders a say in the network’s future. With market trends pointing toward more decentralization and scalability, Polkadot’s technology puts it in a strong position. As the demand for interconnected and efficient blockchains rises, Polkadot looks poised to play a significant role in the next phase of crypto development. Conclusion SEI, OM, ENA, and DOT are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth with a strong community and roadmap.

In 2024, meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. With potential thousand-fold returns that will blow past the finish line, the presale plan draws a hefty 9,900% growth by the TGE. Forget about BOME’s 5,000% rise or WIF’s 1,000% rally – XYZ is here to outscore them all!

The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! Cardano (ADA) Cardano, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency world, offers a fresh approach to blockchain technology. Designed for smart contracts, its platform enables the creation of decentralized finance apps, tokens, and games. What sets Cardano apart is its native cryptocurrency, ADA, which rivals Ethereum’s ETH in functionality. Users can store value, make payments, and even stake ADA on the Cardano network. Uniquely, Cardano emphasizes environmental sustainability by using the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, an energy-efficient alternative to the traditional proof-of-work model. In addition to its green credentials, Cardano’s innovative structure divides its blockchain into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computing Layer manages smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially reaching up to a million per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, ADA’s combination of sustainability, scalability, and efficiency positions it as a noteworthy contender. While other coins like Ethereum are transitioning to proof-of-stake to address similar issues, Cardano’s head start in these areas makes it a coin to watch in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is a cryptocurrency that connects different blockchains. It lets value and data be shared between blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum without middlemen. This helps cryptocurrencies work together more easily. Polkadot uses “parachains” to make transactions faster and handle more at once. It can process more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token, DOT, runs the network. DOT holders can help decide how Polkadot works and earn rewards by staking. Polkadot was created by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched in May 2020. Polkadot has great potential in the crypto world. Its ability to link blockchains can make the whole system more efficient. As cryptocurrencies grow, networks that handle more transactions quickly are needed. Polkadot’s technology meets this need. In the current market, DOT may be attractive for those into innovative projects. Compared to other coins, Polkadot offers unique features that could make it stand out. With the crypto market always changing, coins that solve real problems, like Polkadot, might shine. Conclusion Despite the strengths of ADA and DOT, XYZVerse emerges as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, uniting fans in a community-driven ecosystem during the 2024 bull run.

Both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins have dropped significantly in the past few weeks, but things could change as 2025 approaches. The long term crypto and stock investor who goes by Jelle believes the next year will be “great for altcoins.” On that note, he highlighted TradingView ’s Crypto Total Market Cap Index (TOTAL) entering “price discovery,” displaying high optimism on cryptocurrencies. At the same time, Jelle compared TOTAL’s performance with the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), which “looks ready to move lower.” Indeed, the chart shows TOTAL retesting and old resistance as support at around $3.24 trillion. Meanwhile, BTC.D is seen failing to recover an uptrend, bouncing from the trend line’s resistance, making a lower high. Crypto Total Market Cap (TOTAL) & Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) weekly chart.

The pseudonym account Mister Crypto sent a “warning” to “altcoin holders,” saying “we are about to get super rich.” Backing his optimism, Mister Crypto shared a two-week BTC.D chart also failing to retrieve an uptrend line. Interestingly, the analyst projects the Bitcoin Dominance to fall to a support zone between 38% and 41%. This level was last seen between 2021 and 2023, with altcoins highly outperforming BTC.

38150836,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322863,1735236596,FTX Executive Ryan Salame Gets One-Year Sentence Reduction,"Ryan Salame, a former executive of the now-defunct FTX cryptocurrency exchange, had one year shaved off his prison sentence, as first reported by Business Insider on Thursday. Former FTX executive Ryan Salame has prison release date moved up by more than a year https://t.co/DFnOwxarD1 — Business Insider (@BusinessInsider) December 26, 2024 Initially sentenced to over seven years for his role in FTX’s collapse, Salame is now set to serve just over six and a half years, as confirmed by Federal Bureau of Prisons records . The adjustment comes after Salame reported to prison in Cumberland, Maryland, this past October. Ryan Salame’s Prison Time Adjusted for Good Behavior Federal policies allow inmates to earn sentence reductions through demonstrated good behavior while incarcerated. Salame appears to have benefited from these provisions, leading to the updated sentence length. As the former CEO of FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamian subsidiary of FTX, Salame pleaded guilty in September 2023 to charges of making unlawful political contributions and operating an unlicensed money transmission business. However, controversy arose earlier this year when Salame attempted to withdraw his guilty plea. He alleged that federal prosecutors had promised not to charge his partner, former Congressional candidate Michelle Bond, if he cooperated with the U.S. government. This claim raised concerns of perjury with Judge Lewis A. Kaplan , who presided over the case. Salame’s Legal Battle: Guilty Plea and Controversy Over Michelle Bond Salame last made headlines when he appeared in an interview with Tucker Carlson before reporting to prison. Ryan Salame was the only executive at FTX who wasn’t a partisan Democrat. You can imagine what Biden’s prosecutors did to him.

(38:49) How Salame Met SBF (42:24) What… pic.twitter.com/0s5g72lzFS — Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) October 9, 2024 During the interview , Salame criticized the justice system, alleging that leniency is granted to those who conform to a desired narrative while harsher penalties are reserved for others. “The government offers leniency to those who support their narrative, leaving others too intimidated to speak out,” Salame told Carlson. He also pointed to the relatively light two-year sentence of Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda Research CEO, despite her central role in FTX’s fraudulent operations. Former FTX Executives Face Sentencing Amid Bankman-Fried’s Conviction Salame has repeatedly taken to X to express his grievances over the judicial process following FTX’s detrimental collapse in November 2022. “People lied in SBF’s trial. That doesn’t mean he’s innocent, but it’s truly problematic,” Salame wrote, adding, “You aren’t aware how corrupt the legislative process is (more to come).” The fallout from FTX’s collapse in November 2022 has led to varying sentences for its top executives. Alongside Salame, FTX’s former head of engineering Nishad Singh and chief technical officer Gary Wang were sentenced to time served, effectively avoiding further prison time. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried faces a 25-year sentence for orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in cryptocurrency history.

It is worth noting that the coin is currently trading at $95,358.04, following a 3.08% dip. El Salvador’s latest buy has boosted its reserves to 5,997.77 BTC, now valued at $595 million. 🇸🇻🎁EL SALVADOR STACKED SOME BITCOIN ON CHRISTMAS DAY!! Like a boss, El Salvador continued adding one BTC per day to our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. And we are still so early … … wait until you see what we have in store for 2025! 👀🚀 pic.twitter.com/lrZIDVRWdi — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) December 25, 2024 “Like a boss, El Salvador continued adding one BTC per day to our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” the Bitcoin Office wrote on X. “And we are still so early … wait until you see what we have in store for 2025!” El Salvador Goes Against IMF on Bitcoin Adoption A few days ago, Stacy Herbert, the director of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, went on X to clarify that the firm’s BTC purchases would proceed at “an accelerated pace.” Not long after, El Salvador purchased 12 BTC and 1 BTC the day after. The next day, they grabbed another 12 and have since consistently purchased 1 BTC daily. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) still exerts pressure on the country, asking it to reduce its exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency. Interestingly, El Salvador recently signed a strategic deal with the agency and is expected to scale back on its Bitcoin adoption . Instead, it purchased $1 million worth of Bitcoin just a day after finalizing a $1.4 billion deal with the IMF. US And UK Have Large BTC Stash From Seizures Apart from El Salvador, Bhutan has also strategically held a Bitcoin reserve, mining the coin since as far back as 2019. As it stands, its BTC reserve contributes up to one-third of its GDP. Bhutan holds as much as 11,688 BTC in its Bitcoin reserve. This entire holding is valued at $1.16 billion. This stash is still quite small compared to regions like the US and the UK. However, these other countries got their Bitcoin from mostly criminal seizures and confiscation. The US government secured up to 198,109 BTC, worth a staggering $19.68 billion . Similarly, the U.K. has as much as 61,245 BTC, all forfeiture from criminal cases. This holding amounts to just over $6 billion as of Dec. 25.

PEPE: The Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Aiming to emulate the success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE sets itself apart by eliminating transaction taxes and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. It reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts. The project’s roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, contributing to its stability. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum’s security. In the current market cycle, PEPE’s unique features may appeal to those interested in memecoins. Floki: A Meme Coin Evolving into a Utility-Focused Cryptocurrency Floki is a cryptocurrency that originated from Elon Musk’s 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu puppy Floki. Though it started as a meme coin, Floki has expanded its ecosystem to include utility and charitable initiatives. The project has engaged in building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Floki offers projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and a decentralized finance service called FlokiFi. Its partnership with NOWPayments and introduction of the Floki Card enable real-world use of the token. Recognized by The Economic Times as a top meme coin to buy in 2023, Floki appears to have potential in the current market due to its growing ecosystem and practical applications. BONK: Solana’s Community-Driven Memecoin with Rapid Growth BONK is a memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by moving power away from venture capital tokens. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK surged over 100%. It acts as a community coin, having airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap and saw a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatility of memecoins, BONK’s integration into the growing Solana ecosystem and its involvement with new decentralized apps, like BonkSwap, make it a notable coin. Its potential in the current market cycle seems significant. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run unfolds, coins like PEPE, FLOKI, and BONK show less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale end with possible thousand-fold returns, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

38150586,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53214,1735236236,Ripple’s Masterplan That Could Change XRP Holders’ Lives,"A recent tweet from Britto, a community dedicated to Arthur Britto, the enigmatic co-founder of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has drawn significant attention. Titled “Ripple’s 2024 Masterplan: The Blueprint That Could Change Your Life,” the thread delves into Ripple’s ambitious strategies for transforming global finance, supported by evidence from Ripple’s job postings and initiatives. Here, we analyze the key takeaways from this compelling roadmap. Accelerating Bank Adoption of XRP Ripple’s primary focus in 2024 appears to be fostering deeper collaboration with major global banks. Job postings explicitly target large financial institutions, with roles emphasizing the integration of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Ripple positions XRP as a bridge asset, enabling instant liquidity for global payments. This strategy addresses long-standing inefficiencies in banking operations. By reducing the need for pre-funded Nostro/Vostro accounts, XRP unlocks $27 trillion trapped in dormant capital worldwide, offering significant cost savings for banks and financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 RLUSD and Stablecoin Synergy Ripple is also expanding its stablecoin infrastructure, introducing RLUSD —a U.S. dollar-backed digital asset designed to complement XRP’s functionality. RLUSD ensures transaction stability, while XRP provides the liquidity for global transfers. Every RLUSD transaction burns a small amount of XRP, reducing its supply over time. This interplay between RLUSD and XRP creates a synergistic ecosystem, where both assets drive adoption and utility. Ripple’s vision extends beyond RLUSD, with mentions of RLJPY and RLGBP, hinting at plans for a global network of stablecoins tailored to various currencies. Institutional-Grade Custody Solutions To facilitate widespread adoption, Ripple has prioritized secure custody solutions. Following its acquisition of Metaco , Ripple aims to provide banks with institutional-grade infrastructure to store XRP and other digital assets. Job postings underscore the emphasis on security, scalability, and bank-grade reliability. This strategic move addresses a critical barrier to entry for banks, ensuring they have the tools to integrate and store XRP at scale. Focus on Asia-Pacific (APAC) Ripple’s job postings reveal a concentrated effort to expand its presence in APAC, particularly in regions like Singapore, Japan, and Thailand. These countries boast clear regulatory frameworks, making them ideal markets for blockchain adoption. As APAC banks integrate Ripple’s technologies, the resulting demand for XRP liquidity could significantly influence its value. Ripple’s Comprehensive Financial Toolkit Ripple’s strategy extends beyond individual products, aiming to create a unified financial stack for institutions. This includes cross-border payment solutions, custody infrastructure, stablecoin settlement systems, and XRP liquidity provisioning. Every component in this stack reinforces XRP’s utility. Addressing the $27 Trillion Problem Nostro/Vostro accounts, a relic of traditional banking, lock up trillions of dollars globally. Ripple’s solutions, leveraging XRP, eliminate the need for pre-funded accounts. This enables near-instant settlements, freeing up capital for banks and reducing operational costs. Retail Growth and XRPL Memecoins The tweet contrasts XRPL’s underwhelming memecoin trading volume with Solana’s dominance in the retail space. Despite this disparity, Britto argues that XRPL’s institutional foundation gives it an edge. The ecosystem will see explosive growth once retail attention shifts to XRPL, boosted by rising XRP prices. Memecoins play a key role in driving liquidity and user engagement. As retail interest grows, XRPL could see billions in trading volume, drawing attention to its utility-driven ecosystem. Ripple’s 2024 plan, as outlined in Britto’s thread, portrays the company’s ambitions. From addressing inefficiencies in global finance to building a robust infrastructure for banks and institutions, Ripple’s initiatives position XRP as a critical asset in the evolving financial landscape.

38149930,https://crypto.news/?p=14322216,1735236000,"Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania to create the state-level Bitcoin reserves. What are these bills?","Three of the 50 states of America are expected to create local Bitcoin reserves soon. The bills differ from the proposal of the American National Bitcoin Reserve and demonstrate local specifics. America is bullish on Bitcoin. Allegedly , each fifth American owns some BTC. While the U.S. President is pushing to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the states are working on local reserves. The Ohio and Texas proposals to create such reserves are about to pass; Pennsylvania is following their way, while other states are doing their considerations. Table of Contents What are the specs of the local proposals compared to the federal bill? The Cynthia Lummis bill The local bills Will these bills pass? What are the specs of the local proposals compared to the federal bill? The main distinction is that the local proposals have different end goals if compared to the federal-level proposal. The federal bill is aimed to cover the national debt and calls for purchasing one million BTC that should be stored in the U.S. Treasury. The Texas bill is aimed at accumulating bitcoins by collecting taxes and donations in cryptocurrency. More than that, Texas has a minimum five-year embargo on selling state bitcoins. Ohio and Pennsylvania are willing to accumulate some BTC as a hedge against the eroding USD value. Bitcoins must be bought by the local treasuries. The bills don’t elaborate precisely on the terms. The Cynthia Lummis bill The Federal Reserve bill was introduced in July 2024 by Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis. Her proposal is called Boosting Innovation, Technology and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act. The Lummis bill is expressly presented as a means to pay down the U.S. national debt. Apart from national debt, Lummis mentions soaring inflation rates in the introduction and calls the creation of the reserve a Louisiana Purchase moment. Comparing huge-scale Bitcoin purchases with buying American lands in the past became a popular trope among Bitcoin maximalists. According to the Lummis proposal, Bitcoin is seen as an additional store of value in the federal balance sheet. The bill suggests that the government must establish a U.S. Treasury-controlled decentralized network of Bitcoin vaults. On top of that, the government must purchase one million BTC, which is around 5% of the total supply. The amount is dictated by the fact that the U.S. is already holding 5% of all gold. Private Bitcoin holders should be given self-custody rights. The local bills The local bills of Texas and Ohio don’t include direct intentions to purchase a specified amount of BTC in a certain period, nor are they intended to eliminate the state debts. https://twitter.com/Vivek4real_/status/1867257579262685747 The Texas bill was introduced by Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione on Dec. 12. The bill suggests that local residents will be able to use cryptocurrency to pay their taxes. On top of that, Texans will be able to donate cryptocurrency to the state. All the crypto is going to be exchanged for Bitcoin. Donations, taxes, and other payments to the state agencies will be the main avenues for Texas to accumulate bitcoins. The accumulated BTC are supposed to be stored offline untouched for at least five years. Just like Lummis, Capriglione mentioned inflation as one of the biggest enemies while speaking about the need for the Bitcoin reserve. Texas has been an attractive place for Bitcoin miners due to low electricity costs and various incentives. Read more: Crypto taxes: What does regulation look like around the world? During the CNBC interview released on Dec. 24, Centrifuge general counsel Eli Cohen noted that the implementation may turn out to be challenging. He points out that the tax authorities may find it tricky to collect taxes in BTC and identify taxpayers. If the tax authorities demand taxpayers to provide their BTC wallets, the taxpayers may feel reluctant to obey. https://twitter.com/DerekMerrin/status/1869134602390122545 On Dec. 17, the rep. Derek Merrin introduced the Ohio bill known as the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act. The act suggests that the Ohio treasury will set up the Bitcoin fund and will be able to invest money in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against USD devaluation. In contrast to the Lummis proposal, the bill has no mention of specific Bitcoin purchases or allocations. In 2022, Ohio had a $72.16 billion debt. It is possible that the BTC reserve could facilitate debt redemption. The bill will be worked upon further by legislators in 2025. Read more: Ohio introduces second Bitcoin reserve bill The Pennsylvania bill was introduced back in November. Its prime suggestion is that the state will be able to invest up to 10% of the State General Fund in Bitcoin in order to fight inflation. This means that nearly one billion dollars can be spent on bitcoins. Will these bills pass? The bills mentioned above were introduced. There is no guarantee that they will pass. On average , only 20% of the introduced state-level bills become laws. In Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, this number is even lower. According to the New Healthcare Bill Acts, only 4.5% of the bills introduced to the 115th Congress became law. So, statistically, the odds are not that high. Practically, it depends on multiple factors, not least of all the persistence of the lobbyists. Cohen believes that Lummis is a strong Bitcoin advocate with decent experience, and her bill has a good chance. However, the Lummis Act can fail in Congress. It receives some criticism even within the crypto community. For instance, a passionate crypto writer Nic Carter, warns that while the Bitcoin stockpile (as a store of seized bitcoins) can be beneficial, the strategic Bitcoin reserve (as a reserve of the bitcoins acquired by the government) will not bolster the dollar price (like it is supposed by the strategic Bitcoin reserve advocates) but will do the opposite. The reason is clear: giving Bitcoin a monetary role in the country that issues dollars is signalling the move away from an inconvertible fiat standard, i.e., questioning the dollar’s value, hence risking the role of the U.S. in the global economy. We can’t state, however, that Carter’s concerns are the current mainstream. Quite the opposite. If the strategic Bitcoin reserve is not created while the state-level reserves are successfully set, they may get a leading role in the exploration of the governmental accumulation and storage of Bitcoin and turn into international cryptocurrency hubs. If all the bills fail, new ones will follow.

38150691,https://blockworks.co/news/predicting-tops-of-crypto-cycles,1735236000,The art of predicting the top of a crypto cycle,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Predicting the top of a crypto market cycle is as much an art as it is a science. There’s your Uber driver inquiring about the latest dog coin, a noticeable increase in dodgy celebrity crypto projects, or that cousin you see once a year at Thanksgiving sliding into your DMs for crypto advice. Here are five tools crypto investors turn to when they dust off the crystal ball every four years. It goes without saying that none of this historical data is a definite guarantee for the future. Bitcoin halving Any discussion about crypto cycles is not complete without reference to the quadrennial Bitcoin halving event. Every approximate four years, the Bitcoin network halves its reward emissions. The latest halving saw network emissions halved from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. The halving is the centerpiece of crypto cycles because it has come to be a signal for the beginning of greed and speculation in crypto markets. Importantly, each cycle has tended to peak around 12-18 months after the halving: We are eight months into the latest halving in April 2024, and if history is a reliable indicator, the 2024 cycle still has ways to go. Google search for ‘bitcoin’ Hardly a week goes by in the crypto bull market without this chart surfacing on Twitter. It’s a brain-dead simple indicator: Retail wants to keep up to date, and bitcoin is the go-to Google keyword for doing so. Source: GoogleTrends The last peak in bitcoin search interest was in mid-May 2021, about six months before the price of bitcoin actually did top out. Pi Cycle Top indicator The Pi Cycle Top is a quantitative measure of bitcoin’s price on two moving averages: 111-day and 350-day (multiplied by two). Subscribers to the Pi Cycle Top indicator believe the cycle top is in when the former crosses the latter. This has happened with fair accuracy in past bull cycles in 2013, 2017 and 2021. Source: CryptoCon The indicator rests on a key premise: The end of a bull market is near when everyone and their mom is thinking of getting their hands on the orange coin. This market euphoria drives prices to unsustainable levels above “normal” growth trends, which causes bitcoin prices in the short term to significantly deviate from the long term. App Store rankings Premise: First-timers are using Coinbase rather than Uniswap to ape into cryptocurrencies. Implication: When Coinbase ranks highly on App Store rankings, the top of the cycle is near. Simple enough? It’s a nifty qualitative measure of crypto sentiment, and there are whole Telegram groups dedicated to just tracking it. In the last week, Coinbase has ranged from 66th to 135th. With Solana in the limelight again, a popular derivative of this measure has been the Phantom Wallet ranking. The prevailing idea is similar: Retail loves Solana memecoins, so they’re all downloading Phantom on their phones to trade them. The big assumption with this measure is that crypto investing is still largely untouched by the mainstream, and with every cycle comes a new wave of retail investors that have never installed centralized exchange apps. If crypto is already “mainstream,” this measure loses its relevance. ETH:BTC ratio Ah, the revered ETH:BTC ratio that podcasters and investors cannot help constantly obsessing over. Here’s the idea: Investors buy bitcoin in the early innings of the crypto cycle. Unsatisfied with profits from the orange coin, they soon “rotate” into riskier altcoins, which spikes the ETH:BTC ratio. Source: TradingView With ETH’s sentiment currently in the gutter , ETH:BTC has become a measure of questionable value this cycle. ETH:BTC is currently at a depressing low of 0.034. For context, ETH:BTC peaked at 0.075 in 2022, and 0.0109 in 2018. If history repeats itself, expect markets to crash when ETH:BTC nears its tops.

Analytics Company Answers by Custom Metric,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal recently published an in-depth evaluation of Bitcoin, focusing on the Realized Capitalization metric. The firm noted that Bitcoin’s Realized Capitalization has reached the same resistance levels previously observed in 2019 and March 2024. In his statement, Alphractal highlighted the Long-Term Realized Capital Impulse (LTRCI), a metric designed to analyze movements in capitalization over long periods. This approach provides valuable information on supply and demand dynamics, providing a more comprehensive perspective on market trends. By focusing on longer time frames, LTRCI aims to uncover patterns that may not be noticed in short-term analysis and shed light on the impact of significant capital flows on price movements. Related News: Following Gensler's Resignation and the Trump Administration, the SEC's Cryptocurrency Stance is Projected to Change: What's the Status of the Crypto Lawsuits? “Long-Term Realized Capital Impulse offers an innovative approach to analyze demand from an on-chain perspective,” the company said. Alphractal also took a look at Realized Capital Impulse, which focuses on shorter-term swings in the market. According to the firm, this metric suggests that market enthusiasm has not yet fully materialized. This could indicate that Bitcoin has experienced significant movements over the past year or that there is still potential for growth. The firm added a cautionary note: “A decrease in this metric could negatively impact the price, while an increase indicates a more positive and volatile market outlook.” *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin stands out among top crypto tokens with 125% year-to-date gains, and the meme coin category, or the “other tokens”, hit a key milestone, crossing a market capitalization of $100 billion. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) and Pepe ( PEPE ), the top three meme coins, have erased between 11% and 13% of their value in the past week. Bitcoin consolidates close to $95,000, nearly 12% below its all-time high of $108,353.

Bitcoin and meme coin divide runs deep Bitcoin vs meme coins, most popular narrative of 2024 Meme coins captured the attention of most crypto traders and emerged as a popular narrative this year. A CoinGecko report updated on Monday notes that the meme coin narrative captured a combined 30.67% of global investor interest. Meme trends and meme tokens rank among leading crypto narratives | Source: CoinGecko The report highlights that almost a third of crypto narrative interest this year was focused on speculative gains from meme coins. Traders placed a lower emphasis on fundamentals and turned their attention and capital towards dog and cat-related meme coins, pop culture references and internet personality-themed meme tokens. Meme coins have enjoyed a 6% year-on-year increase in interest from crypto market participants. While Bitcoin garnered institutional attention and capital allocation following the approval of Spot BTC ETFs in the US, four meme coin-based trends ranked among the top 20 narratives in crypto. Solana ( SOL ), Base, Artificial intelligence and cat-themed meme coins garnered between 14% and 8% of interest among crypto narratives. With meme coins cementing their place as a trending token category and trending this cycle, catalysts like institutional allocation and ETF approval could pave the way for further gains for holders.

Similarly, Solana and Base-based meme coins have secured a rank in the top 20 cryptocurrency narratives of the year, dominating the popularity of blue-chip meme coins. Dogecoin, SHIB and PEPE are typically considered blue-chip memes, with a market capitalization between $7 and $46 billion, as seen on CoinGecko. The top 3 tokens in the meme coin category observed a spike in active addresses and activity from traders within the first two weeks of December. Meme coins within top 100 | Source: CoinGecko In the last seven days, the top 3 tokens have erased double-digit value, according to CoinGecko data. Several other meme tokens have accumulated double-digit losses, barring Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). Institutional meme coin holdings tripled this year The wave of meme coin adoption drove institutions to tripe their holdings in the category. From February to March 2024, institutional investors’ spot holdings of memecoins climbed from $62.5 million to $204.8 million. This marks a 226% surge, a significant spike in interest in the memecoin market, according to Bybit’s report on institutional investment in meme coins. In the Bybit report, Eugene Cheung, Head of Institutions of Bybit, is quoted as saying: “Our report ‘Beyond the Hype’ shows that institutional and retail investors are actively leveraging the opportunities presented by the memecoin market. The strategic agility of institutions and the dynamic management by retail investors reflect a sophisticated engagement with these assets. We invite everyone to delve into the full report to understand these important dynamics better.” Dogecoin ETF likely in 2025? Rising institutional adoption has raised questions about the likelihood of approval from the U.S. financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, for meme coin ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of ETFStore expressed shock that an issuer has yet to file for a Dogecoin ETF, both in and outside of the U.S. Geraci believes the only possible downside of such a filing would be that it would mark a futile attempt and end up as a marketing expense for an issuer. The President of the ETFStore commented on the “DOGE” ticker since it is the ticker for the largest meme coin and would likely hold the highest relevance and demand among issuers in the future, Shocked an ETF issuer hasn't filed for Dogecoin ETF yet… What's the downside? Worst case, it's a marketing expense. Wonder which issuer is sitting on the ""DOGE"" ticker. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 23, 2024 As the SEC greenlights the Bitcoin-Ethereum hybrid ETF, DOGE traders have hopes for a Dogecoin ETF approval in 2025.

However, a potential utility could develop in the future.” Lienkha comments on what divides Dogecoin and similar meme coins from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has gained acceptance as “digital gold” and hedge against the devaluation of a fiat currency, Dogecoin and the like are considered speculative tokens. The Bitcoin and meme coin divide runs deep and could influence the approval of a meme coin ETF, further investment from institutional investors and retail participation in the category in the second leg of the bull market. Typically, a drawdown in Bitcoin ushers a steeper and market-wide correction, wiping recent gains from meme coins and hitting the market capitalization of the category negatively.

But is this a serious forecast or just another attempt to stir excitement in the crypto world? The Bold Prediction: Bitcoin to Reach $180K by March 21, 2025 In an interview with Scott Melker, Mike Alfred, a well-known figure in the crypto space and a former CEO, is making waves with his recent prediction that Bitcoin will hit $180,000 by mid-March 2025. According to Alfred, the first quarter of 2025 will be crucial for the cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin potentially making gains as we approach the Bitcoin halving event. “I think Q1 should be quite good,” Alfred said. “The next two to three months are key to this four-year cycle.” What’s Driving the Optimism? Alfred points to a number of factors driving the bullish sentiment for Bitcoin, including the upcoming Bitcoin halving and institutional investment. “This is the year before the big year,” Alfred explained, suggesting that 2025 will be the year when the full potential of the current cycle plays out. He believes that the first few months of 2025 will see explosive price increases, with Bitcoin potentially reaching $120,000 to $150,000 before March. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin and Crypto in 2025 Looking ahead to 2025, both Alfred and Melker agree that the upcoming year will be pivotal for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. While Alfred’s prediction of Bitcoin reaching $180,000 by March is aggressive, the current market conditions and upcoming halving event make it seem more plausible than ever. As 2025 approaches, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s performance in the first quarter. Will the crypto market rally as expected, or will we see another disappointing dip?

Over $3 billion BTC moves to exchanges in a week,"As Bitcoin ( BTC ) faces heightened volatility below the $100,000 resistance zone, on-chain data suggests the digital currency may face further declines in the coming days. Specifically, over 33,000 BTC valued at more than $3.23 billion has been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges in the past week, according to data from prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez on December 27. Bitcoin exchange reserves chart. Source: CryptoQuant/Ali_charts A breakdown of the data shows a sharp uptick in Bitcoin exchange reserves, rising from 2.395 million BTC on December 18 to 2.428 million BTC by December 25. This movement coincided with a decline in Bitcoin’s price, which dropped from $105,000 to $98,400 over the same period. Notably, the rapid increase in exchange reserves could indicate that large holders, or whales, are preparing to liquidate their assets. Historically, such trends have been precursors to significant price corrections, as selling pressure outweighs buying demand. Bitcoin’s bearish outlook In a series of X posts, Martinez doubled down on the possibility of Bitcoin dipping further, noting the asset might plunge to as low as $60,000. He highlighted that the possibility of a drop is validated by Bitcoin breaking below its critical support zone at $97,300. According to data shared by Martinez, this level served as a stronghold for Bitcoin, with 1.51 million wallets purchasing approximately 1.49 million BTC in this range. Bitcoin In/Out of the money around price chart. Source: IntoTheBlock For the bearish scenario to be invalidated, the expert noted that Bitcoin must reclaim the $97,300 level and, more importantly, achieve a close above $100,000. A sustained breakout above this level could pave the way for a significant rally, potentially targeting $168,500. Similarly, financial educator Tony Vays warned that Bitcoin trading below $95,000 is “very bad” as it accelerates the probability of a correction to around the $73,000 zone. According to the analyst, dropping below $95,000 opens the door for the asset to slide to the $92,000 range, which “opens Pandora’s box” for a massive crash.

Notably, analysts believe the asset will likely hit new highs, aligning with post-election optimism that helped Bitcoin reach a record high of approximately $108,000. Looking ahead to the new year, there is anticipation that Donald Trump’s policies could propel Bitcoin to new heights, potentially doubling its value. For instance, banking giant Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin could trade at a new high of $200,000 in 2025, driven mainly by institutional interest.

While sellers threatened continued dips, MOON DENG, PENGU, and Ripple’s XRP had optimistic updates for their communities. Let us find out more. MOODENG explodes in gloomy markets Digital assets traded in red today as the global cryptocurrency market cap plummeted 3.10% in the past 24 hours to $3.33 trillion. While altcoins appeared to suffer the most, with Ethereum, Solana, and DOGE losing up to 7% on their daily charts, MOODENG exploded to record peaks. The hippo-themed digital coin traded at $0.0002088 after brief dips from its daily peak. Chart by Coinmarketcap Its trading volume has jumped by over 1000% to surpass $50 million, reflecting massive trader interest driving MOODENG’s performance. Meanwhile, the staggering gains followed news of Ethereum co-founder donating approximately $300K to nurture baby hippo . PENGU overtakes Dogwifhat in market capitalization Pudgy Penguins has displayed impressive performance lately, establishing itself among the top meme tokens on the Solana ecosystem. The past 24 hours saw PENGU’s price hitting new peaks. The bullish performance propelled the altcoin’s market cap to $2.35 billion, Dogwifhat’s $2.01 billion. Chart by Coinmarketcap PENGU trades at $0.3730, with slight declines from daily highs demonstrating buyer exhaustion after robust gains. The rise in ranks demonstrates PENGU’s surging popularity within the meme crypto world. That reflects new investors joining Pudgy Penguins or speculative trading. Notably, PENGU’s recent performance displays enthusiasm about its future potential in use cases and adoption. Such trends could welcome further price growth in the upcoming sessions. A technical outlook supports more uptrends for PENGU. It exhibits a bullish bias after a descending triangle breakout. The formation signals possible uptrends after consolidation, which could propel PENGU to further highs. Bullish moves will target $0.044 before soaring toward the resistance at $0.0541. That would mean a 45% increase from current prices. However, broad market sentiments remain vital in determining PENGU’s performance in the upcoming times. XRP presents the best Q4 in 7 years Historical data from CryptoRank shows that Q4 2024 is officially XRP’s best quarter in the past seven years. The remittance token gained 255% within the past three months, an impressive performance not seen since 2017. Source – Cryptorank Further details show XRP surged over 1,000% this year, with December witnessing most of these gains. The alt traded at $2.18, reflecting the prevailing selling pressure in the crypto space. XRP lost nearly 5% on its daily chart and signals more near-term struggles before recoveries. Broad market rallies following Trump’s election victory triggered XRP’s gains over the past few weeks. Experts anticipate friendly regulations from the incoming pro-cryptocurrency US leadership. Unlike the Biden administration, Donald Trump has promised to support crypto. The narrative supports speculations that the Ripple vs. SEC battle could end in early next year .

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

This adds to the $6 billion chunk xAI raised in May, making the total cash raised $12 billion. During the week, xAI revealed that Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Blackrock, Fidelity, Nvidia, AMD, Lightspeed, Morgan Stanley, Valor Equity Partners Sequoia Capital, and Vy Capital took part in the investment round. Other heavy players from the GCC region joined the investment round as well. These include Kingdom Holdings, MGX, Oman Investment Authority (OIA), and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). According to a public disclosure , Kingdom Holdings—the Saudi conglomerate holding company—invested around $400 million in the round. The disclosure also stated that xAI is now valued at $45 billion, almost twice its former valuation. In the announcement, xAI wrote, “ The funds from this financing round will be used to further accelerate our advanced infrastructure xAI is primarily focused on the development of advanced AI systems that are truthful, competent, and maximally beneficial for all of humanity.” Investors said that xAI has told them it wants to raise more money next year. xAI to be trained on data from Tesla and SpaceX xAI plans to train its models using data from Musk’s companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. The models could help those companies improve their tech. Currently, xAI manages SpaceX’s Starlink customer service. The AI startup is also negotiating with Tesla to undertake R&D for a percentage of its revenues. Tesla stockholders dislike these proposals. Musk has been sued for taking expertise and resources from Tesla to build xAI, which is considered a competitor startup. xAI’s partnerships and products have helped it make $100 million annually. OpenAI hopes to make $4 billion by 2024, while Anthropic expects $1 billion this year. Musk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its data center in Memphis. The center was built in 122 days and is partly powered by portable diesel engines at the moment . Next year, xAI wants to improve the server farm, which has 100k Nvidia GPUs and double that number. GeForce GPUs are the best chips for training and running models because they can do many tasks at once . In November, Memphis’ regional electricity authority allowed xAI to add 150MW, enough to power 100,000 houses. To win agency clearance, xAI promised to improve the city’s drinking water and give Memphis cheaper Tesla batteries.

38149015,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667308,1735234200,ONDO Faces 30% Correction Risk If It Loses $1.46 Support – Top Analyst,"Ondo Finance has faced significant challenges in recent weeks, with its price dropping over 30% from its all-time high of $2.14. Despite the recent downturn, many analysts remain optimistic about ONDO’s potential for recovery, citing its strong performance earlier this cycle as evidence of its resilience. As one of the top-performing altcoins, ONDO has consistently attracted investor attention, leading to speculation about its next move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? However, caution is warranted. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis warning that ONDO may be at risk of further correction. Martinez highlights the potential formation of a head-and-shoulders pattern on the price chart, a bearish signal often associated with trend reversals. If this pattern plays out, it could lead to increased selling pressure and a deeper pullback. The coming days will be critical for Ondo Finance as it navigates this pivotal moment. Investors will closely watch whether the token can defy bearish signals and reignite bullish momentum or if the feared pattern will confirm, leading to additional declines. For now, ONDO’s future hangs in the balance, with market sentiment and technical indicators offering conflicting signals about its short-term trajectory. ONDO Testing Crucial Demand Ondo Finance has faced a significant correction after its strong rally earlier in the cycle, now testing crucial demand levels at key price points. The token’s price halted at its previous all-time high, around $1.50, which now serves as a pivotal support level. If It holds above this mark, bullish momentum could return, potentially setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. However, top analyst Ali Martinez has raised concerns with a technical analysis that suggests ONDO may be forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. This pattern, if confirmed, typically signals a trend reversal and could lead to increased selling pressure. Martinez warns that a decisive close below the $1.48 level could trigger a steep 30% correction, driving ONDO’s price down to approximately $1.05. Such a move would represent a significant setback for the token and its investors. Related Reading: Solana Sees Consistent Capital Inflows Since 2023 – Liquidity Influx Signals Growth To invalidate this bearish scenario, ONDO must reclaim the $1.86 level as support, a move that would signal strength and restore confidence in the asset’s bullish potential. Until then, the market remains at a critical juncture, with traders closely monitoring price action for clues about ONDO’s next direction. The coming days will be decisive in determining whether ONDO can recover or faces further downside risk. Technical Analysis: What To Expect Ondo Finance (ONDO) is currently trading at $1.49 after successfully testing the critical $1.46 support level highlighted by top analyst Ali Martinez. This level has proven to be a significant line of defense for ONDO, reflecting strong buying interest at this price. The token appears stable for now, but market participants remain cautious, as broader market conditions could still impact ONDO’s trajectory. The recent resilience at $1.46 is encouraging, suggesting that ONDO may be building a foundation for a potential recovery. However, a market-wide retrace could put additional pressure on ONDO, possibly driving its price lower and retesting critical demand levels. Investors are keeping a close eye on key technical levels for confirmation of a bullish rebound. Related Reading: XRP Whales Keep Buying – Data Reveals Smart Money Prepares For A Rally For ONDO to regain upward momentum, reclaiming the $1.70 level in the coming days is essential. A decisive move above this mark would signal renewed strength, paving the way for a bullish recovery and potentially retesting previous highs. Until then, ONDO remains in a delicate position, with traders monitoring broader market sentiment and the asset’s ability to sustain current support levels. The next steps will be crucial in determining whether ONDO can resume its uptrend or face continued consolidation.

Over the last few years, Shiba Inu has grown with projects like Shibarium, Shiba Eternity, and Shiboshi Rush, showcasing its rapid evolution from a meme coin to a broader ecosystem. ‘Welcome to SHIB: The Metaverse’ Shiba Inu recently announced the launch of a virtual world called “SHIB: The Metaverse.” LUCIE (Shibarium’s marketing lead) described the project as “groundbreaking.” Powered by the layer-2 scaling solution, “SHIB: The Metaverse” represents a platform for “creativity, connection, and ownership.” LUCIE further explained that the project allows users to own, trade, and develop virtual real estate recorded on the blockchain. People are also enabled to create personalized avatars, build their own vision, and connect globally with other members of the SHIB community. For their part, Seizan_Shib posted a short video on X, showing what the project looks like. The X user said “SHIB: The Metaverse” is already live but warned that it is still in beta version . One individual who reacted was Shiba Inu’s lead developer – Shytoshi Kusama. They retweeted the post, simply saying , “Beautiful.” Previous SHIB-Related Projects In the past few years, Shiba Inu has significantly expanded beyond being just a meme coin. The self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer has evolved into a broader ecosystem with several notable developments. One evident example is its L2 blockchain solution – Shibarium. It officially saw the light of day last summer and is specifically designed to reduce transaction fees, improve speed, and enhance scalability. Earlier this week, Shibarium blasted through another major milestone. As CryptoPotato reported , the total transactions processed on the network exceeded 700 million. Shiba Inu has also entered the gaming sector. In October, the team introduced Shiboshi Rush, which enables players to deploy their troops at certain locations and “utilize the multiplier gates” to grow their armies. Prior to that, the developers launched Shiba Eternity, which is perhaps the most popular game within the ecosystem. It allows players to trade, collect, and battle with cards that feature numerous characters, items, and themes inspired by the meme coin. In August, LUCIE disclosed that the game’s “closed beta “ is live. They stated that Shiba Eternity isn’t “just the same old game with minor tweaks “ but a complete transition to Web3, featuring significant upgrades. These include a redesigned ranking system, exclusive tournaments for advanced players, an improved and user-friendly interface, and more generous rewards.

These under-the-radar assets have the potential to become major success stories, multiplying in value dramatically. This discovery has sparked interest among investors eager to find the next big opportunity in the ever-changing world of crypto. Graphite Token (@G): Powering the Blockchain That Could Topple Ethereum and Solana Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have had their time in the spotlight. Now, Graphite Token (@G) is here, bringing with it the power of the Graphite L1 blockchain designed to make crypto simpler, faster, and more rewarding for everyone. Could this be the next big thing to follow Ethereum’s legendary 4,000X growth? The secret to life-changing crypto profits lies in spotting the next hidden gem before the crowd. History shows that early adopters of projects with real utility reap massive rewards: Solana started at $0.04 and skyrocketed to nearly $300 — a staggering +7,500%. Ethereum launched below $1 and climbed to around $4,000 — an insane +400,000%. The secret to their growth? Utility. The more people use them, the more valuable their tokens become. But times have changed, and these blockchains aren’t cutting it anymore. Discover SOL and ETH Challenger for 4,000X Profit Potential What’s Wrong with Ethereum and Solana? Older blockchains face growing challenges like rising fees, complexity, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about reliability. Take Solana, which occasionally experiences network outages, or Ethereum, which saw a significant reduction in its burn rate in 2024. Between unpredictable gas costs, unsatisfactory speed, and unreliable service, users are starting to look elsewhere. The dominance of the “old guard” is fading. What Graphite Brings to the Table Graphite is built to address the challenges of older blockchains with a set of practical features. Direct Rewards for Entry-Point Nodes Graphite has something no other blockchain offers. It lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes, so literally anyone contributing to its operations can earn a share. Transparent, Trust-Based Interactions Graphite’s reputation-based system introduces a Trust Score, a measure of user credibility similar to a credit rating in TradFi. This approach enhances transparency while keeping user privacy within the network where interactions are built on trust. Fair Fees, Fast Speed, and High Scalability Powered by the PoA Polymer 2.0 Algorithm, Graphite keeps fees plain and as low as possible by minimizing computational and energy costs. The network processes up to 1,400 transactions per second with confirmation times under 10 seconds, delivering a perfect balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Security as a Top Priority Graphite enforces a one user - one account policy to safeguard its network against fraud and scams. Additionally, it offers an optional KYC verification procedure with three tiers of off-chain checks powered by ZKP to ensure compliance while protecting user data. With transaction filters, users can choose to interact only with accounts that meet specific KYC levels, adding an extra layer of security. Is This Your Chance to Get in Early? The Graphite blockchain is secure, transparent, scalable, and cost-efficient, making it the go-to choice for developers and users alike. With its practical approach and early adoption potential, Graphite is a project worth watching. For those looking to get in early, Graphite offers an opportunity to be part of a blockchain that’s designed for long-term growth and usability. Will it deliver 4,000X gains? Time will tell, but the foundation is strong. This could be your shot at 4,000X profits — Don’t miss out! Aptos: A Scalable Blockchain Aiming to Solve High Transaction Fees Aptos is a new blockchain designed for scalability, safety, and reliability. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by core contributors from Diem (a project initiated by Meta), it aims to address high transaction fees and network congestion seen in other blockchains like Ethereum before its transition to Proof-of-Stake. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, focusing on safety and flexibility. It employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and supports a wide range of Web3 applications. By focusing on scalability and upgradability, Aptos seeks to enhance the blockchain experience for both users and developers.

It lets creators access GPU power for rendering tasks more efficiently and at lower costs. Node operators contribute spare GPU capacity and receive RENDER tokens in return for their services. This system supports the production of animation, motion graphics, and visual effects. It leverages a distributed network of processing power. By connecting creators with unused GPU resources, Render Token aims to improve the rendering process in a decentralized way. Fetch.ai: Bridging AI and Blockchain for Decentralized Machine Learning Fetch.ai is an AI lab building an open, permissionless, decentralized machine learning network with a crypto economy. It allows anyone to access AI technology through a network where users can connect and access secure datasets. By using autonomous AI, tasks can be executed leveraging its global data network. Fetch.ai aims to optimize areas like DeFi trading services, transportation networks, smart energy grids, and travel. It focuses on any complex digital system that relies on large-scale datasets. The potential of Fetch.ai lies in democratizing AI access and enhancing various industries through decentralized machine learning. Conclusion In conclusion, while the top trader has highlighted cryptos like APT, SUI, RENDER, and FET as potential 100X success stories, they may not show significant gains in the short term. Investors might need to be patient, as these coins could take time to realize their full potential. In the upcoming bull run the Graphite (@G) token could take the central stage. However, it is important to consider the timeframe for expected returns. These cryptos might not offer immediate profits, but they could be worthwhile for those looking at a longer investment horizon.

Solana and SOL: A Scalable Foundation for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. It stands out with architectural choices aimed at faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, is central to its ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The SOL coin holds value as it underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem, rewarding participants and allowing users access to a suite of projects on Solana. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network capable of hosting high-activity products and services. Sui: A Scalable Layer-1 Blockchain Focused on User Experience Sui is a layer-1 blockchain platform built to support global adoption. It offers a secure and scalable development environment.

Conclusion In conclusion, the new blockchain is set to surpass Solana (SOL) and SUI in the next three years. SOL and SUI may have less potential in the short term due to various challenges. The new Graphite (@G) blockchain stands out during the current bull run with its unique features and strong support. Its potential for rapid growth makes it a promising option. As the market rises in 2024, Graphite (@G) could become a key player, offering more opportunities than its competitors. Investors should watch its progress closely.

Get in now, watch Catzilla wreck the market, and bring chaos to the competition! Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, reducing the circulating tokens. SHIB's foundation on Ethereum allows it to integrate with decentralized applications like ShibaSwap, its own exchange. Future plans include a non-fungible token (NFT) platform and a governance system through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In the current market cycle, SHIB's expanding ecosystem and technological developments have increased its visibility in the crypto space. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run begins, coins like SHIB show less short-term potential. Meanwhile, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a 700% ROI in presale, triple utility features, and a mission to unite enthusiasts against crypto villains, acquiring $CATZILLA tokens offers a unique opportunity.

As a new administration prepares to take office, President-elect Donald Trump has nominated cryptocurrency-friendly former regulator Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, signaling a shift in the agency’s priorities. In early December, Trump announced Atkins’ candidacy via a post on Truth Social, praising her understanding of crypto and innovation as key to “Making America Greater Than Ever.” Atkins, who served as SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2008, brings experience from her role on the board of advisors to The Digital Chamber, which she joined in 2020. “Atkins really understands crypto,” Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) executive director Alison Mangiero said in an interview. “We’re going to see an SEC that clearly has different priorities than Gensler’s SEC,” she said, noting the potential for a sharp departure from Gensler’s approach. Gensler and Democratic Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga announced their resignations in late November, leaving three Republican commissioners (Mark Uyeda, Hester Peirce and soon-to-be Atkins) at the helm of the SEC. However, the agency’s makeup will change again as the Biden administration will be required by legal requirements to nominate a commissioner from a different political party. Related News: How Much Did Famous Names' Predictions for Bitcoin Price in 2024 Do? Here is a Compilation of Predictions Teresa Goody Guillén, a partner at BakerHostetler and former SEC litigation counsel, explained that the new appointee could be from any non-Republican party, such as a Democrat, Libertarian or independent. “While Atkins’ confirmation is expected to expedite the nomination process for the next commissioner, this appointment will likely compete with other prioritized presidential appointments,” Guillén said. Gensler, whose resignation takes effect the day Trump is inaugurated, has faced criticism from the crypto industry for his aggressive enforcement approach. During his tenure, he has argued that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities and has urged crypto firms to register with the SEC. But many industry leaders have argued that the current regulatory framework is ill-suited to digital assets. Mangiero predicts that under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC could explore new avenues, such as integrating staking into crypto ETFs and other financial products. “There are a lot of little things that the SEC could address in its first few months to send a positive signal,” he said. If confirmed, Atkins’ SEC is expected to impose fewer sanctions on crypto firms. “We’re likely to see fewer non-fraud cases where there’s no investor loss,” Guillén said. He also predicts a decline in new lawsuits aimed at setting regulatory precedents. *This is not investment advice.

Each stage brings new challenges and greater rewards, and as the clock ticks, only the swift and strategic will reap the ultimate gains.

MEW and Popcat have already proven that cats mean business, with MEW achieving a 103.7% climb in three months and Popcat delivering a jaw-dropping 157.44% surge. But these gains pale in comparison to what Catzilla promises. This isn’t just a coin — it’s a revolution. Forget the dog pack; cats are here to rule. Catzilla: The future of meme coins While Shiba Inu (SHIB) expands its utility and PEPE rides on meme nostalgia, Catzilla roars ahead with innovation, community rewards, and financial empowerment. Its presale offers unmatched opportunities, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016, alongside governance, staking, and massive ROI potential. Uniting crypto enthusiasts, anime fans, and meme culture, Catzilla is poised to lead the next generation of meme coins. The days of passive investing are over — Catzilla invites interested investors to join the fight for financial freedom and take their place at the top of the crypto food chain. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with expanding utility Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

Future plans include a non-fungible token (NFT) platform and a governance system through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In the current market cycle, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem and technological developments have increased its visibility in the crypto space. PEPE: A deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum, paying tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. It seeks to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and transparency about its lack of utility, PEPE embraces its identity as a pure memecoin. In April and May 2023, PEPE’s market cap soared to $1.6 billion, creating significant wealth for early holders and building a strong community. The roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover.” PEPE’s potential hinges on market interest in memecoins, and its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on investor sentiment toward high-risk, high-reward assets. Conclusion Catzilla is taking the spotlight in the meme coin market, outshining SHIB and PEPE, which have less short-term potential. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016, Catzilla combines governance, rewards, and staking.

Bitcoin (BTC), which is the pioneer of the crypto market, has recently surpassed the $100,000 mark, reaching a new all-time high of $108,364 before experiencing a pullback. The initial surge is largely attributed to the election of President-elect Donald Trump, whose eagerly-anticipated pro-crypto-friendly policies have invigorated the market.

In this guide, we are going to list and review the top nine ICOs, presales, and altcoins to buy for 2025.

Best Wallet Token - The Ultimate 2025 Crypto Wallet One of the best presales to invest in for 2025 is Best Wallet Token , a new cryptocurrency that has a lot of value and benefits inside its ecosystem, the Best Wallet platform. $BEST is the crypto wallet's native coin, which provides reduced transaction costs and early access to partner crypto projects. Essentially, the Best Wallet Token is a utility token designed to enhance the functionalities of the cryptocurrency wallet. By integrating this token, users can enjoy rewards, seamless transactions, and access to exclusive features within the wallet ecosystem. The project aims to create a more user-friendly and rewarding experience for crypto enthusiasts.

According to some crypto analysts, this ultimate crypto wallet is on track to capture 40% of the $11bn noncustodial wallet market by 2026, making the $BEST token a key crypto asset to watch in the coming years.

Visit Best Wallet Token Ripple XRP - Fourth Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Cap Another altcoin to invest in for 2025 is Ripple (XRP), one of the most established cryptocurrencies designed to facilitate cross-border payments. Its real-time gross settlement system allows for instant, low-cost international transactions, making it a favorite crypto among global financial institutions. And, with its growing institutional adoption and real-world utility, XRP is positioned as a top contender in the crypto market. Moreover, recently, XRP has experienced a significant price surge, trading around $2.24, gaining around 290% in the past three months. This increase is fueled by speculation about the approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This possibility could attract more institutional investors and drive wider adoption, similar to how the Bitcoin ETFs boosted BTC. As a result, XRP has seen a 59% increase in the last month and a 270% year-to-date increase, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in for 2025. Additionally, Ripple's recent regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the launch of its RLUSD stablecoin has further strengthened its position in the market, signaling trust and expansion potential. Looking ahead, the potential approval of XRP ETFs and growing institutional interest could make XRP one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. This is because, unlike many speculative coins, XRP offers real-world utility and has established itself as a key player in digital finance. As the crypto industry prepares for a potential bull run in 2025, XRP is certainly well-positioned to generate significant profits. Wall Street Pepe - Frog-Themed Meme Coin Aiming For Total Crypto Domination Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a promising new meme token that combines the iconic popularity of Pepe with the thrill of Wall Street trading.

Currently, presale participants will enjoy over 30% APY rewards. What’s more, the $WEPE presale offers early buyers a chance to purchase the token before it gets listed on major crypto exchanges, and this project has already gained significant traction, raising over $15 million within the first 10 days of its presale and surpassing the $36 million mark in less than a month. This rapid growth highlights its potential to compete with other top meme coins in the market, making it one of the best presales to buy in 2025. $WEPE is currently priced at $0.0003656 per token, and it can be swapped with ETH, USDT, BNB, or directly through a bank card.

In 2025, the cryptocurrency market is expected to continue its evolution with a focus on scalability, regulatory clarity, and broader adoption. Perhaps more than anything else, all eyes will be on how the Trump administration can impact the crypto landscape. If Trump fulfills his promises, we might see Bitcoin and other cryptos continue the positive momentum. Otherwise, we might see a crypto crash in 2025. More than that, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) may likely become more common, with countries like China and the EU exploring digital versions of their national currencies. Also, regulations around cryptocurrency are likely to become more defined, thereby potentially offering institutional investors more confidence in the market. Lastly, the ongoing development of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain interoperability will continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto space. Additionally, as more industries adopt blockchain technology, the market could see more widespread use cases, further legitimizing the space. In short, 2025 is going to be an exciting year for crypto investors. Final Word - What’s the Best Crypto to Invest In for the New Year? In sum, while there are numerous exciting projects in the crypto space, the best investments for 2025 will solely depend on an individual’s risk tolerance and investment goals. Having said that, Ethereum, Ripple, and Chainlink remain strong long-term investment choices thanks to their established market positions and innovative use cases. Meanwhile, emerging projects like Best Wallet Token, Catslap, Crypto All Stars, Solaxy, and Flockerz offer exciting potential for high returns, especially as the market matures. Ultimately, staying informed about market trends, technological advancements, and regulatory developments will be key to making smart investments in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

Ethereum ( ETH ) token fell to $3,340, down by over 5.6% from its highest level this week. This retreat happened as a sea of red spread in the crypto industry, with the market cap of all coins falling to $3.29 million. Ethereum crashed in a low-volume environment as most traders remained away from the market during the Christmas holiday. CoinGecko data shows that the 24-hour volume was $17.5 billion, down from $24 billion a day earlier. It had its lowest volume in over a month. Ethereum’s futures open interest also continued falling, reaching a low of $26 billion, down from this month’s high of $28 billion. Falling open interest is a sign of falling demand among futures traders.

Data by DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked in its DeFi ecosystem has risen by 5.50% in the last 30 days. Solana and Tron’s TVL has dropped by over 3% in that period. The active addresses ratio has continued to rise in the past few months. It has risen from the October low of 0.37% to 0.57%, its highest level since August. This important data point looks at the ratio of active addresses to balances with balances. Total active Ethereum addresses have risen to over 927,000. Ethereum active addresses | Source: IntoTheBlock More technical data shows that Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value score rose by 2.35% in the last 24 hours to 1.64. This important number looks at whether a crypto asset is overvalued or undervalued. An MVRVA figure of less than 3.8 indicates that an asset is relatively undervalued. Ethereum MVRV indicator | Source: IntoTheBlock Ethereum price analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ETH price formed a small double-top pattern at $4,095 and then made a strong bearish breakout. It then rebounded and retested the pattern’s neckline at $3,500, its lowest swing on December 3. ETH formed a small doji candlestick pattern on Christmas day. A doji is made up of a small body and long and upper shadows and is usually a bearish sign. Ethereum has also formed a bearish flag chart pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely have a bearish breakout and reach the psychological point at $3,000, down by 10% below the current level.

Constitutional Court Ruling Montenegro's Constitutional Court has rejected an appeal by Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, against his extradition. The decision eliminates a critical legal obstacle, pushing the case closer to a resolution. The court’s unanimous verdict follows an October ruling temporarily suspended extradition proceedings until the appeal was addressed. Kwon had contested a Supreme Court of Montenegro ruling from September, invalidating his extradition to South Korea. That decision left the final extradition determination in the hands of Montenegro's Minister of Justice. Extradition to South Korea or the United States? With the appeal dismissed, the focus now shifts to Justice Minister Bojan Božović, who will decide whether Kwon will be extradited to South Korea or the United States. Reports from South Korea suggest a stronger possibility of extradition to the U.S., reflecting the justice ministry's stance. Both nations are pursuing Kwon for charges tied to the collapse of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency ecosystem in May 2022. The crash, involving TerraUSD and Luna coins, wiped out approximately $40 billion from the market and marked the onset of the 2022 crypto winter. The collapse also exposed malpractices at other major platforms like FTX and Celsius, prompting global regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi). Timeline of Legal Proceedings Do Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 while attempting to leave the country using a falsified passport. The High Court in Montenegro initially ruled in February to extradite him to the U.S. to face charges related to the Terra-Luna collapse. However, in March, the decision was reversed in favor of extraditing him to South Korea. Months of legal back-and-forth ensued, delaying the extradition process. The latest ruling brings the case closer to a conclusion, but the final decision remains pending as Minister Božović weighs the options. Broader Implications Kwon’s extradition case is seen as a potential precedent for international cooperation in cryptocurrency-related crimes. The high-profile nature of the case has also sparked political controversies in Montenegro. Former Justice Minister Andrej Milovic accused Prime Minister Milojko Spajić of favoring extradition to South Korea due to alleged financial connections with Kwon. Meanwhile, Goran Rodić, Kwon’s legal representative in Montenegro, urged Justice Minister Božović to ensure an impartial decision free from political influence, as reported by local news outlet “Pobjeda.” The timeline for the final extradition decision remains unclear.

38148816,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53199,1735231799,Expert Says SHIB Will Continue Its Rise Towards $0.000081,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), the dog-themed cryptocurrency, has demonstrated resilience in the face of recent market volatility. According to market analyst Javon Marks, SHIB’s strong rebound positions it to continue its upward trajectory, potentially reaching $0.000081. Shiba Inu Rebounds After Significant Drop Following a market-wide correction, Shiba Inu lost over 20% in value last week, touching a low of $0.00001853—a level last seen in early November. Despite this downturn, the cryptocurrency quickly regained momentum. SHIB has since rebounded and is currently trading at $0.00002271. This recovery has reinforced bullish sentiment among analysts, with Marks identifying the recent price action as a key indicator of further potential growth. Bullish Signals Emerge In a Christmas Day tweet, Marks pointed out that Shiba Inu’s latest rebound has triggered a bullish signal that could drive further price gains. “Shiba Inu’s path close to its all-time high of $0.00008854 remains on course,” Marks stated. He predicts the cryptocurrency will experience a 234% surge to $0.000081, equivalent to a 3.33x price increase from current levels. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) adds bullish signals and the road to $0.000081 is looking like it will continue! A more than 3.33X in an over 234% climb for Shiba is in the cards… https://t.co/UmANSZqJam pic.twitter.com/ceBWBw6ypv — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 24, 2024 Marks’ accompanying analysis highlights a bullish confirmation on the SHIB/USD daily chart, marked by a bullish engulfing candle. This pattern is often regarded as a strong indicator of potential upward momentum in technical analysis. While Marks did not specify an exact timeline for SHIB to reach $0.000081, his remark that the price target is “in the cards” suggests that the rally could occur sooner rather than later. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical Context and Broader Predictions Marks’ latest forecast aligns with his previous bullish outlooks on Shiba Inu. In October, he suggested that SHIB was poised to rise to $0.000081 , a prediction made when the token was trading at $0.0000178. Investors who purchased at that level have already seen a portfolio gain of over 30% at current prices. Other analysts have echoed Marks’ optimism regarding SHIB’s price trajectory. For instance, SHIB KNIGHT, a prominent figure within the community, maintains that the token is ready to surpass $0.00008618 and potentially achieve even higher milestones. Similarly, technical analyst Charting Guy highlighted a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling a potential retest of SHIB’s all-time high of $0.00008854. Outlook for Shiba Inu (SHIB) While Shiba Inu remains over 250% below its target price of $0.000081, analysts are optimistic about its potential to bridge the gap. The cryptocurrency’s ability to rebound sharply from recent lows and sustain positive momentum supports the argument for continued growth. As the second-largest meme coin, Shiba Inu’s performance remains closely watched by the crypto community. With a growing base of supporters and strong technical signals, SHIB may indeed be on the path to significant price milestones in the near future.

38149933,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/russian-companies-are-using-bitcoin-for-international-payments,1735231672,Russian Companies Are Using Bitcoin For International Payments,"Russia’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, has revealed that domestic companies are using Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies for international payments. The shift comes after several legislative changes to allow such transactions to counter sanctions imposed by Western nations. Russia Already Using Bitcoin In Foreign Trade Siluanov’s admission comes as Russia turns to crypto to beat sanctions imposed on it following its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions have significantly compromised and complicated the country’s ability to trade with major partners like China and Turkey. This is because foreign banks have become increasingly reluctant to trade with their Russian counterparts to avoid scrutiny from Western regulatory authorities. Cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, have emerged as a viable alternative for Russia and its domestic companies to conduct international trade without relying on the US Dollar or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)-based payment systems. Russia introduced legislation to permit the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade. It also legalized Bitcoin mining and has established itself as a global leader in mining. Siluanov stated, “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). The finance minister also noted that several Russian companies have made cross-border transactions using Bitcoin, and the country intends to expand and develop digital payments. ""Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year.” Dollar On Shaky Ground? Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the current US administration had severely undermined the US Dollar’s role as a reserve currency, claiming the currency is being used for political purposes. This, according to Putin, has prompted many currencies to look for alternatives to the Dollar. Putin used Bitcoin as an example, adding that no country in the world had the ability to influence or regulate it. The president’s comments indicated that Russia favors the extensive use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments. Russia Contemplating Strategic Reserve Russia could also join several nations in creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to several media reports, Anton Tkachev, a State Duma deputy from the New People party, has proposed establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The proposal highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against Western sanctions, a financial stabilizer, and an investment vehicle. “With limited access to traditional international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies are becoming virtually the only tool for international trade. The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment on cross-border payments in cryptocurrency.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38149306,https://invezz.com/?p=2406413,1735231596,Ukraine eyes sanctions as Russia deepens crypto use,"Ukraine will impose sanctions to disrupt Russia’s use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in foreign trade as tensions between the two countries continue to amplify. According to Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Advisor to the president of Ukraine and Commissioner for Sanctions Policy, efforts are already underway to implement targeted measures to block unwanted cryptocurrency payments, reported local media Ukrainska Pravda . “Are we at all surprised?” Vlasiuk was quoted as saying, adding that Ukraine had already alerted its trade partners earlier this year about the “plans of the enemy.” The government of Ukraine is aiming to counter Russia’s attempts to bypass Western sanctions through the use of digital assets like stablecoins and Bitcoin, and “sanctions and other solutions” are in development in this regard. Sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies have long affected Russia’s ability to trade with its global partners like China and Turkey, particularly following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Vladimir Putin-led country has sought alternative options like cryptocurrencies to retain access to global markets. Russia’s crypto plans Vlasiuk’s remarks came less than 24 hours after Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov publicly disclosed that the country has been using Bitcoin and other cryptos in cross-border trades. Moreover, the minister stressed the government’s intention to intensify efforts to expand and develop this channel even further. Earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill that allows local businesses to use virtual currencies for global trading even though the use of such assets as legal tender remains restricted within Russian borders. The law came into effect in September, but Russian companies had resorted to cryptocurrencies long before that. Bloomberg reported in May that some of the country’s top metal companies were using Tether-issued stablecoin USDT to settle their trades with Hong Kong. Russia’s newfound interest in cryptocurrencies was also evident from Putin’s comments during a speech at the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow think tank. With a nod to Bitcoin’s decentralised nature, Putin positioned digital assets as a low-cost and reliable alternative. Bitcoin’s role remains central to Russia’s plans, and the country has moved to regulate the mining sector by legalising it in August and subsequently implementing a 15% tax on income generated. The tax law also officially recognised cryptocurrencies as property. Ukraine to regulate crypto Crypto usage has surged across both Ukraine and Russia, according to an October Chainalysis report . While Russia has already taken the initial steps, Ukraine is mulling to introduce a draft law early next year. Earlier this month, the head of the Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, Danylo Hetmantse, confirmed that the proposed law would regulate crypto transactions while also introducing a tax framework. Plans are to tax cryptocurrencies similarly to securities, applying standard tax rates without offering any exemptions or special deductions for digital asset transactions.

38147938,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633603,1735231535,US stock market pushes 10-year yields up 100bps despite Fed rate cuts,"The U.S. stock market seems determined to defy the Federal Reserve. While the Fed has cut interest rates by a total of 100 basis points since September, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note skyrocketed by the exact same amount. Yields now sit at 4.60%, up from 3.60%, defying the Fed’s efforts and leaving analysts scratching their heads. This is the sharpest disconnect between market moves and Fed policy in history. The 10-year yield is now at its highest since May, proving once again that rate cuts don’t always mean lower borrowing costs. And borrowers are feeling it. Mortgage rates on a 30-year loan have climbed to 7.10%, up from 6.15% just three months ago. For the average home priced at $420,400, that’s an extra $400 a month out of buyers’ wallets. Inflation hits hard, markets don’t care If you’re wondering why the Fed’s rate cuts aren’t bringing yields down, the answer is simple: inflation is back. The 3-month annualized core CPI is inching closer to 4%, with PCE, PPI, and CPI data all showing a steady rise. And that’s before considering any future tariffs or tax cuts. At the November Fed meeting, when asked about this market disconnect, Chair Jerome Powell said, “It’s material changes in financial conditions that last… and we don’t know that about this.” Well, six weeks later, and the 10-year yield just keeps climbing. Adding fuel to the fire, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) hit a 25-month high, jumping nearly 8% since October. One dollar now fetches $1.44 Canadian, a level not seen in two decades. Inflation’s grip is tightening everywhere, but the bond market is laser-focused on one metric: Supercore PCE inflation. Annualized one-month Supercore PCE inflation is nearing 5%, and the headline number is back above 3.5%. A chaotic road to 2025 With inflation running hotter than expected, expectations for 2025 are changing fast. Just a few months ago, markets anticipated four rate cuts for the year. Now, they’re penciling in just two—and there’s a 21% chance the Fed won’t cut rates at all. The first cut isn’t even on the radar until May 2025, which feels like a lifetime away. Meanwhile, the stock market is on a spending spree. Since Election Day, a record $140 billion has flowed into U.S. equities. Foreign and domestic investors are doubling down despite inflation warnings and a paring back of the Fed’s pivot. If this sounds reckless, it’s because it probably is. Labor market data is adding to the chaos. Weekly jobless claims hit 219,000 for the week ending December 21, just shy of the previous period and below the 225,000 forecast. But here’s the thing: continuing claims, which lag by a week, climbed to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. The Fed, for its part, isn’t backing down on its cautious outlook. Powell said, “It’s kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower. It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/stock-market-push-10-year-yield-100bps-fed/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38147938.jpeg

BTC has been marginally down over the last 24 hours and is trading at around $98,100. The price dipped to $92,500 on Tuesday before recovering. However, analysts expect a further downside as whale transactions reach a two-year high. Most cryptocurrencies opened Boxing Day in the red, with Ethereum (ETH) down almost 2% and trading around $3,430. Ripple (XRP) is also in the red, down by 2.24%, while Solana (SOL) is down almost 2% and trading around $195. Marginal losses were also reported by Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR), and Polkadot (DOT). The overall crypto market cap is down by 0.70% and currently sits at $3.41 trillion. Could We See A Post-Christmas Rally? Historical price trends for Bitcoin (BTC) suggest a recurring pattern of strong upward momentum after Christmas, especially during halving cycles. The trends show BTC enters a profit zone after each halving event, with the price increasing substantially after the holidays. BTC saw a modest consolidation before a staggering 9,000% rally after the 2012 halving. The 2016 halving saw a similar post-Christmas rally which eventually fueled the 2017 bull run. The trend repeated in 2020 when BTC surged to an all-time high post-Christmas. According to analysts, BTC’s price pattern could be attributed to seasonal market dynamics. Year-end institutional balance sheet closures and renewed capital inflows often drive investments. As institutional investors adjust their investments to manage tax liabilities and align with their investment goals, it could increase liquidity and volatility. MicroStrategy Purchases More Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy announced the purchase of 5,000 BTC, capping a frenetic buying spree that began in November. The company has since added 113,000 BTC to its reserves, worth around $11 billion. The firm now owns around 444,000 BTC, worth a staggering $44 billion. The purchase comes as the firm was added to the Nasdaq 100, an index of the largest non-financial companies on the stock exchange. MicroStrategy funds its BTC purchase by using surplus cash along with equity and debt issuances, a strategy that has come under criticism from market analysts, “Eventually, the debt will far eclipse equity, the trading premium will disappear, the conversion prices on the notes will feel unreachable, and equity price will collapse under the weight of senior debt, particularly during a gnarly Bitcoin dip.” Russia Imposes Six-Year Ban On Crypto Mining The Russian government has imposed a six-year ban on crypto mining in ten regions until 2031 due to the mining industry’s high power consumption. The ban places temporary restrictions during periods of peak demand, will come into force on January 1, and end on March 15, 2031. Russia legalized crypto mining earlier this year, with the law coming into force last month. However, it has banned using cryptocurrencies as legal tender for regular payments domestically but allows cross-border payments using crypto to evade sanctions. Russia Using Bitcoin In Foreign Trade Russia is using Bitcoin (BTC) in foreign trade and to settle international payments after legislative changes to counter Western sanctions. Sanctions imposed by Western nations have significantly complicated Russia’s trade with major trading partners, including China and Turkey, with banks wary of processing transactions linked to Russia. Russia permitted the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade and legalized cryptocurrency mining. Russia’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, stated, “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use Bitcoin, which we have mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). Such transactions are already occurring and we believe they must be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled since setting a new all-time high on December 17, reaching $108,268. Since then, it has declined substantially, dropping below $100,00 and the 20-day SMA over the next few sessions. The price continued to fall as the Christmas week began, as it plummeted to a low of $82,469 on Monday before recovering to current levels. However, traders expecting a move above $100,000 were disappointed despite MicroStrategy purchasing another significant chunk of BTC. BTC’s drop began after hawkish comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell’s comments about inflation and future rate cuts sparked a bearish reaction across the market, with cryptocurrencies plummeting. The markets also saw an increase in whale activity as large investors rebalanced their positions for the following year. BTC’s decline from its all-time high has coincided with this increase in whale activity. On-chain data has revealed the average transaction size for BTC jumped to $306,000 on Monday, the highest since November 2022. After reaching a new all-time high last Tuesday, BTC registered a significant decline on Wednesday, dropping almost 6% and settling at $100,195. BTC reported considerable volatility on Thursday as buyers attempted a recovery and sellers sought to lower the price. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand, and BTC fell from an intraday high of $102,792 to slip below $100,000 and the 20-day SMA and settle at $97,703. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $92,072. However, BTC recovered from this level as buyers entered the market and registered a marginal increase to settle at $98,124. Buyers attempted a move past $100,000 and the 20-day SMA on Saturday as BTC rose to an intraday high of $99,942 before losing momentum. As a result, BTC dropped by 0.63% and fell to $97,505. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Sunday as bearish sentiment registered a sharp increase. As a result, BTC dropped by 2.26% and settled at $95,303. The current week began with BTC experiencing volatility again as it rose to an intraday high of $96,530 and fell to an intraday low of $92,469 before settling at $94,830. Despite facing considerable bearish sentiment, BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising just above 4% and settling at $98,677. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC rose to $99,409. However, they could not go past the 20-day SMA and $100,000. The current session sees BTC back in the red, with the price down by 1.40% and trading at $98,020. If BTC sees further downside, it drop to $95,000. If this support level is breached, the price could drop to $90,000. On the other hand, if buyers regain control, BTC could attempt to go above the 20-day SMA and reclaim the $100,000 level. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to reclaim $3,500 as it tries to build momentum after a substantial drop that dragged it below $4,000. ETH reached an intraday high of $4,106 on Monday (December 16) before dropping by 2.33% on Tuesday to settle at $3,892. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH slipped below the 20-day SMA and settled at $3,625. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,762. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, allowing sellers to take over. As a result, ETH dropped almost 6% to go below $3,500 and settle at $3,415. Friday saw ETH plummet below the 50-day SMA as it fell to an intraday low of $3,096.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

SPX6900 (SPX) In the ever-evolving world of internet culture, imagination knows no bounds. Enter SPX6900, a fictional meme token born from the depths of online humor. This imagined cryptocurrency embarks on an audacious quest: to outshine the S&P 500 by reaching an astounding $69 trillion market cap. The playful logic is simple—since 6900 is vastly superior to 500, SPX6900 must be infinitely better than any traditional financial instrument. This whimsical idea captures how numbers and memes collide to create stories that entertain and provoke thought. While SPX6900 is a product of creative minds, it reflects real trends in the cryptocurrency market. Meme tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown how community-driven projects can gain surprising momentum. These coins tap into viral culture and the power of collective belief. In the current market cycle, where unconventional assets often grab headlines, the concept of SPX6900 highlights the unpredictable nature of crypto investments. Though fictional, it sparks conversations about the allure of big numbers and bold ambitions in a market always looking for the next sensation. Popcat (POPCAT) POPCAT is more than just a meme; it's a sensation. Stemming from an Internet meme in October 2020, it showcases two lovable images of a cat named Oatmeal. One picture has Oatmeal with a closed mouth, and the other is edited to form an amusing 'O' shape. This charming cat captured hearts worldwide, and now, it's popping into the crypto scene with its very own meme coin. In a world of serious cryptocurrencies, POPCAT brings fun to the forefront. The token has no inherent value or financial expectations—it's all about entertainment. As the crypto market weaves through its cycles, coins like POPCAT offer a light-hearted alternative. Compared to other meme coins, POPCAT's roots in a beloved meme give it a unique edge. For those looking to join in on the joy without the stress of investments, POPCAT might just be the purr-fect choice. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) began as a fun homage to Dogecoin, but it's quickly becoming a standout in the crypto world. Unlike its inspiration, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB started with an eye-popping supply of one quadrillion tokens. To build trust, half of these were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His generous donation of SHIB to the India Covid Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply put SHIB in the global spotlight. What makes SHIB exciting is its potential beyond being just a memecoin. Its foundation on Ethereum allows for innovative projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade and stake tokens. There's also buzz about a future NFT platform and a community-driven governance system. In today's market, where utility and real-world applications matter, SHIB's technological ambitions set it apart from other coins. As the crypto landscape evolves, SHIB's blend of community appeal and Ethereum-based technology makes it a captivating option for enthusiasts keeping an eye on emerging trends. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency that started as a fun tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Launched on Ethereum, it's a deflationary memecoin with no real utility, embracing the pure spirit of internet memes. In April and May 2023, PEPE saw a huge surge, with its market cap reaching a high of $1.6 billion at one point. Early holders became millionaires, and it attracted a strong community of fans. This boom sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme-based coins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE aims to join the ranks of top meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It appeals to the crypto community with its no-tax policy and straightforward approach. The project's roadmap includes getting listed on major exchanges and creating a ""meme takeover."" While PEPE doesn't offer new technology or utility, its popularity shows how powerful community support and internet culture can be. In the current market, PEPE's rise reflects a trend where memes drive interest and investment. As the crypto world watches and waits for the next big movement, many are keeping an eye on PEPE and wondering if it will reach new heights. Conclusion While SPX, POPCAT, SHIB, and PEPE hold potential, XYZVerse distinguishes itself by uniting sports enthusiasts in a community-driven memecoin aiming for significant growth.

Dogecoin Rallies While Shiba Inu Reactor Whales Exodus Sparks Interest But the real jewel in the crown is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), the new altcoin transforming the gaming world. Its unique model and successful presale are gaining a lot of buzz. Crypto investors are keeping a close eye on these three tokens, but Yeti Ouro is a dark horse with massive growth potential. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Is A Rally On The Horizon Dogecoin price has been on a tear recently. And market indicators suggest that it may be setting itself up for another big rally. It comes as activity in the DOGE community grows and trading volumes leap. Dogecoin rallies have often been inspired by community backing and social media attention. Analysts now suggest that DOGE price will break its $0.40 resistance level. And with renewed interest in the rest of the crypto space, Dogecoin could surge again. Couple this rise with some positive sentiment for long-term holders. However, DOGE’s capacity to engage with mainstream media still arguably makes it a superior older meme coin. Shiba Inu Coin Price Prediction: Whale Activity Explodes Whale activity for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is once again riding a huge wave. In the last 24 hours, SHIB orders have increased by 265%, according to IntoTheBlock. This means that whale activity has increased the volume of large transactions to 375 trillion SHIB tokens. When there is whale activity, however, it often means a big move is coming to a token. Now, investors are left wondering what could be behind this latest next rush. This may be due to recent Shibarium upgrades or new happenings in the SHIB ecosystem. As SHIB struggles to reclaim old prices, those large transactions indicate growing confidence among institutional participants. If the trend is maintained, SHIB price may drop another zero and please its faithful holders. Yeti Ouro: The New Gaming Sensation Dogecoin and Shiba Inu slightly dominate the meme coin space, but Yeti Ouro promises to take things to a whole new level. Yeti Ouro pairs gaming and real utility — something fun, unlike traditional meme tokens. It drives a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game called Yeti Go, based on Unreal Engine. Here’s what investors love about Yeti Ouro: Gaming Utility: Players receive YETIO tokens by competing in PvP races and challenges. YETIO staking: Investors can stake YETIO for passive income and high APY. Deflation: There is a regular burning of a percentage of tokens, resulting in a decrease in supply. Mass Appeal: The game’s chaotic, fun-filled gameplay draws in gamers and crypto investors. Yeti Ouro is already sitting on a presale of over $1.4 million, a sign of investor confidence. Most of the previous altcoin projects storming or following the trail have ignored the monetization of super-quality gameplay and token utility. Meanwhile, the Yeti Ouro meme contest has wrapped up, with some of the participants sharing their innovative creations - https://x.com/nayansingh08/status/1871866750641532951?s=10 Why Yeti Ouro Stands Out The gaming industry is thriving, and Yeti Ouro will take advantage of this multi-billion-dollar Market. It has a solid advantage thanks to its combination of Play-to-Earn mechanics and community-driven additions. Yeti Ouro offers a physical product, unlike popular community tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its P2E model allows players to enjoy themselves while making money. These two inextricably linked purposes bring casual gamers and serious investors on board. Moreover, the presale of Yeti Ouro has proven that the Yeti Ouro can draw attention. YETIO represents one of the most promising prospects for investors searching for the next big thing, with potential 100x returns. Final Thoughts As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu storm the hubs, their competition is catching up. DOGE signals a rally, while SHIB`s whale movements indicate pricing. Yeti Ouro, however, is leveraging its gaming utility and presale hype. With the growth of the crypto market, projects like Yeti Ouro are blazing trails. Its blend of gaming, incentives, and community involvement uniquely positions it. Yeti Ouro is quickly rising and is a no-brainer for long-run investors. Keep an eye on this rising star. Yeti Ouro might just become the breakout token of 2024.

38150835,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322820,1735231027,BONK’s 1 Trillion Token Burn Coming Soon – Is a Massive $1 Surge Coming?,"In late November, the developing team behind the popular Solana-based meme coin coin BONK proposed to burn 1 trillion tokens that the community would contribute during an event named BURNmas. On Wednesday, they announced that they have surpassed that target and will now be burning a total of 1.69 trillion tokens in a move that could further propel the price of BONK to new heights. Hey BONKers, a quick BURNmas Update: During the campaign, the BONK community exceeded The Dog's (and the DAO's) expectations and REALLY showed up The final number of $BONK gathered by these incentives is over 1,690,000,000,000 All that remains now is a DAO multisig… pic.twitter.com/GtZ16u3FK7 — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 25, 2024 As a result, Bonk is one of the few meme coins that has produced gains in the past 7 days, delivering a 7% return to holders during this period. Notably, on December 20, back when the project’s founders announced that they hit the original 1 trillion milestone, the price of BONK went up by 14%. However, the token has not escape the pullback that the crypto market as a whole has experienced in the past few days as it accumulates a 30-day loss of 25.6%. Other tokens have experienced similar setbacks during this period including Dogecoin (DOGE) , which accumulates a 20.2% drop and dogwifhat (WIF), whose 30-day losses are even higher at 42.6%. Token burns consists of sending a certain number of tokens to a specific crypto wallet used to store the assets that will be permanently removed from the blockchain. A smart contract is created to automate the removal and contributors are vetted to ensure that they own the number of tokens that they have committed to send to the burn address. Once performed, these tokens no longer exist and the total supply of the asset is reduced as a result. The primary goal of token burns is to force scarcity. In theory, this should help the value of the asset increase over time if demand remains constant or rises. Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that the total supply of BONK currently stands at 92.66 trillion tokens. This means that a 1.69 trillion BONK bonfire would reduce the circulating supply by 1.8%. BONK Keeps On Dropping as the Market Adjusts to the Federal Reserve’s New Plan The BONK/USD chart shows that the price is on a clear downward path since it hit fresh all-time highs on December 20 at $0.00005029. This descending channel is formed as the asset posts a series of lower highs and lower lows along the way and typically indicate significant weakness in the demand for the token. The hawkish comments made by the Federal Reserve during their latest monetary policy meeting contributed to depress the valuation of several crypto assets. The United States’ central bank said that they are now prepared to make two interest rate cuts next year instead of the three that were initially planned. Market participants interpret this as a sign that inflation could increase once again in the next one to two quarters and that raises the odds that the Fed could even halt its easing process. Lower interest rates typically favor high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies as investors adopt a risk-on attitude and liquidity rises. Despite this temporary weakness, the meme coin sector as a whole has experienced a significant surge after Donald Trump claim victory during the November U.S. election. The price of most assets has climbed to new heights since then and BONK is no exception as it has delivered gains of 134.4% since the year started. For now, the chart indicates that the price may continue its downward trajectory in the near future unless there’s a break above the upper trend line at some point in the future. However, considering the significant gains that meme coins have seen lately, this is a much-needed pullback that gives late buyers a chance to enter the market at more advantageous prices.

Bitcoin (BTC): From Satoshi's Vision to Current Potential Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's first cryptocurrency, founded by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authorities. It operates on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger maintained by network nodes. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles and earn bitcoins as rewards.

The roadmap outlines a phased approach: Phase 1 focuses on prototype development, Phase 2 on testnet rollout, Phase 3 on mainnet launch, and subsequent phases on ecosystem growth, global adoption, and continuous innovation. These strategic plans and robust tokenomics position Lightchain AI as a promising contender in the altcoin market for 2025.

38148030,https://thecoinrise.com/south-korea-targets-north-korean-crypto-hackers-with-sanctions/,1735230356,South Korea Targets North Korean Crypto Hackers With Sanctions,"The South Korean government has taken a bold move to curb North Korea’s escalating crypto hackers activities. Earlier today, the authorities announced sanctions against 15 individuals and one entity from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). These targets have been linked to illicit cyber activities, including crypto thefts that finance Pyongyang’s regime and military ambitions. The announcement sheds light on the intricate web of North Korea’s state-backed cyber operations and their global reach. Bureau 313: The Engine of North Korea’s Crypto Hackers Bureau 313, an organization under the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Machine-Building Industry Department, is at the heart of the sanctions. This department, under UN sanctions since 2016, plays a critical role in North Korea’s weapons production, including its ballistic missile program. The individuals sanctioned have been operating under Bureau 313. Reportedly, they use their expertise to execute sophisticated cyber heists and funnel resources to support the regime’s goals. Global Footprints of North Korean Cyber Operatives North Korean IT personnel have been infiltrating companies worldwide under false identities. According to South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these operatives operate in regions such as China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. While posing as legitimate employees, they secure contracts, steal sensitive information, and execute cyberattacks. One sanctioned individual, Kim Cheol-min, reportedly infiltrated IT firms in the U.S. and Canada and funneled substantial sums of foreign currency to Pyongyang. The sanctions highlight the DPRK’s reliance on crypto thefts as a critical revenue source. North Korean hackers have been implicated in some of the largest crypto heists globally, including Japan-based DMM Bitcoin’s $308 million theft . The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed North Korean involvement in this attack, which forced the company to shut down. Recently, HyperLiquid , a popular Layer 1 blockchain, saw a massive $60 million USDC outflow that sparked concern within the crypto community. Experts alleged that North Korean hackers might be sampling the decentralized exchange for exploits. A Broader Crackdown on DPRK’s Cyber Networks South Korea’s actions follow a series of sanctions from the U.S. Treasury Department. Not long ago, the department targeted two individuals and one entity for laundering digital assets for North Korea through a front company in the UAE. These measures aim to disrupt the DPRK’s cyber operations, which have become increasingly sophisticated and lucrative. According to Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion of digital assets across 47 incidents . This staggering figure represents 61% of the total stolen globally last year, indicating a sharp rise in the scale and frequency of attacks.

XRP: A Fast and Borderless Cryptocurrency for Seamless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and accessible worldwide. XRP enables secure and irreversible transactions without a central authority. Users do not need a bank account for settlements, making it inclusive. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion units. Ripple, initially called OpenCoin Inc., received 80 billion XRP to develop the ecosystem and improve network liquidity. They placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply release. The name XRP comes from ""ripple credits,"" reflecting its goal to facilitate smooth payment transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's features may make it an attractive option. Bitcoin (BTC): From Satoshi's Vision to Current Potential Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's first cryptocurrency, founded by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authorities. It operates on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger maintained by network nodes. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles and earn bitcoins as rewards. The system is designed to be secure and resilient against fraud. With a capped supply of 21 million bitcoins and periodic ""halving"" events reducing mining rewards, Bitcoin remains scarce. The technology behind Bitcoin has potential for transforming financial systems by removing intermediaries like banks. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as both a digital currency and a store of value, reflecting its enduring role in the evolving digital economy. Dogecoin: A Plentiful Cryptocurrency Born from a Meme Dogecoin (DOGE) is a digital currency that started in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. It features the image of a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a joke, it gained significant value in 2021, rising to the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This growth was influenced by social media and figures like Elon Musk. The coin's open and abundant design reflects its roots in internet culture. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's strong community and widespread recognition may make it an attractive option for those interested in cryptocurrencies with significant social media presence. Conclusion XRP, BTC, and DOGE have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, is expected to grow 700% by presale's end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders aiming for market dominance, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Why whales are betting big on XYZverse Massive ROI Forecast: With a roadmap aiming for a 10,000X return, XYZverse has the potential to eclipse past meme coin giants like Pepe and Shiba Inu . Undervalued Opportunity: Still in presale, XYZ is flying under the radar, providing whales with an early-entry advantage before its full market breakout. Expanding Appeal: XYZverse combines the viral energy of memes with the global appeal of sports, drawing in both crypto investors and sports fans alike.

As XYZverse rolls out its ecosystem, including prediction markets and sports betting dApps, its value proposition will only strengthen, attracting more investors and increasing demand. Ethereum Ethereum stands at the forefront of blockchain creativity. Since its inception by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launch in 2015, it has transformed the digital landscape with smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The shift to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 marked a significant milestone, enhancing efficiency and sustainability. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon improve transaction speed and cost, addressing scalability issues. The upcoming sharding phase promises further advancements, reinforcing Ethereum’s commitment to decentralization. Ether (ETH) remains central, facilitating transactions, rewarding stakers, and serving as a valuable asset. In the current market, Ethereum’s advancements make it a prominent player in the blockchain industry. The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and its diverse applications underpin its strong position. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s focus on smart contracts and scalability through Layer 2 solutions gives it a unique edge. As the crypto market evolves, Ethereum’s continued innovation may influence its role in the future of decentralized finance. While market trends fluctuate, Ethereum’s technology and potential keep it at the heart of discussions about crypto’s next steps. Ethena Ethena is introducing ENA, a new kind of digital coin built on Ethereum. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, ENA aims to be a stable, crypto-native dollar that doesn’t rely on traditional banks. This means you can use ENA without worrying about the banking system. Ethena is also bringing the “Internet Bond” to the world. It’s a global savings tool in dollars, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This bond offers a way to save money and earn interest without needing a bank. In today’s market, where many seek stable and accessible financial options, ENA stands out. While other coins might be volatile, ENA focuses on stability and global reach. The idea of a stablecoin that’s not tied to traditional banks is gaining attention, especially after recent banking uncertainties. By providing both a crypto-native dollar and a global savings instrument, Ethena is positioning ENA to meet the needs of users looking for security and growth in the crypto space. PEPE PEPE is the new meme coin making waves in the crypto world. Launched on Ethereum, it’s a tribute to Pepe the Frog, the internet meme created by Matt Furie that charmed the early 2000s. PEPE aims to ride the popularity of other meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With no taxes and a simple, straightforward approach, it’s attracting attention for keeping things pure and fun as a meme coin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE’s value skyrocketed, pushing its market cap to an astonishing $1.6 billion at one point. Early adopters saw massive gains, and a strong community formed around it. Some are calling this a “meme coin season,” as other meme coins have also seen wild ups and downs. With a clear roadmap aiming for major exchange listings and a “meme takeover,” PEPE has potential. Whether it will reach new heights in the current market cycle remains to be seen, but its momentum and community support make it an interesting player to watch. Conclusion ETH, ENA, and PEPE attract whales, but XYZVerse stands out as a sports meme coin with massive growth potential and a strong community focus in the 2024 bull market.

But innovation drives the market forward, and new challengers like Remittix (RTX) are making waves. Positioned as a potential game-changer in the payment sector, could this best new crypto disrupt established players and even rival the BNB price trajectory? Let’s dive into the possibilities. The best new crypto for 2025 is Remittix ADA and BNB are established players, but Remittix (RTX) positions itself as a revolutionary force in the crypto payment sector. Dubbed the ""new XRP,"" Remittix bridges the gap between crypto and fiat systems and so enables seamless cross-border transactions in over 30 fiat currencies. Unlike traditional payment systems that rely on intermediaries, Remittix offers near-instant transfers with minimal fees. The $250 trillion cross-border payment market is ripe for disruption, and Remittix aims to capture a big part of this lucrative sector. Early investors are already reeling in profits as Remittix raises over $375,000 in just 3 days. With the RTX token priced at just $0.0156 now is an excellent time to acquire crypto’s next 80x opportunity! With the potential to solve real-world inefficiencies in international payments, Remittix stands out as more than just another crypto project, it's a tangible solution for businesses and individuals alike. Cardano’s steady growth faces new challenges Cardano (ADA) has long been praised for its technically sound blockchain and enterprise-grade use cases. Despite recent turbulence in the crypto market, Cardano remains resilient. With nearly 687 whale transactions exceeding $1 million in 24 hours and a steady increase in mid-level investors, ADA shows robust backing. Analysts even predict a rally toward $2 if it breaks through critical resistance at $1.25, supported by a bull flag pattern. Yet, challenges loom for Cardano. Criticism over governance structures within the CardanoFoundation and the slow adoption of real-world applications have dampened investor enthusiasm. Even with the promising Plomin hard fork and Charles Hoskinson’s visionary leadership, the competition in the blockchain space remains fierce. Can ADA maintain its position with projects like Remittix gaining traction? Binance Coin struggles under whale pressure Binance Coin (BNB) is no stranger to market dominance. Recent technical analysis shows the BNB price holds strong near $720 with support at $700. However, bearish sentiment creeps in as whale activity declines and futures open interest has dropped nearly 50% to $433 million. This lack of momentum could pose short-term challenges. Despite these headwinds, the technical outlook remains cautiously optimistic. Analysts point to a potential symmetrical triangle breakout that could push the BNB price to $850. That will be a gain of almost 20%. But as Binance grapples with regulatory scrutiny and an increase in competing platforms, the long term growth for BNB is very uncertain. Could Remittix surpass ADA and BNB? While Cardano and Binance Coin hold significant market positions, Remittix’s unique value proposition could redefine the landscape. ADA excels in enterprise applications, and BNB’s utility within Binance is unmatched. But, both projects face hurdles, from governance challenges to regulatory pressures. Remittix, on the other hand, offers a fresh perspective by tackling one of the most pressing issues in global finance: payment inefficiencies. As the presale continues to gain momentum, Remittix demonstrates that innovation and utility are key drivers of investor interest. For those seeking the best new crypto opportunity, RTX provides a compelling case with its focus on accessibility, affordability, and scalability.

The presale token, 1Fuel , is gearing up for an explosive run, while Cardano is struggling to return to $1. Analysts say both crypto assets may eventually become profitable crypto purchases. However, 1Fuel is expected to be the better buy. 1Fuel tipped to surge massively after public-launch Undoubtedly, 1Fuel is one of the best presale tokens to purchase now. The new coin has amazing features that will make it users’ favorite and give it high prominence in the crypto space. 1Fuel will be a DeFi token facilitating DeFi functionalities for users. The crypto coin will bring earning opportunities and incentives to all DeFi participants, regardless of experience. The 1Fuel project will be a trailblazer for a better DeFi experience and improved accessibility. The crypto solution will mitigate common concerns with accessibility, usability, security, and privacy. 1Fuel will be the go-to platform for users due to its user-centric appeal. The budding platform will help simplify complex transactions, address privacy issues, improve asset security and storage, and reduce trading fees. Furthermore, 1Fuel will enable users to manage their assets better. The wallet feature includes providing market insights, which are crucial to better portfolio performance and risk management. 1Fuel aims to be beneficial in all aspects for users, making it a project with a high possibility of blowing up. Participants in the 1Fuel ecosystem are positioned to benefit massively from the project. However, presale investors can even gain more. The 1Fuel token (OFT) is billed to do 100x, andjoining the presale early positions investors to enjoy such a high yield. 1Fuel is almost rounding up its current presale stage and may sell at a higher price in the next stage. Hence, investors searching for a potentially highly rewarding investment can consider 1Fuel, one of the best presale tokens to purchase now. Cardano bulls set to take control as ADA eyes return to $1 Cardano peaked at $1.35 in its 30-day run, its highest market price in about a year. The price surge increased the optimism surrounding the altcoin, with many believing Cardano could hit $2 before 2025. However, all hasn't gone as predicted for Cardano. The crypto coin couldn't defend its yearly high, falling drastically to its nearest support at $0.89. The current outlook shows that Cardano is gradually regaining momentum. At press time, the top altcoin tested the resistance at $0.95 before settling around $0.92. Analysts expect Cardano to maintain this $0.90+ price zone until year-end before challenging for $2+ in 2025. With the bulls looking to take over, buying the Cardano dip could be among the profitable crypto purchasesahead of the new year. Cardano is ranked 9th among cryptocurrencies with the largest market caps. The altcoin currently has a market cap of $32.28 billion and may reach $40 billion once it resumes its upward rally. Conclusion Crypto investors could see a promising 2025 with 1FUEL in their portfolios. Experts consider the new token a stronger investment than Cardano, with greater potential for significant returns. Although Cardano is expected to find its momentum soon, the market outlook suggests it can't rally as high as 1Fuel. This makes 1Fuel presale a must-join for smart investors.

Source: Coinmarketcap This surge, which reached a staggering 96.85% price increase within just one hour, has been the latest topic of discussion in the crypto community. Vitalik Buterin’s Donation Sent MOODENG Way Up: What Comes Next? According to a report earlier today, the Khao Kheow Open Zoo announced that Vitalik Buterin had officially adopted Moo Deng , a pygmy hippopotamus, as part of their Wildlife Sponsorship Program. Buterin’s generous donation of 10 million Thai Baht (approximately $292,230) will support wildlife conservation efforts, particularly those that nurture Moo Deng and her family. It will also fund the construction of a new educational center dedicated to raising awareness about pygmy hippos. The donation will be disbursed in two installments of 5 million Baht each, with the first installment processed on the day of the announcement. In his statement, Buterin expressed enthusiasm for supporting wildlife and emphasized his commitment to conservation efforts. Thanks for the warm welcome to the family and your work for wild animals!

The announcement of Buterin’s adoption led to an explosive reaction in the crypto market. MOODENG’s price surged from a daily low of $0.0001228 to its peak of $0.0002412 within just 60 minutes. Technical Analysis: How High Can MOODENG Go? The trading volume for MOODENG surged over 700% within 24 hours following the announcement. Currently, trading volumes have reached approximately $48.5 million due to the positive sentiment surrounding MOODENG. Despite some volatility, the price stabilized around $0.0002268 at writing time after its peak. However, technical indicators suggest that MOODENG may face challenges maintaining its recent gains amidst broader market pressures. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that MOODENG is currently overbought, suggesting that a correction could be imminent if buying pressure diminishes. Additionally, data from Coinglass reveals that MOODENG’s Open Interest in the derivatives market increased by 10% within the past day, surpassing $127 million.

The long/short ratio has accelerated towards parity at 0.9778. The majority of traders are bullish on it.

Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced selling pressure recently, with Bitcoin down approximately 2.19% and Ethereum down about 3.20% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $95,670. Its recent attempts failed to break through the critical resistance level at $100K.

Although Vitalik Buterin’s charitable actions and subsequent price surge have garnered attention for MOO DENG, market conditions suggest that its gains may be short-lived unless sustained investor interest and a broader market recovery support it. Analysts predict that MOO DENG’s price may dip further from its current levels before stabilizing again. The current support level for MOODENG appears to be around $0.00015.

It aims to empower the Solana community by moving power away from venture capital tokens. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK surged over 100%. It acts as a community coin, having airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest meme coin by market cap and saw a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatility of meme coins, BONK’s integration into the growing Solana ecosystem and its involvement with new decentralized apps, like BonkSwap, make it a notable coin. Its potential in the current market cycle seems significant. Conclusion In summary, while coins like BONK have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out as a meme token embodying luxury and success. Designed for those who seek the best, it follows the path of successful tokens like WIF and Popcat. DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI, blending blockchain with AI, is poised to rival Solana’s legendary rise, starting at just $0.003 in presale. Table of Contents Solana’s legacy benchmark for success What makes Lightchain AI unique? Comparing Solana and Lightchain AI Experts’ optimism for Lightchain AI’s future Solana of 2025? The rise of Lightchain AI (LCAI), a new AI-powered blockchain token priced at just $0.003 during its presale , has drawn comparisons to Solana’s (SOL) remarkable trajectory in 2021. With a focus on real-world utility and cutting-edge technology, industry experts believe Lightchain AI could replicate Solana’s meteoric rise, transforming the crypto landscape by 2025. Let’s explore what makes this coin the next big thing and why it’s being hailed as a potential game-changer. Solana’s legacy benchmark for success Solana’s path from nothing to being one of the best blockchains in the world has made a mark for altcoins looking for wide-use. Its fast deal abilities and small costs drew builders and money people too, pushing its worth from $0.22 in 2020 to more than ͏$200 in 2021. Lightchain AI shows Solana’s growth but with the extra help of smart machine join, fixing holes in use and opening paths to fields much beyond usual blockchain work cases. Also, Solana’s link with Serum (SRM), a not centralized trade place, caused a big rise in both projects’ fame. Lightchain AI has also had opportunities to work with famous trades and plans, pointing at the same path. What makes Lightchain AI unique? Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) : Unlock the power of AI in blockchain ecosystems. The AIVM lets developers seamlessly integrate AI-driven applications, making Lightchain AI a game-changer for industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) : Say goodbye to outdated consensus methods. PoI rewards nodes for performing AI computations, directly pushing the boundaries of machine learning and predictive analytics. Transparent AI framework : No more black-box AI. This framework ensures every AI decision on the platform is fully open and auditable, building trust and confidence for users and developers alike.

Comparing Solana and Lightchain AI Feature Solana (SOL) Lightchain AI (LCAI) Core Focus High-speed transactions AI-powered blockchain Consensus Mechanism Proof of History (PoH) Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Tokenomics Inflationary Deflationary Use Cases DeFi, NFTs AI-driven industries While Solana excels in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Lightchain AI’s emphasis on AI opens new avenues for innovation, making it a multi-industry solution. Experts’ optimism for Lightchain AI’s future Blockchain analysts are optimistic about Lightchain AI , highlighting its potential to tackle real-world challenges and its strong development roadmap. As one of the first platforms to fully integrate AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI is establishing itself as an early mover in industries such as predictive analytics, smart governance, and supply chain optimization. This early-mover advantage positions it for significant adoption across various sectors. Additionally, its presale price of just $0.003 presents a ground-floor opportunity for investors, reminiscent of Solana’s early days, which delivered remarkable returns for its adopters. Offering transaction speeds and scalability comparable to Solana, combined with advanced AI capabilities, Lightchain AI provides a powerful and comprehensive solution for developers and businesses alike. Solana of 2025? Solana set the standard for altcoins to follow, but Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rewriting the playbook with its integration of AI and blockchain technology. With its low presale price, features, and potential for exponential growth, Lightchain AI is a promising contender to become the next Solana in the crypto world. With the AI revolution in full swing, Lightchain AI could be the frontrunner, powering industries and disrupting traditional business models by 2025. Stay ahead of the curve and keep an eye out for this promising token on its journey to success. To learn more about Lightchain AI, visit the website , whitepaper, X , and Telegram.

38146519,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633597,1735228882,"GameStop, MicroStrategy, and Coinbase stocks among top performers today","The US stock market seems to be reviving after a period of intense sell-off, courtesy of the Federal Reserve. GameStop (GME) popped more than 4% today, extending their winning streak to four straight days. This comes after a Christmas post by retail investor icon Keith Gill “Roaring Kitty” that sent the stock soaring, continuing its wild 2024 run. The video game retailer has skyrocketed over 77% this year, making it one of the most watched stocks in the market right now. The surge has caught the attention of traders, adding even more fuel to the already hot market. Crypto-linked stocks, however, didn’t have the same luck. MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and Riot Platforms all slid as Bitcoin took a nosedive. MicroStrategy, often seen as a Bitcoin proxy, fell about 3%, while Coinbase dropped 2%, and Riot Platforms pulled back more than 2%. Bitcoin itself was down 3% as of press time. MicroStrategy doubles down on Bitcoin buys MicroStrategy just dropped another $561 million to add to its massive stash. That makes seven weeks in a row of nonstop purchases, with the latest round coming at an average price near Bitcoin’s record highs last week. They’ve even announced plans to issue more shares, all so they can load up on even more Bitcoin. Despite the dip today, Bitcoin’s 135% gain this year has completely obliterated the returns on gold and global stocks. But don’t get too comfortable. Traders are bracing for wild swings ahead, thanks to the looming expiration of massive Bitcoin and Ether derivatives contracts. The broader crypto market wasn’t spared either, with tokens like Ether, Solana, and Dogecoin down around 3%. While Bitcoin slid, stock futures followed suit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 150 points, and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%. Markets were closed on Wednesday for Christmas, but Thursday morning trading made it clear that the holiday cheer was wearing off. Santa Claus rally loses a bit of steam The Santa Claus rally, a period famous for its market optimism, is still alive—but just barely. The S&P 500 has climbed 1.8% this week, while the Nasdaq surged 2.3%, thanks to major tech players like Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet. The Dow, however, only eked out a 1% gain. For context, the S&P 500 usually averages a 1.3% return during this end-of-year stretch, dwarfing its typical weekly gain of 0.3%. Jobless claims added some tension to the holiday trading buzz. Claims for the week ending December 21 came in at 219,000, below the 225,000 estimate. But continuing claims—those applying for benefits week after week—hit 1.91 million, the highest number since November 2021. Zooming out, the S&P 500 is barely hanging onto a 0.1% gain for December. The Nasdaq has done far better, up 4.2% for the month, while the Dow is down 3.6%, on track for its worst monthly performance since April. If the Dow can hold steady, it could snap a three-week losing streak—the longest it’s had since March. The market mood in a word? Uneasy.

The analyst also mentioned what price levels Bitcoin could reach in the short term as it breaks above $100,000. Bitcoin Support Levels To Watch Out For As Bulls Push For $100,000 In a TradingView post, Trade PSH stated that the local maximum is $99,450 as bulls are repeatedly trying to push the price above $100,000. The crypto analyst also mentioned that the nearest key support zone comes in between $95,000 and $96,600. This aligns with a recent Bitcoinist report that highlighted the $96,000 level as a crucial support zone. Related Reading: Possible Deep Correction Could Push Cardano Price To $0.43, Here’s How While the Bitcoin price is moving above this support zone, Trade PSH stated that the primary scenario is continued growth for the flagship crypto. If Bitcoin maintains an uptrend and eventually breaks above the psychological $100,000 level, the crypto analyst predicts that the intermediate growth target is between $102,000 and $102,757. Based on the current price action, the analyst suggested that Bitcoin could rally to $108,366. This would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto, as its current ATH is $108,268. Meanwhile, Trade PSH mentioned that a drop below $94,300 would invalidate this trade setup. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could break above $100,000 and reach these short-term targets before the year ends. While that remains to be seen, it is worth mentioning that January 2025 provides a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Pro-crypto Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20, which could lead to the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Historically, Bitcoin also enjoyed a price recovery in January 2021 of the last bull run. As such, history could repeat itself again. BTC Is Heading Higher In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price, stating that the flagship crypto is heading higher. His accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin could rally to as high as $158,000 by May 2025. The chart also showed a price target above $220,000, suggesting that the flagship crypto could rally even higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern Says ETH Will Touch $12,000 Titan of Crypto alluded to a bullish pennant, which he suggested was still in play for the Bitcoin price. This massive bull pennant is forming in the monthly timeframe, and if it plays out, the crypto analyst is confident that Bitcoin will enjoy a parabolic rally to this price target. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $98,100, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

38146406,https://nulltx.com/?p=136799,1735228821,2024’s Top Crypto Wallet for Safety and Flexibility,"Keep Your Crypto Safe: The Most Secure Crypto Wallets of 2024! Crypto losses due to security breaches reached record levels this year, surpassing $2 billion, while hacking incidents jumped 21% compared to last year. These alarming statistics highlight the growing need for the most secure crypto wallets. But security isn’t the only factor to consider. The ideal wallet should also offer advanced features that help users stay ahead of market trends and maximize their gains. This includes cross-chain flexibility, trading tools, and options for earning passive income. This guide reviews the four most secure crypto wallets of the year: Plus Wallet, Trust Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Ledger Wallet. This in-depth look at their features and benefits will help users choose the best option for securing their assets today. 1. Plus Wallet: The Secure Wallet That Rewards Every Trade Plus Wallet stands out as one of the most secure crypto wallets, offering top-tier protection along with a variety of powerful features. By storing private keys directly on users’ devices, it ensures complete control and sole access to assets. This local storage, along with encryption, minimizes the risks associated with third-party storage. To further enhance security, Plus Wallet includes two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of protection in case a device is compromised. Beyond its strong security measures, Plus Wallet provides great flexibility. Its cross-chain support allows users to manage a variety of assets from one platform, simplifying the process. The wallet also features quick token listings, with new tokens available in just 15 minutes, giving users early access to new opportunities. Plus, users can enjoy these benefits while earning a continuous passive income, as Plus Wallet rewards users for every trade. This combination of robust security, and user-centric features makes Plus Wallet the most secure crypto wallet for those looking for safety, convenience, and earnings today. 2. Trust Wallet: A Gateway to dApps and NFTs Trust Wallet is a versatile app that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and tokens across different blockchains. It includes a dApp browser, which allows access to popular decentralized applications like Uniswap and Compound, as well as NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea. The wallet makes transferring cryptocurrencies simple and secure. However, its customer support and educational resources may be less extensive compared to other platforms, which could be a limitation for users looking for detailed guidance. Additionally, Trust Wallet’s association with Binance, a centralized exchange, may not align with the preferences of users seeking full decentralization. 3. OKX Wallet: The Multi-Chain Security Solution OKX Wallet is a non-custodial, multichain tool for managing cryptocurrencies. Available on Mac OS and Windows, it supports major blockchains, including Tron, allowing users to send, receive, and swap TRX. The wallet features Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which divides private keys into three parts, offering enhanced security by reducing the risk of key compromise. It also allows seamless swaps between non-underlying and underlying tokens. However, OKX Wallet’s fiat deposit and withdrawal options are limited, which may be a concern for users who need to frequently convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currency. 4. Ledger Wallet: The Versatile Hardware Wallet Wrapping up this list of the most secure crypto wallets of 2024 is Ledger, a reliable hardware solution. Ledger Wallet, including the Nano S Plus and Nano X models, provide a secure and versatile way to manage a variety of cryptocurrencies. The Ledger Live app simplifies asset management with an intuitive interface. Both devices are compact and portable, making it easy to manage assets securely while on the go. The Nano X model also features Bluetooth connectivity for wireless management through mobile devices. However, Ledger offers convenience and security, its devices can be relatively expensive. Additionally, it features closed-source software, which has drawn criticism from users for lacking transparency. The Final Word While each wallet has earned its place as one of the most secure crypto wallets today, its unique features cater to different user needs. OKX Wallet is ideal for users looking for a convenient desktop wallet, though it may not suit those who require fiat options. Ledger Wallet is great for those seeking hardware storage, offering a range of options at different price points. Trust Wallet and Plus Wallet stand out for users wanting multi-chain support and a wide range of asset management. However, Trust Wallet may not appeal to those prioritizing complete decentralization. Plus Wallet, on the other hand, excels for users looking for effortless passive income, as it rewards users simply for trading. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

Price Fails to Hold $2.20 Level appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid ongoing market uncertainty, XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, is poised for a notable price decline following the formation of bearish price action. Besides XRP, the overall cryptocurrency market seems to be struggling to gain momentum and is facing a significant price decline. XRP Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.153 and has experienced a price decline of over 6.8% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 7%, reflecting heightened participation from traders and investors and suggesting concerns about a potential price decline. Why is the XRP Price Falling? However, the potential reason behind XRP’s price decline is the upcoming unlock of 1 billion tokens, as reported by CoinPedia , along with the current market sentiment. Falling Open Interest Additionally, traders appear hesitant to build new positions, potentially due to significant volatility in the market. According to Coinglass data, XRP’s open interest has dropped by 31%, hinting at the liquidation of traders’ positions in the past 24 hours. Traders Long Liquidation This price decline has liquidated $6.84 million worth of XRP long positions out of a total of $7.68 million in overall liquidations, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Amid this bearish outlook, XRP has failed to hold its crucial support level of $2.20. Since the beginning of December 2024, the price has reached this level four times, each time witnessing upside momentum. However, XRP has now failed to maintain this level and appears to be falling toward the next support area. Source: Coinglass However, XRP still has a chance to mitigate the price decline. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the altcoin closes a daily candle below the $2.15 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 14%, reaching the $1.88 mark in the near future. XRP’s bearish thesis will hold only if it closes a daily candle below the $2.15 mark, otherwise, it may be invalidated.",NEGATIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-crash-incoming-price-fails-to-hold-2-20-level/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Notably, in 2025, several cryptocurrency bills could potentially be passed in the United States. Washington is expected to have the most pro-crypto Congress. In the new year, the House Financial Services Committee, which is likely to spearhead crypto legislation, will be led by Rep. French Hill of Arkansas. Hill, who currently chairs the committee’s digital asset panel and has worked on several crypto-related bills, including those focused on regulating stablecoins and the FIT21 market structure bill. “Should FIT21 and stablecoin legislation not pass during the lame duck, both bills will be a top priority for me in the 119th Congress,” Hill noted. FIT 21 Act This bill aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, defining whether they are securities or commodities. The bill has already passed the House and would grant more power to the CFTC for overseeing crypto markets, particularly for digital commodities like Bitcoin. However, the passage of the proposal in the Senate is uncertain, although there is significant bipartisan interest, as highlighted in recent discussions. It’s not clear where FIT21 could go next as the SEC and CFTC will be different in the coming year as Trump has chosen Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, who has shown a friendly approach to crypto. There could also be room for some changes in FIT21 on how decentralization is defined. Stablecoin Legislation Discussions around stablecoin regulation have been ongoing, with bills like the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act being considered. There’s a focus on providing regulatory clarity and consumer protections for stablecoins, which could potentially be included in broader financial legislation or passed as standalone bills. This would involve setting criteria for issuers and ensuring stablecoins are backed appropriately. Digital Asset Market Infrastructure Bill This legislation would deal with aspects like custody and the integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. There’s talk of this bill potentially passing in early 2025, suggesting a push towards infrastructure that supports crypto in financial services. General Regulatory Clarity There’s an overarching push for regulatory clarity in the crypto space, with lawmakers like Rep. French Hill prioritizing digital asset legislation in the new Congress. This could lead to a variety of bills aimed at addressing different aspects of crypto, from taxation to AML/KYC requirements, shaping the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The idea of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction at both federal and state levels. Trump had pledged to establish such a reserve, while Senator Cynthia Lummis has drafted a bill for the U.S. Treasury to buy one million bitcoins over five years. However, Lummis’ bill might face challenges, as it lacks bipartisan support and a Senate companion. Another factor that could affect crypto legislation is Warren’s new spot as the ranking Democrat of the influential Senate Banking Committee. The Prospects Of Crypto-Related Bills With Congress facing multiple competing priorities in the coming year, including major tax and border-related legislation, there will be fierce competition for legislative time.

38146293,https://crypto.news/?p=14322423,1735228600,"Ethena price reverses as whales dump, exchange balances rise","Ethena price retreated for three consecutive days as exchange balances continued rising and as whales sold their tokens. Ethena ( ENA ) token dropped to $0.95, moving below the psychologically important level of $1 for the first time since Dec. 20. The ongoing crash is caused by the risk-off sentiment in the crypto industry, which has caused Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other prices to be lower. It also happened as on-chain data showed that whales were selling their tokens. The biggest transaction occurred when a whale sent 11.6 million ENA tokens worth $11 million to Binance, the biggest crypto exchange. In another transaction, one trader moved ENA tokens valued at $10.7 million to the Binance. Ethena whales dumped tokens worth $30 million on Thursday, Dec. 26. These sales happened a week after Arthur Hayes, Bitmex founder and earlier investor, sold some of his ENA tokens . According to Nansen, Hayes now owns 18,616 coins valued at $17,458. Ethena price also fell as tokens on exchanges continued rising, a popular bearish view. These tokens increased by 5.82% in the last seven days to over 730.27 million. Total supply on exchanges moved to 4.87%, up by 0.27% a week ago. Ethena exchange balances | Source: Nansen Meanwhile, inflows into Ethena’s USDe stablecoin have stalled. The coin has a market cap of $6 billion , where it has been in the past few days, a sign of sluggish demand. Ethena USDe stablecoin | Source: DeFi Llama Ethena price analysis ENA price chart | Source: crypto.news Technicals suggest that Ethena may have more downward to go as it has formed a head and shoulders pattern on the four-hour chart. This pattern comprises a neckline, which is at $0.8552, two shoulders, and a head. In most periods, the pattern leads to a strong downward momentum when it moves below the neckline. Ethena has also moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level and slipped below the 50-period moving average. It also fell below the strong pivot reverse level of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling, with the immediate target being the H&S’s neckline at $0.8552. A drop below that level will point to more downside, potentially to the extremely oversold level of $0.5860.

38146208,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376270,1735228527,Tron (TRX) Price Heatmap: Is a Local Bottom on the Horizon?,"Post-Christmas, the cryptocurrency market turned red, with most assets suffering heavy losses. Tron (TRX) is not immune to the downturn. Earlier this month, the asset reached a new peak and reclaimed the 10th spot by market cap, which sparked a renewed sense of hope in the community. But the latest pullback extended its losses. As a result, TRX is down by over 43% from its recently established all-time high of $0.43 to the current price level of $0.25. However, data points to the formation of a local bottom soon. TRX Nearing a Turning Point? CryptoQuant’s analysis of TRX’s price heatmap revealed that the green trend, represented by the one-year moving average plus two sigma, could serve as a crucial support level during the current market correction. Historically, this green trend has acted as a strong foundation during bull rallies, and it is anticipated to provide similar support, potentially marking a local bottom for TRX’s price. TRX Chart. Source: CryptoQuant The current levels for the green, purple, and blue trends are $0.23, $0.40, and $0.49, respectively. These levels are dynamic and will likely adjust upward with increased interest and demand. As the market heats up, attention should be given to the purple and blue trends, which may act as resistance zones. If TRX price stays above the green trend, it could signal the start of a new upward trend. On the other hand, CryptoQuant warned that a drop below the green trend might indicate a weakening bull cycle. As demand strengthens, Tron’s price could target the purple and blue trend levels, with a breakthrough above the 0.40 level offering strong market confidence. What’s Next For Tron? Earlier this month, TRX’s rally was driven by speculations about Grayscale listing and Tron founder Justin Sun’s initiatives, including a $30 million purchase of WLFI tokens tied to Trum’s project and his advisory role. Sun’s involvement with the artwork “ Comedian ” has also engaged the community, igniting ripple effects for tokens like BAN and related projects. Despite the latest setback to the rally, experts point to a moderately favorable year ahead for the asset. CoinCodex, for one, predicted that TRX could see a modest 2.93% price increase to $0.264 by January 24, 2025. The sentiment remains neutral, while the Fear & Greed Index reflects high optimism at 73 (Greed). TRX has demonstrated 50% green days and 17.17% volatility over the past month, thereby indicating active market participation. Analysts view this as a good buying opportunity, with expectations of a short-term peak of $0.268 on December 30, 2024.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance emerges as the ultimate altcoin opportunity, blending real-world utility with explosive growth, outshining even Ethereum’s bullish future. Table of Contents Ethereum: Bullish outlook vs. dropping fees Rexas Finance: How to transform blockchain investment Conclusion: Rexas finance has a bright future Despite Ethereum still being very much a powerhouse with bullish projections of $8,000 to $10,000 in the next cycle, Rexas Finance is becoming the next big altcoin opportunity. Rexas Finance is already surging with presale success of over $31.5 million and a token price from $0.03 to $0.15, a 400% rise in the last few months. According to analysts, it can convert $450 into $45,000 in sixty days and should be ideal for investors. Rexas Finance is poised to be the perfect choice with insane growth and a bunch of practical blockchain applications, all tied into one place. Ethereum: Bullish outlook vs. dropping fees With a ‘buy the dip’ strategy and long-term growth in mind, Crypto Patel predicts $ETH will go to $8,000-$10,000. Looking at his chart, we can see that it shows key resistance levels as well like the uptrend price channel and the fact that it is in a bullish trajectory despite the current dips in the market. Patel’s analysis carries a more bullish bent and shows optimism for Ethereum to achieve a new all-time high and patience and accumulation during downturns. On the flip side, IntoTheBlock points to an 80% plummet in Ethereum fees (ETH terms) over the past three years, reducing daily ETH burn. And the data reveals a fall from more than 150,000 ETH burned daily in early 2022 to much lower levels by 2024. As a result, Ethereum has been experiencing a decline as a consequence of reduced on-chain activity or enhanced scalability, and this overrode the deflationary dynamics of EIP 1559. Although the price is bullish, so is the market optimism, but the drop in fees and ETH burnt may cast a shadow on Ethereum’s deflationary mechanism strength. Ethereum’s development will therefore be critical in determining the future trajectory of the network, balancing scalability improvements with on-chain activity and market sentiment. Rexas Finance: How to transform blockchain investment With smart tokenization of assets, Rexas Finance is breaking the crypto market, and its presale performance has caught investors’ eyes. The platform aims to democratize real-world assets, like real estate, commodities, and fine art, by simplifying blockchain complexities. The early success of the token in the presale stages is evidence of a good number of investors who are confident and ready to invest in the deflationary market. Moving from S1 at $0.03 to S10 at $0.15, we have seen amazing 400% growth at Tokenizer.com over the course of three months. The project is one of the most anticipated launches for 2024, with 369 million tokens sold and $31.5 million raised. Tokenomics: A sustainable path to growth Rexas Finance has structured tokenomics that will set the platform up for sustainable growth and an ecosystem stable. The total supply: One billion tokens; a fair, thoroughly thought out token allocation to support community development, liquidity, and innovation. 42.5% early adopters can buy tokens at a discounted rate through presale sessions. 22.5% is for staking in the network, allowing investors to utilize the crypto as a stake and earn passive income, but also securing the network. Liquidity: 15%, treasury: 10%, marketing and operations: 3% each, charity and Partnerships: 2% each. The market appeal is driven by smart features Rexas Finance has a suite of utility-driven features that solve real-life problems and, at the same time, attempt to increase the adoption of the blockchain. Rexas Estate enables fractional ownership of tokenized properties, enabling greater access to the investment of real estate. With Rexas Token Builder , businesses and individuals can easily create and weigh up blockchain-based solutions, simplifying token creation. Rexas Launchpad for crypto startups is providing funding, connecting crypto startups with investors. Rexas GenAI NFT creators use it to help them design new digital assets and make blockchain to appeal to the creative industries.

Conclusion: Rexas finance has a bright future Having shone during its presale and delivered smart features and sustainable tokenomics, Rexas Finance is set for rapid expansion in the ensuing years.

What Will Be the Status of the Cases?,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could see significant changes to its approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry as its leadership undergoes a transition, according to comments from current commissioners. The SEC will operate with a reduced team of commissioners starting next year as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler steps down from his position and the agency awaits Senate confirmation of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees. Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda will be the only remaining members during the transition. “We have a big package of materials,” Peirce said. “We have always looked to enforcement as our preferred tool in this area. I think when there are new commission changes and the composition of the commission changes, the composition of the cases may change.” Uyeda noted that transparency and public input are important in shaping SEC policies. Uyeda highlighted the importance of the Administrative Procedure Act in ensuring accountability through public comments on regulations. Related News: The Central Bank of South Korea issued a statement on Cryptocurrencies: A Positive Development “It is our responsibility to the American people to provide this transparency,” Uyeda said. Uyeda also cited concerns about guidance issued by SEC staff without public consultation, citing controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The policy, which required digital asset custodians to report liabilities and corresponding assets on their balance sheets, was overturned by both houses of Congress before being vetoed by President Biden. “It’s hard to engineer change because we’ve come a long way,” Peirce said. “It’s going to take a lot of work from you and us to get back on track, but I think we can do it.” The impending leadership changes could signal a shift away from the SEC’s enforcement-heavy approach to crypto regulation. *This is not investment advice.

Whales actively use methods like CoinJoin to discreetly accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin. CryptoQuant's Ki Young Ju highlighted this trend in a tweet. According to the update, the annual average number of CoinJoin transactions has tripled since 2022.Massive Spike in Bitcoin CoinJoin TransactionsCoinJoin transactions are a method to enhance anonymity by mixing multiple Bitcoin transactions. They have become a preferred tool for large-scale investors, as evidenced by the fact that CoinJoin transactions under 5K were the norm as of December 2022.However, by December 2023, CoinJoin transactions surged to nearly 40K. The trend continued into 2024, with the average number of transactions remaining around 20K. This development suggests a growing priority on privacy as institutional and individual investors move large amounts of BTC. Chart of Bitcoin CoinJoin Transactions Whales Accumulating BTC DiscreetlyThe spike in privacy transactions coincides with significant whale activity in 2024. Specifically, Young Ju highlighted that 1.55 million BTC flowed into accumulation addresses this year. These addresses are primarily associated with entities such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), firms like MicroStrategy, and custodial wallets.Indeed, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over 1.1 million BTC since January, exceeding the holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto. At the same time, MicroStrategy has significantly increased its holdings, now owning over 444,000 BTC.While some of this accumulation is driven by institutional players, a substantial portion remains in the hands of unidentified whales. Specifically, Ju noted that entities have moved between 240,000 and 420,000 BTC have been to unknown entities.This has sparked speculation about the identity and intentions of these entities. Nonetheless, this trend confirms the rising adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors, seeking ways to move funds without drawing attention.However, not all privacy transactions are above board. Some analysts believe the rise in CoinJoin activity may be due to hackers laundering stolen funds.Meanwhile, Ju cited Chainalysis reports revealing total hacking-related losses of $2.2 billion in 2024. This figure represents just 0.5% of Bitcoin's $377 billion in realized market cap inflows.Ultimately, the surge in privacy transactions highlights how whales and institutions are increasingly prioritizing discretion, whether for strategic purposes or to navigate regulatory scrutiny.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/26/420000-btc-remain-unaccounted-for-as-whales-use-privacy-transactions-to-accumulate-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=420000-btc-remain-unaccounted-for-as-whales-use-privacy-transactions-to-accumulate-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This is following its successful BURNmas campaign. The community-driven initiative, marking Bonk’s second anniversary, exceeded initial expectations despite recent price volatility. While BONK’s price has declined 7.5% in the past 24 hours and 25% over the last month, the upcoming burn represents a milestone in the project’s tokenomics management. BURNmas campaign exceeds community expectations The BURNmas initiative marks a change from Bonk’s 2023 BONKmas campaign. The focus shifted from token distribution to ecosystem engagement and supply reduction. Initially planned to burn up to 1 trillion tokens, the campaign’s success prompted an expansion of its scope. Community participation surged during the final week after incentives were increased 100-fold, leading to the collection of over 1.69 trillion BONK tokens for burning. Hey BONKers, a quick BURNmas Update: During the campaign, the BONK community exceeded The Dog's (and the DAO's) expectations and REALLY showed up❗️❗️❗️ The final number of $BONK gathered by these incentives is over 1,690,000,000,000🔥 All that remains now is a DAO multisig… pic.twitter.com/GtZ16u3FK7 — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 25, 2024 The campaign encountered several technical challenges during its execution, particularly with data reporting systems. Issues arose with LiveBonk data tracking and Saturnbot integration, causing fluctuations in reported burn amounts. These technical hurdles, discovered on Christmas Eve, led the team to implement a temporary display cap of “1.69T+” while resolving the final calculations. The magnitude of community participation exceeded the original proposal submitted to BonkDAO, which was designed to celebrate the project’s second anniversary. This overwhelming response has prompted the team to submit an updated proposal to the BONKDAO council. This aims to honor both the original commitment and the community’s participation by burning the entire 1.69 trillion tokens collected. BONK price down 25% in 30 days The BONK team has emphasized that reducing supply overhang through burns should be considered alongside broader ecosystem growth initiatives. This balanced approach aims to create sustainable value for token holders. Despite recent price volatility, with BONK experiencing a 25% decline over the past month, the team has acknowledged the need for technical improvements in future events, particularly in reporting systems and community transparency. Looking ahead, the BONK ecosystem appears focused on diversification beyond token burns. The team has shared plans to support projects building on top of BONK, creating additional utility and value streams. This approach combines supply reduction through burns with ecosystem expansion through development plans. The project’s governance structure, centered around BonkDAO, plays a crucial role in decision-making. The project requires a multisig vote to give the green light for the burn to happen.

KULR, a U.S.-based company which specializes in thermal management solutions mainly for electronic components and batteries, has acquired 217.18 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for nearly $21 million as part of the company’s Bitcoin Treasury strategy. In a Thursday press release on Dec. 26, the San Diego-headquartered company said Bitcoins were purchased at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. Amid the news, KULR’s shares rose 3.51% on pre-market, per data from Nasdaq. The purchase follows the company’s earlier announcement of its Bitcoin Treasury strategy, in which it announced allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash to Bitcoin. KULR says the $21 million purchase is the first of ongoing purchases it intends to make going forward. KULR picked Coinbase’s Prime platform to provide custody, USDC, and self-custodial wallet services for its BTC, according to the press release.

KULR’s Bitcoin purchase comes amid a broader trend of companies embracing cryptocurrency as part of their financial strategies. Artificial intelligence firm Genius Group recently also announced $4 million in BTC purchases, raising its holdings to 153 BTC as part of its “Bitcoin-first” strategy to allocate 90% or more of its reserves to the cryptocurrency.

38145297,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633566,1735226277,Beverly Hills man faces 6 counts of crypto scams involving over $22 million,"A Beverly Hills man is facing six counts of cryptocurrency crimes, which resulted in investors losing over $22 million worth of cryptocurrency. The 23-year-old Gabriel Hay allegedly connived with another fellow – Gavin Mayo of Thousand Oaks, also 23 years of age, to perpetrate a scheme that defrauded investors of their monies. This represents one of the many cases where cryptocurrency and other digital assets are used to perpetrate crime. The duo committed several digital asset crimes According to the Beverly Press , the duo faces one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of stalking. Following investigations, authorities in Beverly Hills revealed that the duo tricked investors by using a series of digital asset project “rug pulls.” “Rugpulls” is reportedly a fraud scheme in which the perpetrators create a non-fungible token (NFT) or other digital assets and ask investors to invest in it before abruptly abandoning the project. US Attorney Martin Estrada said this trend was inevitable, but also vowed his office and other law enforcers would intensify efforts to protect the unsuspecting consumers as well as punish the perpetrators of crypto fraud. “Whenever a new investment trend occurs, scammers are sure to follow.” Estrada. These criminal activities also surface spurred by new technologies that enable digital asset criminals to flourish in defrauding unsuspecting consumers. According to principal deputy attorney general Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Hay and Mayo fleeced investors in digital asset projects “of tens of millions of dollars.” The duo also allegedly threatened one individual for attempting to expose them to their fraudulent schemes. “Fraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors’ hard-earned money. The department is committed to protecting investors and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to root out fraud involving cryptocurrency and other digital assets and bring offenders to justice,” explained Argentieri. The Beverly Hills man and his colleague each face up to 20 years in jail According to authorities, Hay and Mayo each face up to 20 years in jail on conspiracy and wire fraud counts. They also face a maximum of five years each on the stalking count. It is alleged that between May 2021 and May 2024, the duo sponsored several NFT and other digital asset projects and made false statements regarding the projects. The court documents show that Hay and Mayo also provided false and misleading “roadmaps” that detailed all the plans for the NFTs after their launch, which they had never intended to accomplish. In one instance, the indictment alleges that the duo made false claims while promoting the Vault of Gems NFT project, which they said was the “first NFT project pegged to a hard asset.” Hay and Mayo then abandoned the Vault of Gems and other projects they had presented, as opposed to pursuing them. They had collected millions of dollars from investors. According to the court papers, Hay, Mayo, and others allegedly used the tactics with other digital asset projects, including Vault of Gems, Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Faceless, Dirty Dogs, Uncovered, MoonPortal, Squiggles and Roost Coin. It is also alleged that Hay and Mayo used several methods to cover up their involvement in the fraudulent projects. However, a project manager on the Faceless NFT project exposed the duo of their involvement. Hay and Mayo then started harassing the project manager and his parents, sending them intimidating messages. “Using NFTs to commit fraud not only exploits emerging technology but also erodes trust in the broader digital ecosystem.” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Michael McCarthy. He added that while Hay and Mayo’s criminal activities might not involve violence, they reflect the profound harm these schemes caused to the investors who were defrauded of millions of dollars. Hay and Mayo’s case is not unique, as there has been an increase in cryptocurrency scams and other cybercrimes worldwide. Russia is reportedly one of the biggest victims of cybercrimes and suffered over 40 million data breaches during the first quarter of 2022 alone. In Oceania, Australia is the biggest victim, while Nigeria is at the top of cybercrimes in Africa, according to studies. According to AAG , it is estimated that the average cost of a cyber breach was about $4,35 million in 2022 and predicted the global economy will incur about $10.5 trillion due to cybercrime costs compared to $7 trillion in 2022. Reports also show that criminals increasingly target cryptocurrencies and other digital assets when executing cybercrimes. Earlier this year, the US government sanctioned two crypto exchanges – Cryptex and PM2BTC- for allegedly facilitating the laundering of cryptocurrencies obtained through cybercrime.

Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin Presale Offering 50% Off and Great ROI,"Meme coins have become a cultural phenomenon in the crypto space over the past few years. What started as playful jabs at the seriousness of traditional finance has morphed into a lucrative playground for investors. From the meteoric rise of Dogecoin to the quirky antics of Shiba Inu, it’s clear that these coins resonate with a broad audience. But if you missed the boat on “Cat in a Dog’s World,” don’t sweat it! BTFD Coin is here, and it’s making waves with an incredible presale offer. BTFD Coin is not just another cute mascot; it’s primed to elevate the meme coin landscape with its engaging Play 2 Earn (P2E) game , a robust referral program, and an impressive 90% annual percentage yield (APY) on staking. This isn’t just hype—there’s real potential here. Much like savvy investors who took advantage during the 1973 economic downturn, now’s your chance to jump in while the getting’s good. With a limited-time festive discount of 50% off using the bonus code BIG50, you’ll want to pay attention! If you feel like you missed out on the Cat in a Dog’s World excitement, now’s the time to get involved with BTFD Coin. This presale is heating up, and analysts are buzzing about its potential. Let’s dig into what makes BTFD Coin a compelling opportunity for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star BTFD Coin is currently in its 12th presale stage and has already raked in over $4.5 million. That’s right! It hit the $1 million mark in under 10 days and reached $2.5 million in just 14 days since launching. Starting at a mere $0.000004, the price has jumped to $0.000064 after a generous 50% discount. With over 59 billion coins sold and more than 6,600 holders—affectionately called “Bulls”—BTFD Coin is making its mark in the crypto world. One of the standout features of BTFD Coin is its Play 2 Earn game , which went live during the 10th stage of the presale. While the beta version is currently available, rewards will kick in once the full version launches. Imagine earning while you play—how cool is that? This game not only adds a layer of fun but also keeps the community engaged and excited about what’s coming next. Staking is another major draw. With an unbelievable 90% APY since staking launched on December 2, investors can watch their earnings grow just by holding onto their coins. It’s a fantastic way to make your investment work harder for you while being part of a lively community. Let’s not forget the referral program, which allows Bulls to earn rewards by bringing their friends into the fold. It creates a sense of camaraderie that enhances the overall experience, making it not just about profits but about building something together. So why is BTFD Coin capturing so much attention in this ongoing viral meme coin presale? It combines engaging gameplay, impressive staking rewards, and a strong community focus. This isn’t just an investment; it’s a movement, and you don’t want to miss out! Cat in a Dog’s World: The Previous Sensation “Cat in a Dog’s World” made quite an impression when it launched, attracting a ton of attention with its unique branding and community-driven initiatives. With a fun theme and a strong social media presence, it quickly gained traction. Investors flocked to it, hoping to ride the wave of excitement. The community aspect was huge. People shared memes, engaged in discussions, and built a loyal following around the coin. Many investors enjoyed significant returns, capitalizing on the buzz that surrounded it. But here’s the kicker: like many meme coins, that initial excitement can fade fast. The volatility in the crypto market means that what goes up can come down just as quickly. Investors are left wondering if they made the right choice or if they missed the next big thing. In contrast, BTFD Coin offers a refreshing take on the meme coin craze. With its robust features and strong community backing, it’s positioned for sustainable growth that “Cat in a Dog’s World” might struggle to maintain. As the landscape evolves, BTFD Coin is proving to be a more stable and engaging option for those looking to enter the meme coin market. So why does BTFD Coin stand out from the crowd? While “Cat in a Dog’s World” had its moment, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is gearing up to be the next big player in this ongoing viral meme coin presale. What’s The Importance of Buying the Dip Let’s take a moment to discuss why buying the dip is such a smart move. Remember the 1973 economic disaster? A lot of sharp investors seized the opportunity to pick up undervalued assets, setting themselves up for future gains. The same principle applies today, especially in the unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency. When the market dips, it’s like a clearance sale for savvy investors. You can snag quality assets at a lower price, and when the market rebounds, you’ll be in a great position. BTFD Coin is currently in its presale phase, making this an ideal time to get involved before the price potentially skyrockets. Analysts are predicting that once the presale wraps up and BTFD Coin hits the market at $0.0006, those who bought in during this ongoing viral meme coin presale could see significant returns. It’s a classic case of being smart with your investments, just like those who capitalized during the economic downturn of the 70s. How to Buy BTFD Coin Ready to dive in? Here’s how to snag your BTFD coins: Go to the [presale page]. Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and choose your wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet).

Time to Catch the Next Big Wave with BTFD Coin’s 50% Off,"Everyone remembers Pepe Coin’s meteoric rise and crazy hype: A meme coin that started as a joke and became one of the most talked-about tokens of 2023. For many, missing out on Pepe Coin’s ICO is a reminder of what could have been—a tiny investment that could’ve turned into a small fortune. Launched at $0.000000001 per token, Pepe Coin quickly became a favourite among crypto enthusiasts, and before long, it surged in value, making early investors look like absolute legends. But here’s the thing: if you missed Pepe Coin’s ICO, you’re not alone. The good news? BTFD Coin is here, and it’s giving you another shot at grabbing that low-entry, high-return opportunity. With over $4.5 million raised in its presale and more than 59 billion coins sold already, BTFD Coin is rapidly growing in popularity . Better, you can buy in at a massive 50% discount using the BIG50 code at this moment and right up until Jan 5th. It’s like buying Pepe Coin at its ICO price all over again, but this time, you’re ahead of the game. Pepe Coin ICO: The Meme Coin That Took Off Back in 2023, Pepe Coin came out to take the market by storm. Initially priced at $0.000000001 per token, it quickly gained traction among meme coin fans and made its way into the spotlight. What followed was a meteoric rise—by the end of the year, Pepe Coin was trading in the hundreds of millions in market cap, and those who bought early were sitting on huge gains. Just like the story of Dogecoin, Pepe Coin became a viral sensation, supported by memes, pop culture references, and a devoted online community. The Pepe Coin ICO saw investors snapping up billions of tokens at next-to-nothing prices, but now the coin’s value is significantly higher. Unfortunately, if you missed that train, you may have been left wondering what you could have done differently. It’s tough, but here’s where BTFD Coin steps in. The beauty of BTFD Coin is that it’s still in presale, and this is your chance to buy in before the token launches at a price that’s already gained serious momentum.

It’s got staking rewards with an impressive APY of 90%, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s bound to generate engagement, and a roadmap that’s set to push BTFD Coin’s value to new heights. But what really sets it apart is the 50% discount available with the BIG50 code . Now, let’s take a moment to connect the dots.

Now, if the coin hits its predicted value of $0.0006 post-launch, your investment could grow to a whopping $4,687.50—that’s almost a 9x return on your investment.

One ADA token is now worth $1.06 . This is 20% below its highest price this year. This is coming after a huge pump last month. But with Bitcoin dipping below $100,000, ADA and other altcoins lost value, too. The token fell to $0.91 on December 9. The Cardano token has slightly recovered from this steep dip.

Shiba Inu’s SHIB Is Set Fpr New High Despite Current Dip Shiba Inu’s SHIB has remained below $0.00003 for most of December.

Similarly, another analyst at Investinghaven shared a chart on X, suggesting that Shiba Inu’s SHIB price will reach $0.00008 in 2025. The analyst also stated that Shiba Inu’s price action will need to break out of its current triangle pattern to begin the massive uptrend.

Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-fuks-santa-muskfsan-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-bonk-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

As per its official press release , the purchase was made for approximately $21 million, at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. KULR Makes The First Move Towards Treasury Strategy This purchase follows its December 4th announcement of a Bitcoin Treasury strategy, in which KULR announced allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash to BTC. The $21 million BTC purchased is the first of ongoing purchases the Company intends to make going forward. Notably, KULR has chosen Coinbase Prime to provide custody, USDC, and self-custodial wallet services for its BTC holdings. KULR specializes in energy storage for industries such as space, aerospace, and the defense sector. Its expertise in battery design, testing, and production positions it as a key innovator in the energy sector. By embracing Bitcoin, KULR is showing its interest in technological and financial strategies. KULR Joins List of Companies Adopting Bitcoin KULR joins a growing list of companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy. This includes MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. This huge purchase has led to waves of discussions across the broader industry as the crypto market currently faces volatility with the purchase making a bullish path for the crypto’s future movements. BTC is currently trading at $95,285, down over 3% in the past 24 hours. A veteran trader Peter Brandt has maintained a bullish outlook for BTC despite the recent market turbulence. He noted that the crypto is likely to hit $108,358 in the coming days, solidifying investor optimism over the asset’s future movements. Also, on December 19, KULR Technology Group regained compliance with NYSE American’s stockholder equity norms.

Particularly, Solana has experienced a consistent influx of capital since September 2023, reaching a peak of $776 million in daily inflows this year, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode . Solana Sees Capital Influx Despite ETF AbsenceThis growing liquidity has contributed to Solana's impressive price appreciation, with the crypto asset rising over 2,143% from its November 2022 low of $9.64, a price point it revisited on the back of the contagion from the FTX implosion. Solana Capital Influx | Glassnode Despite the absence of Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs), SOL has managed to attract substantial investment. In contrast, Bitcoin and Ethereum have benefited from the introduction of spot ETFs, which have triggered greater institutional investment and contributed to their market growth. For instance, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year led to impressive capital inflows, with investors injecting $36 billion into these funds, accumulating assets of about $110 billion. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been hesitant to approve spot Solana ETF applications. The Crypto Basic confirmed that the SEC plans to reject filings from multiple asset managers seeking to launch such products. Notably, this stance is possibly due to regulatory uncertainties and concerns over investor protection. Despite facing regulatory hurdles, Solana has shown impressive growth and resilience. Since its November 2022 cycle low, the cryptocurrency has outpaced Bitcoin and Ethereum in price gains. According to Glassnode's data, Solana outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum in price movements on 344 of 727 days following the FTX collapse . SOL BTC and ETH Price Performance | Glassnode SOL Has Room for GrowthAlso, the capital inflows have driven a substantial rise in Solana's Realized Cap, which reflects the total value of coins in circulation based on their most recent transaction prices. From January 2023 onward, Solana's Realized Cap grew from $22 billion to an impressive $77 billion, representing a remarkable $55 billion increase in liquidity. Solana Realized Cap by Age | Glassnode Meanwhile, investor activity analysis shows that both short-term and long-term holders have contributed to profit-taking during this period. Coins held for periods ranging from one day to one week, one week to one month, and six months to one year have been contributors to sell-side pressure, each accounting for a substantial portion of realized profits. Nonetheless, this balanced distribution suggests that Solana appeals to a diverse investor profile.Although profit-taking has occurred, Glassnode's analysis shows that investors have yet to reach the unrealized profitability levels the market typically observes before long-term market peaks. This indicates that Solana's value may have room to grow further in the ongoing market cycle.Solana currently trades for $187.83, down 4.84% today after an impressive three-day performance that culminated in a run above $201 on Christmas Day.

38147301,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322847,1735225692,Crypto Scams Drive French Financial Fraud Losses to €500M Annually: AMF,"France is facing a surge in financial scams, with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) reporting that crypto-related fraud is a key driver behind the estimated €500 million in annual losses suffered by victims of financial fraud. French authorities are intensifying their efforts to combat these scams in collaboration with the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR), and the Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes (DGCCRF). Despite a decline in reported complaints, the AMF notes that the overall scale of the fraud remains substantial. However, the rise in scams driven by social media, influencers, and identity theft remains a significant concern, particularly as fraudsters employ deepfake videos, fake press articles, and impersonate government bodies to deceive the public. French Scammers Stole €500M In Crypto Scam: What Else Did The AMF Discover? Financial scams in France have expanded beyond traditional fraudulent schemes, with an increasing focus on crypto-asset investments. The Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office estimates that €500 million is lost annually to such scams. Crypto-related fraud has surged since the second half of 2023, which contributed significantly to these losses. The AMF reports that the average victim of financial scams lost €29,000 by November 2024, with false savings accounts leading to even higher average losses of €69,000. A September 2024 survey by BVA Xsight conducted for the AMF revealed that 3.2% of French adults have fallen victim to financial investment scams, a threefold increase from 2021. The data indicates that men under 35 are particularly vulnerable. They are driven by a desire for quick wealth and misplaced confidence in their investment knowledge. Scammers exploit this demographic by using social media platforms and promising unrealistic returns. One alarming trend is the increase in identity theft scams. Fraudsters impersonate legitimate financial institutions, the AMF, and even government authorities. Sometimes, they employ AI-generated deepfake videos and fake news articles featuring celebrities endorsing fraudulent crypto platforms. Scammers have also developed sophisticated methods to pressure victims, including fake advisors who claim to protect against fraud but instead facilitate unauthorized transactions. The phenomenon of “square fraud”—where victims of initial scams are targeted again by fraudsters posing as public officials offering to recover their lost funds—has also become prevalent. Victims are asked to pay additional fees under the guise of legal or administrative charges, compounding their losses. Regulatory Response and Public Awareness Initiatives French authorities have responded aggressively to curb the rise in financial scams. Since January 2022, the AMF and ACPR have blacklisted nearly 5,000 unauthorized investment platforms and market participants. Additionally, they have worked to block access to 350 fraudulent websites. Law enforcement efforts have yielded significant results. Section J2 of the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office has seized over €645 million in criminal assets since 2020, including €268 million in 2024 alone. Public awareness campaigns are crucial to the AMF’s strategy to prevent scams. In 2024, the AMF and DGCCRF launched several initiatives targeting young investors through social media. Furthermore, regulatory bodies are increasingly targeting influencers who promote unauthorized investment platforms. The DGCCRF inspected 30 operators in 2024 and issued cease-and-desist orders to 10 influencers promoting fraudulent services. Eight complied immediately, while legal proceedings continued against the remaining two. The AMF advises the public to remain vigilant and avoid offers that appear “too good to be true.” Full recommendations below: Source: AMF Website Notably, Bybit was also added to the banned exchanges list in May.

However, Saylor admitted in a recent interview that he was wrong about ETH. Saylor, a Bitcoin bull, has previously argued that Ethereum is an unregistered security and said he believes a spot ETH ETF will never be approved. However, in a recent interview with the Altcoin Daily YouTube channel, Saylor admitted that he was wrong about Ethereum. Saylor stated that his views on Ethereum changed in the second quarter of 2024, and that the turning point came when former President Donald Trump began to support the crypto community. There Are Two Scenarios for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cryptocurrencies! Saylor predicted two possible futures for cryptocurrencies, predicting that in the first scenario, Bitcoin could remain the only digital asset recognized as a commodity, while Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies could remain in a gray area with unclear regulations. Saylor stated that in the second scenario, which seems more likely, the “war on crypto” will end, and that this scenario will provide a clear definition of cryptocurrencies and the sector will have a clearer regulatory environment. At this point, Saylor stated that the future of Bitcoin and Ethereum is bright, and said: “Bitcoin is already poised for significant growth and explosion. As for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, they will likely experience a new era with the emergence of a clear regulatory structure, which has been described as a crypto renaissance.” *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The crypto world is abuzz with Rexas Finance, a rising star priced at just $0.15, predicted to skyrocket to $15 in the next ten weeks. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: A $0.15 game changer Strategic listings fueling momentum A $1 million giveaway adds to the buzz Early investors positioned for unprecedented gains Rexas Finance: A Solana rival like no other Conclusion The search for the next great investment possibility is never-ending in the always-changing realm of cryptocurrencies. Long praised as a blockchain innovator with high-speed transactions and scalability, Solana (SOL) has long been one of the best investments for now. However, seasoned investors and analysts have been interested in a rising star costing just $0.15. Rexas Finance (RXS), a Solana rival, is set for a spectacular climb to $15 in the next ten weeks or even faster. With its original method of linking blockchain technology with practical uses, Rexas Finance , a creative blockchain initiative, has shown fantastic promise. Rexas is quickly establishing itself as a serious rival in the crypto market, having already reached vital benchmarks during its presale phase. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1871307028498685992 Rexas Finance: A $0.15 game changer At its 10th presale stage, Rexas Finance has sold over 371.8 million RXS tokens and raised an astounding $31.8 million. With its presale pricing giving early investors a chance to enter before a significant breakout, this fantastic success has made the project one of the most sought-after prospects on the market. Rexas Finance attracts investors trying to maximize their returns since it offers an entrance point much below its expected potential at just $0.15. Within ten weeks, analysts estimate RXS might soar to $15, a startling 100x rise. What sets Rexas Finance apart Unlike many initiatives that compete for attention, Rexas Finance has developed its image based on pragmatism and security. Its platform helps tokenize real-world assets, including fine art and real estate, increasing their attractiveness and drawing in conventional investors searching for blockchain-based solutions. Certik has also inspected Rexas, a leading blockchain security company, to guarantee their smart contracts are transparent and safe. This degree of assurance gives the project credibility and distinguishes it from other presale tokens without such qualifications. Strategic listings fueling momentum After its listing on essential sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance’s momentum should explode even more. Both are crucial for price acceleration, as these listings will offer more trading volume and visibility. Rexas’s inclusion into these systems is a major driver of the expected surge to $15 as it is meeting millions of traders. Part of Rexas Finance’s road map to becoming a leader in the blockchain field is such calculated actions. These benchmarks confirm the initiative and start a snowball effect, increasing RXS’s visibility and funding. A $1 million giveaway adds to the buzz With an ongoing $1 million competition, 20 fortunate winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, making Rexas Finance even more appealing. This kind of project has attracted a growing group of crypto aficionados who are ready to participate because of FOMO. Driving awareness of the project and strengthening its reputation as a community-focused blockchain, the giveaway is a marketing masterpiece. Fostering loyalty and boosting trade activity, two things that help to drive price increases depend on this kind of participation. Early investors positioned for unprecedented gains In cryptocurrencies, timing is essential; early Rexas Finance investors are positioned to benefit remarkably. With its presale price at $0.15, one of the most intriguing prospects today is a 100x surge to $15. Strong foundations, a clear route map, and increasing acceptance support this trajectory, which is not a speculative frenzy. The flood of demand expected when Rexas moves from presale to public trading could drive higher prices, benefiting those who acted early. Rexas Finance: A Solana rival like no other Solana has previously shown value in blockchain, but Rexas Finance offers something fresh. Its emphasis on tokenizing actual assets distinguishes it from conventional blockchain initiatives and generates a link between crypto and physical investment prospects. Rexas is positioned in this real-world application as more than just another altcoin; it’s a transforming platform that might change blockchain technology’s interaction with international markets. It is a unique candidate for exponential development since it may appeal to traditional investors and crypto aficionados. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is not new for explosive increases; Rexas Finance is looking to be the subsequent significant narrative. With its $0.15 presale price, real-world utility, and strategic vision, RXS is positioned to provide hitherto unheard-of profits. Rexas is becoming Solana’s most formidable rival as it confirms its place in the blockchain ecosystem. RXS could even surpass the most audacious projections. Analysts concur that a surge to $15 in ten weeks or less is more likely. Rexas Finance offers a chance to excel, which is okay for anyone wishing to turn a small investment into life-changing wealth. As presale draws to an end and listings on big platforms approach, now is the ideal moment to lock a share in the next crypto powerhouse.

During the 2010s, crypto hadn't settled on a productive use case for Bitcoin and altcoins until Ethereum smart contracts enabled early-stage teams to raise capital from supporters dispersed around the world. We saw Ethereum bootstrap a global decentralized computer which spawned DeFi, NFTs and various crypto primitives funded by less than $20 million raised from a global community.  Many other projects soon followed suit and we observed a new dynamic in which raising early-stage capital from a decentralized community almost always resulted in more value-add for the project and entrepreneurs than even the best, most well-intentioned venture capitalists could offer. With a decentralized investor group, entrepreneurs get free evangelists, beta testers and code contributors — i.e. free work that contributed to the project at hand. Also, the shorter liquidity time frame allowed for better risk-return profiles for early-stage investors.  Unfortunately, ICOs were slowly choked off and signalled as “not in compliance” with regulations that were never exactly spelled out. By 2020, they had slowed to a trickle and 88% of ICO tokens were trading at below issuance price.  Fast forward to 2025 and we can see the convergence of some important inputs that allow for the re-emergence of compelling investment opportunities, but with very different characteristics from ICO 1.0.  The ingredients of ICO 2.0  1. Updated regulatory stance  I predict that value accrual will be a fundamental part of the “why” of investing in tokens this time around. Entrepreneurs and investors in the space have matured and are ready to collectively admit that there is an expectation of profit with most tokens. In fact, one could argue that the obfuscation of how token holders would be compensated as a hand-wavey attempt to sidestep the Howey test was the primary problem the first time around.  KYC/AML will be focused on on-ramps and off-ramps such as exchanges and L2 bridges, and reasonably concentrate at the point of realization of gains back into fiat, which is the appropriate light touch that should satisfy reasonable regulators.  2. Market turnover  We are seeing the rapid decline of certain mid-market companies that could remake their business models by becoming community-led and decentralized. For example, mid-size media companies including newspapers and magazines are an obvious business model that could be greatly improved by the use of a token economy to drive citizen journalists towards greater professionalism.  3. Crypto's progression  In 2017 we had ICO-click-races on very rough UI/UX interfaces, pre-launch SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) rounds going to a handful of VCs and years of waiting until a live network launch. No one should be surprised then that the majority of ICO projects died. The Darwinian nature of any emerging technology is such that most will perish but the few that survive go on to create great value (spoiler alert: >90% of AI projects are going away as well).  Crypto now has decent on-boarding and good user-facing apps, and most importantly, the community has shown an uncanny ability to publicly call out nonsense and root out bad actors far better than government oversight ever has. The light of open decentralized ledgers is a particularly strong disinfectant.  Implications and predictions  So what does all this mean for the crypto community?  This new wave of decentralized capital formation will dwarf the approximately $20 billion of capital allocated in ICO 1.0 in 2017 and 2018. Over the coming years, we will see hundreds of billions in total capital formation across DeFi, NFTs, RWAs and a plethora of other crypto primitives.  M&A activity will represent a significant component of on-chain capital formation activity. Whether it is traditional businesses getting serious about crypto and buying up lost ground, like the Stripe-Bridge deal or EVM L2s joining forces as they recognize that only a handful will survive to be significant, we will see billions of dollars worth of M&A activity in the coming year.  In addition, mid-market Web2 and legacy companies will seek to reinvent their business model now that they can use token-incentivization under less hostile circumstances. We are seeing companies in energy, media, art and cellular communications get serious about token-incentivization to turn their value chain into an open marketplace, as well as rapidly acquire customers and use cheap(er) labour.  I am also optimistic that regenerative financing, blending a capitalistic mandate and philanthropic mandate, will find its place. And I am very excited about how crypto can change paradigms in bridging reasonable returns on capital with social goals in more compelling ways than we've seen to date.  I predict that we will see a range of novel ways to choose ICO participants, whether as a reward to LPs, relying on reputation based on on-chain activity or via the usage of certain proofs. The byproduct of this is that we will see better balance between retail and institutional/VC investors.  Finally, as always with crypto, we will continue to see relentless innovation and new ideas that give rise to more early stage funding opportunities. Many exciting new teams clearly see that AI's natural transaction medium will be via crypto and are preparing accordingly. AI agents will bootstrap themselves with token-backed fundraising mechanisms that blend debt and equity principles.  Overall, I am optimistic that the crypto community has internalized the lessons learned along the stoic path of evolution to this point. As a litany of opportunities for capital allocation emerge next year, I encourage everyone in crypto to be vocal and open in highlighting due diligence red flags and bend the arc of this industry towards open access, fair launches and projects that are forthright in accruing value to token holders.  Fair launches are a superior path forward and we should all work towards more equitable and transparent fundraising practices. There are still many issues to resolve and there will be some spectacular failures as we move forward, but decentralized capital formation is crypto's original killer app, and it deserves to continue to evolve.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Ryan Zurrer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/26/why-2025-will-see-the-comeback-of-the-ico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae2fc94246c5c6387adb97b48d4a12cf3d899e02-553x420.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin was among the most volatile cryptos in 2024 with the highest price of $108,135 in mid-December compared to the lowest value of $38521 on January 23. Bonk’s price has not experienced the full effects of close to 1 billion token burn . The community is optimistic that the price will take a new turn and rally towards 2025.

Monsta Mash ($MASH) Whale Resurgence Takes The Presale To The Next Level Phase three of Monsta Mash live presale is almost here and with it, a newly increased token price. With recent whale buying, phase two has sold over 90%. The price is set to change from $0.0018 to $0.00365 in phase three. The value of $MASH tokens is projected to continue growing fast as the gaming platform expands. At the utility coin running the gaming ecosystem, $MASH could be valued at over 10X shortly as more gaming features enter the market. In recent developments, The Cryptids-Monsta Mash launched the first Tap-to-Earn gameplay in the beta app. The game enables players to engage in straightforward actions of simple screen taps that earn them real-world rewards. Now downloadable on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store , thrill seekers are all set to begin their earning journey. The Tap-based games have dominated the Telegram space with several very successful projects taking over the market only months after launch. Hamsta Combat has gained over 300 million players in less than one year. With a similar trajectory projected for Monsta Mash, the gaming community will likely balloon in a few months.

So far, over 949.14 billion BONK tokens have gone up in smoke, this could be a game-changer in its future token price. With such a huge supply downsizing, investors can look forward to a possible surge in the value of the remaining tokens. BONK is trading at $0.00003268 after gaining 5.4% in the past week and 1.0% in the past hour. A 100% rise would mean the token trading at $0.00006536. With a potential crypto-friendly US administration , the double value for BONK does not seem too far, the expected super rally in 2025 could have it surging even higher.

XYZ is currently undervalued , and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Solana (SOL) Solana is making waves in the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana offers a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps) that stands out. Its unique architecture allows for faster transactions and supports development across multiple programming languages. At the heart of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL isn’t just a digital coin; it’s the fuel that powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied closely to Solana’s ambition to be the go-to platform for high-activity products and services. Unlike some platforms that rely on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale, Solana avoids these by building a high-capacity network from the ground up. This approach could attract more developers and investors looking for efficiency and speed. In the current market cycle, SOL appears attractive, especially as demand grows for scalable blockchain solutions. With the increasing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Solana’s ability to handle high transaction volumes quickly sets it apart. As the blockchain space evolves, SOL could be a coin to watch. Sui (SUI) Sui is emerging as a groundbreaking blockchain platform designed to bring blockchain technology to everyone. Unlike many existing blockchains, Sui focuses on making interactions simple and secure. It uses a novel object-centric data model and the secure Move programming language to fix common problems in other blockchains. This means transactions can be faster and more efficient. By addressing these technical challenges, Sui aims to support global adoption and provide a powerful platform for developers. What makes Sui stand out is its commitment to user experience. Features like zkLogin allow users to log in securely without complicated steps. Sponsored transactions and programmable transaction blocks make it easier for people to use blockchain apps without worrying about fees or technical details. In a market where many coins struggle with scalability and user adoption, Sui’s focus on accessibility could give it an edge. As the crypto landscape evolves, coins that prioritize both advanced technology and user-friendly experiences, like Sui, may become more attractive to investors and users alike. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is making waves in the blockchain world. It’s a Layer-1 blockchain that’s both fast and eco-friendly. With low fees and rapid transactions, it can process up to 4,500 transactions per second. One of its standout features is allowing users to launch their own customizable Subnets. This means anyone can create their own blockchain network on Avalanche, tailored to their needs. Its unique consensus mechanism combines classical and Nakamoto methods, aiming for transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform is built on three interoperable chains: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain, each serving different purposes like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX is at the heart of Avalanche’s ecosystem. It’s used for transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and running multiple Subnets. This strong utility makes AVAX more than just a digital coin; it’s a tool for payments, staking, and creating custom tokens and blockchains. In today’s market, where speed and scalability are key, Avalanche stands out among other cryptocurrencies. Its eco-friendly approach is also appealing as more people become aware of environmental issues. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, Avalanche’s technology and potential uses are generating interest. Comparing it to other coins, Avalanche seems well-positioned to meet the demands of a growing blockchain industry. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is making waves in the crypto world by connecting different blockchains. Imagine sending value and data between Bitcoin and Ethereum without any middlemen. That’s what Polkadot does. It uses a technology called parachains to make transactions faster and more scalable. This means it can handle more transactions per second than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token lets holders play a role in the network’s development and verify transactions. Created by Gavin Wood, one of Ethereum’s founders, Polkadot promises a future where blockchains work together more efficiently. In today’s market, Polkadot stands out with its focus on interoperability. While many cryptocurrencies build their own ecosystems, Polkadot aims to connect them all. This could be a game-changer as the crypto space grows and the need for cross-chain communication increases. Compared to other coins, DOT offers a governance model that gives holders a say in the network’s future. With market trends pointing toward more decentralization and scalability, Polkadot’s technology puts it in a strong position. As the demand for interconnected and efficient blockchains rises, Polkadot looks poised to play a significant role in the next phase of crypto development. Conclusion SOL, SUI, AVAX, and DOT show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for massive growth and community-driven success.

38144595,https://finbold.com/?p=223125,1735225200,4 altcoins to buy under $0.10 for the start of 2025,"As Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to dominate headlines with its impressive rally—up 46% since November’s election and 133% year-to-date—investors are increasingly turning their attention to altcoins with high growth potential at a lower price point. In this context, Finbold has identified four promising cryptocurrencies priced under $0.10 that could be strong candidates for investment at the start of 2025, offering significant upside for investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Initially dismissed as a meme coin with little to offer beyond speculation, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) has transformed into a cryptocurrency worth watching, especially for short-term investment opportunities. The launch of Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain, has been a cornerstone of SHIB’s growth, dramatically improving scalability and transaction efficiency. With over 700 million transactions recorded since its launch, Shibarium showcases SHIB’s potential for real-world use cases. Further plans to introduce a stablecoin pegged at $0.01 and the TREAT token as a reward mechanism add multifaceted utility to the ecosystem, broadening its appeal. SHIB one-month price chart. Source: Finbold Currently trading at $0.000022, market sentiment around SHIB remains cautiously optimistic, supported by notable activity from whales and major investors. With 55% of SHIB holders currently in profit, whale movements suggest renewed interest from large investors, adding credibility to the token’s short-term bullish case. JasmyCoin (JASMY) Dubbed the “ Bitcoin of Japan, ” JasmyCoin has recently witnessed increased whale accumulation, with the token surging an impressive 63% in a month. Currently trading at $0.036, technical analysis paints a bullish picture, with projections suggesting a potential 700% gain within the next four months. JASMY seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Moreover, derivatives data shows strong market interest and reinforces the bullish sentiment. Trading volume has jumped by 21.17% to $162.02 million, accompanied by a 1.32% rise in open interest, now standing at $57.61 million, reflecting growing trader engagement. On Binance , the long/short ratio heavily favors longs at 2.095, with top traders showing an even stronger bias at 2.2595. Additionally, liquidation data supports this outlook, as short liquidations consistently exceed long liquidations across multiple timeframes. These factors collectively strengthen the bullish case for JasmyCoin in the derivatives market. Gala (GALA) The native token of the crypto gaming project Gala Games, GALA, is showing bullish potential despite recording negative price action over the past few days, currently trading at $0.03. While trading volume has declined by 33.01% and open interest has dropped by 8.39%, derivatives data highlights strong market confidence. GALA seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The Binance long/short ratio stands at 3.6125, increasing to 4.4915 for top traders, signaling a clear preference for longs. Additionally, long liquidations significantly outweigh short liquidations, with $1.03M in longs versus $67.98K in shorts over 24 hours. These metrics reflect sustained optimism, positioning GALA as a token to watch for. VeChain (VET) Currently trading at $0.04907, VeChain ( VET ) has garnered renewed investor interest following the “VeChain Renaissance” upgrade . This optimism is further supported by derivatives data , which shows a strong bullish sentiment. VET seven-day price chart.

38145711,https://invezz.com/?p=2406277,1735225154,"KULR Technology Group, Inc. launches Bitcoin treasury, buys $21M BTC","KULR Technology Group, Inc., a company known for its advancements in energy management platforms, has embarked on a bold new financial strategy by announcing the inclusion of Bitcoin (“BTC”) as a primary asset in its treasury program. This strategic move was officially disclosed on December 4, 2024 , when KULR’s Board of Directors agreed to this innovative approach, signalling a significant shift in how the company manages its surplus cash reserves. KURL partners with Coinbase to acquire Bitcoin With over $12 million currently on its balance sheet, KULR Technology Group has committed to allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash to Bitcoin. This decision is not only a testament to the company’s belief in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value but also reflects a broader trend of corporate treasuries diversifying into digital assets. KULR’s approach to acquiring Bitcoin will be dynamic, guided by market conditions and the company’s cash flow requirements. This flexibility ensures that KULR can adapt its strategy based on evolving economic landscapes and strategic needs. The company has already made its first significant move under this new policy by purchasing 217.18 Bitcoin for approximately $21 million , at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. This acquisition marks the initial step in what KULR describes as ongoing purchases. To manage these holdings, KULR has chosen to partner with Coinbase Prime, leveraging their services for custody, USDC, and self-custodial wallets, ensuring secure and efficient management of their Bitcoin assets. KURL’s long-term Bitcoin vision KULR Chairman and CEO Michael Mo emphasized the company’s confidence in Bitcoin’s future, citing its growing global acceptance as still being in its nascent stages. He noted that various sectors, including companies, financial institutions, governments, and capital markets, are increasingly recognizing blockchain technology and specifically Bitcoin as part of their economic toolkits. This move is seen as a hedge against geopolitical, inflationary, and other macroeconomic trends that affect developed economies, positioning KULR to strengthen its financial standing while expanding operations. This strategic direction by KULR Technology Group is viewed as an aggressive yet calculated move to diversify its treasury reserves, potentially setting a precedent for other mid-cap companies in the tech and energy management sectors. However, it also carries inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility, which KULR acknowledges by maintaining adaptability in its acquisition strategy. KURL’s move comes at a time when there’s an increasing conversation around Bitcoin at the highest levels of government in the US With Senator Cynthia Lummis proposing a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and President-Elect Donald Trump highlighting the potential for a federal Bitcoin stockpile, KULR’s strategy aligns with a broader narrative of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional financial systems.

38144519,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398391,1735225077,Why Bitcoin Corporate Adoption Is Rising?,"The post Why Bitcoin Corporate Adoption Is Rising? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin gaining recognition and adoption worldwide companies aren’t just watching anymore. They’re jumping in and adding the crypto to their books. Businesses are using Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. You might think why Bitcoin corporate adoption is rising? Well, they believe it’s more than just a currency. For some, it’s a way to fight inflation. For others, it’s about staying ahead of the competition. Meet the Bitcoin Pioneers MicroStrategy is leading the pack. They’ve bought over 150,000 Bitcoins. Their CEO, Michael Saylor, calls Bitcoin a “transformative asset.” He’s convinced it’s the best way to protect a company’s money in the long run. Rumble Inc. is another name to watch. They recently announced plans to include Bitcoin in their finances. Their reason? It fits their vision for decentralization and global growth. Hut 8 Mining isn’t far behind. They hold over 10,000 Bitcoins. In fact, they just spent $100 million to buy even more. This helps them upgrade their mining systems and stay competitive. Marathon Digital is also all-in. They’ve raised $835 million to invest in Bitcoin and expand their operations. It’s clear they see Bitcoin as a long-term play. Even smaller companies like KULR Technology are making moves. They’ve already bought 217 Bitcoins and plan to spend up to 90% of their extra cash on it. Why Bitcoin? Why is this happening on such a large scale? Companies want to diversify. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no government or single entity controls it. Its limited supply makes it attractive as a store of value. Hut 8’s strategy is a great example. They’ve managed to buy Bitcoin at an average price of $24,484. That’s much lower than its current value. For them, it’s about smart planning and cost management. What’s Next? More companies could follow this trend as Bitcoin prices rise . Even political shifts, like Trump’s support for Bitcoin, might encourage Bitcoin corporate adoption rate to rise rapidly. One thing is certain: Bitcoin is becoming a big part of corporate strategy.

38144754,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633561,1735225043,Blockchain realities threaten Trump’s “Made in USA” Bitcoin promise,"Donald Trump’s “Made in USA” Bitcoin pledge is hitting the hard wall of blockchain reality. Back in June, the ‘crypto president’ posted on Truth Social that he wanted all remaining Bitcoin to be mined in the United States. The announcement came after a high-profile meeting at Mar-a-Lago with major U.S. crypto miners. “VOTE FOR TRUMP! Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC. Biden’s hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!” he wrote . But Bitcoin’s network doesn’t care about borders. It’s decentralized, which means no one controls it—not Trump, not China, not even the miners themselves. With 95% of Bitcoin already mined and the remaining slivers left scattered in a global tug-of-war, the idea of making Bitcoin strictly American is more fantasy than policy. Global mining competition is crushing Bitcoin mining is big business—tens of billions of dollars big. Trump’s patriotic pitch has to contend with a global playing field teeming with deep-pocketed rivals. Russia’s oligarchs, Dubai’s royals, and Chinese investors in Africa are all swinging their weight around. They’ve got cheap power, endless capital, and no interest in playing second fiddle to the U.S. The numbers tell the story. Bitcoin mining in the U.S. has grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry, but American miners contribute less than 50% of the global hashrate—the computational horsepower that drives mining. This isn’t because U.S. miners lack ambition. It’s because competitors worldwide are relentless. Kazakhstan is ramping up mining farms. China is quietly bringing banned operations back online. Ethiopia’s hydropower resources are turning it into an African crypto hotspot, while Argentina’s miners rely on Bitcoin to escape crushing inflation. And then there’s the Middle East. MARA Holdings, the biggest Bitcoin miner by market cap, partnered with Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund to build a colossal mining farm. Even U.S. companies are playing the global game, finding cheaper energy and cutting deals abroad to stay afloat. Trump’s vision is ambitious, but the global mining scene is a battlefield. Everyone wants a slice of the pie, and some countries—flush with cheap energy—can undercut U.S. operations every step of the way. U.S. miners face mounting pressure American miners were quick to rally behind Trump after he changed from a crypto skeptic to a full-blown industry ally. Riot Platforms and CleanSpark Inc. bet on Trump’s pledge to ease environmental scrutiny, tamp down competition and kill off Biden-era regulations. These miners threw their weight behind Trump, helping the crypto industry pump $135 million into his campaign. But support from Trump doesn’t make the challenges go away. Bitcoin’s 113% return in 2024 hasn’t saved most mining stocks , which are ending the year deep in the red. Companies like Argo Blockchain are down 84%, while Sphere 3D has lost 69%. The biggest winners? Core Scientific, which climbed 327%, and Bitdeer, up 167%. For most miners, though, the numbers don’t look great. It’s not just about market returns. Mining difficulty skyrocketed by 50.71% this year, making it harder than ever to secure new Bitcoin. Meanwhile, operational costs have exploded. BitFuFu, for instance, reported a staggering 168% jump in mining costs, hitting $51,887 per Bitcoin mined. And let’s talk about machines—the lifeblood of any mining operation. Most of these machines come from Bitmain, a Chinese manufacturer. A trade war with China could make those rigs way more expensive, slamming American miners with costs they can’t afford to absorb. U.S.-based miners aren’t just battling global competition—they’re also expanding their hosting services. In plain terms, this means running mining machines owned by foreign investors. Even within U.S. borders, it’s not all “Made in USA.” Halving cuts, diversification grows Bitcoin halving—where mining rewards are slashed in half every four years—is squeezing profits like never before. In April, rewards dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This predictable event cut into miners’ revenue, which stood at $42 million in December, compared to a peak of $100 million earlier this year. But some miners are adapting. Core Scientific, traditionally focused on Bitcoin, jumped into AI by teaming up with CoreWeave. They’re hosting Nvidia GPUs, cashing in on the AI boom, and expecting $8.7 billion in revenue over the next 12 years. Other companies, like Hut 8 and MARA, are stacking Bitcoin reserves to strengthen their balance sheets. U.S. miners raised over $2.2 billion through stock offerings this year. While that’s a lifeline for many, it shows just how challenging the industry has become. Reduced rewards, soaring costs, and fierce competition are pushing miners to get creative—or get out.

Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), one of the top meme coins in the Solana ecosystem, dropped by 16.8%, making it one of the biggest laggards. Floki ( FLOKI ) retreated by 4.5%, while Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) plummeted by 6.5%. Other top laggards in the meme coin industry were Brett, Mog Coin, and Popcat ( POPCAT ). PENGU was the only major meme coin in the green, rising by 6% as total sales jumped by 127% in the last 24 hours to $6.1 million. Meme coins crashed on Boxing Day | Source: CoinGecko Meme coins retreated because of the risk-off sentiment in the crypto industry, as most coins dropped. Bitcoin fell to $95,000, while the market cap of all coins fell to $3.32 trillion. Altcoins, especially the highly volatile meme coins, often drop sharply when Bitcoin is not doing well. Meme coins and other altcoins also dropped as liquidity in the crypto industry fell because of the Christmas holiday. Data shows that most cryptocurrencies are seeing low volume as most investors and traders remain on holiday. Bitcoin had a 24-hour volume of $33.96 million on Thursday, the lowest level since November 3rd.

Floki’s 24-hour volume was $238 million, its lowest level in over a month. Similarly, Fartcoin’s volume was $187 million, while Shiba Inu had a $576 million volume. Cryptocurrency prices often experience major swings in either direction when there is limited volume. Meme coin prices are also falling as investors continue to book profits after most of them rose sharply during the year. Floki peaked at $0.0002885 in November, 200% higher than its lowest level in August, while Shiba Inu reached $0.000033. Additionally, there are still concerns about the Federal Reserve , which hinted that it will deliver just two interest rate cuts in 2025. That hawkish tilt has pushed bond yields higher, with the 10-year moving to 4.63% and the 30-year and 5-year rising to 4.8% and 4.50%, respectively.

By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart On the USDT-Paired chart, the asset began its aggressive rally at the beginning of November, breaking the 200-day moving average to the upside. Since then, multiple resistance levels have been broken, but the $1.2 level has rejected the asset on a couple of occasions. The market’s failure to continue beyond the $1.2 level has led to a correction toward the $0.75 support zone, successfully preventing a deeper decline. If this level holds, it could only be a matter of time before ADA climbs above the $1.2 mark. Yet, a breakdown of this area could result in a drop toward the 200-day moving average, located around the $0.5 level. The BTC Paired Chart On the ADA/BTC daily chart, it is evident that Cardano has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent crypto rally but is also depreciating against BTC on a broader scale. With the 1,000 SAT support level being almost broken to the downside, it is likely for the ADA/BTC chart to decline toward the 200-day moving average, located around the 700 SAT mark. Therefore, as the chart suggests, it is probable that BTC will outperform ADA in the coming weeks.

In addition to a recap of investments, OKX Ventures also outlined a number of key predictions for the crypto industry as the new year approaches. Firstly, OKX predicts that more blockchain-based companies will seek legitimization in the form of licenses. Therefore, the number of licensed crypto firms will increase significantly. CEO of OKX Star Xu pointed out that the exchange itself was one of the first cryptocurrency trading platforms to obtain a comprehensive operating license in the UAE. In addition, OKX sees more countries creating crypto regulations to accommodate the rapidly growing industry. Next, OKX believes AI agents will play an important role within crypto markets, even in issuing tokens, trading, and creating a range of digital assets. Agent-to-agent interactions will also become more prominent as time goes on. AI agents will also participate in strengthening project security and solving internal issues within the blockchain. Aside from AI, it appears that OKX will still prioritize Bitcoin-based projects as the exchange also predicts more innovations will come from the ecosystem alongside a “BTC DeFi Summer” that will be spearheaded by Babylon and other Bitcoin Layer2 projects.

Analysts Predict Explosive Growth,"The cryptocurrency market thrives on innovation, with Lightchain AI (LCAI) emerging as a standout project poised for significant growth. Drawing comparisons to Solana (SOL), a blockchain known for its speed and scalability, Lightchain AI’s unique approach is sparking interest among analysts. Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale , Lightchain AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to offer a platform for real-world applications. While Solana disrupted the market with its high throughput, Lightchain AI introduces multi-industry utility, positioning itself as a major player in blockchain's next evolutionary phase. How Solana’s Success Mirrors Lightchain AI’s Potential Solana (SOL) gained traction by addressing issues like high transaction fees and slow speeds, solidifying its position as a leading blockchain for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Similarly, Lightchain AI is making strides with its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), enabling developers to create AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). However, Lightchain AI goes a step further by targeting industries such as healthcare, logistics, and finance, offering a broader range of use cases. Analysts see similarities in their growth potential, particularly as Lightchain AI’s presale provides early investors with an opportunity to enter a promising project at the ground level. Just as Solana experienced exponential growth due to its technical advancements, Lightchain AI’s focus on scalability and AI integration could propel it to similar heights. Lightchain AI’s Roadmap Inspires Confidence Among Analysts A key factor in Lightchain AI’s appeal is its phased roadmap, which outlines a clear strategy for long-term growth. Starting with a testnet rollout in January 2025, the project aims to onboard developers and validate its capabilities in real-world environments. By March 2025, Lightchain AI plans to launch its mainnet, incorporating key features like cross-chain interoperability and decentralized governance. These milestones demonstrate the project’s commitment to scalability and adoption, much like Solana’s early emphasis on expanding its ecosystem. Analysts predict that Lightchain AI’s focus on multi-industry applications, combined with its community-driven development, could position it as a blockchain solution with widespread appeal. Why Lightchain AI May Surpass Solana’s Trajectory While Solana excels in throughput and efficiency, Lightchain AI differentiates itself with its emphasis on AI integration and real-world problem-solving. Its deflationary tokenomics, which reduce supply over time, add an extra layer of value for long-term holders. Furthermore, Lightchain AI’s early presale pricing offers an unparalleled opportunity for investors to get in at the ground floor of a project poised for global adoption. Analysts predict that as industries increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions, Lightchain AI’s versatile platform will outperform expectations, rivaling the explosive growth seen by Solana in its early years. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, Lightchain AI presents an opportunity to be part of a project that combines cutting-edge technology with scalable blockchain solutions. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

It was never if, only when.” This comment underscores the belief that XRP’s utility lies in its ability to revolutionize outdated financial frameworks. Many supporters of XRP argue that its underlying technology offers a solution to inefficiencies in cross-border payments, such as high costs and slow transaction times. Another respondent emphasized the significance of Ripple’s strategic partnerships and its focus on integrating XRP into a global financial ecosystem. They highlighted Ripple’s success in onboarding major financial institutions and central banks, suggesting that XRP’s future value may extend beyond its current applications to include uses not yet fully realized. This viewpoint underscores the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and transformative potential of Ripple’s solutions, which could position XRP as a critical asset in the cryptocurrency space by 2030.

38144000,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376277,1735224076,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Risks Dropping Toward $80K if it Fails to Reclaim $100K Soon,"Bitcoin has failed to sustain its rally above the $100K level and has been correcting over the last week. Yet, a bullish continuation can materialize soon. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset dropped below the $100K level last week and has failed to climb back above it since. While the $90K support zone has held the market, preventing it from dropping lower, the price has failed to break above the $100K level yet again and is getting rejected to the downside. This could result in a deeper continuation below the $90K and toward the $80K area in the coming weeks if the price fails to break back above $100K. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, things look slightly more tricky for Bitcoin. The price has recently broken the ascending channel pattern to the downside, which can be a reversal signal. The lower boundary of the pattern has also been retested twice alongside the $100K resistance level. Yet, both levels have held and pushed the asset lower, which could lead to a drop toward the $90K level and even lower in the short term. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Long-Term Holder SOPR Not everything can be figured out using technical and price analysis. For a better view of the underlying dynamics of the Bitcoin network, it is beneficial to analyze on-chain metrics. This chart presents the long-term holder SOPR metric, which measures the ratio of profit realization by investors who have held their coins for over 6 months. As the chart suggests, the realized profit is relatively high, but it has yet to reach the values previously seen when the market was consolidating below the $70K level. This is especially interesting, as BTC is now trading around $100K. As a result, it could be interpreted that long-term holders’ selling pressure is still insufficient to overwhelm the market, and the price could still rally higher in the coming weeks.

The donation to adopt Moo Deng, a pygmy hippo sparked a 70% surge in MOODENG’s price. The MOODENG token saw a recent price jump due to a donation from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Following the announcement of the donation, MOODENG’s price rose by over 70%, and its trading volume also increased by 380% in just a matter of hours. Vitalik Buterin’s donation to MOODENG Vitalik Buterin’s involvement with Moo Deng is not just a donation. He also adopted the adorable pygmy hippo and its family for the next two years. According to an official statement from the Khao Kheow Zoo, Buterin also joined the zoo’s Wildlife Sponsorship Program and contributed to the improvement of the zoo’s facilities, especially for Moo Deng’s habitat. Vitalik Buterin shared, “I am delighted to accept your invitation to be Moo Deng’s adoptive father while she grows up, and to donate to the Zoo in her name, no less than 10,000,000 THB.” The donation will happen in two parts. The first payment of 5 million THB is set for December 26, 2024, or earlier, while the second installment will follow within the next year. MOODENG has been in the news in charitable headlines in the past. For example, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously donated MOODENG tokens to a medical research organization, which helped improve the project’s image and showcased its focus on charity. The project has also consistently focused on combining fun with philanthropy, just as Moo Deng, the real hippo brings joy to visitors at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo. In addition to its charitable efforts, the MOODENG project is committed to security and transparency. The project’s creators claim to have relinquished ownership of the token, ensuring it is decentralized and free from manipulation. MOODENG price surge Following Vitalik Buterin’s donation announcement, the price of the MOODENG token surged by over 70%. It quickly jumped from $0.0001228 to $0.0002417. As of press time, it currently trades at $0.0001958 . MOODENG’s recent price surge also came with a huge 380% increase in trading activity. The token now has a market cap of $86.24 million and a circulating supply of about 41 billion coins. MOODENG stands out as an example of how meme tokens can create a strong, loyal community. Its connection to Moo Deng and ties to Vitalik Buterin have also impacted its success. It has fostered a perception of genuine community involvement. While memecoins like MOODENG are often seen as risky since they rely more on hype than solid foundations, activity within passionate communities can also lead to significant price swings. MOODENG’s story is not an exception in terms of what crypto can do outside of growing in value. Communities can also support meaningful causes and create real-world impact. Vitalik Buterin’s donation to Moo Deng’s family at the Khao Kheow Zoo caused the MOODENG token’s price to spike by 70%. The gesture also helped the zoo gain prominence and social credit, which could eventually lead to more donations.

38147663,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106587,1735223637,"Pantera Capital Issues Timeline for Bitcoin to Hit $117,000","Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead predicts Bitcoin could hit an all-time high of $117,000 by August 2025, marking the asset’s peak price for the 2024/2025 bull cycle. Morehead made the projection during a recent interview on the Bankless Podcast. During the interview, Morehead highlighted Bitcoin historical price alignment with the halving event occurring every four years. BTC Performance Before and After Bitcoin HalvingFor context, Bitcoin’s price surged tremendously during the previous halving event, with the latest expected to follow a similar trend. The last halving occurred in April 2024, reducing miners’ rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Citing historical data, the Pantera CEO claims that the halving impact on Bitcoin’s price begins 400 days before the event. According to Morehead, the crypto market reaches the peak of a bull cycle around 480 days after the halving. Bitcoin to Hit $117K Based on Bitcoin’s historical price movements, Morehead forecasted that the premier cryptocurrency could surge to a peak of $117,000. He expects Bitcoin to clinch the target by August 2025, exactly eight months from now. Besides the anticipated rally accompanying Bitcoin halving, Morehead expects factors, such as macroeconomic and favorable political developments, to pave the way for Bitcoin’s potential surge to $117,000. The $117,000 target represents a surge of 22.53% from its current price of $95,484. Bitwise CIO Cites Condition for Bitcoin Potential Surge to $500K It is worth noting that Bitcoin has recently welcomed more ambitious predictions. Last week, Matt Hougan, CIO of digital asset manager Bitwise, predicted that Bitcoin’s 2024 rally would extend into next year, projecting that the firstborn crypto asset would reach a peak price of $200,000 by then. The Bitwise CIO highlighted three factors that could push Bitcoin to this target: spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, growing institutional demand, and increased interest in BTC among countries. Furthermore, Hougan speculated that BTC’s price would soar to $500,000 if Donald Trump established a national Bitcoin stockpile. The U.S. President-elect disclosed this plan during the Bitcoin Conference earlier this year. Following Trump’s reelection last month, several Bitcoin proponents, including Hougan, have highlighted the proposal's potential impact on Bitcoin's price. According to Hougan, other countries might follow the U.S. to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile. Consequently, he expects Bitcoin to surge to around $300,000 to $500,000 if this initiative comes to fruition. Meanwhile, some countries, like Japan, are not interested in creating a national Bitcoin stockpile. As reported earlier, the Japanese government believes Bitcoin and other assets are not foreign exchange. It emphasized that creating a Bitcoin reserve could jeopardize the security of the country’s foreign reserve.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/26/pantera-capital-issues-timeline-for-bitcoin-to-hit-117000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pantera-capital-issues-timeline-for-bitcoin-to-hit-117000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

XRP’s bullish momentum has stalled at levels above its 2021 top of $1.96. The XRPL native token surged past the peak amid a November uptrend to $2.9097, posting an over 100% gain during the run.However, since then, XRP has retraced 25%. Last week, the asset briefly retested below $2 amid a broader market retracement before rebounding to its current market price.Amid the market uncertainties, market analyst Egrag Crypto has insisted it is all noise at the moment. In a recent commentary , the expert maintained that XRP's reaction to two crucial price levels would reveal its next direction.Two Crucial Levels to WatchAccording to Egrag’s analysis, XRP will continue to trend within its current range until it breaks either the upper or lower boundary. The seasoned speculator mentioned in an earlier analysis that XRP has entered a micro range and will maintain a fluctuation between $2 and $2.9 until a confirmed breakout.Meanwhile, Egrag suggested that a break below $2 would ensure lower prices for XRP. The analyst's chart shows that if it loses this level, XRP will target $1.64 and probably $1.3700, as another commentator, Dom, speculated.Furthermore, Egrag inferred that a push past $2.65 would spur a bullish breakout. From there, XRP could surge to higher prices like $3 and $5 , as other analysts expect. XRP Ready to ExplodeAdditionally, market analyst and community figure Gordon insists that XRP is ready to explode despite the recent downtrend. He tweeted that XRP's chart is currently one of the most bullish in the crypto market.In an accompanying XRP/USD 12-hour chart, he shared that XRP is currently forming a symmetrical triangle.

This is part of Sui tokenomics and monthly unlock schedule that inflates SUI’s circulating supply and dilutes investors’ holdings. Finbold has been monitoring and reporting Sui cliff unlocks according to data from Tokenomist . For example, December 1 saw Sui’s largest unlock in U.S. dollar value to date due to SUI’s ongoing price increase, unlocking $224 million worth of 64.19 million tokens. The phenomenon is set to repeat on 2025’s first day if SUI continues trading close to its current level. Indeed, the usual 64.19 million SUI unlock currently holds a nominal value of $274.11 million. This will artificially increase Sui’s circulating supply and market capitalization by 2.19% after the token unlock. Interestingly, there are still 1.85 billion SUI locked in vested contracts with a scheduled unlock. Over 5.22 billion of locked SUI tokens are not yet scheduled, classified as “TBD locked” by Tokenomist . Sui Network (SUI) Total Unlock Progress and Unlock Events. Source: Tokenomist / Finbold Nearly $600 million of token unlocks next week Overall, “Cliff Unlocks” data from Tokenomist also shows that $581.95 million will be unlocked by 43 cryptocurrency projects in the next seven days. Other projects with significant unlocks are Optimism ( OP ) and ImmutableX ( IMX ), with $60.80 million and $36.04 million, respectively. Yet, SUI still represents the largest share, unlocking approximately 50% of all cliff unlocks for the upcoming week. Cliff Unlocks Next seven days. Source: Tokenomist / Finbold SUI tokenomics and market effects Sui Series A and B investors receive the most, getting over 19 million SUI each, for 61% of the total. Mysten Labs gets the remaining 25.03 million, reserving 12.63 million for the community, 10.34 million for early contributors, and 2.07 million for its treasury. So far, the Sui Network has already unlocked 29% of its maximum capped supply of 10 billion SUI. At $4.27 per token, the “ Solana-killer ” has a fully diluted value (FDV) of $42.70 billion. This is a similar value to Circle’s USDC circulating market cap by press time. USDC and Sui market data. Source: CoinMarketCap Notably, each time the network unlocks more tokens, it increases the potential selling pressure and artificially inflates the market cap. An increasing supply requires a similar, or better, increased demand to sustain its prices, according to the laws of economics. This is why Sui’s largest cliff unlock to date represents a first-moment threat to SUI investors, diluting their holdings’ value. Furthermore, Sui has a unique tokenomics, which allows Mysten Labs and Series A/B investors to stake their locked tokens. These positions generate asymmetric liquid rewards against other staking investors, allowing these entities to sell these rewards or compound their staking positions over time.

Ethereum is at the center of attention investors who anticipate a potential rally in the coming weeks. This optimism is fueled by expectations that Ethereum’s resurgence could mark the beginning of a long-awaited Altseason, bringing widespread gains across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, highlighting Ethereum’s formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern in the 4-hour timeframe. According to Runefelt, this pattern is a classic precursor to a breakout, with a bullish target set above $3,980. Such a move would signal a strong return to upward momentum for Ethereum, reinforcing its position as a leading asset in the crypto market. Market participants closely monitor this pattern, as a confirmed breakout could catalyze a broader rally across altcoins. However, Ethereum must first conquer this critical level to solidify its bullish outlook. With the market at a crossroads, the coming weeks will be decisive for Ethereum’s trajectory and its role in sparking the next major phase of growth in the crypto market. Ethereum Prepares For A Rally Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,000 mark, maintaining a strong position after weeks of consolidation. Currently, ETH is trading within a tight range, capped by resistance at $3,550. This critical zone has captured the attention of analysts and investors eager for Ethereum to break out and surpass its yearly highs, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, emphasizing the symmetrical triangle pattern forming on Ethereum’s 4-hour timeframe. According to Runefelt, this pattern suggests a high probability of a significant price move, though the direction remains uncertain. He forecasts a bullish target of $3,980 if ETH breaks upward from the triangle. This level would reaffirm Ethereum’s strength and likely inspire confidence among market participants. Conversely, if the pattern breaks downward, Runefelt predicts a retracement to $2,920, marking a critical test of Ethereum’s ability to hold key support levels. Related Reading: Solana Sees Consistent Capital Inflows Since 2023 – Liquidity Influx Signals Growth The upcoming days are expected to be pivotal for Ethereum as this symmetrical triangle nears its resolution. Whether ETH surges past resistance or dips to retest support, the outcome will have significant implications for its short-term direction and long-term outlook. Investors are closely monitoring these movements, awaiting signals of Ethereum’s next big move. Price Action: Keeping An Eye On Key Demand Ethereum is trading at $3,360, showing resilience after consolidating above the critical $3,300 support level. This zone remains a key threshold for bulls aiming to maintain momentum and push prices higher. Holding above $3,300 is essential, as a breach of this level could trigger a deeper correction, potentially retesting lower support zones and dampening bullish sentiment. On the flip side, if ETH establishes a solid base above $3,350, it could pave the way for a swift recovery. A push beyond the $3,550 resistance mark would likely reignite bullish momentum, setting Ethereum up to challenge its yearly highs. This level represents a significant psychological and technical milestone, and reclaiming it would signal strength in the market.

For now, ETH’s consolidation above $3,300 signals cautious optimism, with the potential for an explosive move in either direction depending on how these levels are defended or broken.

The raids, carried out at the premises of more than 20 wedding planners, yielded Rs. 20 crores in cash and jewellery and three crypto wallets-two from local platforms and one from a big global exchange. This operation brought into light a strong nexus of unaccounted cash, cryptocurrency transactions, and illicit Hawala networks. Wedding Planners in the Line of Fire The investigation brought wedding planners into focus as the principal operators of this network. “They arranged the collection of cash against receipts and had it converted through Hawala brokers in Rajasthan and Gujarat into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Tether,” the report said. The planners allegedly used these unreported funds to settle high-value expenses, bypassing tax regulations. Hawala and Crypto: A Deadly Combination Hawala is a type of informal but illegal money transfer system wherein cash is moved through the efforts of brokers without involving officially recognized banking channels. Couple this with cryptocurrency, and it becomes a quite excellent way of laundering money-well beyond the scrutiny of any financial authorities. Police think the network allowed customers to avoid strict financial regulations while remaining undercover. The KYC Challenge Stricter Know-Your-Customer compliance on regulated cryptocurrency exchanges has made it rather difficult for such operations to flourish. However, investigators suspect the accused had converted the cash into cryptocurrencies using either platforms with lax KYC or intermediaries. Such methods allowed them to avoid raising any red flags and enabled them to achieve major laundering activities. Evidence and Expanded Investigations Raids yielded important evidence in the form of WhatsApp conversations, email trails, and spreadsheets of the illicit transactions. Investigations are on to identify more such beneficiaries who received the unreported cash payments. The network seems larger, stretching beyond Jaipur, and suspected to link to Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Delhi. A Wider Crackdown Authorities are now widening their investigation to other cities and cash-based businesses, including wedding and event planners. The move marks a big crackdown on money laundering in India, with the government increasing enforcement in compliance with financial laws.

38144439,https://blockworks.co/news/dont-forget-lightning-network-bitcoin,1735223400,Glory days: Why we can’t forget Lightning Network,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . We all know it’s lame to live in the past. It’s cringe when middle-aged dadbros bring up their high school football “careers,” and we shake our heads when our moms drone on about their college semesters abroad in Europe (it’s always Italy). But now it’s my turn. Lighting Network was the best thing that has ever happened to Bitcoin — until it wasn’t. A refresher: Lightning is a proposed layer-2 solution for enabling super fast (almost instant) and cheap BTC transfers. Usually, it takes about an hour on average for bitcoin transfers to be fully confirmed. Standard practice says that a transaction is only settled when it’s six blocks deep in the chain, and blocks arrive every 10 minutes or so. Instead, Lightning Network allows two users to open a payments channel between them, and only the first and last transaction in that channel actually makes it to the Bitcoin blockchain. Everything else in between then becomes just a matter for the two parties — so no need to wait for any confirmations at all, beyond the offchain tallies displayed by the Lightning app being used. Anyone who’d entered crypto in the past three years might only really know Lightning from El Salvador’s monumental adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. The official government Chivo app and other payment processors like OpenNode used Lightning as their backbone. This meant many regular Salvadorans were suddenly converted into Lightning users, even if they didn’t fully know it. The rollout was not without problems. And while Lightning capacity had been on the rise in the leadup to El Salvador’s adoption, the amount of bitcoin bouncing around channels still jumped almost 40% in the following three months, from under 2,400 BTC to 3,300 BTC. These days, there’s closer to 5,000 BTC ($500 million with BTC at $100k), but growth has stagnated in the past two and a half years. The real kicker is that Lightning was so much more fun and relevant when there was less than 1,000 BTC on the network. When silly micropayment gimmicks ran free. Between late 2018 and early 2019, a proliferation of experimental apps captured imaginations. There were Miniclip-style gaming portals like Satoshi’s Games, as well as a Mario clone “Super Bro” that transformed every in-game coin into a collectible sat. Those were great. But none held a candle (or even a Lightning Torch ) to two in particular: Pollo.feed, which allowed you to feed actual live chickens remotely for just a few sats while you watched via livestream. Magic internet money was instantly physical. Satoshi’s World would let you traverse Google Earth, tagging it with whatever nonsense graffiti you’d like — and visible for all the other digital travelers to see (I tagged Amsterdam Central Station with “LONG BITCOIN, SHORT THE BANKERS”). It’s okay that Bitcoin is more serious these days. But it’s also not. The internet was absolutely better when we were all doing dumb stuff on the Lightning Network. Sadly, we’ll probably never make it back. Now, who’s ready to hear about that time I hit a full-court touchdown? Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Meanwhile, a bearish reversal does not seem probable at the moment as long as a certain key level holds. By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart As the USDT paired chart demonstrates, the price has failed to continue its almost vertical rally beyond the $3 resistance level and is currently moving sideways below the mentioned level. Yet, with the key $2 support zone holding the price on multiple occasions, as long as this level remains intact, investors could be hopeful that a bullish continuation will occur soon. The BTC Paired Chart The XRP/BTC chart also shows a quite similar picture, as the price has failed to continue above the 2800 SAT resistance level and has been quickly rejected to the downside. Meanwhile, with the 2000 SAT support area being able to prevent a deeper decline, there is still the probability for the market to continue higher in the short term. Of course, a breakdown of the 2000 SAT zone would rule out a bullish continuation for a while.

With Trump now expected to take office on January 20, 2025, the US elections were a victory not only for Trump but also for crypto leaders. At this point, it was seen that there was a huge increase in the wealth of important names in the crypto industry after the election. According to Coindesk, CEOs such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made huge financial gains after the election results. Accordingly, Brian Armstrong sold stocks after the election and earned $129 million, and Coinbase's market value increased by $21 billion. Apart from the Coinbase CEO, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also benefited greatly from the rise of the company’s native token, XRP, as its price skyrocketed from $0.50 to $2.9 after the election. Garlinghouse is also known to own more than 6% of Ripple and a significant amount of XRP, which has more than tripled in value since the election. In addition to the CEOs of Coinbase and Ripple, major investors in crypto companies such as Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) also made huge gains with the election. Accordingly, Andreessen Horowitz founders Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz also made significant gains from their investments in Solana (SOL) and Uniswap (UNI). Coinbase donated $74 million to various political action committees (PACs) in support of the election, Ripple $73 million, a16z $70 million, Jump Crypto $15 million, and crypto exchange Gemini $5 million. *This is not investment advice.

Rexas Finance (RXS) is one of these interesting altcoins rising as a leader in market significance and investor interest, among others, ready to replace Cardano (ADA). At $0.15 right now, market analysts estimate Rexas Finance might explode to $17.50 in just 15 to 17 weeks, a more than 11,500% increase. This extreme price estimate is not unqualified hype. Supported by creative technology, a fast-expanding ecosystem, and outstanding fundraising achievements, Rexas presents itself as a revolutionary Altcoin. Below, we investigate the elements behind this optimistic view and explain why Rexas Finance is the next major crypto innovation . Rexas Finance (RXS): The $0.150 Underdog Ready to Dominate Rexas Finance draws much interest from institutional and ordinary investors at its presale price of $0.150. In its ongoing 10th presale, the project has raised over $32.3 million and sold more than 374.6 million RXS tokens, highlighting the crypto community’s great faith in its future. But why is Rexas hailed as Cardano’s successor? Its original approach to blockchain technology will help explain it. Although Cardano is well-known for its systematic, research-driven development, Rexas Finance provides a real-world application focus, linking blockchain with real estate, fine art, and more. Rexas is more than another cryptocurrency since its asset tokenizing concept adds value. Moreover, Rexas already had a Certik audit, underscoring its dependability and security consciousness. With its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, it is poised to become extremely visible and accessible. Why $17.50 Is Achievable for Rexas 1. Rapid Presale Momentum The presale figures reveal volumes about confidence in Rexas. Early phases of raising over $32.3 million show great demand; early adopters already see significant returns as each presale level slightly raises the price. This trend is likely to last into the post-listing phase when even more prices are driven by more market involvement. 2. Market Sentiment Shift Investors are always looking for the “next big thing. ” As Cardano finds it challenging to maintain its once-dominant posture, many are turning to alternatives like Rexas. Rexas’s attractiveness is strengthened by its story of replacing a well-known powerhouse like ADA. 3. Real-World Utility Unlike many speculative coins, Rexas Finance is based on practical applications. By providing blockchain-based solutions for sectors usually unaffected by cryptocurrencies, such as real estate and art tokenization, Rexas presents a strong argument for institutional and retail investors to get involved. 4. Strategic Marketing and Community Building The ongoing $1 million giveaway is evidence of Rexas Finance’s successful marketing plan. Offering 20 winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens would thank early supporters and help build a committed community. This incredible support will increase the token’s value in the following weeks. How Rexas Stacks Up Against Cardano Rexas Finance(RXS) focuses on asset tokenization and directly meets market needs by bridging blockchain with concrete sectors. Its emphasis on valuable applications sets it apart from Cardano. Rexas also gains from entering the market during maximum blockchain acceptance. Unlike Cardano, which had to create its ecosystem from scratch, Rexas can profit from the crypto space’s current infrastructure and user base. https://x.com/rexasfinance/status/1870977899437969726 What’s Next For Rexas Finance? The project is prepared for a transforming trip as Rexas Finance prepares for its public release. Its modest presale price, creative utility, and calculated rollout guarantee that RXS is positioned for significant returns. From its price of $0.150, market analysts estimate that this spike would drive Rexas Finance from here to as high as $17.50 within 15–17 weeks. This offers early investors a life-changing chance to grow a little investment into significant riches. Conclusion Rexas Finance is positioned to participate significantly in the crypto scene with its aspirational mission, solid foundations, and developing community. For investors looking for exponential profits, its ability to mix modern blockchain technology with practical utility makes it stand out. As the market recovers and investor attention moves toward creative ideas, Rexas Finance will likely replace Cardano and exceed it in terms of mart. At $0.150, Rexas Finance presents an unmatched chance for anyone wishing to profit from the next crypto wave, as RXS is poised to surge to $17.50 and above.

38143483,https://finbold.com/?p=223168,1735222997,This historical pattern points to a new Dogecoin ‘price run’; Is $2 next?,"Although Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is experiencing short-term bearish sentiment, historical price movement suggests the meme coin could be building up for a potential rally toward a single-digit valuation. Over the years, Dogecoin’s price action has been defined by three distinct cycles, each characterized by extended periods of consolidation within symmetrical triangle formations, followed by breakouts, according to an analysis shared by Javon Marks in an X post on December 25. From 2014 to 2017, Dogecoin broke out of consolidation and exceeded the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension , setting a precedent for exponential growth. The 2018 to 2021 cycle mirrored this behavior, with DOGE breaking resistance and surpassing the 1.618 Fib level during its dramatic 2021 rally. DOGE historical price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The current analysis indicates that Dogecoin is in its third cycle, which began in 2022. Over the past two years, a symmetrical triangle has been formed while testing key resistance. If this trend continues, the expert projects that DOGE could reach $2.28 or higher, representing a potential increase of over 500%. “The history hasn’t changed and still points to a fairly high likeliness of a price run to AND ABOVE the 1.618 Fib Extension level as it did every cycle prior to this and this time around,” the analyst said. Such a move would bring Dogecoin’s market cap to approximately $342 billion, potentially ranking it among the top three digital assets, assuming minimal growth in other cryptocurrencies. More bullish potential for DOGE This analysis aligns with insights shared by another cryptocurrency trading expert, Trader Tardigrade , in an X post on December 26. The technical analysis also highlighted Dogecoin’s repeating cycles of consolidation followed by parabolic price surges. DOGE historical price analysis chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade The latest setup suggests Dogecoin has emerged from its accumulation phase, a signal that has previously triggered exponential price movements. Similar patterns in 2017, 2021, and now 2024 hint that DOGE could be gearing up for another major run, possibly surpassing its all-time highs. Interestingly, on-chain data points to underlying bullish factors for Dogecoin despite its near-term weakness. Particularly, cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez noted in a December 24 X post that whale investors accumulated 270 million DOGE—worth approximately $89.64 million—within 96 hours. Historically, such large transactions have often preceded notable price rallies.

Trump is regarded as the first pro-crypto president, having promised to support the sector during his campaign. DOGE price analysis At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.31803, down nearly 5% on the daily chart and 13% over the past week. DOGE seven-day price chart.

Currently, DOGE is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ), signaling near-term weakness but well above the 200-day SMA, reflecting a longer-term bullish outlook. Dogecoin’s relative strength index ( RSI ) at 43.60 suggests mild bearish momentum, while the Fear & Greed Index at 73 indicates strong market interest.

38143420,https://crypto.news/?p=14322395,1735222927,Flockerz presale enters final stage with 28 days remaining,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Flockerz nears the end of its $7.7m presale, introducing a Vote-to-Earn DAO and staking rewards to engage and reward its community. Table of Contents Vote-to-earn: A game-changer in blockchain governance Staking rewards and long-term potential Secure FLOCK tokens before the presale ends The buzz around new meme coin Flockerz (FLOCK) is growing as its presale nears the finish line. With just 28 days now left before the presale concludes, the project has already raised an impressive $7.7 million. Now, the project is looking to secure exchange listings for FLOCK, hoping to continue the newfound momentum. Flockerz is developing the world’s first Vote-to-Earn decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This platform will be the first to provide investors with monetary incentives for participating in the governance process. 2024 has been the year of meme coins – with popular assets such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe providing even higher gains than Gold and other traditional currencies. However, it has also been the year for new meme coin projects – such as Pepe Unchained (PEPU) – which delivered a 10x return on investment right after its exchange listing. Similar success has also been achieved by Crypto All-Stars (STARS) – which shot up by over 100% within the first day of going live. Now, Flockerz aims to follow suit, already showing strong investor interest via the presale, and providing real utility to token holders. With FLOCK currently priced at $0.00653 during the presale, interested readers can get in at a discount before the token hits the open market. Vote-to-earn: A game-changer in blockchain governance Unlike most meme coins, Flockerz isn’t just about hype – it’s introducing a groundbreaking feature to the blockchain space. At the core of this platform is ‘Flocktopia’ – its governance DAO. Available exclusively for FLOCK token holders, Flocktopia allows users to make key project development decisions, implement new features, build marketing strategies, develop expansion plans, and vote on token burns. But most importantly, Flockerz incentivizes DAO participation by offering monetary rewards. Every time one votes on the Flocktopia DAO, they are rewarded with a portion of FLOCK tokens. This Vote-to-Earn model ensures that decision-making aligns with the community’s best interests, paving the way for a truly decentralized and sustainable ecosystem. The goal of this decentralized community is to tackle the major issue of centralization that plagues the crypto space. Most of the notable meme tokens are controlled by single entities or centralized teams, which may not act in the community’s favor. By offering this decentralized approach, Flockerz promotes a community-driven ecosystem and distributes governance fairly, creating a robust and community-driven system. Staking rewards and long-term potential Beyond the decentralized governance structure, Flockerz provides further utility through its lucrative staking opportunities. FLOCK token holders can stake their holdings on smart contracts and generate a live APY (Annual percentage yield) of up to 353%. So far, more than 500 million tokens are staked on Flockerz. In the long term, 25% of the total FLOCK supply will be distributed as staking rewards. This will be highly attractive to loyal investors who are looking to be a part of this community for the long haul. Staking FLOCK during the presale offers a double advantage – as early adopters can compound their holdings before the token’s market debut, and any price increase post-launch could significantly boost their returns. Due to such benefits, FLOCK has attracted the attention of prominent YouTube influencers. A crypto influencer with over 134k subscribers, Claybro, has spoken on the bullish outlook towards Flockerz. He suggests that Flockerz’s successful presale and utility could make it a huge investment opportunity. Secure FLOCK tokens before the presale ends With 28 days remaining, there’s limited time to join the Flockerz presale. Interested investors can head over to the Flockerz presale website and purchase Flockerz, or directly through the Best Wallet app – where FLOCK can be bought through the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section. On the presale website, Flockerz can be swapped with other tokens including Ethereum, BNB, and Tether. Flockerz has already undergone rigorous audits by Coinsult and Solid Proof, ensuring the project’s security and transparency.

38143406,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398370,1735222920,Ripple’s Upcoming 1 Billion XRP Unlock: Will It Impact the Price?,"The post Ripple’s Upcoming 1 Billion XRP Unlock: Will It Impact the Price? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Ripple performing significantly well on the charts recently, concerns have arisen over its upcoming 1 billion XRP unlock, which it does every single month to fund its operations. On January 1st, the market will witness 2025’s first token unlock event. The XRP community is waiting on how the token’s price will react to these Billions worth of XRP unlocks. Will Ripple’s Token Unlock Affect XRP Price? Notably, Ripple has 55B XRP tokens locked in an escrow account, which is nearly 55% of the total XRP supply. It unlocks a 1B supply on the first of every month. The unlocks are made to provide liquidity to exchanges and partners, not for buying or selling, which prevents them from directly entering the market and affecting the price. The December unlock, Ripple’s largest XRP sell-off, also did not impact the price, as it remained around $1.8 and even surged the following day due to many bullish factors, including the RLUSD stablecoin launch. On January 1, 2024, Ripple will unlock 1B XRP in three transactions, 200M XRP, 300M XRP, and 500M XRP, which is nearly 1.75% of the XRP’s total circulating supply. Analysts Bullish Over XRP A prominent onchain analyst, Ali Martinez recently took to X to share that whales bought another 60 million XRP in the last 48 hours. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, down over 4% in the past 24 hours. Another analyst, Egrag Crypto in his recent analysis has noted that with BTC Dominance decreasing and ETH Dominance rising steadily, XRP has the explosive potential to outperform both. Currently at 3.93% dominance (above Fib 0.382), and if XRP closes above Fib 0.5 (5.57%), then we could see a double-digit dominance ahead. Analysts like Javon Marks are optimistic that XRP will outperform expectations. Recently, he highlighted that XRP lately demonstrated strength not seen since its 2017 rally, with potential for even more growth. 2025, Landmark Year for XRP? Bitstamp, the world’s longest-running cryptocurrency exchange, has forecasted that 2025 could be a landmark year for XRP, which has sparked excitement in the XRP army and the wider crypto community. Furthermore, the recent approval of RLUSD by the New York Department of Financial Services highlights the XRPL’s role in enterprise-level payments, tokenization of real-world assets, and DeFi. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently described RLUSD as the “gold standard for the enterprise sector,” underscoring its alignment with XRP’s ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripples-upcoming-1-billion-xrp-unlock-will-it-impact-the-price/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

MIRA coin: from a viral plea to a viral coin Siqi Chen, known on social media platforms as @blader, shared his daughter’s diagnosis in a post that quickly went viral, touching the hearts of many in the cryptocurrency community. Siqi Chen @blader · Follow Replying to @blader on 9/23, mira was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor called a craniopharyngioma. while benign, it is located in an extremely dangerous area of the brain and associated with the worst quality of life outcomes out of all survivable brain tumors. 5:37 AM · Dec 25, 2024 962 Reply Copy link Read 6 replies Shortly after Siqi Chen’s plea for help, a user on the Solana blockchain launched MIRA coin, dedicating half of its entire supply to Chen to fund research into his daughter’s condition. Within hours of its launch, $MIRA’s value soared, achieving a market cap of over $70 million. The coin’s trading volume hit $91.7 million in just the first four hours, demonstrating the crypto community’s willingness to rally behind a cause. This surge was not just a financial phenomenon but a symbol of unity, showing that the crypto world can come together in times of crisis. After the coin’s value skyrocketed, Chen decided to sell 10% of the tokens to cover immediate treatment costs, with the remainder dedicated to ongoing research into craniopharyngiomas at the Hankinson Lab at the University of Colorado.

It exemplifies how a new form of digital currency can catalyze real-world impact, potentially setting a precedent for future crypto-based philanthropy. The crypto community’s response to Mira’s story has been overwhelmingly positive, with many viewing this as a pivotal moment where the often-criticized volatility of meme coins could be directed towards substantial, beneficial outcomes. However, this narrative isn’t without its critics. Some argue that the rapid rise of $MIRA might be more about the chase for profit than genuine philanthropy. There are concerns about sustainability and whether this model can be replicated for other causes without the same level of community investment or if it’s a one-off driven by a particularly compelling story. Despite these criticisms, the success of MIRA in raising significant funds for brain tumour research has opened a dialogue about the potential of cryptocurrencies in charitable giving. It’s a testament to the power of community-driven efforts in the digital age, where technology can amplify human kindness on an unprecedented scale.

It’s now one of the top-performing altcoins, with a market cap exceeding $2 billion. Source : Tradingview What’s fueling this GT rise? The numbers tell the story. The Money Flow Index (MFI) is sitting at 94.82. That shows heavy buying activity, which typically drives prices higher. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also high at 77.24. While that usually signals overbought conditions, GT hasn’t slowed down. And the Bull Bear Power (BBP) metric? It’s at 3.49, meaning the bulls are firmly in control. Source : Tradingview Since November 9, GT has been moving steadily within a rising parallel channel. Its latest support level is $13.92, offering a cushion for traders even if the market turns. What Could Be Next for GT? GT’s performance isn’t happening in isolation. Other exchange-linked tokens, like Bitget Token (BGB), are also doing well. But GT is leading the pack. If its momentum continues, the price could hit $18 soon, maybe even $20 in an extremely bullish scenario. That said, crypto markets are unpredictable. If traders start taking profits, GT’s price could drop back to $13.92. Still, its performance so far makes it clear—GT is one of the standout altcoins of the year. Why GT Matters Right Now In a market full of uncertainty, GT is offering something different: growth. Its success highlights the growing interest in exchange-linked tokens.

As such, it is no surprise that the billionaire did not miss the chance to shout out the popular crypto on Christmas day.""Who Let the DOGE Out?""Amid the Christmas festivities, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took time out to offer a Dogecoin mention with a play on the lyrics of Baha Men's 2000 hit song ""Who Let the Dogs Out.""""Who let the DOGE out?"" Musk wrote, captioning a photo of his dogs Gatsby, Marvin, and Floki in Christmas-inspired costumes in an X post on Wednesday, December 25.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1871980130303918426But Musk's DOGE shout-out did not end there as keen-eyed observers were quick to point out that the cape on Floki, a dog that has also inspired a successful meme coin of its own, was decorated with Dogecoin logos.Many DOGE proponents and avid Musk followers are hopeful that the billionaire's latest show of support will have bullish implications for the meme coin's price. One observer pointed out that the last time the billionaire posted those words in reference to the meme coin, it went parabolic shortly after. The post in question came up February 7, 2021. Besides an immediate price surge on the day, DOGE kicked off a parabolic rally to all-time highs of $0.73 roughly two months after in a run many have attributed to Musk's unrelenting support and influence.There is no clear indication that such a rally is imminent as DOGE trades 5% lower on Thursday, December 26, at $0.3162. Over the past month, however, analysts have continued to predict higher prices for the asset, arguing that it is replicating its price action from the 2017 and 2021 bull cycles.While most DOGE proponents are okay with Elon Musk's support, the billionaire's antics have previously attracted a class action lawsuit bringing market manipulation claims.

Fixed supply and halving cycles drive Bitcoin’s scarcity, shaping its long-term value. Virgin bitcoins gain rarity as new emissions slow, enhancing their desirability and value. On Christmas Eve 2024, Bitcoin achieved a notable milestone by reaching 19.8 million mined units. This leaves fewer than 1.2 million bitcoins left to be mined before the total supply cap of 21 million is reached. This event marks a key point in Bitcoin’s journey, with the remaining coins expected to be mined over the next century or more. Bitcoin’s Emission Schedule and the 2140 Supply End With Bitcoin’s emission schedule, the final fraction of its supply won’t be unlocked until 2140, making this the last era of Bitcoin’s inflationary phase. The question now arises: Will the supply cap be removed, and if so, what would that mean for Bitcoin’s future? Bitcoin’s supply model is designed to be deflationary, with its total supply capped at 21 million coins.

Meanwhile, 29% aren’t so sure. But it’s clear that his pro-business rhetoric and big promises have struck a chord with the majority of investors. The survey also showed a surprising level of trust in Trump’s ability to navigate the complexities of artificial intelligence. More than half—57%—of those polled expressed confidence in how Trump and his team will handle AI development. Tariffs, however, remain a hot-button issue, with respondents evenly split on whether these trade policies will help or harm the economy, workers, and consumers. Tariffs and their tangled web Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy has always been a defining feature of his economic playbook. During his campaign, he floated tariffs exceeding 60% on Chinese imports. In recent months, he’s doubled down on those threats, pledging to slap an extra 10% tariff on Chinese goods and raising duties on Canada and Mexico by 25%. The investment world is deeply divided. Some believe these measures will level the playing field for American businesses, while others worry about rising costs for consumers and potential backlash from global trade partners. “It’s a gamble,” said one participant in the survey. Trump’s influence doesn’t stop at policy. He’s also building alliances with industry heavyweights. His close relationship with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has earned mixed reactions. When asked whether Musk’s influence on Trump’s administration was positive, 36% of survey participants agreed, while another 36% were on the fence. The remaining 28% dismissed the idea outright. Investors set their sights on 2025 As the dust settles on 2024, small-cap stocks are becoming the darlings of the investment world. Nearly 30% of survey respondents picked small caps as the top asset class for 2025. This choice isn’t surprising, given that the Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-cap stocks, climbed nearly 12% this year. Still, it lagged behind the S&P 500’s impressive 26% gain and the Nasdaq Composite’s 33% surge. Big-cap tech wasn’t far behind, with 14% of investors naming it their top pick. Another 14% bet on the broader S&P 500. Bitcoin, Chinese stocks, Indian equities, and private markets each garnered 7% of the vote. The tech sector has been unstoppable this year, with the S&P 500 tech index soaring over 40%, thanks to giants like Apple, which hit record highs during the Christmas Eve trading session. But investors aren’t putting all their chips on the “Magnificent Seven”—a group of mega-cap tech stocks including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. A whopping 77% believe the rest of the S&P 500 will outperform these tech titans in 2025. The remaining 23% think the tech juggernauts still have room to run. AI-driven sectors like software and semiconductors also captured attention. The SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF gained 29% year-to-date, while the VanEck Semiconductor ETF skyrocketed 44%. Yet, 71% of investors expect software stocks to outshine semiconductors in the coming year. Bitcoin: Boom or bust? The crypto market has had a wild ride in 2024, with Bitcoin smashing through the $108,000 mark in December. But not everyone is convinced the rally will continue. 57% of survey respondents believe Bitcoin is more likely to fall to $50,000 than climb to $200,000. The remaining 43% see a shot at even greater highs. Despite the excitement around Bitcoin, crypto-mining stocks got no love from investors in the survey. None of the respondents saw these companies as worthwhile investments for 2025. Instead, 64% favored cybersecurity stocks, while 36% pointed to AI-related equities as promising bets. Bitcoin’s recent dip hasn’t helped its case. The apex crypto has slid 3% as of press time even after MicroStrategy announced plans to issue more shares to buy additional tokens. Other cryptos, including Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, followed suit, each dropping around 3%. On Friday, $43 billion in crypto open interest is set to expire on Deribit , a derivatives exchange. This includes $13.95 billion in Bitcoin options and $3.77 billion in Ether options, raising concerns about heightened volatility.

38143210,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376251,1735222496,"Binance Bitcoin Reserves Hit Lowest Level in 2024, Possible Indicator of Bullish Reversal","Bitcoin saw a setback after the holidays, losing almost 4% in value over the past day. This latest dip briefly dragged its price under $95.2k on Thursday. In fact, following multiple corrections since mid-December, Bitcoin has nearly wiped out its monthly gain. However, data suggests there could be room for more upward movement. Declining Binance Reserves CryptoQuant’s latest analysis reveals that Binance’s Bitcoin reserves have dropped to their lowest levels since the beginning of 2024. This decline notably began in August and mirrors a similar trend observed in January, when reserves also hit a low, a moment that preceded a 90% rally in BTC’s price. This milestone coincides with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of around $108,000. The diminishing reserves on Binance indicate that investors are growing increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, choosing to withdraw their holdings rather than keeping them on the exchange for short-term selling. Historically, such periods of withdrawal have often been associated with the buildup of positive market momentum. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data also revealed a surge in Bitcoin demand, as over-the-counter (OTC) desks reported their largest monthly inventory decline of 2024, with a reduction of 26,000 BTC. Since November 20, the total balance held by these desks has dropped by 40,000 BTC, which is evidence of a tightening of supply. This decline in available inventory suggests that demand is increasing, thereby contributing to a building market momentum. The ongoing withdrawal of Bitcoin from OTC desks indicates growing confidence in the asset, which, in turn, could potentially set the stage for the next leg up as the supply becomes more constrained. Bitcoin: $120k A Realistic Target for Jan While Bitcoin may have been trading below $100,000 for almost a week now, experts suggest that it is poised for a major move. One crypto analyst under the pseudonym “xoom” said that the crypto asset’s trajectory shows a bullish setup despite a lack of a Christmas rally. As per their analysis , the market is displaying a bullish engulfing candle with rising volume, emerging from the lows of a megaphone pattern. This type of pattern often signals an imminent breakout. If the pattern plays out, the analyst predicts a potential price range of $110k-$130k by the end of January, with $120k as a realistic target. While volatility and a brief dip to shake out weaker hands are possible, any pullback is expected to be short-lived, with the overall trend pointing upward. The analyst also sees the potential for Bitcoin to reach $135k–$140k or higher in the coming months. With such developments on the horizon, the analyst believes now is not the time to stay on the sidelines, as the next move could spark the beginning of a significant rally.

38143188,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114877,1735222492,Markets Show Resilience Ahead of End-of-Year Options Expirations: Bybit x Block Scholes Crypto Derivatives Report,"DUBAI, UAE, Dec. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, released the latest Crypto Derivatives Analytics Report in collaboration with Block Scholes, highlighting the muted market volatility despite major options expirations on Friday. BTC and ETH’s realized volatility has increased, but short-term options haven’t adjusted to this change. This indicates that while spot prices are fluctuating, the options market is not fully reacting to these shifts, although BTC and ETH volumes have displayed slightly different patterns. With more than $525 million in BTC and ETH options contracts expiring on Dec 27, 2024’s end-of-year options expiration looks set to be one of the biggest yet, yet expectations for volatility have remained subdued. The report highlights an unusual inversion in ETH’s volatility structure, but BTC has not mirrored the reaction. Additionally, a change in funding rates—sometimes turning negative as spot prices drop—signals a new market phase. Notably, BTC’s volatility structure has been less responsive to changes in spot prices, whereas ETH’s short-term options are exhibiting more noticeable fluctuations. Key Findings: BTC Options Expirations: In the past month, BTC’s realized volatility has been higher than implied volatility on three occasions, each time reaching a relatively calm equilibrium. Open interest in BTC options remains high, contributing to potential increased volatility as we near the end of the year. Around $360 million worth of BTC options (both puts and calls) are set to expire soon, which can affect price movement. ETH Options: Calls Dominate Despite a mid-week inversion, ETH’s volatility term structure has flattened, maintaining levels similar to those seen over the past month. In the final week of 2024, calls overwhelmed puts in open interest in ETH options, although market movements and trading activities are more on the put side.

38143083,https://crypto.news/?p=14322385,1735222260,Chainlink price forms a risky pattern despite whales accumulation,"Chainlink price retreated on Boxing Day even as whales accumulated the biggest oracle project in the crypto industry. Chainlink ( LINK ) retreated to $22.90, down by 12.45% from its highest level this week and by 26% from the year-to-date high. This decline happened as most cryptocurrencies crashed, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) falling to $95,000 and the market cap of all coins dropping to $3.3 trillion. As we have covered before, there are signs that whales have continued accumulating the LINK token. Data by Etherscan shows that one whale moved coins worth $1 million to a private wallet from Coinbase. Another investor made a similar transaction worth $1.3 million, while another moved coins worth $566,000 from Kraken.

More data shows that the netflow of Chainlink tokens to exchanges has turned negative, a sign of more accumulation. The netflow moved to minus 677,000 tokens, the lowest level in weeks. Chainlink has become one of the most important players in the cryptocurrency industry. It provides its oracle solutions to the biggest players in the decentralized finance industry, such as AAVE and Compound. Chainlink also started the Cross-Chain Token standard that streamlines token transfers across blockchains using the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. Leading cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu, Turbo, and Neiro now use CCT. Chainlink price forms H&S pattern Chainlink price chart | Source: crypto.news The four-hour chart shows that the LINK price peaked at $30.93 this month and then retreated to the current $22.7. It is now slowly forming a head and shoulders pattern, a popular reversal sign whose neckline is at $20.36. The head is this month’s high at $30.93, while the shoulder is around $26. Chainlink price has also dropped below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average and is pointing downwards. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the coin is bearish, with the next reference level to watch being $20.36. A move below that level could mean it moves to $13.3, which is 41% below the current level. The bearish view will become invalidated if it moves above the right shoulder at $26.

38143026,https://crypto.news/?p=14321934,1735222109,"Should web3 devs be building tribes, not just tools? | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Memes have come a long way, from niche internet jokes to full-blown speculative trading instruments. Now, with Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ), we even have the first AI agent millionaire . While I had initially written off meme coins as gambling chips at the crypto casino, it takes foresight to see what they truly signify. Murad Mahmudov’s presentation at TOKEN2049 in Singapore opened my eyes. You might also like: Creator economy 2.0: AI and web3 define the digital success | Opinion From Dogecoin ( DOGE ) or Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) to Bonk ( BONK ) or Pepe ( PEPE ), crypto memes are rallying points in today’s hyper-digital world. They provide folks with a shared language and identity—the assurance of belonging—where legacy institutions and market structures are failing them. Murad says we’re in a ‘meme coin supercycle,’ and tribal loyalty and community sentiments drive markets more than utility. I think he’s totally on point—the signs are everywhere, in the trenches and also outside. As an OG, I’ve had to question whether or not traditional business advice is mostly useless in web3. The ‘token is the product’ here. So innovators and devs might be wise to focus on building based tribes and tight-knit communities, not just some abstract underlying utility. Neither more infra nor more apps Starting with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), a culture of anarchy together with cutting-edge tech defined crypto’s value proposition. It came with the promise of a decentralized and trustless world built around individual autonomy. But more than fifteen years later, crypto-tech hasn’t quite fulfilled its promises … yet. While more infra and more apps might increase the coolness of blockchain and crypto, what it truly needs—especially for mass adoption—is more emotional touchpoints and narratives around which people can huddle. The next billion users don’t care about the tech or which big-shot VC is investing in the next shiny object. They care about having fun with a community of like-minded people. The ‘public good’ or social impact projects created downstream from here—are the cherry on top. Take DOGE, the OG crypto meme coin, for example. It was born with satirical intent and no groundbreaking tech or VC funding to back it up. I was in the room at the Ethereum Foundation in Zug when DOGE was launched. It was an intentional joke; tech bros said, “Let’s not take ourselves too seriously.” Yet it now has over 6.9 millionholders, and the community is using its money to fund water wells in Kenya. That’s what you call bottom-up utility creation. Rather than deep-pocket investors dumping ‘use-cases’ and overvalued coins on retail, meme coins foster genuinely decentralized community formation. That’s the core strength and beauty of meme coins. Speculation aside, they incentivize geographically, culturally, and ideologically discreet people to form groups around a shared idea—mostly a fun, humorous one. And because there’s typically no ulterior, long-term end in sight, memecoin communities come together for the community’s sake. Vibing in a disconnected world Tribalism isn’t new in crypto. Bitcoin maximalism or Ethereum loyalty, for example, is nothing short of quasi-religious sentiments. The Genesis Block is a holy symbol enshrined in mathematics, game theory, and mythology. Source: Vitalik’s blog , showcasing conflicting BTC and ETH vibes This begs the question—why are meme coins booming now? The short and lazy answer would be that crypto works in cycles, and now is the time for meme coins. All of them will go to zero once the hype passes. But no. The world is becoming increasingly distraught, and younger generations are having a hard time making sense of it. There’s an utter lack of meaning—and disillusionment—as established institutions either crumble or betray their dark, anti-individual underbelly. Memes are the antidote to such banality, not just in crypto but everywhere. Even the US presidential elections were largely being fought on memetic identities like ‘ Kamala is Brat ’ or ‘ Bro Vote ’ more than hardcore policy, performance, or ideology. Earlier Brexit saw sharp divisions into ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ camps, with tribal language like “Remoaner” and “Brextremist” characterizing polarized conversations across the board. Although a negative manifestation, this shows how integral tribalism is to modern times and culture. Meme coins are great because they channel this rising demand for belongingness and connection into something positive and monetizable. Thousands vibed with the ‘ Goatse Gospel ,’ and many more will do so without caring if LLMs can make typos or not. Popcat ( POPCAT ), the Solana-based meme coin, is another example of fun vibes and community traction erasing the need for technical promises. Bonk thrived on similar lines to become the ‘ social layer ’ of Solana. Overall, the meme coin supercycle underlines a reality where identity is the new utility. No matter what right-curve narrative or gigabrain tech innovations projects subscribe to, a community-first approach will separate winners from losers. Without a based community, even the best tech would find its place in the dumpster. Whereas even the most mundane, uninteresting tech can go to the moon with active, loyal community support. Intrinsic value has acquired a new form altogether. Younger consumers give as much importance to fun, identity, and emotional connection as functionalities. Web3 projects, like everything else, must pass the vibe check. Builders—mainly those with web2 backgrounds—must rewire themselves to build tribes, not mere tools. AI might not take your job, but failing to serve the demands of the time surely will. The lesson is simple: community is currency, and identity is the ultimate asset.

Analysts set a $15K-$25K target for Ethereum in 2025. Ethereum surged 74% within six weeks in the last quarter of 2024. Ethereum (ETH) is set to witness a parabolic rally in 2025 with a surge in ETF inflows, heightened user sentiment, and notable outflows from centralized exchanges. Several crypto analysts stated that the flagship altcoin could rally between $15,000 and $25,000 in the coming months amid increasing demand. Despite its recent demand, the price has not achieved its momentum. However, crypto watchers believe there is a momentum build-up that would reflect at an appropriate time. Data from SosoValue show that spot ETH ETFs experienced significant demand in the past few days. As of December 2024, the spot ETH ETF recorded a total inflow of $2.51 billion. Notably, on December 24 alone, the daily inflow claimed $53 million of the total value, marking a growing market optimism for the crypto. At the same time, the ETH outflows from exchanges are on the rise, suggesting an ongoing accumulation by large-scale investors.

What was once a fringe interest, dismissed by mainstream financial experts and government regulators, is now a central topic in investment circles and Washington, D.C. policy discussions. The digital asset market, led by Bitcoin, has clearly reached new heights and has garnered interest from retail and, most importantly, institutional investors. The landscape of crypto investment is almost completely different from what was seen in the last 5 years, and the momentum looks very sustainable. Bitcoin at $100,000: Once a dream, now a nightmare scenario Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in 2024 is undoubtedly the highlight of the year. Bitcoin’s price surged by about 120% since the beginning of the year, but it crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in November. BTC/USDT price chart for the year 2024. Source: TradingView The price uptick came on the back of several catalysts, including the presidential election and the growing acceptance of crypto in traditional financial systems. As of December, Bitcoin’s market capitalization ballooned by nearly $1.7 trillion, per Coingecko data . Analysts, including Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, predict Bitcoin could top $200,000 before the end of 2025, with more institutional investments expected as the market matures. The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was a huge turning point for the crypto. The approval of these financial instruments allowed retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning it, essentially democratizing access to the asset. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, once a vocal skeptic of crypto, now recommends that investors allocate up to 2% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, became the fastest-growing ETF in history. As of mid-December, the 11 Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US had amassed $100 billion in assets. A pro-crypto US administration Analysts believe the election of Donald Trump, a self-identified pro-crypto candidate, and the “Red Wave” that saw Republicans take the majority number of seats in Congress, paved the way for the current market bull run. Trump’s campaign and subsequent victory resonated with crypto enthusiasts, especially those advocating for fewer regulations and clearer laws. The President-elect has made it clear that his administration will be friendly to the crypto industry. He has followed through on his pledge to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was seen as an obstacle to crypto innovation, replacing him with Paul Atkins, a crypto advocate. Since then, Trump has proposed the creation of a “strategic national Bitcoin reserve,” but we aren’t certain it will come true. Many of his appointees, including venture capitalist David Sacks, have the deepest ties to the crypto space. With that, blockchain now has a strong voice in Washington and Wall Street. While it remains to be seen exactly how far the new administration will push pro-crypto legislation , the signals are clear: crypto will have strong support at the highest levels of government. Institutionalization of crypto: ETFs, liquid staking, and the role of Big Money Spot crypto ETFs have made it possible to do what we once dreamed about; traditional investors can now enter the market without having to deal with the complexities of directly purchasing and holding digital assets. “You had folks who would have been allocating to Bitcoin, but because there was no traditionally trusted, easy, efficient way to do it for their circumstances, they weren’t in it,” BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “And then the ETFs changed that.” Meanwhile, the growth of decentralized finance (defi) has been complemented by innovations such as liquid staking, which allows institutional investors to stake assets without locking them up for extended periods. Liquid staking protocols like Lido and EigenLayer have come up with innovative strategies to maximize capital efficiency while offering staking rewards. They have opened up additional opportunities for institutions to engage with digital assets more intimately. Pro-crypto legislation and the road ahead While the regulatory landscape is still in its infancy, 2024 has seen positive steps toward an imperative basis of regulation: the path to clarity. According to industry insiders, these changes could have a much larger impact on altcoins than Bitcoin, which already benefits from a more defined regulatory framework. The upcoming changes to the regulatory environment, which will see Paul Atkins take charge of the US SEC, could usher in a new wave of innovation, with entrepreneurs leveraging blockchain and tokenization technologies to build meaningful, value-added businesses. However, there are still hurdles to overcome. Many traditional financial institutions, like Goldman Sachs, remain cautious about crypto. For them, the stumbling block remains the ongoing uncertainty around regulatory frameworks. “Everyone’s speculating as to how that regulatory framework will evolve, but it’s still unclear how the regulatory framework is going to evolve,” David Solomon, Goldman Sachs CEO, remarked at a Reuters conference. Despite the fears from traditional financial institutions, the optimism surrounding crypto has never been higher, especially in light of the incoming administration’s apparent support. A year of growth and innovation Looking ahead to 2025, the prospects for the digital asset industry are brighter than ever. With a pro-crypto administration and regulatory clarity on the horizon, the space is poised for continued growth. The increasing adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, alongside growing institutional investment in defi and altcoins, sets the stage for a strong year. 2024 was the year that laid the foundation for the crypto revolution, but 2025 will likely be the year when the industry truly matures. Capital flow into the space is increasing, and new innovations are emerging at an accelerating pace. For digital asset enthusiasts and investors alike, the future looks incredibly promising. If increased clarity, a supportive political environment, and rapid institutional adoption become a reality, the digital asset market could change for the better.

Historically, such withdrawals are seen as a bullish indicator, reflecting long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s price. Notably, a similar pattern occurred earlier this year. In January, reserves hit comparable lows, and just two months later, Bitcoin soared to $73,679, achieving a then all-time high. “Periods of significant withdrawals often coincide with positive market momentum,” noted Darkfost. With Bitcoin currently priced at $98,680, some analysts speculate it could follow the same trajectory, potentially reaching $187,500 in the coming months if history repeats itself. Dominance Levels Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market now stands at 58.4%, inching closer to the critical 60% threshold. While this level historically signals Bitcoin’s strength, some analysts warn it could also trigger a shift toward alternative cryptocurrencies. Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, predicted earlier this year that Bitcoin would test the 60% dominance level by December, a milestone achieved on October 30. Whether this trend persists remains to be seen as market dynamics evolve. Despite its current strength, Bitcoin has struggled to sustain prices above the psychological $100,000 mark . After hitting a record high of $108,300 on December 17, Bitcoin’s value has been trading below $100,000 since December 19. Future Bitcoin Price Projections Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, attributes Bitcoin’s current downtrend to the seasonal volatility typical of the Christmas period. However, he expects market activity to rebound in the coming weeks as funds reposition themselves ahead of key political events, including Donald Trump’s inauguration. “Post-Christmas, we usually see a spike in trading activity,” said Lee. “Bitcoin is likely to trade within the $94,000 to $105,000 range, with the possibility of exceeding $105,000 once liquidity returns.” As Bitcoin’s price consolidates under $100,000, market participants are watching closely to see if the new year will bring another historic rally.

XRP: Fast and Open Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that runs on the XRP Ledger, designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. It enables borderless and secure transactions without a central authority or bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, formerly OpenCoin Inc., was given 80 billion XRP to develop the ecosystem further, placing 55 billion in escrow to control supply. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payments across different currencies. Its technology offers potential for transforming international transactions, making it an important player in the cryptocurrency space. In the current market cycle, XRP continues to draw attention for its utility in global payments. Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano, with its native cryptocurrency ADA, is a flexible blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. It facilitates the development of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Cardano stands out for its environmentally sustainable approach, using the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism for energy efficiency, unlike the energy-intensive proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts—enhancing its transaction processing capability potentially up to a million transactions per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. In the current market cycle, ADA continues to rival Ethereum’s ETH in enabling users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Conclusion XRP is projected to stabilize at $2, and ADA shows limited short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN appeals to those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of its presale and potential for massive returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, building a community of leaders and offering real benefits to early adopters.

38143883,https://invezz.com/?p=2405784,1735221600,This alternative token to Solana (SOL) valued at $0.15 will skyrocket into the top 10 list in 112 days,"Once praised as a game-changer in the blockchain field, Solana (SOL) has since come under significant downward pressure due to market changes. Its price has decreased below $200, which aligns with a pessimistic trend. The crypto market is wondering whether it may recover its previous splendor. Although Solana’s chances of a return are still under discussion, a fresh competitor called Rexas Finance (RXS) has surfaced as one token ready to disrupt the market. At barely $0.150 right now, Rexas Finance is attracting much attention since experts project it might rise into the top 10 cryptocurrencies in 100 days or less. Solana’s recent market challenges Offering high-performance capabilities and scalability that have drawn developers and investors, Solana has become a trademark of blockchain innovation. However, macroeconomic events, notably the most recent US Federal Reserve rate drop, have affected its price. Solana’s price dropped considerably during the previous week, going below the $200 level in over a month. Key technical signals pointing to Solana’s possible comeback have drawn attention from crypto experts, including Ali Martinez. The token tries to find a significant support zone between $188 and $179, a traditionally robust resistance level. Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic RSI suggest that Solana may be oversold and provide the conditions for a comeback. Notwithstanding these signals, the general market mood and residual negative influences cast doubt on Solana’s capacity to find ground over $200. Why Rexas Finance is gaining traction Solana struggles with market conditions, but Rexas Finance is rapidly becoming a good substitute for those looking for explosive development. Rexas Finance specializes in tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWA), which lets users tokenize physical objects like real estate, luxury items, and fine art. This creative solution presents a compelling use case by democratizing access to traditionally dominated by institutional investors and high-value asset markets. Rexas Finance appeals mostly because it can solve actual financial inefficiencies. The platform improves liquidity, lowers transaction costs, and streamlines asset ownership processes. These benefits help Rexas Finance close the gap between conventional finance and blockchain technology. With RXS coins only $0.15 during its presale, the project draws many investors ready to profit from its expansion possibilities. In its presale stages, Rexas Finance set amazing records: it has sold 375,948,845 tokens and raised $32,517,669 in stage 10. The strong reaction emphasizes the growing faith among institutional and individual investors in the initiative’s possible success. Unlike speculative tokens, Rexas Finance provides a real-use case that appeals to investors looking for long-term value. Analysts estimate that Rexas Finance, driven by its creative platform and fast-growing user base, may become one of the top ten cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization within 100 days. Major crypto tracking sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have noticed the initiative, increasing its profile in a saturated industry. Rexas Finance has also prioritized security, which is important for building investor confidence. Leading blockchain security company CertiK recently examined the platform to ensure its smart contracts are strong and safe. This certification helps Rexas Finance stand out from other developing projects by adding another degree of legitimacy. Why Rexas Finance (RXS) could outperform Solana Solana is still a major participant in the blockchain scene, but its recent price fluctuation has raised questions about its short-term viability. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, presents a different story and a methodical technique for handling practical financial difficulties. By focusing on RWA tokenization, Rexas Finance is establishing a special place in the market, which early adopters could find quite profitable. The $0.150 entrance price for RXS tokens also offers a compelling prospect for investors who might have missed Solana’s early profits. Given its presale momentum and growing acceptance, Rexas Finance can yield earnings on par with Solana’s explosive climb in 2021. Although the cryptocurrency market is known to be volatile, Rexas Finance is one initiative with a clear goal and sensible uses. While Solana fights to recover past highs, Rexas Finance is quickly rising as a prominent competitor in the blockchain industry. With its creative platform, excellent presale performance, and increasing investor confidence, Rexas Finance is well on its way to ranking among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the not-too-distant future. Rexas Finance presents a compelling offer to anyone looking for the next significant crypto market opportunity. With just $0.150, this other token to Solana could change the investing scene and provide substantial returns in the following months.

Animoca, a metaverse and gaming venture capital firm, posted a warning on its own account at 01:36 UTC on Thursday saying Siu's account had been compromised and the company was not introducing an official token or non-fungible token (NFT).   The exploit was probably perpetrated through a phishing email that purported to come from X and be related to copyright infringement, according to ZachXBT. The crypto exploit investigator posted on Tuesday about several similar attacks that took place over the past month, allowing the perpetrators to get away with about $500,000 at the time.  The false post from Siu's account promoted a token named MOCA on the Solana blockchain, according to a screenshot posted by ZachXBT.   Moca Foundation, a ""community-owned foundation that aims to supercharge Mocaverse’s network effects,"" has its own Moca Coin (MOCA), which it describes as an ""omni-chain network token."" Mocaverse is an account and ID management system in which both Animoca and Siu personally have a stake,   According to a post from Mocaverse, control of Siu's account has been secured by X, which is in the process of verifying ownership. Related accounts remain untouched.  ""There is no compromise on Animoca Brands, Moca Network or MOCA Foundation official handles, and there are strict security measures in place,"" it said.

As they continue to show signs of recovery, BGB leads the current daily surge with 17% gains in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent crackdown across the crypto space, BGB showed signs of strength with a back-to-back gain in the past weeks. It pushed above $5 this week and is now on the verge of taking $7. Looks highly bullish on the daily chart. While the bulls currently appear more formidable amid dominance, the price is expected to close strong this week. Although the current market drop may affect this target price if supply increases. However, it is crucial to note that this ongoing bullish move was mainly initiated in October after a flash crash to the $0.53 level. Looking back from there to where it currently trades, BGB has seen a staggering gain. That said, the daily bias is still considered bullish following a higher high and higher low pattern on the 4-hour chart. Failure to sustain this pattern may result in a major retracement. For now, it remains under the bulls’ radar.

Steph cited data from the analytics platform CryptoQuant. The chart he shared depicted that XRP's maximum supply of 100 billion is seeing a sharp decrease in recent years. In contrast to the decline in available supply, the price of XRP has been on a strong upward trajectory.Accordingly, Steph suggested that demand for XRP is rising sharply. He asserted that the next price movement of XRP could be explosive and that it is only a matter of time before such an explosion occurs.Notably, XRP has been in a bearish trend over the past three weeks, and this analyst used the token's decreasing supply as a basis to argue for a major bull rally.Is XRP Supply Really Shrinking?However, it is important to note that while the shared chart depicted a strong declining pattern in XRP's total supply , the actual figures tell a slightly different story.In particular, out of XRP's 100 billion supply, only 13,275,691 XRP, or 13.27 million tokens, have been destroyed and permanently removed from circulation. As a result, XRP's total supply still stands at a staggering 99.986 billion tokens.

Yet, it is growing quickly again toward the 3 billion mark. Besides, the current figure mirrors the volume that has been on Binance for most of 2024.

Similarly, Ethereum's supply on exchanges, which was at 20.66 million a year ago, dropped to 18.6 million in September. While it is now back at 19 million, the overall trend shows a steep decline.Likewise, Bitcoin, which started the year with 3.07 million BTC tokens on exchanges, has seen this number drop to 2.42 million.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DOGEN, the new alpha meme token, is captivating investors with projected 700% presale growth and potential for thousand-fold returns, redefining the meme coin landscape. Table of Contents DOGEN: The first meme token for alpha males Dogecoin: Meme-based crypto with growing potential PEPE: The deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the frog Conclusion As the festive season approaches, a new cryptocurrency is capturing the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. Investors in Dogecoin and PEPE are now focusing on DOGEN, a digital asset rumored to offer monumental returns. Is this the next breakout star with potential for extraordinary growth? The excitement is building as more eyes turn to this emerging coin. DOGEN: The first meme token for alpha males Designed for those who dream big, DOGEN is built for winners who demand the best. According to the team, this isn’t just a token; it’s a ticket to the Alpha DOGEN lifestyle. DOGEN is taking off with a projected 700% surge by the end of its presale, and that’s just the beginning. As meme tokens dominate this altcoin season, DOGEN stands out with the potential for legendary thousand-fold returns. Getting in early is the ultimate power move. While others watch from the sidelines, DOGEN holders will be leading the pack and setting the trends that others can only hope to follow. DOGEN is the new alpha in the Solana meme token ecosystem, joining the ranks of giants like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, all of which have delivered astonishing 1000% gains. Undervalued and under the radar, DOGEN is primed to redefine the narrative and make its mark in the upcoming bull run. The dedicated team behind DOGEN is focused on creating a thriving, long-lasting community of alpha leaders who dominate the crypto space. From exclusive campaigns to early adopter perks, DOGEN provides tangible value to its holders and proves it’s here to stay. DOGEN’s multi-level referral program is as fierce as its vision. Earn 7% from every token direct recruits (1st level) purchase using a referral code, and watch profits multiply as referrals bring in even more users. Investors can now become a part of something that lasts and conquer the market with DOGEN. Dogecoin: Meme-based crypto with growing potential Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “meme coin,” it gained significant value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This surge was driven by social media influence, especially from Elon Musk, and the broader crypto market boom. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a joke, Dogecoin shows the power of community and social media. In the current market cycle, its growing popularity and active community might make Dogecoin an attractive option for those interested in cryptocurrency. PEPE: The deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Aiming to emulate the success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE sets itself apart by eliminating transaction taxes and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. It reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts. The project’s roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, contributing to its stability. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum’s security. In the current market cycle, PEPE’s unique features may appeal to those interested in memecoins. Conclusion While DOGE and PEPE have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth before presale ends and possible thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows the success of BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It builds a community of alpha leaders and offers real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

It currently appears weak on the day following a slight 3% loss. Last week trading ended very painfully for LTC after witnessing a serious crackdown during the week, although it found a temporal threshold after a sharp bounce and started this week’s trading on a recovery mode. That brought a relief in the past few days until it taps a key level. The recovery stalled due to a rejection and the price falls, looking weak on the intraday trading. A drop below the pschological $100 level could cause another serious correction capable of plunging the price to the $70 region or even beyond before locating a strong level for a rebound. Adjusting to the 4-hour chart, it is still following a lower low and lower high pattern. Failure to bounce back may lead to a massive market reset. But looking at the current market structure, LTC remains bullish in the mid-term despite the temporal correction – which currently appears healthy for the market as it reaccumulates for a bigger upward rally. We can expect that to happen when it finds a strong threshold. LTC’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As LTC slowly resumes correction, it must successfully plunge through the mentioned psychological level to last week’s $87 low before dipping to $78. The key support below this level is $70. If the price increases above the $114.3 resistance that broke as support last week, we can expect more recovery to the $131.5 resistance along with the $147 resistance that halted buying weeks back. A break there would confirm a new bullish rally.

The government of Ukraine has unveiled plans to impose “sanctions and other solutions” aimed at blocking Russia ‘s use of Bitcoin ( BTC ) for international payments, just a day after Russia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov publicly confirmed that Russian companies are already using crypto to evade Western sanctions. Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an advisor to the Ukrainian president, said that Ukraine had already alerted its international partners to Russia’s intentions earlier this year and that measures to prevent unwanted crypto payments are already in development, Ukrainska Pravda reports . “Are we at all surprised? No, we were, without exaggeration, the first to draw our partners’ attention to such plans of the enemy back in the summer. Appropriate sanctions and other solutions to block the possibility of using unwanted cryptocurrency payments are already being prepared.” Vladyslav Vlasiuk You might also like: Vladimir Putin: Bitcoin can’t be stopped Russia seeks Plan B Russia has been looking for ways to get around sanctions that have impacted its ability to make and receive international payments, even with countries like China. As crypto.news reported earlier , Russian companies have turned to using stablecoins like Tether’s ( USDT ) to carry out cross-border transactions. Some of Russia’s largest metal producers have started using stablecoins for trade with Chinese clients, though details on the volume of these trades are unclear. Sources have said that other alternatives are much slower or could risk having an overseas bank account frozen. Siluanov’s admission comes just a few months after the Kremlin established a legal framework for Bitcoin miners, which includes a provision allowing approved companies to use crypto for international trade.

The rally, however, stalled at just above $99,800 as Asia opened for business on Thursday morning and declined rapidly to roughly $95,000 only a few hours later.  Bitcoin at press time was trading at $95,300, down 3.1% over the past 24 hours.  The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by 4.2% over the same time frame, with ETH, SOL, XRP, ADA and AVAX among cryptos in that gauge sporting 4%-7% losses.  U.S. markets are open on Thursday, and stock index futures are pointing to modest early losses; gold and oil are marginally in the green.  Crypto's price action over the past 48 hours is surely on very low volume and bitcoin has still more than doubled year-to-date, but perhaps overlooked in declines over the past week is that the tailwind of lower interest rates might have become a headwind.  The 10-year Treasury yield continued to drift upward early Thursday, now at 4.63% and within a few basis points of its 2024 high. The yield is now ahead by nearly 100 basis points since the Federal Reserve slashed benchmark short-term rates by 50 basis points in September.  Macro researcher Jim Bianco noted that the swift move upward in long-term rates following a Fed rate cut is nearly unprecedented in modern monetary history. ""The bond market will keep selling (higher yields) the more the Fed talks about rate cuts in 2025,"" said Bianco. ""If the Fed does not back off the rate-cutting talk, bond yields will go as high as needed to start breaking things, to break inflation.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/26/bitcoin-returns-to-95-k-as-christmas-rally-snuffed-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e79981dd265f43b22546a55d5a954113e18747b-3024x4032.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here are All the Need-to-Know Details,"Once seen as a far-fetched idea, a proposal to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction in the United States, with the support of former President Donald Trump. While proponents see it as a bold step toward securing America’s financial future, critics argue it could jeopardize Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and lead to complex economic challenges. The concept of a national Bitcoin reserve was introduced by Dennis Porter, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, a nonprofit organization founded in 2022 to advocate for Bitcoin adoption at the state and federal levels. Once a small idea, the proposal gained momentum after Trump publicly supported it during a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, in July. Appearing on CNBC earlier this month, Trump expressed support for the idea when asked if the federal government envisioned a strategic cryptocurrency reserve similar to oil reserves. “I think so,” Trump replied, adding, “We’re going to do great things in crypto.” Porter sees Trump's support as a turning point that has encouraged other politicians to embrace the concept. Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has emerged as a leading advocate of a federal Bitcoin reserve. This summer, she introduced a bill that would have the U.S. government purchase 1 million Bitcoins over five years. Lummis argues that such a move could help solve the national debt, which has reached $36 trillion, and cement America’s leadership in financial innovation. “My generation has spent federal dollars without limits for years,” Lummis said. “A strategic Bitcoin reserve gives us the chance to pay off nearly half of our national debt in the next 20 years and ensure we remain a leader in 21st century finance.” The idea has gained bipartisan support, with Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California proposing that Bitcoin seized from criminal activity be held by the government as part of its reserves rather than sold immediately. Lummis’ plan to fund Bitcoin purchases involves revaluing the United States’ gold reserves, which are currently priced at $42 per ounce, well below the market rate of around $2,650 per ounce. By adjusting the valuation, the government could theoretically make a paper profit from financing Bitcoin purchases without issuing new debt or increasing taxes. Related News: How Will January Go in Cryptocurrencies? How is the Market Sentiment? But critics say the approach is not without consequences. Monetary economist George Selgin described the plan as a “backdoor loan” that relies on financial maneuvers to bypass traditional appropriations processes. The proposal has faced significant backlash from Bitcoin proponents who see government intervention as contrary to BTC’s original vision of decentralization. Mark Goodwin, editor-in-chief of Bitcoin Magazine, has expressed concerns that a state-controlled Bitcoin reserve could hinder BTC’s development as a decentralized currency and overpower the traditional financial system. Kathryn Austin Fitts, a former investment banker and federal official, argued that the plan benefits wealthy Bitcoin holders by creating a guaranteed recipient. She lamented that Bitcoin, once conceived as a revolutionary payments system, has morphed into what she called a “pump-and-dump financial product.” Despite the criticism, Porter and his team have continued to push the idea at both the federal and state levels. Last week, Texas introduced a bill to create a state-level Bitcoin reserve, and similar proposals have emerged in Pennsylvania and Ohio. According to Porter, the fight for Bitcoin reserves is about much more than economics. “Bitcoin is too important to give up on this fight,” he said. US President Donald Trump, who supports the idea, will take office on January 20. *This is not investment advice.

38143881,https://invezz.com/?p=2406050,1735220398,"Coinbase, Ripple bosses see massive wealth surge post Trump’s victory: report","The recent US elections have delivered significant financial windfalls for leaders in the crypto space, with some seeing their fortunes soar by billions. A report by CoinDesk reveals that key players such as Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong and Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse have experienced massive gains following Trump’s victory. The surge in cryptocurrency values, driven by renewed investor optimism and political shifts, has bolstered the wealth of these executives while simultaneously elevating the market capitalisation of their companies. Coinbase’s Armstrong gains $2 billion in wealth Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has reaped extraordinary benefits following the elections, largely due to strategic sales of company stock. According to SEC filings, Armstrong’s stock sales alone netted $129 million, while Coinbase’s market value surged by $21 billion. His personal stake in Coinbase, held through a trust, has ballooned by nearly $2 billion, now standing at $6.4 billion. Coinbase’s involvement in the elections was notable, with the company donating $25 million to the super political action committee (PAC) Fairshake, a contribution matched by Armstrong’s personal donations. In total, Coinbase and its CEO allocated $74 million to political funding, equalling contributions from Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Armstrong has publicly framed his stock sales as part of a diversification strategy, enabling investments in high-risk ventures while retaining a substantial 10% stake in Coinbase, comprising approximately 24 million shares. Ripple’s XRP surges 54% Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has similarly seen his wealth grow exponentially after the elections. Ripple’s native token, XRP, soared from $0.50 to $2.32, delivering a 54.7% gain within a month, according to CoinMarketCap. This price spike propelled XRP’s market capitalisation, making it the third-largest digital asset globally. The increase in XRP’s value has tripled the value of Garlinghouse’s holdings, which include over 6% of Ripple and an undisclosed quantity of XRP tokens. This dramatic growth has positioned Garlinghouse among the top billionaires in the United States, with his wealth mirroring the broader recovery in the crypto market, which has added over $1 trillion in value since the elections. Ripple’s substantial political contributions also played a role in its elevated profile. The company donated $73 million, with some funds reserved for the 2026 election cycle. Andreessen Horowitz outpaces its investments Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm known for its substantial crypto investments, also benefitted from the post-election market rally. Co-founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz had stakes in several blockchain companies that surged in value after the election. Their total gains far exceeded the $70 million they contributed to US political campaigns, highlighting the outsized returns available in the crypto sector under favourable market conditions. The CoinDesk report emphasised that these developments underscore the interplay between political landscapes and financial markets. The surge in cryptocurrency values and increased market activity have provided a windfall for those at the helm of major firms like Coinbase, Ripple, and a16z, reflecting the broader implications of political outcomes on wealth generation in emerging industries.

38142203,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633509,1735220360,Bloomberg says Tether will collapse due to association with president Trump,"Bloomberg is back to doing what it does best: pushing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). This time, the target is Tether, the crypto industry’s biggest stablecoin issuer, and the ammunition is Donald Trump’s presidency. Bloomberg’s latest editorial predicts what’ll happen when Trump’s crypto-friendly policies collide with Tether’s controversial practices. But let’s just call this what it is — an attack on crypto, laced with political undertones. It’s not the first one this month either. Tether acts as a digital dollar, providing traders a safe haven from unstable local currencies and other volatile cryptos. It’s supposed to be simple: for every Tether token issued, there’s an actual dollar in reserve. But Bloomberg doesn’t buy it. According to the editorial, Tether operates more like a dodgy offshore bank than a transparent financial institution. Its reserves reportedly include Bitcoin, risky loans, and investments nobody can seem to fully identify. Add shady associations to the formula. Over the years, Tether’s name has popped up in investigations involving everyone from North Korean hackers to Irish gangsters and Hamas operatives. Bloomberg points to these links in accusing Tether of enabling billions of dollars to move in and out of the criminal underworld. Trump makes Tether even bigger Admittedly, Trump’s administration is already too cozy with Tether. His pick for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has direct ties to the stablecoin issuer via his company Cantor Fitzgerald, which owns a 5% stake in Tether, earning millions in custody fees and pushing for plans to lend billions against Bitcoin. For Bloomberg, this is the beginning of the end. It argues that the deeper Tether integrates with Wall Street, the higher the chances of a catastrophic fallout. Trading volume exploded after Trump’s election, with Tether moving $4.6 trillion in November alone. What’s worse, the news outlet argues that Tether’s continued growth could turn a crypto crash into a full-blown financial crisis. Imagine if Tether’s reserves—already packed with risky assets—collapse. Bloomberg warns this could drag down firms like Cantor and infect traditional financial markets. But wait, it gets juicier. Bloomberg accuses Tether of being a tool for crime. Federal prosecutors have had their eyes on the company for years, and the Treasury Department has floated the idea of sanctions to remove it from American markets altogether. Tether, for its part, denies any wrongdoing and insists its reserves are fully backed. Still, with Trump back in the Oval, Bloomberg argues that Tether could flourish in a way that makes these alleged risks impossible to ignore. Bloomberg slams Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plan Bloomberg isn’t just targeting Tether, as aforementioned. They’ve got a bone to pick with Trump’s rumored Bitcoin reserve plan too. The idea, backed by Trump and first created by crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis , involves the U.S. government holding onto 200,000 confiscated Bitcoins—worth $20 billion—and buying another million over five years. Supporters compare it to the country’s strategic petroleum reserve, which stockpiles oil for emergencies. However, Bloomberg published an editorial earlier this month calling it “the biggest crypto scam yet.” It argues that Bitcoin has no industrial use, no intrinsic value, and no connection to the real economy. In the news outlet’s eyes, it’s nothing more than a speculative asset, with its value entirely dependent on market hype. According to Bloomberg, a government Bitcoin reserve would enrich early holders, inflate the price, and leave taxpayers holding the bag. Funding the purchases would mean either borrowing more money—adding to the national debt—or printing more money, fueling inflation. And if Bitcoin’s price tanks, the reserve could end up worthless, leaving the government with a pile of useless digital tokens. Bloomberg also warns that a Bitcoin reserve could push banks deeper into crypto. Imagine banks lending dollars against Bitcoin collateral, only to panic when prices drop. The media giant says this could lead to another financial crisis, complete with bailouts and taxpayer-funded rescues. And the irony is not lost on Bloomberg either. Bitcoin was supposed to be about freedom from governments and banks. Yet here we are, with centralized financial institutions lobbying for subsidies and government backing. Bloomberg calls it the ultimate betrayal of Bitcoin’s original vision. And it’s not wrong. Bloomberg’s bias and political games Here’s the thing, though: Bloomberg’s motivation might have more to do with bitter politics than the Satoshi gospel. The company, owned by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, has a history of taking potshots at both. You see, Michael is a Democrat and a longtime Trump critic who hates crypto. He even ran for president in 2020 on a platform that included a heavy campaign against crypto. So, it’s no surprise that Bloomberg’s editorial board is now going after Trump’s crypto policies with a vengeance. But while Bloomberg’s warnings might scare some, they don’t tell the whole story. Tether and Bitcoin have survived worse. The crypto industry thrives on uncertainty, and every time someone declares its demise, it comes back stronger. As for Trump, he’s not likely to back down. We doubt the self-proclaimed “crypto president” ever even thinks about Michael Bloomberg.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tether-will-collapse-with-president-trump/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38142203.jpeg

38143880,https://invezz.com/?p=2406038,1735220144,"Japan shelves Bitcoin Reserves plans, citing lack of information","Japan is putting plans for a national Bitcoin reserve aside at the moment due to a lack of information and concerns over volatility. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has clarified the government’s stance on the matter in response to an enquiry from Satoshi Hamada, a member of the House of Councilors from the Party to Protect the People from NHK. Hamada was enquiring about the government’s opinion on whether the country should follow in the footsteps of nations like the United States in adopting Bitcoin as an asset for its foreign currency reserves. In response, the government said it was not fully aware of the measures being taken by the US and other countries. Notably, discussions regarding the adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset remain in the early stages all across the globe, making it difficult for Japan to present an official stance at this time. Ishiba also clarified that Japan does not classify cryptocurrencies as foreign exchange assets, and its foreign currency reserves are primarily aimed at stabilising foreign currency-denominated assets and the foreign bond market. The reserves are managed under a Special Account framework, which prioritises safety and liquidity and, as a result, is deterring the government from adding risk assets. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are viewed as incompatible assets due to their high volatility and unpredictable price fluctuations. While Japan has chosen to tread these waters lightly, the US Federal Reserve has gone out to clarify it cannot hold Bitcoin . However, incoming President Donald Trump and several Republican lawmakers have pushed for the establishment of a Bitcoin-backed reserve. Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill earlier this year, dubbed the BITCOIN Act of 2024, which proposes that the US treasury acquire 1 million BTC over five years and establish a national Bitcoin reserve. Proponents claim Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation, reduce the national debt, and strengthen the position of the US as a global financial leader. Cryptocurrencies remain in focus Crypto remains a key area of focus in Japan despite the government’s current stance, and regulators have continued to push for measures that foster the economy as the nation has witnessed a surge in crypto adoption. Last month, the government agreed to consider tax reforms on crypto assets, including a proposal to lower the tax rate on cryptocurrency gains to 20% from the current 55%, aligning them with stock market profits. Prime Minister Ishiba has also vowed to use blockchain technology and NFTs as tools to strengthen the island nation’s economy, confirming the nation’s pro-crypto approach. Amid this backdrop, Japanese businesses have shown a keen interest in holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets to counter the effects of the nation’s economic challenges.

As investors shift focus toward innovative projects with practical utility and scalability, tokens like Lightchain AI (LCAI) , Ethereum (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL) are emerging as top picks. Each of these tokens represents unique opportunities for portfolio diversification, blending technology innovation, community-driven growth, and real-world application. Lightchain AI AI-Blockchain Convergence Lightchain AI (LCAI) is capturing attention with its innovative fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale , Lightchain AI offers a low-risk entry point for investors seeking exposure to the booming AI sector. The platform supports AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) that cater to industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its focus on developer collaboration, offering tools like APIs, SDKs, and testing environments to foster innovation. With a testnet launch scheduled for January 2025, analysts predict that Lightchain AI’s multi-industry adaptability could propel it to exponential growth, making it a frontrunner in the altcoin space. Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana Smart Contract Platforms Ethereum, Polkadot and Solana is well-kno͏wn smart deal places, each gives special traits. Ethereum, began in 2015, was first with smart deals and holds a big group of not-central apps. Even with its wide use it has met problems with growth leading to higher fees for each deal. Polkadot, made by Ethereum's co-maker Gavin Wood, looks at joining together, helping many blockchains to work well with each other. Its special design lets for side-by-side deal handling, boosting scale. Solana is distinguished by its high throughput, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, thanks to its combination of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms. This design results in low transaction fees, making it attractive for high-frequency applications. Each platform addresses the blockchain trilemma—scalability, security, and decentralization—in distinct ways, catering to diverse developer and user needs. Dogecoin Resilient Meme Coin Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to defy expectations as a community-driven cryptocurrency with real-world adoption. Known for its loyal following and viral appeal, DOGE has found practical use cases, including payments for goods and services. As the broader crypto market matures, Dogecoin’s simplicity and active community ensure its relevance in the altcoin space. While it lacks the technological depth of projects like Lightchain AI or Ethereum, DOGE’s speculative appeal and strong network effect make it a potential candidate for another surge in 2025. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38143879,https://invezz.com/?p=2406039,1735219995,SBI VC Trade to acquire DMM Bitcoin assets after the $320M BTC hack fallout,"In a significant shakeup within Japan’s cryptocurrency landscape, DMM Bitcoin, once a burgeoning crypto exchange, has announced its closure following a devastating security breach. Back in May 2024, DMM Bitcoin suffered what has been termed as one of Japan’s largest crypto leaks, with hackers making off with over 4,500 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $320 million at the time of the incident. This breach led to a domino effect of service restrictions, ultimately culminating in the decision to wind down operations. Unpacking the DMM Bitcoin Hack The hack , initially described by DMM Bitcoin as an “unauthorized leak,” was later traced to a server breach and a private key hack. The breach was particularly damaging due to its scale; cyber attackers managed to siphon off more than 4,502.9 BTC from a single wallet, leading to a temporary halt in all services including withdrawals, new account openings, and trading. The aftermath saw DMM Bitcoin grappling with recovery efforts, promising full compensation for customer deposits through the support of its parent company and other group firms. However, things have taken an unexpected turn after the National Police Agency of Japan on Tuesday, December 24, 2024, linked the hack to the notorious North Korean hacking group TraderTraitor. The National Police Agency of Japan stated that the fraudulent transfer of crypto assets from a cold wallet developed and provided by Ginco Inc., which DMM Bitcoin used, was carried out by TraderTraitor, a cyber attack group backed by North Korea. SBI VC Trade to the rescue SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of the financial conglomerate SBI Holdings, will acquire DMM Bitcoin’s customer accounts and assets . This acquisition, scheduled to be finalized on Saturday, March 8, 2025, marks a strategic move by SBI to expand its footprint in Japan’s crypto market while offering a lifeline to DMM Bitcoin’s affected user base. Following the acquisition, SBI VC Trade has assured that all customer assets, including both fiat and crypto, will be safeguarded during this transition. The acquisition includes plans for SBI VC Trade to start handling 14 cryptocurrency trading pairs not previously supported by them, which were available on DMM Bitcoin. This expansion aims to ensure a seamless transition for DMM’s customers, maintaining the diversity of trading options they were accustomed to. This deal will not only facilitate the recovery for DMM users but also strengthen SBI’s position in the cryptocurrency trading sector, which is still reeling from the effects of the hack. The move is seen by many as a bullish sign for crypto investors in Japan, providing a sense of stability after a tumultuous period. This acquisition by SBI VC Trade, while it marks the closure of DMM Bitcoin, opens a new chapter in Japan’s crypto narrative, emphasizing the importance of robust security measures and the potential for recovery and growth even in the wake of significant setbacks. It not only salvages the situation for DMM Bitcoin’s users but also signals a potential uptick in consolidation within the Japanese crypto market, where security and trust remain paramount.

Positioned as a revolutionary force in the PropFi (Property Finance) sector, Lightchain AI’s unique capabilities and innovative roadmap are setting it apart. Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale , the token is rapidly gaining traction as a promising investment for 2025. Why Ethereum And Cardano Investors Are Rotating Funds Ethereum and Cardano are old favorites for blockchain investors, due to their new tech and systems. Yet, both networks have problems͏ that affect how people invest. Ethereum, even with its switch to Proof of Stake and Layer-2 fixes, still has high gas costs and network crowding. In the same way, Cardano’s slow growth rate, based on serious study work, has caused hold ups in ecosystem expansion. Money givers are now looking for tasks that mix growth, use, and new ideas. Lightchain AI, with its aim on PropFi options and real-life uses offers a new choice that fits the rising need for blockchain tasks with real-world, many industry uses. Lightchain AI’s PropFi Focus Captures Investor Interest Lightchain AI is drawing attention for its innovative focus on PropFi (Property Finance), leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence to transform real estate transactions. By streamlining processes such as property listing verification, transaction management, and secure documentation, Lightchain AI creates a seamless, transparent ecosystem for buyers, sellers, and investors. This focus on PropFi enables the integration of decentralized governance and smart contracts, reducing reliance on intermediaries and lowering transaction costs. Moreover, Lightchain AI's commitment to transparency fosters trust in a traditionally opaque industry, enhancing user confidence and scalability. Investors are particularly intrigued by Lightchain AI's potential to disrupt property finance, providing new avenues for investment while addressing inefficiencies in the current real estate market. This strategic vision makes it a standout player in blockchain innovation. Is Lightchain AI the Breakout Token of 2025? With its presale price of $0.0041 and a clear roadmap for adoption, Lightchain AI is being hailed as a ground-floor opportunity for investors seeking exponential returns. Analysts predict that its focus on PropFi, coupled with its broader applications across healthcare, logistics, and finance, positions it as a leader in the next wave of blockchain growth. While Ethereum and Cardano will likely maintain their dominance in certain niches, the shift toward specialized solutions like PropFi is driving Lightchain AI into the spotlight. By 2025, Lightchain AI could become a cornerstone of the PropFi sector, delivering the breakout performance investors are seeking in the blockchain market. So, is Lightchain AI 2025's breakout star? Yes, it certainly has the potential to be. With a solid team, innovative technology, and a clear focus on real-world use cases, Lightchain AI is setting itself up for success in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Ryan Salame, a former top executive at the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX , reported to federal prison in October to begin serving his 7.5-year sentence for his role in the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried ‘s multi-billion-dollar crypto empire. However, according to a Business Insider report , Salame’s release date has suddenly been moved up by more than a year. Federal Bureau of Prisons records show that Salame is now set to be released on March 1, 2031, just over a year earlier than his original sentence. Salame pleaded guilty to criminal charges in May 2023 and began his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland. He was deeply involved in Bankman-Fried’s operations and was among other FTX executives who pleaded guilty in connection with the fraud scheme. While the exact reason behind the sentence shortage remains unclear, the report noted that Salame’s attorneys didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Salame also became the CEO of FTX’s Bahamas subsidiary. In 2022, FTX crashed due to mismanagement of funds, lack of liquidity and the large volume of withdrawals. FTX filed for bankruptcy as it couldn’t handle all of its customer transactions due to “low liquidity.” Furthermore, the exchange spent customer funds illegally, as well as illegally funded loans and projects of Alameda research. Prosecutors claim that Salame helped FTX accept customer deposits through a U.S. bank account without having the required licenses.

Guarda Wallet: Surviving the test of time Conclusion Managing your investments while traveling the world can be a real headache, especially if you’re constantly moving between time zones, airports, and remote work destinations.

Developed by the team behind the instant crypto exchange ChangeNOW , NOW Wallet is tailored for globetrotters, offering a seamless experience across mobile (Google Play and App Store, with ratings 4.5 and higher) and desktop (macOS, Windows, and Linux) platforms. Best features for travelers: Multi-currency and Multi-network support: NOW Wallet supports over 70 blockchains and 1,500+ tokens, including crypto OGs, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), privacy-focused coins like Monero (XMR) , AI cons such as The Graph (GRT), leading stablecoins , and many more.

For travelers, NOW Wallet provides the ultimate freedom to manage crypto assets wherever life takes you. Its intuitive design and flexibility make it a must-have for those seeking both convenience and security. 2. Trust Wallet: A reliable option Trust Wallet is one of the most popular non-custodial wallets in the crypto space due to its strong brand reputation and straightforward interface.

Multi-currency support : Trust Wallet supports exposure to multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin. NFT integration : Whether you’re collecting or showcasing digital art during your travels, Trust Wallet simplifies NFT management. Built-in exchange : Swap crypto assets without leaving the wallet’s interface. The swaps are designed for quick or last-minute transactions. Browser for dApps: Trust Wallet offers optional access to a dApp browser that provides exposure to decentralized finance platforms, NFT marketplaces, and games. Token staking : Stake selected assets, including Binance Coin and Tron, to earn passive rewards while you travel. Trust Wallet doesn’t offer native desktop support, which might pose an issue for workers who still prefer to operate from a large screen. However, its mobile approach means users can take advantage of smooth crypto management on the go. 3. MetaMask: Convenient access to the web3 universe For crypto users who want to focus on the decentralized web while traveling, MetaMask is the go-to wallet. Best features for travelers: Mobile and browser extension : MetaMask’s mobile app and browser extension offer flexibility to manage crypto assets on the go or from a laptop. EVM compatibility : Manage assets on Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Arbitrum, and other EVM-compatible networks.

Customizable gas fees : Adjust gas fees for transactions to match your urgency. Wallet security : Users can take advantage of advanced wallet security features beyond just a password. This includes a seed phrase, and biometric authentication for added protection. Multi-account management : Create and manage multiple wallets within the app to separate personal, business, or travel-related transactions efficiently. While MetaMask has a reputation for being the top wallet for web3 capabilities, it primarily supports Ethereum and EVM-based networks. This will certainly limit options for users managing multi-chain portfolios. 4. Exodus Wallet: Aesthetics and functionality Exodus Wallet is a perfect choice for travelers who want a wallet offering both aesthetics and functionality characteristics. Best features for travelers: Multi-currency support : Exodus supports most of the popular assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, along with meme coins and stablecoins.

Portfolio tracker : View and monitor your crypto holdings with a user-friendly portfolio tracker that automatically updates asset values in real time. Customer support : Exodus provides responsive customer support through live chat and email to assist users with troubleshooting while traveling. While Exodus delivers a premium user experience, it lacks extensive dApp support compared to rival wallets. Staking features are also limited compared to more staking-focused wallets like NOW Wallet. 5. Guarda Wallet: Surviving the test of time For travelers who need a versatile wallet that works across multiple platforms, Guarda Wallet is an excellent choice. Best features for travelers: Multi-currency support : Guarda supports over 50 blockchains and more than 400,000 tokens, including top coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and privacy-focused coins like Monero. Staking options : Earn passive income while you travel by staking assets like Tron, Cosmos, among others. Fiat integration : Guarda makes it simple to buy crypto using fiat currencies, including credit cards, bank transfers, and credit cards. Cross-platform : Guarda, like many of its rivals, works on mobile, desktop, and web devices. Top-notch security : From wallet encryption to secure backups and multi-signature options, Guarda gives users peace of mind that their funds are always protected. While Guarda’s feature set deserves it a spot in the top five wallets, the user interface will likely feel overwhelming for new users. Advanced users with diversified portfolios that demand a platform that makes it easy to complete transactions in seconds may find an advanced user interface to be more of an inconvenience than a benefit. Conclusion For today’s digital nomads and frequent travelers, managing crypto doesn’t have to be complicated. Non-custodial wallets provide the flexibility, control, and security needed to keep your assets within reach, no matter where you are or how busy your schedule is. From Trust Wallet’s simplicity and MetaMask’s web3 capabilities to Exodus’ sleek interface and Guarda’s versatility, each wallet caters to specific needs. While it is difficult to select a leader among the pack, NOW Wallet can be considered as the ultimate companion for travelers. Its user-friendly platform, support for thousands of assets, features like endless swaps, staking options, and access to a built-in exchange make it a must-have tool for investors of all shapes and sizes who are always on the go.

Saylor’s Vision for 2045 In a video chat with Altcoin Daily analyst Austin, Michael Saylor outlines why Bitcoin could reach $13 million per coin by 2045, focusing on its unique qualities as the “world’s first perfect monetary asset.” Unlike traditional investments like gold, real estate, or stocks, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it a powerful hedge against inflation and market risks. Scarcity is the Key! Saylor highlights Bitcoin’s rarity as its greatest strength. Traditional assets, even scarce ones like gold or waterfront properties, can be reproduced or expanded. Bitcoin’s supply, however, is capped forever. This absolute scarcity gives it unmatched value as a store of wealth, especially in a time when fiat currencies are losing purchasing power. For example, the U.S. dollar has lost 99.9% of its value over the past century, with weaker currencies declining even further. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Advocate Michael Saylor Says He Was Wrong About Ethereum, Here’s Why , Leaving Behind the Rest Bitcoin’s performance over the past decade has been extraordinary. It has grown at an average annual rate of 60%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 15% annual growth. Saylor believes this trend will lead to a massive shift of global wealth—estimated at $500 trillion—from traditional assets like equities, bonds, and real estate into Bitcoin. Despite occasional price dips, Saylor sees these as signs of a maturing market rather than indicators of instability. Institutions are diving into Bitcoin don’t miss out! Read Bitcoin price prediction and stay ahead of the game! Saylor likens Bitcoin’s rise to the unstoppable flow of water downhill. He forecasts its price will increase from $55,000 in 2024 to $13 million by 2045. With its market capitalization growing from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, Bitcoin could become a cornerstone of global wealth. According to Saylor, Bitcoin is set to deliver an annual return of 29% over the next 21 years. Saylor is even bullish on Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve plan and suggested the U.S. adopt a Digital Assets Framework with a Bitcoin reserve, claiming it could generate up to $81 trillion for the national Treasury, reduce the national debt, and give the economy an instant boost. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One standout newcomer is Lightchain , currently in its exciting AI Presale phase, offering unique features and cutting-edge applications that are already turning heads in the crypto community. While XRP excels in cross-border payments and Cardano takes a methodical approach to blockchain development, analysts believe several underrated altcoins like Lightchain have the potential to outpace both by 2025. Here are three such altcoins to watch closely. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Convergence of Blockchain and AI Lightchain AI is where blockchain meets reality, turning tech hype into practical magic across industries. Think finance, healthcare, and supply chain management—all leveled up. In finance, we’re talking secure, speedy transactions and predictive analytics that make decision-making feel like you’ve got a crystal ball. In healthcare , it’s all about locking down patient data and fine-tuning treatment plans for better results (and fewer headaches). As for supply chains? Say goodbye to chaos—hello transparency, efficiency, and delivery tracking that actually works. What makes Lightchain AI the real MVP? Its knack for scaling up and teaming up. By solving real-world problems across multiple sectors, it’s not just building a platform—it’s creating a powerhouse ecosystem that makes blockchain actually useful. Polkadot (DOT) Advancing Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot (DOT) is a trailblazer in blockchain interoperability, allowing multiple blockchains to communicate and share data seamlessly. Its parachain architecture enables developers to create specialized blockchains tailored to specific use cases, fostering an ecosystem of interoperable solutions. Polkadot’s ability to connect different blockchains gives it a competitive edge over XRP and Cardano, which operate within more isolated ecosystems. With new parachains expected to go live in 2025, Polkadot is poised to attract more developers and projects, solidifying its position as a leader in blockchain connectivity. As the demand for cross-chain functionality grows, Polkadot’s innovative approach positions it for substantial growth in the coming years. Avalanche (AVAX) Speed and Efficiency Champion Avalanche (AVAX) is making waves as one of the fastest blockchains out there, handling thousands of transactions per second with impressively low fees. Thanks to its innovative subnet architecture, developers can build customizable blockchain networks tailored to their needs, making it a go-to choice for enterprises and DeFi projects. What sets Avalanche apart? Its laser focus on scalability and efficiency gives it a clear edge over Cardano’s slower, research-heavy approach and XRP’s limited functionality. Looking ahead to 2025, Avalanche is poised for explosive growth, with its speed and flexibility likely to attract big-name partnerships and groundbreaking projects. For investors, Avalanche isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a powerhouse of technical innovation and real-world usability, positioning itself as a serious contender in the crypto market.

The formation of higher lows further emphasizes XRP’s strength and bullish momentum. Calling it “the most bullish-looking chart in the entire crypto space,” CrediBULL Crypto’s confidence in XRP’s next phase has bolstered market sentiment. Analyst’s Strategy: Preparing for the Next Move CrediBULL Crypto plans to re-enter the market with a long position in the coming days, reinforcing the bullish outlook for XRP/BTC. The analyst’s one-hour chart indicates a brief dip might precede a rally of over 65%. Technical indicators also point to an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic signal of a bullish reversal. This pattern often suggests prices are poised to climb, making XRP a key asset to watch. Whale Activity Signals Confidence Amid recent price fluctuations, XRP whales have shown unwavering confidence. During a price dip, they added 40 million tokens, reflecting strong belief in the token’s long-term prospects. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.178, down over 4% in the past 24 hours, while aiming to hold critical support at $2.35 XRP Price Analysis Analysts suggest that breaking through the $2.35 resistance could trigger a rally, pushing XRP to $2.40, $2.50, and eventually $2.65. Beyond these levels, the token might target $2.72 and could even surge to $3.50, setting the stage for a significant price breakout. As XRP consolidates, the market eagerly anticipates its next move. With bullish signals and whale activity aligning, $2.65 may just be the start of a broader rally. Will it live up to the growing expectations?

Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale , Lightchain AI is attracting significant attention for its ability to combine blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) while offering unmatched incentives for its community. Experts are now forecasting that Lightchain AI has the potential to surpass established projects like Avalanche (AVAX) and Nervos Network (CKB) in terms of adoption and growth. Innovative Staking Rewards That Redefine Engagement At the core of Lightchain AI’s appeal is its staking rewards system, designed to foster community participation and ensure network security. Unlike old staking models, Lightchain AI adds AI jobs into its rewards system making it possible for stakers to earn by helping with useful tasks that push the ecosystem ahead. These gifts are more improved by changing perks, which grow as the group gets bigger, making a place where staying over time is very good. For example, Avalanche and Nervos Network have strong staking plans, but they miss the link of smart-driven work that makes Lightchain AI different. This way not only makes sure of sustainability, but also puts͏ Lightchain AI as a leader in using staking for growth and size of the ecosystem. Lightchain AI’s Strategic Advantages Over AVAX and Nervos Both Avalanche (AVAX) and Nervos Network (CKB) have built strong ecosystems focusing on scalability and interoperability. Avalanche’s subnet technology allows for customizable blockchain networks, while Nervos offers a multi-layer approach to ensure universal app access. However, Lightchain AI’s focus on AI integration and its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism provide a distinct competitive edge. By allowing stakers to participate in AI computations, Lightchain AI not only ensures productive engagement but also taps into the rapidly growing demand for AI-driven blockchain solutions. This multi-industry applicability makes Lightchain AI more versatile than Avalanche and Nervos, with potential use cases spanning healthcare, logistics, and finance. Why Experts Predict Lightchain AI Could Outperform Analysts are optimistic about Lightchain AI’s growth trajectory, citing its early-stage presale pricing , multi-industry focus, and game-changing staking model as key factors. The deflationary tokenomics, combined with its commitment to fostering developer collaboration and enterprise partnerships, further solidify its long-term potential. With Avalanche and Nervos Network already established in the market, their growth rates may taper as competition increases. Lightchain AI, on the other hand, offers investors a chance to be part of a rapidly expanding ecosystem with a clear roadmap for scalability and adoption. Experts believe that this combination of innovation and accessibility could allow Lightchain AI to surpass both AVAX and Nervos Network in the coming years, establishing itself as a leading player in the blockchain industry. So join presale now and be part of the Lightchain AI revolution. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Here’s the “silent” addendum: the SEC might warm up to crypto more than we expect. Gensler’s departure marks the end of an era that saw the SEC ramp up enforcement efforts against the crypto industry. His tenure, which was marked by aggressive regulatory actions, will now give way to a new regime under President-elect Donald Trump. The appointment of Paul Atkins, a figure seen as more crypto-friendly, sets the stage for the commission’s new era. The question remains: What does this transition mean for the future of crypto regulation in the US? Gensler’s departure: A bitter goodbye to the crypto “Grinch” Gary Gensler’s time at the SEC has been nothing short of turbulent, especially in the eyes of the cryptocurrency community. From the start, Gensler and his tough stance on crypto initiated a series of enforcement actions against prominent crypto companies, including Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of violating securities laws. His actions were not limited to regulatory notices. Billions of dollars in fines and lawsuits followed, even for the likes of crypto community favorite and Tesla CEO Elon Musk . It’s safe to say no one from the community is sad that he’s leaving. The House of Representatives even said his leadership makes the SEC a “rogue agency.” GARY GENSLER LITERALLY SHAKING when asked if #eth is a security or a commodity and refusing to answer the question pic.twitter.com/GD9lg6cOaT — Tyler Strejilevich (@TylerSCrypto) April 18, 2023 However, Gensler’s resignation doesn’t come solely due to pressure from the crypto industry. While President-elect Trump had promised to fire Gensler on “day one,” he lacked the authority to do so. Gensler’s five-year term runs until 2026. However, it is customary for SEC chairs to resign with a change in administration. His departure has been framed as part of the broader political dynamics surrounding the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration. In a statement announcing his resignation, Gensler defended his record, emphasizing the SEC’s mission to enforce laws and hold wrongdoers accountable. Yet, many in the crypto sector will remember Gensler’s tenure for its focus on enforcement rather than regulatory clarity . Gensler pushed the crypto industry as far as he could The SEC’s regulatory approach under Gensler led to significant friction with the cryptocurrency community. Just months ago, Crypto.com took legal action against the SEC. Today, https://t.co/pFc4Pz9nFR filed suit against the SEC to protect the future of crypto in the U.S.: https://t.co/kXxyhF7zFe — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) October 8, 2024 The company, along with others such as Robinhood and Uniswap, accused the SEC of overreaching in its enforcement of unregistered securities laws. Some argued that the agency’s broad application of securities laws to digital assets lacks proper authority. Advocacy groups and state officials alike have also expressed their frustration with what they saw as an undiplomatic regulatory regime. A group of 18 state attorneys general, including Kentucky, Florida, and Texas, filed a lawsuit against the SEC, accusing the agency of unconstitutional overreach. These attorneys general argue that the SEC’s aggressive stance on crypto infringes upon states’ rights to regulate their own economies, disrupting an industry that has been rapidly growing in both influence and value. At the heart of this dispute is Gensler’s insistence that most cryptocurrencies, aside from Bitcoin and Ethereum, qualify as securities. His stance has created a murky regulatory environment for businesses operating in the space. The lawsuit challenges the SEC’s expansive interpretation of its jurisdiction and argues that the agency’s enforcement actions are harming the very citizens they purport to protect. A new era under Paul Atkins: What’s next for the SEC? With Gensler’s resignation, all eyes turn to Paul Atkins, Trump’s selection to take the helm of the SEC. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, is seen as a stark contrast to Gensler. He is known for his pro-market and pro-innovation stance, and his appointment has been welcomed by many in the crypto industry. President Donald Trump announced Paul Atkins as his selection for the SEC Chief role. Source: X Atkins has long been an advocate for deregulation in certain sectors, and industry leaders see his understanding of crypto as an asset. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, both praised Atkins’ appointment, as they believe the pro-crypto lawyer is the best choice to lead the financial industry forward. “We’ll see an SEC that has clearly different priorities than that of the Gensler SEC,” said Alison Mangiero, executive director of the Proof of Stake Alliance, in an interview with The Block. Atkins is expected to take a more hands-off approach to regulation, focusing on fraud and ensuring investor protection without overburdening the industry with excessive red tape. For many in the crypto sector, this means fewer enforcement actions against companies not involved in fraudulent activities and a shift away from the type of “novel cases” that Gensler’s SEC pursued, often to establish legal precedents. One key area where change could be immediate is in the approval of crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Under Gensler, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs but held back on other digital assets, including Solana and XRP. With Atkins at the helm, there is speculation that the SEC could approve additional crypto ETFs or revisit the issue of staking in ETFs. The future of crypto regulation looks bright, but is it? Atkins’ confirmation could mark the beginning of a new regulatory era for the crypto industry, one that emphasizes clarity over enforcement. However, it is still uncertain how the SEC will handle some of the ongoing rulemaking processes, such as Regulation ATS, which could require decentralized projects to register with the agency. The new leadership at the SEC will have to balance the need for investor protection with the desire to foster innovation. In the meantime, crypto companies are bracing for the final months of Gensler’s tenure. If you are asking whether the regulatory landscape will change, the answer is yes. But if you’re asking when it will, your guess is as good as ours. The community insists Atkins will help the industry adopt a more sensible approach that encourages development and investment without overregulating. As Gensler prepares to leave the SEC and Trump’s administration succeeds “lukewarm on crypto matters” Biden, the crypto sector looks toward a future that, for the first time in years, seems more favorable for financial innovation.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/gary-gensler-economic-crypto-policy-sec-2025/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38141695.jpeg

It is one of the most transformative innovations of the 21st century, revolutionizing industries with its ability to ensure transparency, security, and decentralization. Nonetheless, according to critics, the technology is yet to be proven to solve real-world solutions despite the innovations made in industries such as healthcare, real estate, supply chain management and governance. This may ring true. Despite hundreds of millions of people across the world having used the technology , many still use it for speculation – buying up cryptocurrencies with the hope of becoming instant millionaires in the near future. This article aims to disprove the logic that blockchain technology is only used for speculation purposes. We delve deeper into the utility and rapid innovations in the space, showing you, the reader, how the technology is pushing boundaries beyond traditional applications like cryptocurrencies. The article further discusses the top emerging blockchain trends that will revolutionize technology in 2025, mentioning some of the projects leading this innovation journey. Top Innovative Trends Taking Shape In Blockchain Technology As stated, blockchain technology has been at the forefront of revolutionary technologies in the 21st century. Notwithstanding, the industry itself is witnessing a revolutionary change, with new innovations popping up in the space every couple of months. One of the leading innovations in the space is the rise of interoperability and cross-chain solutions. Over the years, blockchain innovation has suffered from connectivity across networks, with each network siloed in its ecosystem. This has led to liquidity fragmentation, inefficient data communication, and reduced innovation across blockchain ecosystems. As the year turns, interoperability will be a key factor in enabling seamless data exchange and asset transfers across networks. In addition, building efficient cross-chain networks will ensure a robust, interconnected blockchain ecosystem, which is key to enhancing scalability, innovation, and efficiency in a growing blockchain universe. Secondly, the blockchain ecosystem is also witnessing rapid changes in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi), as communities build more scalable and user-friendly platforms. In 2024, DeFi has evolved from simplistic transactions such as borrowing, lending and staking to more complex financial instruments such as restaking, tokenized real-world assets and insurance. The new DeFi 2.0 has the potential to provide even greater financial inclusion to the underbanked and unbanked, as it offers a more secure, accessible and user-friendly experience. Finally, blockchain is slowly amalgamating itself with futuristic technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data to push forward the next generation of innovative products. Merging into these futuristic technologies allows blockchain platforms to be intelligent, adaptive and highly secure. This integration creates solutions capable of analyzing massive datasets, automating processes, and even self-learning. The Top Blockchain Products To Look Out For In 2025 The list above is in no way exhaustive. Several advancements in blockchain are currently being made, including eco-friendly innovations, privacy-enhancing technologies, decentralized governance platforms, enterprise blockchain solutions, staking platforms and more. While several projects could have made it to the list, the following are the projects that we believe will set the trend for blockchain innovation in 2025. From time-based frameworks to decentralized data networks and efficiency-driven consensus mechanisms, the list discusses our top blockchain picks for 2025. Analog One Interoperability remains a key challenge for developers and users across the blockchain realm. Analog , a suite of omni-chain interoperability protocols that simplifies access to Web3 data and removes barriers to cross-chain communication, aims to solve these challenges. Via its Timechain, Analog GMP, and Analog Watch, the platform allows developers to build their DApps on any chain, from Ethereum to Polkadot and beyond. Analog revolves around the Timechain, a sovereign blockchain ecosystem that serves as a ledger for all its activities—essentially acting as an Accountability Layer. The network pioneered the Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism to ensure high levels of security and that all network activities are transparent and verifiable. The Anagog GMP allows developers to move data and value across chains with unparalleled decentralization, security, and cost efficiency. Chrono.tech While blockchain utility has majorly focused on investment opportunities, one company is changing this by solving employment challenges globally. Australian-based blockchain company Chrono.tech is unlocking a new world of employment opportunities for anyone with an internet connection globally. The company focuses on human resource solutions for enterprises and businesses worldwide, allowing them to source talent and pay their employees promptly and fairly. Chrono’s main goal is to minimize and eliminate the bottlenecks to recruitment and payment processes for both workers and employers. The platform has four major platforms to ensure increased efficiency in global employment, namely LaborX (a global recruitment platform that connects individuals with work opportunities and enables them to get paid in crypto), TimeX (a hybrid exchange that offers users faster, secure, and cost-effective transactions, as well as, protection against front-running and illegal activities), PaymentX (an automated cryptocurrency payroll solution for enterprises), and AUDT (a stablecoin backed by Australian dollars in a 1:1 ratio). Fetch.ai Artificial intelligence is here with us and blockchain companies are increasingly merging the technology into their products. Fetch.ai is one such company that helps developers create AI platforms and services on a blockchain. The platform allows anyone to build and deploy AI services such as negotiators and agents at scale, anytime and at their convenience. The decentralized AI-powered platform provides users with autonomous machine-to-machine transactions and services, impacting several industries such as supply chain management, data interoperability, and more. In addition, Fetch AI allows users to monetize their unique AI agents, AI apps and services. Users can also join the platform’s ‘Agentverse’ and carry out the effectiveness of the AI Agents' semantic descriptors and get analytical insights to improve their discoverability on their platform. Band Protocol The emergence of oracles in the blockchain space improved the space immensely, helping networks (which inherently rely on internal data) to bridge external data onto the blockchain. This helped supply blockchains with verified, off-chain data, empowering smart contracts to interact dynamically with the outside world. Chainlink pioneered the development of oracles within the blockchain ecosystem but recently several platforms are rising to challenge it – primarily Band Protocol. Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. The platform is rising as a worthy competitor to challenge the dominance of Chainlick in the oracle space with its innovative cross-chain data oracle feeds. The platform leverages the Cosmos SDK and its own blockchain, BandChain, to offer a customizable, flexible and scalable oracle to multiple blockchains. This could lead to the development of complex DApps that share data, which leads to enhanced innovation in the wider blockchain space. Energy Web Finally, 2025 could be the year that Web 3 projects finally champion the creation of energy-efficient and sustainable products. Platforms such as Energy Web are leveraging blockchain technology to help global companies to identify, transform, and validate specific business processes that make them more sustainable. As the calls to make businesses “greener”, platforms such as Energy Web are integrating blockchain to make this a reality. The company allows companies to utilize its native currency, $EWT, to configure, launch, and maintain distributed computing networks that ingest data from external sources, execute custom workflows, and vote on results in order to establish consensus on how to make their business more environmental friendly. In addition, the blockchain is designed to decarbonize the energy sector by allowing companies to conduct peer-to-peer trades on carbon credits to accelerate the companies’ climate goals. Conclusion In conclusion, the rapidly evolving nature of blockchain technology is expected to continue its trend in 2025, with new innovations set to be built for the betterment of the society. These changes will not only redefine the possibilities of blockchain technology but also shape the future of industries across the globe. From AI and decentralized data networks to interoperability and gree energy, blockchain will stand at the forefront of this wave of innovation in technology. It is an exciting time to be a part of this space, and we can't wait to see what the future holds. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38141201,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633504,1735218050,Virtuals ecosystem AI agents abandon Solana for DEX trading on Base network,"Virtuals Protocol is the new source of AI agent tokens, after creating a platform for influential AI agents. The tokens related to those agents are now flowing into the Base ecosystem. AI agents from Virtuals Protocol are gaining influence with Base simultaneously becoming the destination for AI token trading. Initially, AI agents used Solana to spread their tokens, but that trend has shifted to Base, another low-latency, cheap network. New AI agents are springing up every day, entering a fierce competition for mindshare just like memes. However, instead of memes, AI agents are also offering rapid content creation, testing and refining their engagement strategies. DEXs on Base have seen an inflow of AI agent tokens from Virtuals Protocol, with these tokens taking up 15 out of the 25 top liquidity pairs. Base DEXs are still most widely used to boost the influence of Coinbase’s CBBTC, a wrapped form of BTC compatible with the L2 chain. Virtuals is now the second-biggest asset category, serving as a proxy for its entire ecosystem of AI agents. Virtuals Protocols drive new AI agent creation VIRTUAL traded at $2.94 as of December 26, down from a recent peak above $3.10. The platform emerged as the leader in creating new AI agents, which proliferated on social media. VIRTUAL shifted the gear from introducing singular agents to bringing an entire competitive ecosystem. The GAME agentic framework has been active for about a month, producing more than 200 projects. Launching an AI agent is more intensive compared to launching a meme token, but growth is happening fast. It's been just over a month since @GAME_Virtuals was made available for @virtuals_io agent builders to use. We've seen: – 200+ projects building using GAME with a collective market cap of >500mn – 150k requests sent daily on GAME – 200% week-on-week growth GAME is getting… pic.twitter.com/CokwQQmuYb — Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) December 26, 2024 AI agents are themed on the Virtuals platform, offering a range of options for the agent’s character. The platform brings both entertainment and meme agents, as well as agents in the productivity, creativity, information and on-chain categories . Some compare the rise of Virtuals on Base to the early days of Pump.fun on Solana. AI agents have to compete for both on-chain trading and social media influence, especially after the creation of new agents becomes progressively easier. Some of the newly launched Virtuals AI agents are starting to achieve prominence and even earning the makings of blue-chip status. AIXBT is among the top tokens, trading near its all-time high of $0.37. The token is still valued under $300M, potentially primed for a higher valuation. Tokens graduating from Virtuals are also competing with external projects, including AI16Z and ELIZA. Top AI agent tokens consolidate value at the end of 2024 The AI agent sector had a slow build-up over the past year, only coming into the spotlight in Q4. All actively traded AI tokens are valued at $8.7B in total market capitalization, at one point reaching a record above $10B. VIRTUAL became the leader in that space, displacing all other singular agents. The token is valued at $2.956B in total market capitalization, offering growth due to its role as an infrastructure provider. The question remains whether FARTCOIN could be counted as an AI agent token. FARTCOIN still trades close to $1B in total valuation, but it offers no additional features. In contrast, AIXBT and other agents from the Virtuals platform also connect with each other and accelerate their influence on social media. The emergence of AI agents asks new questions of meme assets. Agents and their content and entertainment often rely on meme culture. However, AI agents may replace the hype of memes, as the category competes for mindshare. The AI narrative slowed down at the end of December, based on Kaito’s social media data . The AI hype competes with DeFi and memes for social media representation and an inflow of funds. AI agents are expected to be one of the hottest topics extending into 2025. After the experimental stage of individual agents, the focus shifts to infrastructure and launchpads, as well as adding DeFi elements. AI agents are combining and extending previous Web3 trends with elements of NFT ownership, meme cults, DEX activity, and DeFi.

It reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts. The project’s roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, contributing to its stability. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum’s security.

38143648,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/analysts-expect-lightchain-ai-to-surpass-cardano-with-3-target-by-2026,1735218028,Analysts Expect Lightchain AI to Surpass Cardano With $3 Target by 2026,"As blockchain innovation accelerates, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a serious competitor to established platforms like Cardano (ADA). Analysts predict that Lightchain AI, currently priced at $0.0041 during its presale , has the potential to achieve a $3 valuation by 2026, surpassing Cardano in both growth trajectory and market relevance. With its focus on artificial intelligence (AI) integration, real-world applications, and multi-industry adaptability, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the next wave of blockchain adoption. Cardano’s Slower Development Pace Faces New Competition Cardano has earned its reputation as a research-driven blockchain with a focus on scalability and sustainability. However, its methodical development approach has often led to delays in delivering key features, such as smart contract deployment and ecosystem expansion. While Cardano remains a top player, these challenges have left room for newer platforms like Lightchain AI to capture market share. Unlike Cardano, which emphasizes academic rigor, Lightchain AI prioritizes rapid deployment and real-world solutions. Its roadmap features key milestones, including a testnet launch in January 2025 and a mainnet rollout by March 2025, signaling a clear commitment to scalability and adoption. For analysts, this faster pace of development positions Lightchain AI as a viable contender to surpass Cardano’s market valuation by 2026. Why Lightchain AI’s $3 Target Is Achievable The prediction of Lightchain AI reaching $3 by 2026 is driven by its unique features and market strategy. Its focus on integrating AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) addresses critical challenges in industries such as finance, healthcare, and logistics. This multi-industry approach ensures diversified adoption, creating a broader market for its token. Lightchain AI’s innovative staking rewards system and developer-centric tools, such as APIs and SDKs, further enhance its appeal. These features encourage active participation and ecosystem growth, setting the stage for sustainable long-term value. Additionally, its deflationary tokenomics add scarcity over time, driving demand and price appreciation. Compared to Cardano’s more gradual growth, Lightchain AI’s scalability and practical focus give it an edge in capturing investor confidence. Lightchain AI’s Role in the Future of Blockchain As blockchain continues to expand into real-world applications, platforms like Lightchain AI are poised to take the lead. Its commitment to leveraging AI and blockchain technology to solve pressing challenges makes it a standout in the market. With analysts forecasting a $3 valuation by 2026, Lightchain AI is set to redefine expectations for next-generation blockchain platforms, potentially overtaking Cardano as a leader in innovation and adoption. For investors looking to capitalize on the next big opportunity, Lightchain AI’s presale provides an accessible entry point into a project with immense growth potential. As adoption accelerates and milestones are achieved, the journey toward a $3 valuation could make Lightchain AI one of the most rewarding investments of the decade. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Rising market activity usually indicates more investor confidence and drives momentum for altcoins. Cardano price has also shown some positive movement. Anticipation is high for an innovative period in the cryptocurrency arena. Cardano’s price is set for a potential surge, aiming to impact the market significantly. A newcomer is also emerging, ready to challenge established altcoins and capture the attention of savvy investors. Although Cardano (ADA) remains a great project in the crypto industry, DTX Exchange is also showing gains and acquiring significant traction in the crypto community. DTX Exchange is launching a hybrid trading model. With a low price of $0.12 in its ongoing presale, DTX has already seen a 500% rise from its original $0.02 pricing. Cardano (ADA) Price Not Ready to Breach $1 Cardano (ADA) is in the news, attracting a lot of interest due to its poor price performance in the past month. Cardano price lost over 12% value in a month, whereas most coins have gained double-digit growth. The Cardano network is designed to be flexible, sustainable, and scalable, which makes it a good platform for smart contracts. Developers can build decentralized finance apps, form and launch new crypto tokens, and develop games. Similar to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA can be used to store financial value, make payments, and earn rewards through staking on the Cardano network. Source: CoinMarketCap As of today, December 25, Cardano price is trading 12% down in its weekly charts, keeping around the $0.92 price band, as the $0.95 band is acting as a resistance point for now. Investors are frustrated by Cardano’s price weakness despite the platform’s strong crypto technical and feature-rich platform. In comparison, DTX Exchange may be a new platform, but it is designed to be community-driven. It is building a strong network of dedicated investors looking forward to trading in crypto along with stocks, forex, and ETFs. DTX Exchange: 93% Supply Sold DTX Exchange (DTX) is one of the promising new ICOs with plenty of room for growth. In addition to its growth prospects, its transformation of crypto trading makes it a solid altcoin to hold on to. It combines elements of CEX and DEX and bridges the gap between TradFi and DeFi platforms to give traders a unified platform to trade in any over 120,000 asset combos of their choice. In addition, DTX Exchange (DTX) is already listed on CoinMarketCap, which investors see as an indicator of an upcoming CEX listing, which shows trust in DTX Exchange. The platform is also compliant with global trading standards. DTX Exchange adheres to established quality standards and ensures data safety and security are primary focus areas. The leading third-party platform, SolidProof, has satisfactorily audited the platform. Conclusion Although Cardano’s price has the potential to reach $1 by 2025, DTX Exchange is on track to hit its milestones far quicker. DTX Exchange stands out with its real-world asset trading platform, easy tools, and community-driven approach. Available for $0.12 and expected to increase to $0.14 as soon as stage seven starts, DTX offers an excellent chance for early entry and significant returns for investors.

38142029,https://invezz.com/?p=2405691,1735218000,Buying this cheap token today at $0.15 is like buying Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013 at $150,"The current presale price of Rexas Finance (RXS) at $0.15 echoes Bitcoin’s era-defining valuation of $150 in 2013. Investors who seized the Bitcoin opportunity then have witnessed unprecedented returns as it now hovers below $100,000. Today, Rexas Finance presents a similarly compelling proposition in the crypto market, blending blockchain innovation with real-world asset tokenization. With RXS presale advancing in its tenth stage, its price has already multiplied fivefold from the initial stage. Early adopters could gain substantial returns as the token gears toward double-digit figures by 2025, offering what may be a rare entry point into a transformative project. Revolutionizing real-world asset tokenization Rexas Finance is reshaping how individuals and institutions access and manage real-world assets (RWA). Its platform allows anyone to tokenize assets such as real estate, commodities, and collectibles, unlocking liquidity and enabling fractional ownership. For instance, an investor in Asia can now purchase a fractional stake in a European property, earning passive income from rents or value appreciation. The global real estate market, valued at over $326 trillion, and the $121 trillion commodities market are just a few of the industries Rexas Finance is modernizing. By integrating blockchain technology, the platform provides unparalleled accessibility and efficiency, empowering users to digitize and trade assets seamlessly. Rexas Finance’s token builder simplifies this process, enabling anyone to create tokens that represent shares in tangible assets. Supporting this ecosystem are tools like the Rexas QuickMint Bot, which streamlines token minting on platforms like Telegram and Discord. Additionally, the Rexas Launchpad helps projects raise funds, offering a reliable avenue for token sales. These features create an ecosystem bridging the gap between traditional assets and blockchain networks, making Rexas Finance a one-stop solution for asset tokenization. Presale momentum and growing investor confidence Rexas Finance has garnered attention through its presale success, raising over $32.4 million. Its public presale strategy ensures that everyday investors, rather than venture capitalists, can partake in this financial revolution. The presale, now in its tenth stage, has witnessed rapid sellouts in earlier rounds, with $26.3 million raised in stages 1–9 alone. At $0.15 per token, buyers in the current stage can expect a 1.33x return upon launch. With only 1 billion total tokens available, RXS maintains a strategic allocation for liquidity (15%), staking pools (22.5%), and marketing (3%), ensuring long-term project sustainability. Additionally, the ongoing $1 million giveaway reinforces community engagement, offering 20 winners $50,000 each in USDT, boosting participation and adoption. Rexas Finance’s credibility is further solidified by its CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. These achievements enhance its visibility among millions of crypto enthusiasts, reinforcing trust and attracting a diverse investor base. Comparisons to Bitcoin and the road ahead Bitcoin’s meteoric rise from $150 to nearly $100,000 exemplifies the transformative potential of early investments in innovative technologies. While Bitcoin pioneered the concept of decentralized currency, Rexas Finance is revolutionizing asset ownership and trade. By tokenizing tangible assets, RXS goes beyond traditional crypto use cases, enabling broader financial participation. The platform’s roadmap includes launching on three top-tier exchanges, promising enhanced liquidity and accessibility. As blockchain adoption continues to grow, Rexas Finance is positioned to lead the tokenization of assets, bringing RWAs into blockchain networks and making them globally accessible.

38140883,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667280,1735218000,Bulls Falter As PEPE Slide To $0.00001748: Key Support In Focus,"PEPE bullish momentum has taken a hit, with the price retreating to a crucial support level at $0.00001748. This setback puts the bulls under pressure to hold the line as bearish forces regain strength. After an initial rally showed promise, the inability to sustain upward movement signals a critical moment for the meme coin’s price trajectory. PEPE now faces a decisive retest, with the $0.00001748 level emerging as a key point of contention between buyers and sellers. If the bulls manage to defend this support, it could act as a springboard for a rebound, setting the stage for a renewed attempt to break through higher resistance levels. However, failure to hold above this threshold may result in heightened bearish activity, pushing PEPE further downward and signaling a deeper correction. PEPE Retreat To $0.00001748: What’s Driving The Pullback? The inability of PEPE’s bulls to maintain upward momentum has been a primary factor in the price retreat. Buying pressure has dwindled after reaching resistance levels that tested market confidence, allowing bears to regain control. Its failure to generate sufficient volume to break through higher resistance zones suggests that the rally lacked the strength for sustained upward movement. Related Reading: PEPE Price Hits $0.000027 ATH, On-Chain Data Says These Are The People Driving It Key technical indicators, such as the Composite Trend Oscillator, have been signaling potential drop conditions in recent trading sessions. As a result, PEPE’s price correction was anticipated as the market sought to restore balance. The indicator’s move toward the neutral levels reflects this shift, while the 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) show bearish crossovers that reinforce the current downtrend. PEPE’s retracement must also be viewed in the context of the broader cryptocurrency market. Recent volatility in major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum has created an uncertain environment, causing smaller tokens like PEPE to experience amplified price swings. Bearish sentiment across the market has likely weighed on PEPE, compounding its struggles to maintain higher levels. Key Support Analysis: Can $0.00001748 Hold? The $0.00001748 level has emerged as a critical support zone for PEPE as bearish pressure intensifies. This level has historically provided a strong floor, preventing deeper declines during previous downtrends. Its ability to hold hinges on several factors, including market sentiment, volume dynamics, and broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Related Reading: Pepe Battles Price Decline, But Analysts Signal A Potential Rally Ahead If the $0.00001748 support holds firm, it could ignite renewed buying strength, providing bulls the capacity to regain control and drive the price higher toward its previous peak of $0.00002721. A decisive breakout above this resistance might pave the way for the formation of new highs, signaling a shift in market sentiment and stronger upward momentum. However, a clear break below $0.00001748 may indicate more downside risk, potentially driving PEPE toward the next critical support at $0.00001313. Once this level is breached, the price could continue to decline, testing additional support zones.

According to a December 25 notice, SBI VC Trade will assume control of DMM’s accounts and assets on March 8, 2025. DMM Bitcoin’s customers, many of whom faced uncertainty following the hack, can breathe a sigh of relief. SBI VC Trade assured users that they would not need to open new accounts, as the firm will create accounts automatically for a seamless transition. The decision by DMM to liquidate and transfer its customers to SBI VC Trade comes in the wake of an unprecedented breach in May 2024. Attackers infiltrated DMM’s servers and compromised wallets holding 4,500 Bitcoin, valued at $320 million at the time. Despite promises from DMM to replace stolen funds, the damage proved irreparable, forcing the exchange to shut down operations. The Role of North Korea-Linked Hackers The exploit has been attributed to the North Korean cybercrime group TraderTraitor, as confirmed by the FBI, Japan’s National Police Agency, and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3). Details of the heist reveal a multi-layered operation. The FBI reported that TraderTraitor used social engineering tactics, posing as a recruiter on LinkedIn to lure an employee from Ginco, a crypto wallet firm. The attacker sent a malicious script disguised as a pre-employment test, which the employee unknowingly uploaded to their GitHub page. Months later, the group exploited this vulnerability to infiltrate DMM Bitcoin’s systems, manipulating transaction requests and absconding with the Bitcoin. A Year of Major Crypto Losses The DMM Bitcoin breach is among the largest crypto hacks of 2024, second only to the $235 million hack of WazirX , an India-based exchange. According to blockchain security firm Hacken, attacks on centralized crypto services more than doubled this year, with total losses surpassing $694 million. As SBI VC Trade steps in to salvage DMM Bitcoin’s operations, the incident underscores the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in the cryptocurrency sector. For now, DMM’s customers have a pathway to recovery.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donald-saves-crypto-donalcry-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-before-exchange-listings-as-wif-pepe-and-shib-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

One such investor has gained notoriety for foretelling the large Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) rallies, which yielded gains in the hundreds of thousands of percentage points. This investor is now focused on Rexas Finance (RXS), a startup rapidly acquiring popularity and potentially yielding life-changing gains in the following years. Solana's Meteoric Rallies and Dogecoin Reviewing their success in forecasting Dogecoin and Solana's amazing price swings will help one grasp why this investor supports Rexas Finance. The rise of Dogecoin shocked the cryptocurrency market in 2021. DOGE started the year at $0.007 and peaked at $0.74 at the end of May 2021. These kinds of events show an amazing 15,000% rise. The increase was increasingly boosted by viral ‘memes’ trends and endorsements by various public figures and further by the expanding adoption of the coin by people who appreciated the project's softer approach. Solana started the crypto market with its creative blockchain technology in 2020. Beginning at barely $1.50 in early 2021, SOL surged to an all-time high of $260 by November of the same year, producing gains of about 17,000%. Solana's success was assisted by its scalability, exceptionally low transaction costs, and solid ecosystem backing decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These amazing discoveries made the investor known as a master of identifying possible crypto superpowers. The Next Big Thing: Rexas Finance (RXS) Once precisely forecasting the surges of Dogecoin and Solana, a powerful investor turned their attention to a new coin: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance offers a completely different approach to blockchain technology, which emphasizes solving a real-world issue: tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). At the same time, Dogecoin and Solana attracted attention for their social influence and technological innovation. By letting users tokenize and exchange actual assets such as real estate, fine art, and luxury goods on the blockchain, Rexas Finance hopes to transform conventional finance. This action allows regular people to participate in the ownership of high-value assets, democratizing access to markets once limited to affluent investors. Through RWA tokenization, Rexas generates liquidity and a more inclusive financial environment. Rexas Finance stands out among other blockchain ventures by emphasizing actual value instead of speculative trends. Rexas Finance is positioned to profit from a fast-developing market as distributed finance (DeFi) and tokenized asset interest grow. Rexas creates new possibilities for individual investors once shut off from high-value markets by permitting fractional ownership of real-world assets. Currently valued at just $0.15 during its presale, the RXS token is a reasonably cheap starting point for anyone wishing to get in early. The presale has been quite successful, with 374,231,469 RXS tokens sold already and $32,260,062 raised. Rexas Finance is likely to have exponential expansion in the next few years, given the success of its presale and the growing interest in tokenized assets. A Bright Future Ahead: Rexas Finance’s Potential in 2025 With some estimates estimating a possible price rise of up to 10,000%, analysts believe Rexas Finance may see a significant surge in 2025. This forecast appears reasonable with the platform's creative approach and the great demand for tokenized real-world assets. Rexas Finance positions itself as a more sustainable investment over the long run since, unlike meme coins like Dogecoin, it has a compelling use case and a clear vision for the future of finance. Rexas Finance also recently finished a thorough CertiK assessment to guarantee that its smart contracts are secure and free from flaws. For investors, this degree of openness and security lends confidence that is sometimes lacking in the cryptocurrency market. Rexas Finance is rapidly becoming known as a real participant in the crypto industry, with listings on big sites such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Rexas Finance gives investors who missed out on the meteoric profits of Dogecoin and Solana another opportunity to join a cryptocurrency with great upside potential. With its original focus on real-world asset tokenizing, safe platform, and rising investor interest, Rexas Finance could be the next best cryptocurrency in 2025. Those who make early investments in Rexas Finance could find themselves in a prime position for big rewards as the industry develops, as early Dogecoin and Solana investors found in 2021 For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below: Website: https://rexas.com Win $1 Million Giveaway: https://bit.ly/Rexas1M Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance Telegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 305,200 followers on social media platform X that the decentralized oracle project Chainlink ( LINK ) is forming a bullish reversal pattern on the hourly chart, reminiscent of a Bitcoin move in 2019 when BTC broke through resistance at $4,220. “These bottom structures are definitely some of my favorites to trade; BTC 2019 bottom for reference.” Source: Bluntz/X He says that LINK may be forming a bullish Adam and Eve pattern, which indicates an asset is threatening to take out its horizontal resistance after carving a bottom. “Some nice bottom structures forming across the board now that the dust has settled.

38140694,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633462,1735217136,"India’s economy is tumbling, and it might take whole world down with it","India’s economy is spiraling. The rupee is sinking like a stone, dragging with it a mix of trade deficits, shrinking capital inflows, and uncertainty. The country’s economy has quickly become so important that if it plummets, the global economy will be at stake. Thursday is the seventh straight session of bad news, with the rupee plummeting to 85.2525 per U.S. dollar, which was an all-time low. The currency has already lost 1.74% of its value since October and is on track for its worst quarterly performance since late 2022. Behind this collapse is a sobering reality. India’s trade deficit expanded by 18.4% from April to November. Capital markets have not been kind either, with $10.3 billion in outflows this quarter compared to $20 billion in inflows just three months ago. Economists predict the balance of payments will hit a deficit of $20 billion to $30 billion this fiscal year, a sharp decline from last year’s $60 billion surplus. The dollar is crushing everything in its path Donald Trump’s election victory has supercharged the dollar, with markets expecting his policies to fuel growth and inflation. The dollar index is riding high, and Federal Reserve officials have already announced fewer rate cuts next year. Investors are flocking to the dollar, leaving currencies like the rupee gasping for air. India is particularly vulnerable. IDFC First Bank estimates the rupee will weaken further to 86 per dollar by September 2025. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tried to stem the bleeding with interest rate hikes since May 2022, but inflation and a slowing economy are keeping the central bank’s hands tied. Economic growth is projected at 6.8% this fiscal year, a drop from last year’s higher base. And while that number might still sound decent, the cracks are visible. India’s investment crisis is a ticking time bomb Government spending on infrastructure has been a lifeline for India’s economy. Roads, housing projects, and energy infrastructure are all getting a boost. But here’s the problem: private investments, which are supposed to carry the torch, are stuck at the starting line. They make up about 37% of India’s total investment but haven’t rebounded as expected. The reasons are complicated. Corporate tax cuts and the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme have given companies the tools to expand, though the momentum hasn’t spread across sectors. Electronics and pharmaceuticals are thriving, but broader industries are lagging. Solar panel manufacturing and advanced battery technologies are expected to join the winners, but those gains are still years away. India’s government debt is sky-high—86% of GDP—leaving little room for more public spending. The Union Budget for 2024–25 allocated a 17.1% increase in capital expenditures. Import duties on essential raw materials have been slashed to encourage domestic production. But these measures won’t solve the larger problem: private investors are still hesitant to put their money on the line. Without stronger private investment, the government’s efforts might not be enough to pull the economy out of its slump. Global risks are piling up India is incredibly important to the global economy. The country is set to double in size economically, from $3.6 trillion in 2023–24 to over $7 trillion by 2030–31, making it the third-largest economy in the world. At the same time, its share of global GDP is projected to climb from 3.6% to 4.5%. But these numbers don’t mean much if the foundation crumbles. Right now, India is standing between being a global powerhouse and a massive liability. The country’s integration into global supply chains has grown over the years, with huge exports in services, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing. For instance, its pharmaceutical industry plays a key role in global healthcare, while tech services power companies far beyond its borders. A severe slowdown or policy misstep in India will affect these industries, raising costs and creating bottlenecks worldwide.

Toncoin Takes 2025 by Storm Toncoin is carving out a niche with its robust connection to Telegram, showing a promising uptick in its market stats—trading at $5.89 with an expansive user base. As it continues to enhance its ecosystem and utility, Toncoin is shaping up to be a heavy hitter in 2025.

Three promising candidates for this explosion in value are Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Rexas Finance (RXS). Though each has different market dynamics and characteristics, this cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS), shines with the possibility of reaching $10 in only 10 weeks. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Star of Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is priced at $0.15 at its 10th presale stage. It has already shown remarkable expansion, jumping 400% from its starting price of $0.030 in stage 1. The presale has raised over $32,074,982 by selling 372,997,598 RXS tokens. With one stage left before its launches at $0.20 in early 2025 on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, RXS is drawing in savvy investors. Rexas Finance is a forerunner in asset tokenizing, not just another cryptocurrency. By enabling users to access the platform closes the distance between physical objects and blockchain breeze real estate, goods, and even artwork, the plat and form close erasing trillions of dollars in readily available markets with the $379.7 trillion real estate market, $121.2 trillion commodities market, and $65 billion yearly art market within reach. The Rexas Launchpad allows easy fundraising, and users may tokenize their assets without writing a single line of code using its creative Token Builder. Certik has audited this innovative solution to ensure investor confidence and security. Furthermore, its community-centric strategy and rejection of venture financing have produced a committed investor base. RXS is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, and Rexas Finance's profile is firm. Twenty winners will receive each RXS token worth $50,000 in the ongoing $1 million RXS giveaway, encouraging involvement. When the presale ends, RXS is expected to launch at $0.20. It has the potential to rise to $10 in only 10 weeks, reflecting a 6,566% increase from its present price. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin with a Cult Following Investors still choose the original meme coin, Dogecoin, rather often. DOGE, priced at $0.3197 with 24-hour trading and volume above $7 billion, has gained 122.76% in the past 30 days. Supported by well-known people like Elon Musk, its strong community helps it become a regular competitor for development. Designed as a humorous substitute for Bitcoin, Dogecoin has become a significant part of cryptocurrency and could reach $3 in the next ten weeks. Its community uses it for micropayments and tipping appeal. DOGE, thus, has less potential to attain exponential development in a short period than tokens like Rexas Finance, which have revolutionary aspects. Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain Built on Innovation As of writing, ADA, its natural token, costs $0.9030 and has risen by 14.90% throughout the past thirty days. Developers and investors love Cardano because of its creative Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and innovative contract capability. Cardano's strong points include a governance system that lets ADA members cast and allows them to vote. Though Cardano has excellent potential for consistent expansion to $6.2 in only 10 weeks, its path is slower than the explorer of Rexas FFinance's Why (RXS) Stands Out While Dogecoin and Cardano offer compelling investment opportunities, Rexas Finance’s unique value proposition sets it apart: Real-World Use Cases: Unlike most cryptocurrencies, RXS directly integrates with real-world markets, enabling seamless asset tokenization and ownership. Explosive Growth: With a 400% increase in just 60 days and projections to reach $10 shortly after launch, RXS demonstrates unmatched bullish momentum. Certik Audit: Security and transparency boost investor confidence. Community-Driven: By avoiding venture cases, its investors and community. Upcoming Exchange L by avoiding venture capital funding: Launching on three of the top tier-1 exchanges in 2025 will further propel its price. Conclusion Of the three cryptocurrencies under $2, Rexas Finance is the best option, with the best chance to reach $10 in only ten weeks. Now is the moment to buy RXS in the crypto scene before its price skyrockets—one presale stage yet to go. Take advantage of your chance to be part of the next great thing in cryptocurrencies and participate in the Rexas Finance presale.

Historically, Bitcoin bull markets are marked by sharp price increases followed by significant selling pressure, but data shows a clear trend of decreasing volatility in the current cycle. The most significant pullback in this bull market occurred on August 5, 2024, when Bitcoin’s price fell 32%. However, Glassnode notes that most pullbacks in this cycle saw Bitcoin fall only 25% from local highs, and volatility for this cycle was among the lowest ever recorded. This stability is attributed to a combination of factors, including the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have generated significant demand and the growing interest of institutional investors. Related News: Experienced Analyst Reveals: “For Bitcoin Price to Surpass $108,000...” Glassnode’s analysis reveals that the majority of short-term Bitcoin holders are currently “in loss status,” meaning the market price of their coins is below their purchase cost but they are not experiencing the extreme unrealized losses typically associated with market declines. This suggests that short-term holders remain resilient even during corrections, due to increased confidence driven by market developments such as institutional adoption and ETF launches. *This is not investment advice.

The newly discovered scam uses elements of social engineering, pig butchering, and laundering funds through stablecoins. The attacker extracted about $1.2M from user wallets through social engineering tactics. The newly discovered scam was noticed by Whitestream analysts. The funds have not been tracked in detail, but Whitestream notes most were directed to a single wallet before they were sent to exchanges. Threat actor offers shady investments in confidence scams The attacker’s method of stealing funds copies romance scams or pig butchering models, which relies on gaining the victim’s confidence. The end goal is to either request crypto directly or introduce a malicious link. While wallets can flag some sites, they are not filtering third parties yet. This allows anyone to build a wallet connection request and potentially drain funds. The scam led users to a site presented as an investment portal for Seed Crypto. The threat page is still active, displaying a basic message and a button to connect wallets. The landing page explained crypto in a language targeting outsiders while promising a vague investment opportunity. The page required a wallet connection, which then used the permission to drain wallets. The site required a WalletConnect or a Coinbase wallet, one of the most widely used apps. Early details revealed about the scam reinforce the regional nature of attacks and their limited time frame. In this case, the threat actor operated out of Southeast Asia, and focused on local services for cashing out. The exploiting address, however, had no problems with swapping out funds through HTX, Binance, OKX, Gate.IO, and ChangeNow. Pig butchering and confidence scams are among the most closely watched, as they often target mainstream users and not crypto insiders. However, due to the ease of acquiring crypto or stablecoins, scammers are capable of convincing users to hand over or “invest” funds. Both Tether and Circle have assisted law enforcement with tracking and freezing pig butchering addresses, while they were still incapable of cashing out. Personal message scams took up to $3.6B in 2024 Confidence scams targeting crypto outsiders surpassed losses from attacks against crypto protocols. It is difficult to track confidence scams, as some are regional and limited to a campaign. However, an estimated $3.6B was lost and laundered through this type of scam as revealed by data from a preliminary Cyvers overview for the past year. Over the course of 2024, the influence of the Huione Guarantee market was noted as a tool to launder funds through faked commercial activity. The main tools for moving funds were again USDT and USDC, which despite attempts to freeze wallets, managed to remain undiscovered. As this type of scam became more common, Interpol called for removing the “pig butchering” term, to avoid stigma and help victims seek help without shame. Some of the scams were considered romance-baiting, while others still had an element of confidence. Both eventually led up to the same point – investment offers. Confidence scams caused a lot of devastation this year, causing deep losses because they typically target individuals with disposable funds. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) estimates total confidence scams at $5.6B for the whole of 2023.

For context, Dogecoin grew 72.37% and 114.86% in these years, dwarfed by this year's upsurge by miles.Notably, the fourth year of each cycle has been the best-performing year for Dogecoin. The asset has trounced its previous cycle’s percentage uptick, and a community enthusiast known as ""Investments CEO"" expects a similar play next year.Dogecoin to Better 2021’s 12,000% Uptick: AnalystIn a Christmas Day post , the analyst Investments CEO argued that Dogecoin would repeat its fourth-year cyclical performance. Meanwhile, he suggested that the meme coin would improve on its 2021 rally.For context, Dogecoin rallied 12,000% in 2021, peaking at its all-time high of $0.73995. Notably, the year’s rally was more than double that seen in 2018, as the leading meme coin surged 5,000% six years ago.Meanwhile, the notable community figure asserted that the historical trend would persist next year. A surge past 12,000% in 2025 would push Dogecoin to an unprecedented price above $40 per coin.

In fact, another analysis supports the Dogecoin enthusiast claims of an over 12,000% upswing.For context, seasoned market analyst Ali Martinez teased the idea.

38139784,https://crypto.news/?p=14322323,1735215900,"Crypto scams cost French victims €500m annually, AMF says","French authorities are grappling with an alarming rise in crypto scams, which contribute to an estimated €500 million in annual losses. Financial scams continue to inflict heavy losses on French consumers, with the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office estimating that victims lose at least €500 million each year. In a Thursday press release on Dec. 26, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers revealed that the average loss for victims of financial scams in 2024 was €29,000. Many of these scams have targeted crypto investors, with fraudsters using fake celebrity endorsements and investment platforms, the regulator said. “Fake videos and press articles are used to replicate the physical characteristics of celebrities, sometimes using artificial intelligence. These celebrities then inadvertently reveal the source of their wealth, obtained thanks to an alleged crypto-asset trading offer, which turns out to be a complete scam.” The Autorité des Marchés Financiers You might also like: Bybit crypto exchange receives warning from AMF Although the number of complaints has dropped, possibly because of compensation schemes and law firms grouping cases together, the AMF says French authorities are still taking action against fraudsters. Since 2022, the AMF and the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution have blacklisted almost 5,000 unauthorized market participants, the press release reads. They both have also worked to block nearly 350 fraudulent websites. In November 2023, an AMF study showed that more French people own crypto than stocks or exchange-traded funds. The survey found that 9% of people own cryptocurrencies, compared to 7% who hold stocks and 2% with ETFs. The AMF urged the public to remain vigilant, warning against offers that seem “too good to be true” and advising individuals to consult official registers before making investments.

Recent developments include Special Pool rewards, the addition of new trading assets, and festive campaigns, reflecting ZND’s commitment to delivering a versatile and user-friendly experience. Following the Token Generation Event (TGE) on October 24, 2024, held in the heart of the Principality of Monaco, the ZND token has seen active trading on major exchanges such as MEXC, Bitmart, and zondacrypto. It debuted at $0.10 USDT and reached a peak of $1.20 USDT. The token’s liquidity pool of €500,000, locked for 24 months on Uniswap, supports stability within the ecosystem. In a recent initiative, ZND introduced the Special Pool , aimed at rewarding early supporters and active users while supporting the platform’s deflationary model. From October 24 to the end of November, the Special Pool accumulated 82,610 ZND tokens through trading fees and early withdrawal penalties from the staking program. Of these, 57,827 tokens were distributed via airdrops to users in loyalty tiers, with Gold Tier members receiving 116 ZND each, Platinum Tier members 128 ZND, Diamond Tier members 133 ZND, and Ambassador Tier members 139 ZND. To further promote token scarcity, the remaining 24,783 ZND tokens were burned. The burn transaction details are available on Etherscan. On December 19, 2024, ZND fulfilled its commitment to listing 150 assets for trading on the platform, achieving this milestone ahead of schedule. Thirty new assets were added, including $RON, $KAIA, $1000SATS, $ROSE, $BLUR, $OM, $WOO, $PEOPLE, $JTO, $RAY, $CRV, $ASTR, $SUPER, $ARKM, $IOTX, $ENS, $TWT, $CELO, $MEME, $SSV, $ANKR, $RSR, $SC, $SKL, $QTUM, $POLYX, $T, $ILV, $LRC, $MASK, and $PIXEL. This expansion broadens the platform’s offerings and enhances opportunities for traders. ZND has also launched holiday campaigns to encourage community participation. The “19 Days of ZND Christmas” event invited users to join the ZND community for daily contests and prizes. Additionally, the “ZND Santa Claus Rally Airdrop” rewarded top participants on the ZND App leaderboard with ZND tokens, match tickets, and team jerseys. These campaigns were accessible via the official ZND Telegram channels. On December 18, 2024, ZND highlighted the results of the Special Pool rewards and burn mechanism, reinforcing the ecosystem’s focus on supporting long-term token value. The Special Pool was designed to reward early supporters, $ZND token holders, and active participants while boosting the token’s value through a deflationary model. Between October 24 and the end of November, the pool accumulated 82,610 $ZND tokens. Of these, 57,827 $ZND were distributed as airdrops to loyal users across Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Ambassador tiers, with individual rewards ranging from 116 to 139 $ZND. The remaining 24,783 $ZND tokens were burned to reduce supply, with transaction details available on Etherscan . Earlier in December, ZND launched a farming service within its Earn feature, allowing users to lock popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH to earn rewards in ZND tokens. This service offers bonus structures with rewards reaching up to 20% additional ZND, providing users with passive earning opportunities while increasing demand for the ZND token. ZND’s staking program , introduced shortly after the TGE, continues to attract user participation. In the first two months, over 20 million ZND tokens—approximately 50% of the circulating supply—were locked, reflecting strong community confidence. The staking program offers high APRs, loyalty-based benefits, and early withdrawal options with penalty fees, contributing to market stability. ZND’s ecosystem emphasizes regulatory compliance, holding licenses in Estonia, Poland, Canada, and Italy, and readiness for forthcoming MiCA regulations. Strategic partnerships with four Serie A clubs such as Juventus FC or Atalanta Bergamo, top female cycling team Canyon//SRAM zondacrypto, as well as AS Monaco’s football team Salon Honneur, and events like the Giro d’Italia or Tour de Pologne amplify ZND’s visibility. Brand ambassadors Giorgio Chiellini and Wojciech Szczęsny further support the project’s credibility. Media campaigns across major Polish TV networks continue to promote user adoption, with a new one coming soon starring Kasia Niewiadoma, who achieved triumph in last year’s Tour de France Femme avec Zwift, and now is set to become zondacrypto’s ambassador. About ZND ZND is a digital OTC platform designed to offer interconnected financial services inside zondacrypto’s ecosystem. At its very heart lies the ZND token, powering the entire ecosystem: exchange, payment gateway, and OTC platform – with a neobank coming soon. The ZND platform, developed in collaboration between zondacrypto and ICEO Venture Builder, features trading, earning, borrowing, and exploration functionalities.

38141464,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53177,1735215725,Analyst Says XRP Could Rally to $35 If This Happens,"Crypto analyst CryptoInsightUK has suggested that XRP may experience a significant price surge, potentially reaching $35 by late 2025. This prediction is based on the continuation of a bullish trend observed in recent months. XRP’s Performance in 2024 XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has demonstrated remarkable growth in 2024 despite market uncertainties. The digital asset reached a multi-year high of $2.9 earlier this month after a decisive breakout in November. Over the past year, XRP has risen by over 250%, driven by strong investor confidence in its ecosystem. Several macroeconomic factors have contributed to this optimism. These include the SEC’s regulatory reforms and political developments like Donald Trump’s election victory, which some analysts believe have positively impacted the broader cryptocurrency market. Projections for 2025 CryptoInsightUK has revised his price targets for XRP based on recent market behavior. According to his analysis, the cryptocurrency is expected to see notable upward movements in the first and final quarters of 2025. In a recent commentary, CryptoInsightUK forecasted that XRP could rise to $10 during the first quarter of 2025. He expects XRP to reach $35 by the end of the year provided current market trends continue. He attributed this outlook to adjustments in his 2017 overlay bar, which he aligned with XRP’s recent price breakout. Finally, $XRP / $USD Weekly. I have overlayed the 2017 bars pattern but also adjusted it to size in relation to our recent breakout.

Dom, another prominent market watcher, has highlighted risks that could disrupt XRP’s upward trajectory. He pointed out that the cryptocurrency has tested its $1.9 support level twice, which he believes has weakened its foundation. Dom warned that Bitcoin’s inability to maintain a price above $95,000 could trigger a broader market downturn, pulling altcoins like XRP down. Should XRP lose the $1.9 support level, Dom predicts a steep decline to $1.6, citing the absence of a significant demand zone between these price points. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He emphasized that a drop to $1.6 could undermine XRP’s bullish momentum and push it into uncertain territory. “The correction would be much larger,” Dom cautioned, signaling a potential end to the recent uptrend. Key Levels to Watch Despite the risks, Dom acknowledged that XRP could maintain its bullish position if it holds above its current price. He stated that a reclaim of $2.4 will be pivotal for the asset to pursue a new all-time high. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.19, reflecting a 1.82% decline over the past 24 hours. According to Dom, achieving a $2.4 price level would signal renewed strength in XRP’s bullish case, potentially paving the way for further growth.

The token’s market value surged to over $80 million within five hours of its launch, showing the power of unity in the crypto world. on 9/23, mira was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor called a craniopharyngioma. while benign, it is located in an extremely dangerous area of the brain and associated with the worst quality of life outcomes out of all survivable brain tumors. pic.twitter.com/GANqrb5ERD — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 25, 2024 The MIRA meme coin, built on the Solana blockchain , was created to fund Mira’s medical treatment and support research into her rare condition. What started as a financial effort quickly became a symbol of solidarity and hope, showing how the crypto space can unite in times of need. Siqi Chen, Mira’s father, shared his daughter’s story online, revealing her diagnosis with Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma—a rare and aggressive brain tumor. While the tumor is non-cancerous, its location in a critical area of the brain makes treatment extremely challenging. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is CHILLGUY Meme Copied? Crypto Coin Crashes 20% Amid Controversy , $MIRA Gains Momentum Shortly after its launch, $MIRA gained rapid attention. Half of the token’s total supply was sent to Siqi Chen’s wallet to support Mira’s treatment, giving the family both hope and resources. The token’s market cap climbed quickly, demonstrating that memecoins can have real-world impact beyond trading. Supporting Vital Research Siqi Chen sold 10% of his MIRA holdings, or 5% of the total supply, raising approximately $49,200. He pledged this amount to the Hankinson Lab at the University of Colorado—the only research facility in North America studying Mira’s specific type of tumor. After consulting the community, Siqi decided to sell another 10% of his holdings, with the proceeds also going to the lab. To protect the token’s value, he proposed gradually selling small portions daily instead of all at once, an approach the community strongly supported. With MIRA’s market cap already reaching impressive levels, the community remains optimistic about its growth. Their ambitious goal? A $1 billion market cap. Let’s hope it works out. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38139676,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633398,1735215396,North Korea faces South Korean sanctions targeting crypto hackers and IT operatives,"South Korea has imposed sanctions on North Korean crypto hackers and IT workers to prevent the country from funding its weapon programs through cybercrime. South Korea’s sanctions South Korea imposed sanctions on North Korea due to crypto hackers and IT workers. These sanctions are to stop North Korea from using illegal online activities to fund its nuclear weapons and missiles. South Korea and its allies are intensifying their efforts to prevent North Korea from making illegal money through digital currencies and IT work. South Korea has identified Bureau 313, a cyber unit under North Korea’s Ministry of National Defense, which is part of the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Machine-Building Industry Department. Data from Chainalysis shows that in 2024 alone, North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion in cryptocurrencies, over 60% of all crypto thefts globally this year. These stolen funds are to directly support North Korea’s weapons programs, which cover about 40% of the costs of developing weapons of mass destruction. South Korea’s sanctions target about 15 individuals and one organization linked to Bureau 313. These people are mostly IT experts who use their skills to infiltrate international IT markets. North Korea on hacks North Korean hackers are believed to have carried out some of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts. The FBI recently revealed that North Korea was behind the $308 million stolen from the Japan-based crypto company DMM Bitcoin , which caused it to shut down. Additionally, last week, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two people and one company for helping North Korea launder stolen cryptocurrencies through a front company in the United Arab Emirates. IT workers usually go to countries like China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa by hiding from North Korea to get jobs with international companies. Once hired, they do illegal things like hacking, stealing cryptocurrencies, and hiding stolen money. For example, Kim Cheol-min worked at IT companies in the U.S. and Canada and sent a lot of money back to North Korea. It shows that North Korea doesn’t rely on hacking. They also have skilled IT workers who use fake identities to get real remote jobs and earn money from other countries. The Lazarus Group , linked to the North Korean government, was behind major hacks, such as the $620 million theft from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network in 2022. Seeing the value of blockchain and digital money, South Korea has set strict rules to keep its crypto market safe. For instance, the country’s Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) system requires crypto exchanges to follow strict anti-money laundering rules and use real-name account systems. These efforts are meant to stop North Korea from making illegal money and to make crypto safer.

38139450,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376250,1735215271,Holiday Warning for the Shiba Inu (SHIB) Community: Users Should Stay Vigilant for These Scams,"TL;DR Shibarium Trustwatch warns SHIB holders of fake giveaways, phishing emails, and scam social accounts during the holidays. Users are cautioned to avoid sending emails about SHIFU tokens and urged to verify information through official channels. ‘Protect Yourself This Christmas’ Despite the festive season, scammers don’t have days off and are always on the lookout for new victims. One particular group in the cryptocurrency sector , which bad actors attack quite regularly , is the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community. A few days ago, Shibarium Trustwatch (an X account that aims to provide security) alerted users to be extra cautious with several common crypto scams. The first is giveaways, which offer “free” tokens, merchandise, or NFTs. “Remember, free stuff is never truly free – providing personal information puts you at risk,” the team warned. Second, the community should stay vigilant for phishing emails. Fraudsters often send emails to victims, claiming to be from official SHIB-related projects, thus trying to steal their login credentials. Next on the list are social media accounts. The team cautioned that scammers create fake profiles on social media platforms pretending to be influencers, developers, or official accounts that offer tempting deals. “Verify handles and avoid DMs offering quick profits,” Shibarium Trustwatch warned. Ponzi schemes, fake charity appeals, fake customer support, and malicious links are the other things the SHIB community should be careful about. “Providing personal information or falling for these scams doesn’t just put you at risk – it may lead to your data being sold on the dark web, where hackers can use it for identity theft or other malicious activities. Scammers exploit trust, kindness, and generosity, especially during the holiday season, so we must stay vigilant. Let’s keep the Shibarmy strong and safe this holiday season. Be cautious, protect your crypto, and share love responsibly. Nothing in life is free. Even the things that seem free often come with hidden costs or risks,” the team concluded. The SHIFU Warning Earlier this month, Shibarium Trustwatch issued an alert concerning the meme coin SHIFU. The team claimed that bad actors request victims to send them an email containing information about the token: “Fraudsters are asking people to send them an email asking how to buy and claim SHIFU or if SHIFU has not appeared in their wallet.” Shibarium Trustwatch advised users to stay away from that scheme and not send emails to anyone. Verifying information through official channels and avoiding sharing personal data is also necessary. SHIFU is a dog-themed meme coin within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which was introduced by Shytoshi Kusama at the beginning of the month. While it can be found on certain decentralized exchanges, leading crypto platforms like Binance have not yet embraced it. A few weeks ago, the meme coin project launched a special airdrop. The team announced that 30% of the total SHIFU supply (30 billion tokens) will be allocated to the community. Of this, 22 billion SHIFU will go to holders with at least 100,000 SHIB and 100 BUBBLE. An additional 2 billion tokens are set aside for eligible LEASH holders, while BONE owners will receive 1 billion tokens . The remaining 70% of the supply will be reserved for other purposes, including “liquidity and public pre-sale,” treasury funds, and marketing efforts.

But, Avalanche’s main interest still lies in old blockchain markets such as DeFi and NFTs which, even though they are successful, limits its reach to the industries beyond those niche. Lightchain AI redefining blockchain with artificial intelligence In contrast to Avalanche’s focus on smart contracts, Lightchain AI stands out by integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence to solve real-world challenges. Its features set it apart from other emerging projects. Using a unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus model, it rewards nodes for completing AI tasks such as model training, turning the blockchain into a productive AI network. Lightchain AI also brings tangible benefits to industries like healthcare, logistics, and supply chain management through its AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). Furthermore, its optimized infrastructure ensures scalability, allowing it to handle complex AI workloads without sacrificing network efficiency. By merging blockchain and AI, Lightchain AI pushes beyond traditional financial applications, making it appealing to a wider range of industries and use cases. Head-to-head Lightchain AI vs. Avalanche Aspect Avalanche (AVAX) Lightchain AI (LCAI) Core Focus Smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs AI-powered decentralized solutions Market Position Established Emerging Innovation Fast transactions, Subnets AI integration, PoI consensus Long-Term Utility Developer-friendly infrastructure Real-world AI applications Scalability High Optimized for AI computations Tokenomics Fixed supply Deflationary with token burning Investor perspectives: What sets them apart? Avalanche stability and expansion Avalanche is perfect for investors seeking exposure to a well-established ecosystem. With its speed, scalability, and growing partnerships, it’s a reliable bet for steady growth. However, its market saturation and dependency on specific sectors (DeFi and NFTs) might limit explosive returns. Lightchain AI innovation and early-stage potential Lightchain AI, on the other hand, is ideal for those willing to invest early in a smart project. Its presale pricing of $0.003 offers ground-floor access to a token with exponential growth potential. By addressing diverse industries through AI integration, Lightchain AI positions itself as a transformative force in blockchain. Which token delivers better long-term returns? Choosing between Avalanche and Lightchain AI depends on your investment strategy. For steady growth Avalanche offers a proven platform with a growing user base and ecosystem. It’s a solid choice for moderate, reliable returns. For exponential returns Lightchain AI’s unique combination of blockchain and AI, coupled with its deflationary tokenomics, makes it a high-risk, high-reward option for investors seeking early-stage growth opportunities. Future of blockchain innovation Avalanche and Lightchain AI represent two different paths to success in the crypto world. Avalanche leverages its established position to dominate traditional blockchain markets, while Lightchain AI pioneers new territory by integrating AI for broader applications. With the potential to revolutionize industries and drive blockchain adoption, both tokens offer exciting prospects for long-term investors. As the market continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these two projects fare and what new innovations they bring to the table.

38139146,https://finbold.com/?p=223130,1735214716,AI predicts Polygon price as Aave threats to leave the blockchain,"Polygon (POL, formerly MATIC ) is going through a significant crisis as the AaveDAO is set to vote on a proposal to leave the blockchain due to security concerns. Finbold turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze this context and provide a Polygon price prediction if this comes true. Finbold covered Polygon-Aave drama last week, as POL’s price reacted negatively to Aave’s ( AAVE ) response to the $1 billion-bridge proposal. At that time, Polygon was trading at $0.594, down 38.65% year-to-date. Why is Aave DAO considering leaving the Polygon blockchain In summary, Allez Labs, along with Morpho and Yearn, proposed transferring about $1.3 billion of the Polygon-Ethereum bridge to their protocols for liquidity supply and yield generation. Many decentralized finance ( DeFi ) users and analysts expressed concern to this proposal, including relevant leadership from Aave, the world’s leading DeFi protocol and competitor of the proponents. As a result, Marc Zeller and EzR3aL, two of the most influential figures on Aave’s governance’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) said they plan to support Aave protocol leaving the Polygon blockchain due to security concerns in a vote expected to happen in January 2025. This could be a significant hit for Polygon price and ecosystem, considering Aave represents around 40% of Polygon’s presence in DeFi, according to a DL News’ s report on December 26. Meanwhile, Polygon accounts for only 1.5% of Aave revenue, an argument Zeller used to justify his position. “Polygon is 1.5% of Aave DAO revenue,” Marc Zeller commented in a related thread. “In what world do we risk a billion of bad debt for this?” Grok AI’s POL price prediction amid Polygon-Aave drama As of this writing, POL (formerly MATIC) is trading at $0.485, down nearly 50% year-to-date. This also represents an 18% drop from when we reported Polygon-Aave’s drama for the first time on December 17. Polygon (POL, formerly MATIC) 2024 price chart. Source: Finbold Grok AI: Polygon price bearish prediction First, Grok AI believes the immediate response to Aave leaving Polygon would be bearish for POL’s price, predicting a crash. This, according to xAI’s model— paralleled to Google —could create a sell-off driving Polygon to as low as $0.30. “The loss of such a major player could shake investor confidence, leading to a sell-off. Given POL’s already negative performance year-to-date as of late 2024, an additional drop might push the price below current levels, potentially testing lower support levels like $0.30 or even lower if market sentiment turns very bearish.” – Grok AI output on the Polygon-Aave drama The AI expects a bounce up after testing the price support. Nevertheless, Grok doubles down on the bearish stance, saying Polygon will hardly surpass $0.50 in 2025. Grok AI analyzing Polygon implication if Aave DAO votes to leave. Source: Grok / Finbold The bullish case On the other hand, Grok also considers a potential upside, with a bullish price prediction for Polygon in 2025. For that to happen, the AI says Polygon’s leadership must be able to deal with the ongoing crisis and loss of confidence from investors, besides delivering a solid work next year, capable of attracting significant demand for its ecosystem. “If Polygon adapts and grows despite this setback, predictions could range from $0.63 to $1.91 by the end of 2025, as suggested by some analyses, assuming market conditions remain favorable for altcoins.” – Grok AI Grok AI Bearish and Bullish price prediction for Polygon. Source: Grok / Finbold As things develop, investors must understand the security risks using bridged assets could incur to the ecosystem and closely watch what happens next regarding AaveDAO’s decision.

Based on its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets, analysts are predicting that RXS will skyrocket to $1 and eventually $10. Rexas Finance has Impressive Presale Success and Strong Community Engagement, which makes it a solid contender in the Crypto market. Rexas Finance Presale Gains 317% Boosting Investor Interest At the moment, Rexas Finance’s presale price at $0.15 has led to investors taking notice, with the project achieving an incredible 317% price increase since inception. The project is flexible to users that want to tokenize tangible assets like real estate, intellectual property as well as art, linking the physical and digital economies. Rexas Finance with its presale that has now raised over $22.42 million shows the high level of investor confidence and market potential. The platform's unique ability to fractionalize ownership appeals to individual and institutional investors who seek diversified opportunities. It has a dedicated community of early adopters and has already raked in nearly 392,000 participants and paid out nearly $1 million in a prize campaign. Projections in the markets put RXS on track to reach $10 just with its anticipated launch price of $0.20 being 7,900% higher than now. Cardano (ADA): This Asset May Enter Upcoming $5 Cup The price of Cardano currently stands at $1.14, having gained 6% in 24 hours. The momentum of this cryptocurrency indicates it is on the verge of breaking out above the $1.20 resistance level, which could spark a big rally. According to analysts, ADA might test its all-time high of $3.10 before it hits the projected $5 milestone. The broader crypto resurgence, which sees Bitcoin reach over $100K, also boosts the favourable environment for ADA recovery. RSI—61, on the other hand, shows support for a bullish point of view. The good news is that with 86% of ADA holders in profit, the sentiment is still bullish, but the road to $5 might be lengthier in 2024. Comparing Prospects: ADA’s Potential Growth Loses Against Rexas Finance We have an established position of steady growth, giving us room to continue to grow slowly while enjoying a solid foundation, but Rexas Finance represents exponential potential with a truly innovative and robust use case. The overall goal of RXS is to make asset ownership as democratic as possible and provide unparalleled flexibility and convenience to the global user base. RXS’s path from $0.15 to $10 will happen quicker and deliver more returns on the way up as ADA attempts to recoup its heights. Conclusion: Rexas Finance Redefines the Crypto Investment With its pioneering asset tokenization platform, Rexas Finance surges ahead and sets a new standard in the cryptocurrency realm. Thanks to its presale success and innovative approach coupled with community-driven initiatives, it poses a strong contender for Cardano. For those looking for a phenomenal growth play to possibly jump in ahead of ADA's next advance, RXS is an investor’s alternative.

One of these was Japan. However, Japan was among the countries that were not keen on Bitcoin reserves. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that his government currently does not have enough information about the Bitcoin strategic reserve plans of the United States and other countries, local news agency CoinPost reported. Stating that Japan cannot yet decide whether to implement a Bitcoin reserve, Ishiba said, “It is difficult for the government to express its views on Bitcoin.” The prime minister's response came to a question from People's Protection Party Councilor Satoshi Hamada. Hamada said, “I think Japan should consider following the example of the United States and converting some of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets such as Bitcoin,” and asked the government for an official opinion on the matter. In response, Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba said that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin do not fall into the category of foreign exchange and added that “the government considers that the volatility of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, is inconsistent with the current system.” The prime minister’s response once again shows that the Japanese government is cautious about including cryptocurrencies in its national reserve strategy, while Trump and Republican lawmakers continue to move forward with creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the Fed would not participate in the Bitcoin reserve plan. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum King of Smart Contracts Ethereum (ETH) stays a top place in the crypto world, especially doing well in areas of money that is not controlled by banks (DeFi) and unique digital items (NFTs). The platform's move to a Proof of Stake (PoS) way of agreeing has greatly made its ability to handle more work better and use less power. This change has caused about 99.98% drop in Ethereum's use of energy͏ making it more green for both users and developers. In the DeFi area Etherum keeps a strong place with its whole worth locked (TVL) hit a two-year top of $80 billion This growth shows Ethereum's strong setup and its power to back many types of money uses. In the NFT place, Ethereum's part of the market has had some ups and downs. As of December 2023, Ethereum made up 34.6% of NFT trade volume, which is $1.41 billion dollars. While Ethereum stays a big name in this area; other blockchains are slowly getting more attention. Looking to the future, Ethereum's forthcoming Pectra upgrade, planned for early 2025, aims to further enhance the platform's scalability, security, and user experience. This upgrade is anticipated to strengthen Ethereum's position as a premier platform for both DeFi and NFTs by delivering improved performance and reducing transaction costs. Dogecoin Meme Coin with Staying Power Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke, but it’s grown into one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies out there—thanks to its passionate community and some high-profile endorsements. The Dogecoin community is the heart of its success, keeping the market active and creating a strong sense of belonging for its users. This community-driven energy has been key to keeping Dogecoin relevant in the ever-competitive crypto world. When it comes to adoption, Dogecoin is making waves as a payment option. With low transaction fees and fast processing times, it’s an appealing choice for businesses. For example, places like Williamsburg Pizza in New York and University Sports Grill in Arizona now accept Dogecoin for purchases like food and drinks. Celebrities have also helped boost Dogecoin’s popularity. Big names like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban have shown their support, shining a spotlight on the cryptocurrency and making it even more appealing to the market. While Dogecoin still thrives largely on speculation, its strong community, growing use for payments, and celebrity backing are keeping it firmly in the spotlight of the crypto world. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The Economic Times reported on Dec. 26 that the Income Tax Department of India had unearthed a multi-faceted nexus involving hawala operators as well as cryptocurrency transactions after it raided a couple of wedding planners in Jaipur. The raids led to the seizure of $2 million, i.e. Rs 20 crores in cash and jewellery, from at least 20 wedding planners in Jaipur. Three crypto wallets linked to the rackets were also seized.

The nexus, officials suspect, extends beyond the borders of Jaipur, with connections to several major cities, including Mumbai, Hyderabad and Delhi. The raids also unveiled a network of resorts, hotel owners, catering and decoration services that permitted customers to make payment either in cash or through banking channels. The authorities are now looking at conducting similar raids in other cities as part of an overall crackdown on unaccountable transactions in the wedding and events industry.

38138889,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398295,1735214199,XRP Lawsuit 2024: A Year in Review of the SEC’s Battle Against Ripple And What’s Next,"The post XRP Lawsuit 2024: A Year in Review of the SEC’s Battle Against Ripple And What’s Next appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As 2024 draws to a close, one of the most closely followed legal battles in the cryptocurrency world has continued to keep everyone on the edge, leaving a mark on Ripple Labs and the entire crypto industry. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple , alleging that the cryptocurrency XRP is an unregistered security, has been a long saga filled with twists, turns, and dramatic courtroom showdowns. Let’s look back at the major milestones of this battle, and where things stand heading into 2025. The SEC’s Bold Move: XRP Declared an Unregistered Security In late 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped a bombshell on Ripple Labs – creators of the XRP cryptocurrency. The SEC accused Ripple of raising billions of dollars through unregistered XRP sales, claiming that XRP was a security akin to a stock like Apple or Tesla, rather than a decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This lawsuit quickly became one of the most watched cases in the crypto world, not just for Ripple’s future, but for the future of crypto regulation in the United States. A Year of Legal Challenges and Small Wins for Ripple Though the lawsuit’s origins go back to 2020, 2024 has been a pivotal year for Ripple as they continue to challenge the SEC’s claims in court. While the battle is ongoing, Ripple has secured some important legal victories, giving it a significant lead in the case. Here’s a month-by-month look at the key developments: January: SEC Pushes for Financial Disclosure The SEC’s aggressive legal stance continued into the new year. In January 2024, the SEC filed a motion to compel Ripple Labs to disclose financial documents related to XRP sales after the legal action was initiated in 2020. The request to reveal sensitive financial data was met with resistance from Ripple, which argued that such disclosure could harm its business interests and violate privacy. February: A Legal Extension for Ripple By February 2024, Ripple was granted an extension in its legal battle . Judge Analisa Torres, presiding over the case, agreed to extend the timeline for Ripple to provide detailed financial statements covering 2022-2023. This victory was significant for Ripple, as it bought them more time to prepare their defense. March: SEC Seeks $2 Billion Penalty In March 2024, the stakes were raised when the SEC pushed for an astonishing $2 billion in fines and penalties against Ripple for the alleged unregistered sales of XRP. This figure, disclosed by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. Ripple, however, vehemently opposed the penalty, calling it disproportionate and unjustified. April: Ripple Disputes the $2 Billion Fine By April, Ripple doubled down on its defense, rejecting the SEC’s demand for the $2 billion fine. Ripple argued that the proposed penalties were extreme and didn’t align with the facts of the case. The dispute highlighted the growing divide between Ripple and the SEC and set the stage for a bitter legal showdown. May: Tensions Over Business Dealings In May 2024, tensions intensified when Ripple sought to seal exhibits related to its business dealings, particularly discounting details for major XRP buyers. The SEC, however, pushed back, claiming that transparency was essential to ensure fair judgment in the case. This dispute over confidentiality further complicated the already contentious legal battle. June: Settlement Talks on the Horizon By June, there were signs that a settlement could be on the horizon. Ripple filed a notice regarding the Terraform Labs settlement, which resulted in a $4.47 billion agreement . Ripple continued to advocate for a much smaller settlement, around $10 million, but the SEC demanded a much larger fine of $102.6 million related to XRP sales that were considered illegal under securities laws. July: Major Legal Victory for Ripple July 2024 marked a win for Ripple. A federal judge ruled that the sale of XRP on public exchanges did not violate securities laws, a major victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. However, the court also ruled that Ripple had violated securities law in its sales to institutional investors, like hedge funds, a decision that continued to leave the door open for future legal challenges. August: A $125 Million Fine Instead of $2 Billion In August 2024, Ripple saw another victory when Judge Torres ruled that the company would face a fine of $ 125 million , a far cry from the $2 billion the SEC had originally sought. This decision was a huge relief for Ripple, though it remained locked in a battle over penalties and other legal implications of the case. October: The SEC Appeals The battle took another turn in October when the SEC announced its decision to appeal a court ruling that restricted its ability to regulate the sales of XRP on public exchanges. The SEC argued that Judge Torres’ ruling, which determined that XRP’s public sales were not subject to investor protection laws, was a blow to the regulator’s authority over the crypto markets. The appeal was filed with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, leaving the industry on edge as the case continued to unfold. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 2024 Trump Win Sparks Billion-Dollar Gains for Musk, Armstrong, and Garlinghouse , November: Trump Takes Over In early November, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the SEC to submit its main brief by January 15, 2025 . The SEC requested an extension, which Ripple is opposing. Ripple is pushing for the court to uphold Judge Torres’s earlier ruling that XRP is not a security under the Howey test, a significant win for the company. November also saw a political shift, with Donald Trump’s re-election victory seen as a positive for the crypto industry. Many believe Trump’s win could influence future cryptocurrency regulations, including the ongoing Ripple case. December: New Dates Revealed In December, the legal battle intensified when plaintiff Bradley Sostack filed an appeal against rulings in Ripple’s favor . On December 23, 2024, the plaintiff was required to submit a mediation questionnaire, an important step in the legal process. Appeal transcripts are due by January 30, 2025, and Ripple must respond to the plaintiff by April 7, 2025. What’s Next for Ripple and the SEC? As we close out 2024, the Ripple-SEC saga remains unresolved. Ripple continues to make legal headway, securing smaller victories and defending itself against the SEC’s massive fines. The case is not just about Ripple’s future but the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. With both sides digging in their heels, the battle is set to continue into 2025, and the cryptocurrency world will be watching closely to see whether Ripple can finally put the legal drama behind it – or if the SEC will manage to set a precedent for crypto regulation moving forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38138966,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/bitcoin-btc-bears-halt-christmas-rally-crypto-market-insights,1735214192,Bitcoin ($BTC) Bears Halt Christmas Rally: Crypto Market Insights,"A $7,000 rally, which took the Bitcoin ($BTC) price to within touching distance of $100,000, was stopped in its tracks by the Bitcoin bears on Thursday. Currently back at just above $95,000, what do the last few days of 2024 hold for the king of the cryptocurrencies? No more rally into end of year? As we enter the last gasps of 2024 a Christmas rally has perhaps been wiped off of Santa’s Christmas to-do list once and for all. While there could potentially be one more surge from the bulls, which could take the price back to the top of the ascending channel and a new all-time high, the clock is starting to run down, and this latest reversal may have some more legs in it yet. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF outflow continues On the buy and sell side of things, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a fourth straight trading day of net outflows. 3.57K BTC left the ETFs on Wednesday, making this an outflow total of 15.5K BTC (around $1.5 billion) for the period of these four days. MicroStrategy aiming to provide rocket fuel for Bitcoin price With this said, many Bitcoin bulls across social media are still predicting higher prices going into Q1 of 2025. This might be in part due to MicroStrategy calling a special shareholder’s meeting where the board seeks to increase the authorised Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.33 billion, and preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion. The vote is very likely to be positive for the company, given that Chairman Michael Saylor holds nearly 50% of the voting power. The resulting authorisation would allow MicroStrategy to go ahead with a future massive buying spree which has the potential to create a virtuous buying circle that forces the price of Bitcoin up and MicroStrategy’s stock price along with it. How far will $BTC price fall? Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC shows that the price rose back to once more retest the bottom of the ascending channel, from where it was rejected again. $BTC is now heading back down, and it just remains to be seen where a bounce might take place. The current price level is a good horizontal support level at around $95,600. If the price falls further, and there is a good chance this might be the case, there is support at $94,300, then an ascending trendline around $92,600, and finally the main ascending trendline which stretches all the way back to the 2021 bull market double top, which would be at around $91,000. Concerns on the 2-week chart Source: TradingView Zooming right out into the 2-week chart, there are some concerns that need to be kept in mind. The current 2-week candle is enveloping the previous one, which is bearish. However, Sunday’s close is still a few days off. Also, at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI, which signals price momentum, is shaping to roll over. Once again, there is still time for this to change. The 80.00 level may act as support, which it has done in the past. In the meantime, the weekly Stochastic is on the way down. This would take at least another month to bottom, before potentially rising again and providing that all-important upside momentum.

38138833,https://thecoinrise.com/animoca-brands-co-founder-falls-victim-to-x-account-hack-in-fake-token-scam/,1735214136,Animoca Brands Co-Founder Falls Victim to X Account Hack in Fake Token Scam,"Animoca Brands, a major player in the blockchain gaming industry, has confirmed that its co-founder and chair, Yat Siu, fell victim to a social media hack on X (formerly Twitter). The breach resulted in Siu’s account being used to promote a fraudulent token called Animoca Brands (MOCA), launched on the Solana blockchain through the memecoin platform Pump.fun. Animoca Brands Warns Against Fake Token On December 26, Animoca Brands posted an official warning to its X followers, stating, “Unfortunately [Siu’s] social media account has been compromised. The token launch on Solana as claimed in a post was made by the hacker.” The firm quickly clarified that neither Siu nor Animoca Brands had any involvement in the token’s creation or promotion. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT identified the attack as part of a broader phishing campaign targeting crypto-focused accounts on X . According to ZachXBT, the hacker likely used a phishing email masquerading as a copyright infringement notice from the X team. The email tricked victims into resetting their account passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials on a phishing site controlled by the attacker. Phishing Scheme Behind the Breach This phishing campaign has compromised at least 15 crypto-related X accounts since late November. The attacker deployed a fake MOCA token linked to Siu’s hacked account, which briefly spiked to a market cap of $36,700 before crashing to $6,200, as reported by analytics platform Birdeye. The token’s value plummeted almost immediately after the fraudulent post, leaving the market with minimal trading activity. The hacker’s address, responsible for deploying the MOCA token, matches those used in similar attacks over the past month, which have collectively netted the attacker approximately $500,000. Security Concerns The breach of Yat Siu’s account follows a series of similar incidents, including attacks on the accounts of RuneMine, a Bitcoin infrastructure provider. Earlier this month, popular rapper Drake also faced a similar hack , when his attacked account started promoting a Solana-based memecoin ANITA. The attack on Siu notes the growing threat of social engineering tactics used by cybercriminals to exploit high-profile individuals in the crypto space. Animoca Brands has advised its followers to exercise caution and disregard any token launches promoted through compromised accounts.

38138840,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114366,1735214111,Bitcoin Futures and Options Indicate Strong Market Confidence Despite Volatility,"Bitcoin Futures and Options Indicate Strong Market Confidence Despite Volatility Bitcoin traders are demonstrating robust market confidence, as revealed by recent data on futures and options contracts. Cointelegraph, citing analytics from Laevitas, reported that Bitcoin futures monthly contracts are trading at a 12% premium to spot market prices, significantly above the neutral range of 5% to 10%. This trend underscores the growing demand for leveraged long positions, signaling bullish sentiment despite recent price fluctuations. Simultaneously, Bitcoin options data shows a persistent discount on put options relative to call options, further supporting a positive market outlook. Futures Contracts: A Bullish Premium Bitcoin futures are standardized contracts allowing traders to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a future date. The premium observed in futures contracts—currently at 12%—is a key indicator of market sentiment. Neutral Range : A 5% to 10% premium indicates a balanced market outlook. Bullish Signal : The current 12% premium reflects heightened confidence among traders, suggesting expectations of higher Bitcoin prices in the coming months. This elevated premium implies robust demand for leveraged long positions, where traders bet on price increases to amplify potential returns. Options Data: Call Options Outperform Puts Bitcoin options offer another lens to gauge market sentiment. These contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call options) or sell (put options) Bitcoin at a set price before the contract expires. Current Trend : One-month Bitcoin options show put options trading at a 2% discount to call options, a pattern that has persisted for two weeks. Market Interpretation : Typically, when traders anticipate a downturn, put options trade at a premium of 6% or higher. The current discount suggests that traders do not foresee a major correction in the near term. What the Data Tells Us About Market Sentiment The combination of bullish futures premiums and discounted put options paints a picture of strong market confidence: Optimistic Traders : The data indicates that traders are positioning themselves for price increases rather than hedging against downturns. Stabilizing Volatility : Despite recent fluctuations, the market appears to be pricing in resilience, with no immediate signs of panic. Institutional Confidence : The consistent demand for leveraged long positions and call options often aligns with institutional investor activity, reflecting broader confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Historical Context: Bitcoin Futures and Options in Action This isn’t the first time Bitcoin’s futures and options markets have signaled bullish trends: 2021 Bull Run : Elevated futures premiums and call option dominance preceded Bitcoin’s rally to its all-time high of $69,000. 2023 Recovery : Similar patterns emerged during Bitcoin’s recovery from a bear market, signaling renewed investor optimism. These historical parallels suggest that current trends could foreshadow another leg up in Bitcoin’s price. Factors Driving Bullish Sentiment Several underlying factors contribute to the strong market confidence reflected in futures and options data: Institutional Adoption : Increased involvement from institutions adds liquidity and stability to Bitcoin markets. Macroeconomic Environment : With global economic uncertainties, Bitcoin remains an attractive hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Technological Advancements : Developments in Bitcoin’s network, including scalability and security improvements, enhance its value proposition. Regulatory Clarity : Gradual progress in crypto regulations has bolstered investor confidence, reducing fears of sudden crackdowns. Potential Risks and Considerations Despite the optimistic outlook, investors should remain aware of potential risks: Price Volatility : Bitcoin’s historical volatility means that even bullish trends can experience sharp corrections. Market Overexposure : High leverage in futures trading can amplify losses during market downturns. Regulatory Uncertainty : While progress has been made, unexpected regulatory developments could disrupt market dynamics. Investor Strategies in the Current Market Given the current market sentiment, investors might consider the following strategies: Long Positions : Leveraged long positions could benefit from the anticipated price increases. Options Trading : Call options present an opportunity to profit from bullish sentiment with limited risk exposure. Diversified Portfolios : Balancing Bitcoin holdings with other assets can mitigate risk while capitalizing on market opportunities. Conclusion Bitcoin futures and options data highlight strong market confidence, with a 12% futures premium and discounted put options signaling bullish sentiment despite recent volatility. This trend underscores traders’ optimism about Bitcoin’s near-term prospects, driven by institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors, and technological advancements. However, as with any market, risks remain. Investors should approach opportunities with informed caution, balancing optimism with strategic planning.

As a result, his recommended portfolio emphasizes precious metals such as gold and silver alongside cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ). Part of his advocacy for alternative assets stems from a distrust of fiat currency, which he deems “fake money” destined for a crash. Interestingly, Kiyosaki has expressed gratitude for investors opting for alternative assets, noting they are avoiding putting their money in the traditional institutions, which he terms a “Den of Thieves.” But how would an investment in Kiyosaki’s preferred assets have performed in 2024? Kiyosaki portfolio 2024 returns Kiyosaki’s portfolio includes gold, silver, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Bitcoin has rallied 126.59% after peaking above the coveted $100,000 spot. Bitcoin year-to-date price chart. Source: Finbold On the other hand, Ethereum grew by 47.49% and Solana by 86.49% over the same period. Precious metals also recorded substantial gains in 2024, with gold increasing by 27.35% and silver by 24.00%. Now, if you allocated $1,000 equally among these five assets at the start of the year, a $200 investment in Bitcoin would now be worth $453.18. With a 47.49% gain, Ethereum would have turned $200 into $294.98. Solana’s performance would have grown the $200 investment to $372.98. Gold, often seen as a safe-haven asset, would have increased the $200 investment to $254.70, while silver’s rise would have brought its value to $248.00. Combining these returns, the total portfolio would now be valued at $1,623.84, representing a 62.38% gain in less than a year. The portfolio has largely benefited from positive price action in 2024, backed by strong fundamentals. Precious metals rallied to new highs amid economic uncertainty. At the same time, Bitcoin hit a record high of $108,000, primarily driven by the impact of the halving and post-election optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s election, who is widely considered to implement pro-cryptocurrency policies. Kiyosaki’s alternative asset outlook Kiyosaki, who has long projected a global economic crash, maintains that Bitcoin, gold, and silver are central to protecting wealth. Global crash has started.

Indeed, with Bitcoin’s recent drop below $100,000, the financial educator has criticized individuals complaining about the correction, viewing it instead as an ideal opportunity to accumulate the asset. Overall, with Kiyosaki predicting that Bitcoin could reach a high of $350,000 in 2025, he maintains that it is not too late to buy the asset.

A Solana token named “MIRA,” created by a crypto trader in her honor, saw its market value soar to over $80 million within just five hours of launch. Mira, the youngest daughter of Runway CEO Siqi Chen, was diagnosed with Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma, a rare brain tumor, before her second birthday. Crypto Community Shows Support for Mira Siqi shared her journey on social media, drawing widespread attention and support from the crypto world. “On 9/23, Mira was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor called a craniopharyngioma,” he wrote on X. “While benign, it is located in an extremely dangerous area of the brain and associated with the worst quality of life outcomes out of all survivable brain tumors.” He added that, while there is still no cure, the research team has identified promising new drugs for Mira’s tumor. He then asked for donations to help the research proceed. As the story went viral, donations poured into Siqi’s Solana and Bitcoin wallets, and the community’s response reached new heights when an anonymous trader launched the MIRA token. The trader sent half of the token’s supply to Siqi, who was taken aback by the gesture. “So some random guy 20 minutes made a SOL memecoin called $MIRA to help with research fundraising and sent me half the entire supply and it’s now worth like $400K and i literally don’t know what to do because i certainly don’t want to rug a bunch of random people,” Siqi wrote. Siqi decided to sell 10% of his holdings, representing 5% of the total token supply, raising approximately $49,200. liquidated 10%. thanks to the SOL community for $49,263 contributed to hankinson lab. if it tanks, i'm ok – i don't want to be the one to rug folks. if it moons, i'll announce more liquidations 24 hours in advance to support the lab further. thank you – this is pure magic. — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 26, 2024 The funds were pledged to the Hankinson Lab at the University of Colorado, the only North American research facility dedicated to Mira’s condition. Following a community poll, Siqi committed to selling another 10%, with proceeds also going to the lab. Acknowledging the token’s rapid rise, Siqi proposed a gradual approach to avoid market disruption. “I may commit to selling like 1% daily, and I won’t be moving anything until tomorrow,” he stated. As of the latest update, the MIRA token was trading at $0.043, with a market cap of $43 million, according to data from DEX Screener . Degens Can Do Good Too In a post on X, Pump.fun, the Solana-based marketplace that was used to create the $MIRA token, acknowledged that meme coins can also be used for good causes aside from their speculative causes. “Over $400k cash and millions in tokens have been raised in just a few hours for a good cause through a memecoin,” the platform wrote. over $400k cash and millions in tokens have been raised in just a few hours for a good cause through a memecoin degens can do good too!

38138047,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667283,1735212645,"Ethereum Total Value Locked Reaches Highest Level Since 2022 After Crossing $90 Billion, Will Price Follow?","Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, has reached a significant milestone after its Total Value Locked (TVL) surpassed $90 billion this month. This massive surge marks the highest TVL Ethereum has recorded since April 2022, igniting discussions about the likelihood of a huge price rally in the coming months. Ethereum TVL Hits New Milestone With $90 Billion Growth Data from DeFi TVL aggregator DefiLlama reveals that Ethereum’s TVL has surged past $90 billion, reaching its highest level since April 2022. This unexpected resurgence signifies a potential comeback for the altcoin giant, further solidifying its position at the forefront of the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern Says ETH Will Touch $12,000 A surging TVL generally signals an increased usage and adoption of Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem. It reflects both interest and confidence from institutional and individual investors, underscoring a potential shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. The massive growth in Ethereum’s TVL has also sparked debates about its potential impacts on the altcoin’s price trajectory. Various analysts are speculating that this distinct milestone could trigger a price recovery for Ethereum, which has been experiencing a prolonged consolidation since its decline below $4,000. Commenting on Ethereum’s $90 billion TVL growth, crypto analyst ‘Bitcoin Buddha’ suggested that the top altcoin could be at the beginning of its next bull run, driven by market sentiment and steady bullish momentum. The analyst also cautions that not holding ETH could lead to regret, predicting an bullish altcoin season and an Ethereum bull run by 2025. Echoing this enthusiasm, a crypto member known as ‘CR’ emphasized that 2025 could be a pivotal year, as he anticipates a potential bull rally for Ethereum. The price of ETH is currently trading at $3,368, reflecting more than a 15% crash from its previous price high around the $4,000 mark. While Ethereum’s $90 billion TVL growth is a major development, DefiLlama has recorded a significant drop, with the TVL currently at $69.31 billion. Despite this decline, analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s future price prospects. Analysts Strong Bullish Stance On Ethereum Price Potential Various crypto community analysts are super bullish on Ethereum’s future outlook, projecting massive price rallies by 2025. According to crypto analyst Mags, Ethereum is gearing up for a massive price rally that could propel it to a new all-time high of $7,297.

Mister Crypto has also highlighted a growing interest among whales, with these large-scale investors seemingly preparing for a bullish surge in Ethereum.

38137928,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376218,1735212498,"PENGU Overtakes BONK, Becomes Top Meme Coin on Solana at $2.6B Valuation","The newly launched Pudgy Penguins cryptocurrency Pengu (PENGU) has flipped Bonk (BONK) to claim the crown as the largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, with a market cap of $2.65 billion. The shift is the culmination of a rally that kicked off on Christmas Eve when the token gained over 30% in 24 hours. PENGU Rises Data from the crypto price tracking website CoinGecko shows that the broader Solana meme coin market has experienced explosive growth, with its total valuation rising to $18.2 billion, a 10.3% increase over the last day. Anchoring this performance was PENGU, which posted an 11.2% jump in the past 24 hours and a remarkable 22.3% rise in the last seven days. The meme coin, airdropped to members of the globally successful Pudgy Penguins NFT community on December 17, has not been without controversy. Soon after the token’s launch, the floor prices of the NFT collection plunged by more than 50%, wiping out any gains made since early November. According to analysts, this was largely because the value of the collection was partly pegged on exclusive access to the brand, with the introduction of PENGU making investment in the NFTs more accessible, therefore diluting their worth. On its rollout, the coin shot to a record high of $0.0684 before dropping to a record low of $0.0114. It then see-sawed for the next few days, moving between $0.038 on December 18 to $0.0231 on December 20. However, since December 23, it has been making steady gains, going as high as $0.0417 on Boxing Day, a price that pushed its market cap to $2.62 billion. BONK Falls Conversely, the previous king of the Solana meme coins, BONK, showed more modest improvements in its price over the last seven days, going up 6.9% in that period. Further, across two weeks, it lost 17% of its value, with CoinGecko data showing another 23% plunge over 30 days, putting its market cap at just over $2.5 billion and allowing PENGU to surpass it. The competition doesn’t end there. Other meme tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are vying for investor attention. On Christmas Eve, the former reached an all-time high of $1.02, pushing its overall worth beyond the $1 billion mark. However, despite Fartcoin being among the top gainers across seven days with a price increase of 13.1%, it has plummeted 15% since December 25. With a unit currently changing hands at about $$0.986, its $1.072 billion market cap is still some ways behind WIF’s $1.9 billion.

38137895,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398223,1735212362,"Bitcoin Advocate Michael Saylor Says He Was Wrong About Ethereum, Here’s Why","The post Bitcoin Advocate Michael Saylor Says He Was Wrong About Ethereum, Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor, once a fierce critic of Ethereum, has recently admitted that he was wrong in his earlier views. The prominent Bitcoin advocate had previously predicted that Ethereum would be labeled an unregistered security, and he believed it would never be approved for a spot ETF. Let’s find out what changed his views. What Changed in Saylor’s Views? In a recent interview on the Altcoin Daily channe l, Michael Saylor admitted he was wrong about Ethereum. He explained that his views changed in the second quarter of the year. The turning point came when former President Donald Trump began supporting the crypto community . Trump recognized the growing influence of digital assets, and this helped change the way people saw crypto. Saylor pointed out that this shift, along with the growing support from the political right has made the future look much better for Ethereum and other digital assets. He thinks the change in politics has opened the door to a more positive future for crypto. Saylor’s Key Expectation Meanwhile, Saylor sees two possible futures for the crypto world. In the first scenario, Bitcoin stays the only digital asset recognized as a commodity, while Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies remain in a gray area with unclear regulations. The second scenario, which seems more likely now, is the end of the “war on crypto.” This would provide a clear definition of digital assets and allow the industry to thrive under a more manageable regulatory environment. Bright Future Ahead for Bitcoin and Ethereum With the prospect of a digital assets framework becoming a reality, Saylor believes that Bitcoin is poised for significant growth. Instead of growing at a rate of 20-40% per year, Bitcoin could see a much more rapid surge, potentially pushing Bitcoin to a $280 trillion asset class. As for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, they will likely experience a new lease on life with the emergence of a clear regulatory structure, which Saylor describes as a “crypto renaissance.” He sees a future where millions of new digital assets will be created, leading to the growth of exchanges, wallets, and applications. While there may be setbacks, Saylor believes this shift will bring new opportunities and a thriving digital economy. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 2024 Trump Win Sparks Billion-Dollar Gains for Musk, Armstrong, and Garlinghouse , Need for a Clear Framework As per Michael Saylor, the crypto market as a whole now has new hope. He believes that other digital assets will thrive if a clear regulatory framework is set. In addition to this the rise of tokenized assets, including stablecoins, could help grow the industry from a $100 billion to a $1 trillion market. Ethereum, along with Bitcoin, stands to benefit as the digital economy rapidly evolves, bringing millions of new digital assets to life. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Despite the slight correction, GAME continues to attract attention as the third-largest token by market capitalization within the Virtuals Protocol ecosystem. Over the past week, the token has seen a 122% uptick in price, fueled by growing interest in AI agents on the platform. Meanwhile, Prefrontal Cortex Convo Agent by Virtuals (CONVO) has also shown impressive gains, with a trading volume of $4,563,276 in the past 24 hours, an increase of 79.10% compared to the previous day.

Key tokens within the Virtuals Protocol include GAME, CONVO, aixbt (AIXBT), Luna (LUNA), and Iona (IONA). Since its launch, Virtuals Protocol has seen its VIRTUAL token price skyrocket by 6,252%, from an initial $0.051 to an all-time high of $3.24.

While the crypto market faces a downswing after the Fed rate announcement, traders find other bullish cryptos to mimic the XRP price rally and yield record-breaking gains in the next bullish leg. The demand for low-cap altcoins rose amid capital rotation from large-cap altcoins after making new all-time highs this cycle, especially Ripple. This promising opportunity is grabbed by the one and only DTX Exchange (DTX), emerging as a must-invest crypto as its listing is anticipated to happen during the peak of this bullish cycle. In this article, we’ll see Ripple developments, how its price soared 5x within days, and why DTX Exchange (DTX) is well-positioned to break the XRP price records next month. What Caused Ripple (XRP) To Rally 500% After Trump’s Victory The XRP price surge is attributed to its recent RLUSD stablecoin development and launch. After approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the Ripple Foundation began a new era alongside ledger enhancements for the financial and banking sector. After entering the Singapore markets, XRP price enjoys fresh demand with 5.4% intraday gains. Furthermore, the resignation of Gary Gensler, the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC chair, and Trump’s promises for crypto-friendly policies also played a critical role in pushing the XRP price to an all-time high amid its ongoing conflict with the SEC. This price trend made Ripple the most profitable investment for November, multiplying traders’ capital by 5x. Why DTX Exchange Could Mimic XRP Price Potential In 2025 Ripple (XRP) has seen impressive growth, with a 5x surge in recent weeks, driven by its stablecoin developments and market momentum. However, the price drop to $2 poses a challenge amid the ongoing bearish pressures. For many experts, it’s unlikely that the XRP price can reach another all-time high in the bullish cycle expected to happen after Trump’s inauguration. DTX Exchange, on the other hand, steals the spotlight with its advanced features like tokenized ETF trading and 1000x leverage. With over $10.5 million raised in its presale stage 6, DTX is positioned to surpass XRP’s growth, offering traders a unique opportunity for higher returns as its listing approaches. DTX Exchange (DTX) Rallies Unbounded After $10.5M Presale DTX Exchange (DTX) races ahead in the presale sector with its cutting-edge trading technologies and hybrid platform. Offering access to over 120,000 digital assets across diverse sectors such as forex, cryptocurrencies, and stocks, DTX delivers a seamless and secure trading ecosystem built on scalable infrastructure and advanced hybrid blockchain layer-1 ‘VulcanX’. The platform introduces innovative features such as tokenized ETF trading, advanced automation strategies, and quantitative trading, setting a new benchmark for market efficiency and portfolio diversification. With a KYC-free onboarding process, non-custodial wallets, and multi-tier account systems, DTX minimizes risks by eliminating intermediaries. One of DTX’s most distinctive offerings is its 1000x leverage, enabling traders to maximize their positions with minimal capital while maintaining robust risk management. Having already raised over $10.5 million, with tokens priced at just $0.12, analysts predict a potential breakout to over $2 upon its listing on major centralized exchanges, presenting early investors with the opportunity for a 100x return.

For context, Cardano began Christmas with a $0.93 price but eventually witnessed a bearish spell hours into the day, dropping to retest the $0.91 price support. However, the bulls mounted an impressive defense, triggering a spike to knock at the $0.94 mark .This rebound was rather short-lived, resulting in a mild pullback and subsequent consolidation. Notably, ADA aimed to build on a recent uptrend, which began on Dec. 23 with an impressive 4.8% intraday close. Nonetheless, the bears snuffed this momentum on Christmas day.Cardano Bulls Buy 6B+ ADADespite this, Cardano bulls appear to have increased their appetite. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that these investors procured about 6.83 billion ADA tokens worth $6.352 billion on Christmas Day.For context, bulls refer to market participants who purchased at least 1% of Cardano's trading volume over a 24-hour period. While the latest purchase volume represented a drop from previous highs, overall net inflows marked an impressive two-week high.Particularly, besides the bulls, Cardano bears saw a more substantial drop in their sales volume. Notably, these addresses sold 6.82 billion ADA on Christmas Day , their lowest volume in over a year. Cardano Bulls and Bears IntoTheBlock Cardano Bulls and Bears | IntoTheBlock Interestingly, this bull-bear volume led to an excess demand of 7.53 million Cardano (about $7 million) yesterday, representing the highest demand ADA has witnessed since Dec. 10, which previously led to a three-day price uptick to $1.As the crypto market shows signs of a potential recovery, a new trend of excess demand could grant the bulls enough strength to push Cardano prices above the current range-bound phase. However, this might not occur until the festivities are over.For context, the market is relatively quiet during Yuletide periods as most market participants turn their focus away from trading. This reflects in Cardano's large transaction volume, which slumped to a near two-month low of 4,330 transactions on Christmas Day. ADA Large Transactions IntoTheBlock ADA Large Transactions IntoTheBlock Cardano Eyes $1Despite this, analysts expect the recovery to trigger Cardano's next leg up. Flash, a Bitcoin and crypto trader, asserted on Christmas Eve that Cardano is on the verge of properly starting its own bull market, which he believes could begin when ADA recovers the $1.25 level.https://twitter.com/THEFLASHTRADING/status/1871428815995773367Meanwhile, at press time, Cardano trades for $0.8705, down 5.07% today as it corrects all the gains from the most recent rebound. ADA's chances of a full-blown recovery hinge on its ability to reclaim $1 , which would require a push above the 21-day EMA at $1.014. Cardano 1D Chart Cardano 1D Chart Nonetheless, despite the bearish pressure, its technicals remain favorable. For instance, Cardano's Commodity Channel Index (CCI) has dropped to negative 91, suggesting it might be oversold. Data from CryptoQuant also confirms that RSI has entered the oversold region, and a recovery is imminent.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/26/cardano-bulls-bought-6b-worth-of-ada-on-christmas-day-as-price-eyes-1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-bulls-bought-6b-worth-of-ada-on-christmas-day-as-price-eyes-1,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Can it recover, or will it retest the critical $0.000014451 level? With Bitcoin's price remaining under the $100,000 mark, the bearish influence on meme coins continues to grow. The market cap of meme coins has dropped to $97.83 billion, marking a 3.48% decline over the past 24 hours.Amid this downturn, PEPE’s price has fallen by 6.62% in the same period, bringing its market cap down to $7.33 billion. With the increasing bearish pressure, will PEPE face a short-term pullback to the 7-day low of $0.000014451?PEPE Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, PEPE’s price action shows a failed attempt at a rounding bottom breakout. The price failed to surpass the neckline at $0.00001988, and the higher price rejection kept the peak price below the 38.20% Fibonacci level. PEPE Price Chart The crucial Fibonacci resistance level is priced at $0.00001921. The bearish reversal in PEPE price is now testing the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.00001739. This accounts for a price drop of 10% and breaks below the 20 EMA line. Along with the crucial Fibonacci resistance, the dynamic average line of 50 EMA keeps the bullish growth under check. Moreover, the bearish turnaround results in a negative crossover in the MACD and signal lines. Furthermore, the 100 and 200 EMA lines are on the verge of giving a bearish crossover. Hence, the technical indicators are giving a sell signal for the PEPE meme coin.PEPE Price TargetBased on the price action, the crucial support at $0.00001732 and the 23.60% Fibonacci level form a solid demand zone for PEPE. However, a close below this level on the 4-hour chart will likely lead to a retest of $0.000014451.On the other hand, if the broader market recovers, a sharp reversal breaking above the 38.20% Fibonacci level could test the horizontal resistance at $0.00002232. This level is slightly above the 68.80% Fibonacci level at $0.000022155.",NEGATIVE,PEPE,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/26/bearish-clouds-over-pepe-is-a-drop-to-0-000014-inevitable/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bearish-clouds-over-pepe-is-a-drop-to-0-000014-inevitable,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

38137293,https://crypto.news/?p=14321887,1735211252,"Coinbase CLO shares data on crypto hedge funds debanking, demands for answers","The Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal took to X to demand answers after learning from the AIMA survey that 75% of crypto hedge funds face issues with accessing basic banking services. None of the traditional alternative investment managers (e.g., real estate) experienced similar troubles with the banks. The Grewal’s X post raises questions that have already been circulating in the media for quite a while. You have probably heard of Operation Choke Point 2.0 or read about the redacted documents published by Coinbase in which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation openly asks banks to pause all the operations associated with cryptocurrencies. The Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) survey report furnishes these concerns with new statistical grounds. Alongside Grewal, AIMA calls for action in the press release. Why would 3/4 of 160 crypto hedge funds report issues with basic banking services over 3 years when ZERO were reported by 20 other alternative investors surveyed? Why would most be told their bank is dropping them? Good on @AIMA_org for sharing this data– we need answers, now. — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 20, 2024 The survey was held in October, and its results are concerning. Before we move to the key takeaways from the press release, we should stress that, according to AIMA, debunking is a problem exclusive to crypto hedge funds. AIMA surveyed 20 other alternative investors who were not dealing with cryptocurrencies, and none of them had issues while receiving basic banking services. Table of Contents The key takeaways from the AIMA press release AIMA calls for change, Trump vows to terminate Operation Choke Point 2.0 Wait a minute! Isn’t Operation Choke Point 2.0 just a conspiracy theory? Possible implications of Operation Choke Point 2.0 The key takeaways from the AIMA press release The key points from the AIMA press release are as follows: AIMA surveyed 160 crypto hedge funds. Three-fourths of them have contested facing troubles while accessing or growing standard banking services in the last three years. The troubles may include complete service denial. Only 2% of the hedge funds whose relationships were about to be terminated received a formal explanation for that. The named reason was that the banks were limiting crypto clients. According to AIMA, debanking of crypto businesses (the so-called “Operation Choke Point 2.0”) undermines the operational efficiency of the U.S. crypto sector, negatively impacts investors’ confidence, and harms the acquisition of the skilled professionals. John D’Agostino, a co-chair of the AIMA Digital Assets Group, concludes that the banking challenges are not a niche problem as they burden the overall development of the U.S. economy and innovation. The complete report is available here . AIMA calls for change, Trump vows to terminate Operation Choke Point 2.0 AIMA calls for a collaborative effort to address the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency business. The association sees the solution in working closely with the new administration, the leaders of the banking sphere, and policymakers. During the 2024 Presidential campaign, Trump, who was demonstrating his animosity towards the original Operation Choke Point started during Obama’s White House tenure, declared that he was going to shut down Operation Choke Point 2.0 as soon as he gets elected. However, as the statements made by Jerome Powell during the FOMC event indicate, Trump will have to deal with various cryptocurrency sceptics, including ones with massive influences and high positions. Wait a minute! Isn’t Operation Choke Point 2.0 just a conspiracy theory? Let’s begin with a bit of history. Unleashed during the Obama presidency, Operation Choke Point was the Department of Justice’s secretive program allegedly aimed at denying banking services to fraudsters of all kinds, including those who traded ammunition, pornography, drug paraphernalia, etc. The idea was pretty simple: if we uncompromisingly cut the access to financial operations for fraudsters, they won’t be able to break the law, and many crimes will be prevented. Soon, the operation achieved notoriety as, due to a lack of clear limitations, debanking turned into a weapon against political enemies instead of protecting society from fraud and crime. In 2013, the program critics came to believe that fighting the political opponents was the prime goal of Operation Choke Point. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to eliminate this operation. While the Obama-era Operation Choke Point was deployed officially, the existence of the modern-day Operation Choke Point 2.0 is yet to be confirmed. Nevertheless, the leaked documents and cases like the ones described in the AIMA press release make people think that an operation similar to Operation Choke Point exists nowadays and targets cryptocurrency companies. The operation is in effect, disregarding its official name. Although the FDIC seems to be the main actor in the operation, there are other disjointed institutions pushing banks to limit services for clients working in the crypto sector. Read more: https://crypto.news/nic-carter-revisits-operation-choke-point-2-0-after-bombshell-silvergate-testimony/ Some experts covering this “operation” expressed an opinion that the FDIC attack on the crypto industry is the response to the turbulent events that shook the crypto market in 2022. It includes the FTX collapse, TerraUSD losing its peg and crashing altogether, Celsius and Voyager freezing the users’ accounts, etc. However, let’s look closely at the documents released by Coinbase in December 2024. We will find out that the FDIC was pressing banks to stop working with cryptocurrency companies before these events. Although the cases mentioned above are not the result of the FDIC actions, they took place in circumstances where banks were already forced to pause service for the crypto clients. Possible implications of Operation Choke Point 2.0 Banks don’t have a clear checklist to determine if the client can access services. In a situation where banks cannot decide on the risk rate they are willing to work at, they may prefer to block services for the clients dealing with cryptocurrency to avoid a backlash from the FDIC. AIMA has already voiced the possible implications. By far, pressure on banks and a lack of clear instructions will hurdle innovation in the U.S. and make the country unattractive for companies from the cryptocurrency sector.

A whale who made $9.5M on $ai16z exchanged 500K $ai16z($412K) for $PENGU again 2 hours ago. This whale initially spent $1.15M to buy 14.08M $ai16z and sold 7.87M $ai16z for $5.57M, leaving 6.21M $ai16z($5.08M). #ai16z Over the past 8 days, the whale has spent $2.47M to buy… pic.twitter.com/IDZt5VeAQ1 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 26, 2024 The investor has spent a total of $2.47 million acquiring 79.9 million $PENGU over the last eight days and now holds unrealized profits amounting to $835,000. PENGU whale transactions drive market interest In another notable transaction, a whale who received a PENGU airdrop of 116.7 million tokens (initially valued at $394,000) at the listing price has increased their holdings. After PENGU’s price surged by 660% since its launch, the airdropped tokens are now worth $4.4 million. This particular whale spent 5,250 Solana (SOL) equivalent to $1 million to purchase 34.42 million PENGU, bringing their total holdings to 151.12 million tokens, now valued at $5.748 million. Meanwhile, per market tracker Onchain Lens, a newly created wallet also amassed 538.4 million PENGU tokens, worth more than $20 million at current valuations, on the day before Christmas. This accumulation occurred at an average price of $0.028 per token, according to Nansen data. A newly created wallet has accumulated 519.99M $PENGU , worth $14.72M from #Binance at an average price of $0.028.

On December 17, the token’s price skyrocketed by nearly 500% within its first hours of trading, climbing from $0.01141 to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.06845, according to CoinGecko. However, this meteoric rise was followed by a sharp correction, with the price dropping to $0.031 by December 18, marking a 55% decline from its ATH. The token’s price has since stabilized within a range of $0.033 to $0.039 per token over the past seven days, with a low of $0.023 observed during this period. Despite the volatility, the project’s official social media channels reported that PENGU has surpassed 500,000 holders, indicating strong interest and adoption among investors. The surge in liquidity has also been mirrored by increased trading volumes. On December 24, PENGU’s market cap soared past $2.26 billion. Blockchain security experts warn of a hack targeting Pudgy Penguins users Meanwhile, blockchain security analysts have uncovered a new scam targeting cryptocurrency users through malicious advertisements on Google’s ad network. The scam specifically aims at users of Pudgy Penguins by exploiting Google ads to lure unsuspecting users into visiting fraudulent websites. According to Scam Sniffer, a blockchain security firm, the ads reportedly embed suspicious JavaScript code designed to detect if the visitor has a crypto wallet. Upon detecting a wallet, the code redirects users to a fake website that closely mimics the legitimate Pudgy Penguins website. 🚨 URGENT SECURITY ALERT 🚨 1/6 A user reported being redirected to a fake @pudgypenguins website through a Singapore news portal.

Here Are the Details,"The South Korean government announced today that it has imposed sanctions on 15 individuals and one organization from North Korea for illegal cyber activities, including cryptocurrency theft. South Korea Imposes Sanctions on North Korean Crypto Hackers and IT Operators The move marks the latest effort to curb the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) increasing reliance on cybercrime to fund its regime. According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, the sanctioned individuals are linked to Bureau 313, a branch of the Machinery Manufacturing Industry Department of the Workers' Party of Korea. This unit, which the UN Security Council has imposed sanctions on since 2016, oversees North Korea's weapons production, including its ballistic missile program. “North Korean IT personnel are known to conceal their identities and work for global IT companies while engaging in information theft and cyberattacks,” the ministry said in a statement. Kim Cheol-min, who was among those sanctioned, infiltrated IT companies in the US and Canada as an employee and transferred significant amounts of foreign currency to Pyongyang. South Korea also imposed sanctions on a North Korean entity that sent IT workers abroad to generate revenue for the regime and its military operations. North Korean hackers have been linked to some of the largest cryptocurrency thefts worldwide. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has confirmed that North Korean cyber actors were behind the theft of $308 million in crypto from Japan-based crypto firm DMM Bitcoin, which has since ceased operations. *This is not investment advice.

38167846,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114348,1735210822,Japan Expresses Caution on Adding Bitcoin to National Reserves,"Japan Expresses Caution on Adding Bitcoin to National Reserves The Japanese government has officially expressed caution regarding the inclusion of Bitcoin in its national reserves. According to a report by CoinPost, as cited by Wu Blockchain on X, the government clarified that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, do not fall under the foreign exchange reserve category. This stance reflects Japan’s prioritization of security and liquidity in its reserve system, which contrasts with the inherent volatility of digital assets like Bitcoin. Why Japan is Reluctant to Add Bitcoin to National Reserves Japan’s decision to exclude Bitcoin from its national reserves is rooted in several key concerns: Volatility : The unpredictable nature of Bitcoin’s value makes it incompatible with the stability required for reserve assets. Liquidity Requirements : National reserves must maintain high liquidity to respond to economic crises or financial emergencies promptly. Security Risks : While blockchain is inherently secure, the risk of hacks or loss through mishandling presents a challenge for incorporating Bitcoin into national systems. A government spokesperson emphasized the importance of maintaining reserve assets that align with these priorities, stating that Bitcoin’s volatility undermines its suitability as a reliable reserve currency. Japan’s Reserve System: An Overview Japan’s foreign exchange reserves are among the largest in the world, predominantly composed of: US Dollar Assets : Treasury bonds, cash deposits, and other dollar-denominated securities. Gold Holdings : A time-tested reserve asset known for its stability. Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) : International reserve assets maintained by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The reserve composition underscores Japan’s cautious approach, favoring assets that provide consistent value and are easily convertible during times of need. Bitcoin’s Incompatibility with Current Reserve Standards Bitcoin’s unique characteristics, while appealing to individual investors and institutions, create challenges for its inclusion in national reserves: Price Swings : Bitcoin has experienced dramatic price changes, including peaks and troughs within short periods, making it unreliable for reserve purposes. Decentralization : While decentralization is a core strength of Bitcoin, it limits government control, which is essential for managing reserve assets. Regulatory Ambiguity : The lack of standardized global regulations around cryptocurrencies adds another layer of complexity to using Bitcoin as a reserve asset. These factors collectively explain why Japan, despite its pro-innovation stance in technology, remains cautious about integrating Bitcoin into its reserve system. Global Context: Other Nations’ Perspectives on Bitcoin Reserves Japan’s conservative stance on Bitcoin contrasts with the approach of some other nations: El Salvador : The first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender has also added it to its national reserves, despite criticisms about volatility and risk. Russia and Iran : These nations have explored the use of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to circumvent sanctions, though they have not formally included Bitcoin in their reserves. United States : While some policymakers have proposed studying the potential role of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is not currently part of U.S. reserves. Japan’s emphasis on stability and liquidity aligns more closely with the policies of developed nations that prioritize traditional reserve assets over cryptocurrencies. Japan’s Position on Cryptocurrency Regulation Although cautious about Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Japan remains a global leader in cryptocurrency regulation and innovation: Early Adoption of Regulations : Japan was one of the first countries to create a legal framework for cryptocurrency exchanges, ensuring investor protection and market stability. Support for Blockchain Innovation : The government encourages blockchain startups and research, recognizing the transformative potential of the technology. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Exploration : Japan is actively exploring the development of a digital yen, reflecting its commitment to staying at the forefront of financial innovation. This dual approach highlights Japan’s balanced perspective: fostering innovation while mitigating risks associated with cryptocurrencies. What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future as a Reserve Asset Japan’s cautious stance raises important questions about the role of Bitcoin in global reserves: Stability Challenges : Can Bitcoin’s volatility be mitigated to make it a viable reserve asset? Global Acceptance : Will more nations follow Japan’s lead, or will they take a risk-tolerant approach like El Salvador? Evolution of Reserves : As digital assets gain traction, could new frameworks emerge to integrate cryptocurrencies into national reserves? While Bitcoin’s future as a reserve asset remains uncertain, its role in the broader financial ecosystem continues to grow. Conclusion Japan’s cautious stance on Bitcoin as part of its national reserves underscores the challenges of integrating volatile digital assets into traditional financial systems. By prioritizing security, liquidity, and stability, Japan has reaffirmed its commitment to a conservative reserve strategy that aligns with its economic objectives. However, the decision does not diminish Japan’s broader support for blockchain innovation and cryptocurrency regulation. As the global conversation around digital assets evolves, Japan’s balanced approach could serve as a model for other nations navigating the complexities of this new financial frontier.

38137242,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631395,1735210800,Buying Lightchain AI (LCAI) Now Is Like Getting in on XRP at $0.006 in 2017,"Many crypto enthusiasts regret missing early opportunities in projects like XRP, which skyrocketed from mere cents to an all-time high of over $3.50. However, Lightchain AI (LCAI) presents a unique opportunity to make similar gains, priced currently at just $0.003. With groundbreaking technology that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain, LCAI is poised for massive growth, and getting in now could mirror the early days of XRP. Let’s break down why LCAI is the next big thing in crypto and why early investors could see huge returns. Why LCAI is Poised to Mimic XRP’s Early Success Looking back at XRP’s journey, it started as a relatively unknown asset in the crypto space before its explosive growth. Much like XRP in 2017, Lightchain AI is in its early stages, but its utility-driven approach, coupled with the growing interest in AI, could propel it to the top. Here’s why. 1. Successful Presale and Staking Launch LCAI has raised over $2.2 million in its presale phase, indicating strong investor interest. Following this achievement, the platform launched its staking feature, allowing token holders to participate in network security and earn rewards. 2. Strategic Partnerships Across Industries Lightchain AI is forming partnerships in sectors such as supply chain management, data analytics, and healthcare AI. These collaborations aim to facilitate real-world applications of its AI-integrated blockchain platform, enhancing its utility and adoption. 3. Integration with Solana’s Ecosystem Operating on the Solana blockchain, Lightchain AI leverages Solana’s high transaction speeds and scalability. This integration enables efficient deployment of AI-driven applications, attracting interest from Solana investors and developers seeking innovative solutions. 4. Innovative Tokenomics and Governance LCAI’s tokenomics are designed to ensure sustainability and equitable distribution. The platform emphasizes decentralized governance, allowing token holders to influence key decisions, which fosters a community-driven ecosystem. 5. Analyst Predictions and Market Positioning Analysts suggest that LCAI’s unique integration of AI and blockchain positions it for significant growth, potentially outperforming established platforms like Solana and TRON by 2025. Its early-stage investment opportunities and innovative technology make it an attractive option for investors seeking high returns. What Sets LCAI Apart from Other Cryptos While tokens like XRP gained value through speculation and market momentum, LCAI is designed for long-term growth through real-world utility. Here’s a comparison of why LCAI stands out. Feature Lightchain AI (LCAI) XRP (2017) Focus AI and blockchain integration Cross-border payments Technology AIVM, PoI consensus mechanism XRP Ledger, payment system Growth Potential High (target price $15+) Moderate (initial hype) Utility AI-driven dApps, enterprise use Payment solution Why Buying LCAI Now Is Like Buying XRP at $0.006 LCAI presents a unique investment opportunity reminiscent of XRP’s early days when it was priced under a penny. Right now in its early sale stage at only $0.003, LCAI gives a cheap chance for buyers who might have lost on past crypto spikes. Its promise is based on its solid tech base, like how XRP got popular through its role in the payment area. LCAI is using AI mix, a fast-expanding field with endless uses make it stand out as token with big growth chance First investors in XRP got big gains in 2017 and LCAI is ready to give like advantages to early users as its worth rise with more adoption and tech advances. Also, LCAI has a clear AI setup, making sure all AI choi͏ce-making steps are open and checkable, which helps build trust with users and makers. It adds shared rule-making into AI, allowing for smarter choices from the community. With these new features, LCAI stands out as an exciting chance for money in a changing crypto and AI world. What Could Drive LCAI’s Price Surge Several key factors could drive LCAI’s price from its current presale value to $15 or higher within months, just as XRP saw explosive growth in the past. 1. Technological Milestones LCAI’s roadmap includes critical milestones such as the launch of its testnet and mainnet, which will allow it to scale rapidly. Each successful milestone is likely to trigger significant interest and price surges. 2. Partnerships and Adoption Strategic partnerships with industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain will position LCAI as a leader in AI-powered blockchain solutions. The more use cases that emerge, the greater the adoption, and the higher the token’s value. 3. Tokenomics LCAI’s deflationary tokenomics ensure that as the token supply decreases, its value increases. A portion of transaction fees is burned over time, creating scarcity and driving demand. LCAI New XRP Buying Lightchain AI (LCAI) at $0.003 is like getting in on XRP at $0.006 in 2017. With its innovative use of AI technology and blockchain, LCAI is positioned to become the next big mover in the crypto space. The combination of real-world utility, strong tokenomics, and a promising roadmap makes LCAI a strong contender for exponential gains in the coming months. As the AI industry continues to expand, Lightchain AI’s potential to disrupt multiple sectors presents an incredible investment opportunity for those looking to diversify their portfolios with a cutting-edge crypto asset. Don’t miss the chance to be part of the future—invest in Lightchain AI today and watch your investment grow.

38136904,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114356,1735210515,Declining Binance BTC Reserves Signal Potential Market Uptrend,"Declining Binance BTC Reserves Signal Potential Market Uptrend Binance’s Bitcoin (BTC) reserves have reached their lowest levels since January 2024, according to CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost. This sustained decline, ongoing since August, could indicate brewing positive momentum in the cryptocurrency market. Historical patterns reveal that similar reductions in BTC reserves have often preceded significant price rallies. What Are Binance BTC Reserves? Binance BTC reserves represent the total Bitcoin held in wallets associated with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. These reserves are a critical metric for gauging market sentiment and liquidity, as they reflect the balance between Bitcoin inflows (deposits) and outflows (withdrawals). A decrease in reserves typically suggests: Increased withdrawal activity, often associated with investors moving BTC to private wallets for long-term holding. Reduced selling pressure on exchanges, signaling bullish market sentiment. The Current Decline in Binance BTC Reserves CryptoQuant data shows that Binance’s BTC reserves have steadily decreased since August 2024, marking a sharp decline to levels last seen in January. This downtrend aligns with a broader market shift, potentially pointing to growing confidence among Bitcoin investors. “The consistent decline in Binance BTC reserves could be a precursor to a significant market uptrend,” said Darkfost in a recent analysis. Historical Context: January’s BTC Rally The current situation bears a striking resemblance to the events of January 2024 when Binance’s BTC reserves similarly dropped to a low point. What followed was a remarkable 90% surge in Bitcoin prices over the next several months. The January rally was fueled by several factors: Investor Accumulation : Reduced exchange reserves signaled long-term holding behavior. Market Optimism : Positive macroeconomic developments boosted confidence in cryptocurrencies. Reduced Selling Pressure : The decline in reserves reduced downward pressure on BTC prices. If history repeats itself, the current reserve levels could pave the way for another significant price surge. Factors Contributing to the Decline in Reserves Several dynamics are driving the current reduction in Binance BTC reserves: Long-Term Holding Investors withdrawing BTC from exchanges to private wallets indicate a shift toward long-term holding strategies. Institutional Activity Institutional investors often move large amounts of BTC off exchanges to secure custody solutions, contributing to reserve declines. Decreasing Selling Pressure Lower reserves suggest reduced intent to sell, creating an environment conducive to upward price movements. Potential Implications for the Market The decline in Binance BTC reserves could have far-reaching implications: Bullish Price Action : Reduced reserves historically align with bullish trends as supply on exchanges diminishes. Market Confidence : Increased withdrawal activity reflects investor confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Liquidity Shifts : A decrease in exchange reserves may limit immediate BTC availability for trading, influencing price volatility. How This Aligns with Broader Market Trends The cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery in recent months, bolstered by: Macroeconomic Developments : Increasing adoption of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Regulatory Clarity : Progressive regulatory frameworks in key markets have fueled optimism among investors. Technological Advances : Bitcoin’s scalability improvements and adoption in emerging markets have strengthened its fundamentals. The decline in Binance BTC reserves complements these trends, reinforcing the narrative of a strengthening market. Potential Risks and Considerations While the decline in Binance BTC reserves is a positive signal, it is essential to consider potential risks: Market Manipulation Sudden withdrawals could be strategic, creating an artificial impression of scarcity. Regulatory Crackdowns Uncertainty around crypto regulations could impact investor sentiment, dampening price momentum. Global Economic Shifts Broader economic factors, such as interest rate changes or geopolitical tensions, could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Investors should remain cautious and evaluate multiple factors before making decisions. Key Takeaways for Investors The current trend in Binance BTC reserves offers several insights for traders and long-term investors: Monitor Exchange Reserves : Changes in BTC reserves on major exchanges can serve as early indicators of market trends. Focus on Fundamentals : A declining reserve signals strong fundamentals and investor confidence in Bitcoin. Prepare for Volatility : While a bullish trend may be forming, the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile. Conclusion The decline in Binance BTC reserves to their lowest point since January 2024 highlights a potential shift in market dynamics, echoing patterns that preceded this year’s 90% Bitcoin price surge. This trend reflects growing investor confidence, reduced selling pressure, and the broader maturation of the cryptocurrency market. While the outlook appears promising, investors should remain vigilant, balancing optimism with caution. As Bitcoin continues to assert its dominance, the current reserve trend could signal the beginning of another bullish phase.

38138138,https://invezz.com/?p=2405605,1735210373,Pudgy Penguins NFT users targeted by malicious Google ad campaign,"A sophisticated phishing campaign has been uncovered, targeting users of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project through malicious Google Ads. The attack uses advanced mechanisms to exploit vulnerabilities in Web3 wallets and ad networks, exposing unsuspecting users to significant risks. Researchers, including ScamSniffer, have identified the malicious ads as part of a broader effort to deceive crypto enthusiasts, raising concerns across the Web3 ecosystem. Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam @realScamSniffer · Follow 🚨 URGENT SECURITY ALERT 🚨1/6 A user reported being redirected to a fake @pudgypenguins website through a Singapore news portal. Our investigation revealed this is part of a larger malicious advertising campaign. 1:11 pm · 25 Dec 2024 249 Reply Copy link Read 10 replies The incident underscores the growing need for heightened vigilance, robust security practices, and better regulatory oversight among NFT holders and Web3 participants to mitigate these threats effectively. How the NFT phishing attack works The attackers utilise Google Ads to distribute phishing scripts hosted on the Adloox tracking domain. These scripts scan users’ browsers for Web3 wallets. When a wallet is detected, the user is redirected to a fraudulent site—pudqypenguin[.]com—designed to steal wallet credentials. What sets this campaign apart is its ability to exploit Prebid.js, a widely used header bidding API library. Websites integrating the Adloox analytics module may unknowingly transmit malware-laden scripts, making users more vulnerable to such attacks. Although Pudgy Penguins NFT users are the immediate targets, researchers warn that the method could easily be adapted for other Web3 projects, amplifying its potential impact. The attack’s sophisticated nature and its reliance on established advertising frameworks highlight a worrying trend in phishing tactics, especially for the crypto industry. With growing reliance on Web3 wallets for transactions and asset storage, the repercussions of such breaches could extend beyond individual users, affecting the broader ecosystem, reducing trust in decentralised platforms, and impacting the confidence of new Web3 adopters. Mitigation measures Following the exposure of this campaign, calls for proactive user measures have intensified. Recommended steps to minimise risks include: Ad blockers: Installing ad blockers can reduce exposure to malicious advertisements. Browser segregation: Using separate browsers for crypto activities and general browsing can help contain potential threats. URL vigilance: Verifying website URLs before entering wallet credentials is essential to avoid fake sites. ScamSniffer, a phishing detection tool, has also proven effective in identifying and mitigating similar threats. The swift response of researchers like ZachXBT has been pivotal in addressing the immediate risks. After the campaign was publicised, Adloox removed the compromised JavaScript files, halting further damage and offering some relief to affected users. This phishing campaign is a wake-up call for the Web3 community, emphasising the importance of user education, secure browsing practices, and vigilance in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. As attackers continue to refine their methods, both users and platform providers must adopt comprehensive security measures to safeguard the integrity of digital assets and interactions. Collaborative efforts between security researchers, ad networks, and Web3 developers will be essential in preventing future attacks of this scale and complexity.

During a December 26 session, Ishiba responded to Satoshi Hamada, a member of the House of Councilors from the Party to Protect the People from NHK, who advocated for Japan to follow the United States in adopting Bitcoin as part of its foreign exchange reserves. Hamada urged the Japanese government to consider diversifying its reserves with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, highlighting the growing global interest in the asset. However, Ishiba stated that crypto assets do not currently fall under Japan’s foreign exchange category and emphasized the lack of clarity on international approaches, making it difficult for the government to adopt a definitive stance. Global Push for Bitcoin Reserves Gains Traction Japan’s hesitancy comes as other nations explore the potential of Bitcoin in sovereign reserves. Jack Mallers, the CEO of Strike, recently predicted that Donald Trump, upon assuming the U.S. presidency, might issue an executive order designating Bitcoin as a reserve asset . Similarly, Brazil has made strides in this direction . Congressman Eros Biondini introduced a bill on November 25 to establish a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, known as RESBit. If passed, Brazil would join a small but growing group of nations recognizing Bitcoin’s role in financial strategy. These developments reflect an increasing acknowledgment of Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and a diversifier in foreign reserves. However, Japan’s conservative approach to financial innovation, coupled with its commitment to regulatory clarity, suggests the country may adopt a wait-and-see strategy. Japan’s Balanced Approach While the Bitcoin reserve debate unfolds, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has pointed to Japan’s proactive stance on cryptocurrency regulation. Speaking in September, Garlinghouse noted Japan’s openness to stablecoin innovation, particularly the potential for a yen-backed stablecoin. He praised the country’s regulatory clarity, describing its market as “healthy” despite its conservatism. Japan’s focus on stablecoins could reflect its preference for financial instruments that align more closely with existing frameworks. However, the global shift toward Bitcoin reserves could put pressure on Japan to reevaluate its stance in the coming years.

Dogecoin is poised for a “parabolic rally,” claims analyst Ali Martinez. ONDO is facing a 30% bearish drop if it doesn’t reclaim $1.86. Bitcoin, which was trading around $92K, surged above $99K over the last seven days. Despite expectations of a ‘Santa Rally’ during the Christmas period, the leading cryptocurrency struggled to retain its price above $99,000. At the time of press, Bitcoin is trading at $95,593 with a market cap of 1.89T. After skyrocketing to an all-time high of $108,268.45 earlier this month, investors started to book profits. As a result, Bitcoin dropped below the $100,000 price level, losing its $2 trillion valuation. However, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still bullish for Bitcoin at 68.59. The gradient of the line suggests that a correction is prevalent after BTC reached overbought levels earlier.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. ADA, LINK, and RTX lead the charge for 2025, with Remittix poised for a potential 20x ROI through its game-changing cross-border payment solutions. Table of Contents Can Remittix deliver a 20x ROI by Q1 2025? Analysts weigh in Cardano partners with $1 trillion EV sector Chainlink expands with 16 integrations across 11 chains Conclusion As the crypto market folds into neutral activity, investors are looking ahead to 2025 for the next top altcoins. The top picks are ADA, given the recent Cardano price action, and LINK, which continues to make a name in the crypto market with blockchain oracles. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is also drawing attention for its ambitious use case in cross-border payments and presale hype. This article delves into the potential of these three tokens and considers which might deliver 20x gains in the coming years. Can Remittix deliver a 20x ROI by Q1 2025? Analysts weigh in Remittix offers a vision and approach to solving financial challenges by focusing on bridging the gap between DeFi and TradFi payment systems. Through its platform, Remittix users can convert cryptocurrencies into fiat and send them to bank accounts worldwide. Central to its potential success is the Remittix Pay API, a tool that allows businesses to accept crypto payments and settle in fiat currencies. Flat-fee pricing and support for over 40 cryptocurrencies make it suitable for both remittances and business operations. This service is relevant as more merchants adopt cryptocurrency as a payment option. The growing demand for efficient cross-border payments enhances Remittix’s appeal. Traditional banking systems often impose high fees and delays, while Remittix eliminates these pain points due to the use of its fast and reliable transactions that will be hugely valuable in underbanked regions helping to further fuel the global adoption of RTX. Cardano partners with $1 trillion EV sector After a remarkable 130% price increase over the last six months, ADA re-entered conversations about being one of the top altcoins ahead of 2025. Cardano’s recent collaboration with the Argentine industry to tokenize Lithium in Q1 2025 makes it a network to watch out for. This move is lauded as the biggest decentralization initiative so far, given the EV industry’s worth of over $1 trillion. In Q3 2024, ADA’s DeFi sector saw a 13.3% growth , attributed to its community-approved governance and Chang Hard Fork. The ADA token builds on its top 10 position as the Cardano price is forecasted to surge by 25% in the next month and 141% in the next three months. Cardano could be following a bullish pattern similar to its 2020 cycle. Chainlink expands with 16 integrations across 11 chains The LINK ecosystem expanded significantly in the past week, accommodating 16 integrations of the Chainlink standard across five services and 11 different chains. With over $14.8 billion in market capitalization, LINK is bringing global finance on-chain through financial institutions such as Euroclear and Swift. LINK’s technical indicator currently signals a “strong buy” as the altcoin holds a 41% increase over the past month. According to Lookonchain , whales are accumulating LINK tokens ahead of the next cycle, giving hope to traders looking to break even. Crypto analysts for CoinCodex forecast LINK’s price will soar by 53% in one month and 108% in the next 3 months. Conclusion The RTX presale is live, with tokens selling for $0.0156 apiece, alongside this analysts tip Remittix to deliver a 20x price increase in the first quarter of 2025, ahead of LINK or ADA.

If approved, this move will position FLOKI as the second memecoin, after Dogecoin, to offer an institutional-grade investment product in Europe. The announcement, made on December 25 , reveals Floki’s collaboration with a regulated asset manager and ETP issuer to design an investment vehicle accessible to institutional and retail investors alike. Floki DAO to Allocate $2.8M Worth of Tokens for the ETP To support the initiative, the Floki DAO has proposed allocating 16 billion FLOKI tokens—worth approximately $2.8 million—from its treasury to provide liquidity for the ETP. The proposal has received overwhelming community support, with 204.9 billion votes in favor and none against. Voting is set to conclude on December 27. The ETP aims to bridge traditional finance with digital assets, enabling investors to gain regulated exposure to FLOKI. While details on the product’s structure and pricing remain confidential, Floki has assured that tokens allocated for liquidity will remain under its ownership and can be reclaimed once third-party liquidity is sufficient.

The card, available in physical and virtual formats across 31 European countries, supports multiple cryptocurrencies, including FLOKI, Bitcoin, and USDT. The initiative aligns with a broader trend of expanding crypto investment options. Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, products like Solana, Ripple, and Dogecoin ETPs have emerged, catering to growing demand. Last month, Valour launched the first Dogecoin ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market, providing retail and institutional investors in the Nordics with regulated exposure to DOGE. Meme Coins Were the “Most Popular” Crypto Narrative in 2024 Meme coins dominated the crypto landscape in 2024 , capturing nearly a third of investor interest, according to a recent CoinGecko report. The study, which analyzed site traffic from January 1 to December 21, revealed that 31% of crypto-related searches centered around these highly speculative tokens. Among the various trends, the “main meme coin narrative” alone accounted for 15% of interest, a notable increase of over six percentage points from 2023. Solana-based meme coins followed closely as the fourth-largest category, with an 8% share of interest. Additionally, other meme coin-related trends, such as those tied to Coinbase’s Base blockchain and AI-themed meme coins , ranked among the top narratives, further solidifying the sector’s prominence. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to lead the market with respective market caps of $49.3 billion and $13.8 billion, contributing to a combined memecoin market valuation of $113.2 billion. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) tokens emerged as the second-most popular crypto narrative of the year, securing nearly 13% of interest.

38136464,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114411,1735209659,Forex Capital Markets: Unlocking Opportunities in the World’s Largest Financial Market,"Forex Capital Markets: Unlocking Opportunities in the World’s Largest Financial Market Forex capital markets, often referred to as the backbone of global finance, facilitate the trading of foreign currencies on a massive scale. With a daily trading volume exceeding $6.6 trillion, the Forex market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world. This article explores the concept of Forex capital markets, their significance, and how traders and investors can benefit from their dynamic nature. What Are Forex Capital Markets? Forex capital markets are platforms where currencies are bought, sold, and exchanged. They play a critical role in facilitating international trade, investments, and monetary policy execution. Key Features of Forex Capital Markets Decentralized Structure : Unlike stock exchanges, Forex operates as an over-the-counter (OTC) market without a centralized location. 24/5 Trading : Forex markets remain open 24 hours a day, five days a week, accommodating traders across different time zones. Currency Pairs : Trading involves pairs of currencies, such as EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, and USD/JPY. Liquidity : Forex markets are highly liquid, allowing for seamless entry and exit of trades. Participants in Forex Capital Markets Various entities engage in Forex trading for different purposes, including: Central Banks Manage monetary policy and stabilize currency values. Institutional Investors Hedge funds, pension funds, and mutual funds participate for portfolio diversification. Corporations Conduct currency exchanges for international trade and investment. Retail Traders Individual traders engage in Forex to profit from currency fluctuations. How Forex Capital Markets Work Currency Pairs Currencies are traded in pairs, with one currency being exchanged for another. For example, in the EUR/USD pair: Base Currency (EUR) : The currency being bought. Quote Currency (USD) : The currency being sold. Price Movements Forex prices are influenced by supply and demand dynamics, driven by factors such as: Interest rate changes. Economic data (GDP, employment, inflation). Political and geopolitical events. Leverage and Margin Forex trading often involves leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with smaller capital. However, this amplifies both potential profits and risks. Benefits of Forex Capital Markets High Liquidity Forex is the most liquid market globally, enabling fast trade execution and reduced slippage. Diverse Opportunities Traders can profit in both rising and falling markets due to the ability to go long or short. Accessibility With low initial capital requirements and the availability of demo accounts, Forex trading is accessible to retail traders. Flexibility The 24-hour nature of Forex allows traders to execute trades at any time, accommodating different schedules. Challenges in Forex Capital Markets While Forex offers numerous opportunities, traders should be aware of the challenges: Volatility Sudden price swings can lead to significant losses, especially for leveraged trades. Complexity Understanding the myriad factors affecting currency prices requires knowledge and experience. Leverage Risks While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases the potential for losses. Market Scams New traders must ensure they choose regulated brokers to avoid fraudulent schemes. Strategies for Success in Forex Capital Markets To succeed in Forex trading, consider these strategies: Learn the Basics Gain a strong understanding of Forex concepts, including currency pairs, leverage, and technical indicators. Risk Management Use tools like stop-loss orders and position sizing to limit potential losses. Stay Informed Keep track of economic events and news that could impact currency values. Diversify Trades Avoid overexposure to a single currency pair by diversifying your trading portfolio. Practice with a Demo Account Test strategies in a risk-free environment before trading with real money. Forex Capital Markets vs. Stock Markets Aspect Forex Capital Markets Stock Markets Market Size $6.6 trillion daily ~$200 billion daily Trading Hours 24/5 Limited to exchange hours Leverage High (up to 500:1) Lower (typically 2:1 to 5:1) Instruments Currency pairs Shares of companies Volatility High Moderate Top Platforms for Forex Capital Markets MetaTrader 4/5 (MT4/MT5) Advanced charting tools and automated trading. TradingView User-friendly platform with social trading features. cTrader Ideal for scalpers and algorithmic traders. Conclusion Forex capital markets offer unparalleled opportunities for traders and investors, with high liquidity, global accessibility, and diverse trading instruments. While the market’s decentralized and fast-paced nature can be intimidating, understanding its dynamics and adopting disciplined strategies can lead to success. Whether you’re a novice or an experienced trader, Forex capital markets provide a gateway to the world of global finance.

What sets them apart is the courage they have shown in taking the risk of entering a budding sector struggling due to numerous challenges, including extreme volatility and regulatory uncertainty. But who stands at the top? Crypto Market Boom in 2024 2024 has been a remarkable year for the cryptocurrency market, with a staggering 99.4% growth since the start of the year. This growth comes as the political environment in the U.S. becomes more favorable toward the industry, and Bitcoin reaches the $100K milestone. Experts predict even more growth in the coming years. With this progress, many crypto entrepreneurs have seen their wealth grow substantially. Naturally, the question arises: Who are the key crypto billionaires in 2024? Changpeng Zhao Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, is the richest crypto billionaire, with a net worth of $65.4B. Zhao’s journey into the crypto world began after gaining experience at companies like Bloomberg and Blockchain.com. He founded Binance in 2017, which quickly became one of the largest crypto exchanges globally. Despite facing legal issues this year, including a four-month prison sentence and a $50 million fine for violating U.S. banking laws, Zhao was released in September and remains a dominant figure in the industry. Brian Armstrong With a net worth of $12.1B, Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of popular crypto exchange Coinbase, stays in the second position on the list. In the early stage of his career, he was a software engineer. He worked for several tech giants, including IBM and Airbnb. His destiny changed when he co-founded Coinbase in 2012. In mid-2021, his company was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. With a trading volume of $2,236,072,410, Coinbase remains the most prominent crypto exchange in the United States. Giancarlo Devasini Giancarlo Devasini, co-founder of Bitfinex and Tether, is third on the list, with a net worth of over $9.2B. Devasini’s wealth is largely tied to his stakes in Tether (the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap) and Bitfinex, a leading exchange. He reportedly owns more than 47% of Tether, which plays a significant role in his substantial fortune. Michael Saylor Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, ranks fourth with a net worth of $9B. Saylor is well-known for his aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has paid off as Bitcoin’s value soared in 2024. MicroStrategy currently holds over 444,000 BTC, making it the largest public holder of Bitcoin. Saylor’s 9.9% stake in the company also continues to grow in value alongside the rise of Bitcoin. Chris Larsen Chris Larsen, co-founder of Ripple Labs, is in fifth place with a net worth of $8B. Ripple’s XRP token, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, $128,422,395,294, has been central to Larsen’s wealth. Ripple remains a leader in blockchain-based payment solutions, and the success of XRP contributes significantly to Larsen’s fortune. Fred Ehrsam With a net worth of $3.4B, Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Ethereum, is in the sixth position on the list. The real crypto journey of Ehrsam, who started his career as a trader in Goldman Sachs’s foreign exchange division, commenced when he co-founded Coinbase in 2012. In 2017, he left the Coinbase team to start a crypto venture capital firm, Paradigm. Reports suggest that the venture capital firm has more than $8 billion in AUM in projects such as Uniswap and Flashbots. Barry Silbert Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group, takes the seventh spot with a net worth of $3.2B. Silbert, a former investment banker, played a key role in Bitcoin’s early adoption through his investment vehicle BIT. His company, Digital Currency Group, has become a major player in the crypto investment space. Jed McCaleb Jed McCaleb, a key figure behind Mt. Gox, Ripple, and Stellar, ranks eighth with a net worth of $2.9B. McCaleb was involved in Mt. Gox, the first major Bitcoin exchange, before moving to Ripple as a co-founder. After leaving Ripple in 2014, he created Stellar, a competitor to Ripple. The sale of his original 9 billion XRP tokens has helped boost his wealth. Winklevoss Twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the well-known twins behind Gemini, have a net worth of $2.7B and sit in ninth place. The twins gained fame in 2009 for their lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, claiming he stole their idea for Facebook. They received a $65 million settlement, which they invested in Bitcoin. Later, they founded the Gemini exchange, which has helped grow their fortune. Devin Finzer Devin Finzer, co-founder of OpenSea, holds the tenth position with a net worth of $2.2B. Finzer entered the crypto world in 2017 when he launched OpenSea, an NFT marketplace that saw massive growth in 2021. The success of OpenSea has allowed Finzer to join the ranks of the top crypto billionaires. The Future of Crypto Billionaires With the crypto industry poised for even greater growth in the coming years, we may see more billionaires rise through innovative ventures and investments. Names like Alex Atallah, Kim Hyoung-Nyon, Nikil Viswanathan, and Joe Lau are currently making waves and could soon join the list of top crypto billionaires.

38136366,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633404,1735209379,China’s economic outlooks looks very confusing heading into 2025,"China’s economic forecast heading into 2025 is like staring at a chaotic spreadsheet riddled with contradictions. The World Bank has boosted its expectations for the country’s GDP growth next year, bumping it up by 0.4 percentage points to 4.5%. That sounds nice on paper. But look closer, and it’s clear that optimism hangs by a thread. The promises out of Beijing are big, but the results? Well, they’re not exactly living up to the hype. For 2024, the World Bank increased its GDP forecast to 4.9%, just a hair below China’s official target of 5%. Not bad, considering the economy grew 4.8% in the first nine months of the year. Yet the underlying issues—weak domestic demand, deflationary pressure, and a bruised property market—are a brutal reality check. Beijing’s economic team, led by President Xi Jinping, has announced reforms and fiscal adjustments, but critics argue it’s all talk and not enough action. Weak demand, big promises, and even bigger questions China’s economic struggles are rooted in a three-year property market collapse that gutted household wealth and left domestic demand limping. Xi’s pivot to high-tech manufacturing and industry hasn’t done much to inspire confidence either. Exports, the crutch keeping things steady, could face a major hit as Donald Trump prepares to take office again. His return threatens to slap China with tariffs as high as 60%, which would blow a $570 billion-sized hole in bilateral trade. The World Bank warns that traditional stimulus isn’t enough to pull China out of this funk. Deeper reforms are needed in everything from healthcare to education to the pensions system. Oh, and there’s the hukou registration system, a bureaucratic nightmare that has long been a barrier to economic mobility. According to the World Bank, “conventional measures will not be sufficient” to reignite growth. Translation: it’s time for Beijing to stop with the quick fixes and get serious. And then there’s the middle class — or what’s left of it. A recent World Bank study on economic mobility from 2010 to 2021 painted a grim picture: over half a billion people risk falling out of the middle class. The report credits China with lifting 800 million people out of poverty in the last 40 years, a monumental achievement. But today, 38.2% of the population is stuck in a vulnerable “middle class,” teetering on the edge of slipping back into poverty. These are people earning above $6.85 a day (using 2017 purchasing power parity), but not enough to feel secure. The breakdown is sobering: 17% of China’s 1.4 billion people remain in poverty, while 32.1% are considered “secure middle class.” That leaves the majority still financially unstable. Geopolitics: Trump, tariffs, and a whole lot of tension If the domestic problems weren’t enough, Xi Jinping has a geopolitical storm brewing. Trump’s return to the White House is the nightmare scenario Beijing didn’t want. The US president has made it clear he plans to crank up the heat on Chinese goods and tighten export controls on advanced tech like semiconductors, AI, and quantum computing. The last time Trump wielded his tariff stick, China’s economy was in better shape. Now, with excessive debt, deflation, and a real estate mess, the country is far more vulnerable. And it’s not just trade wars. US hawks are pushing for a tougher stance on Taiwan and the South China Sea, raising fears of a standoff that could rival the Cuban Missile Crisis. There’s also the issue of Beijing’s regional relationships. Over the years, China’s aggressive behavior in disputed waters and its economic coercion have pushed neighboring countries closer to the US. Trump’s “America First” policies, including potential tariffs on East Asian allies, might give Beijing an opening to rebuild some bridges. But that requires compromise—something Xi hasn’t shown much interest in. Russia, Ukraine, and the wild card: A US-Russia reset The war in Ukraine complicates things some more. Europe’s frustration with Beijing’s perceived support for Russia has strained relations, and Trump’s call for China to play a role in ending the conflict adds another layer of complexity. Xi is stuck between a rock and a hard place: pressure Vladimir Putin to cut a deal, and risk their “no-limits best friendship,” or further alienate Europe. And then there’s the wildcard nobody saw coming—a potential US-Russia rapprochement. The idea of Trump cozying up to Moscow isn’t far-fetched, and it could spell disaster for Beijing. Such a shift would weaken Xi’s friendship with Putin while freeing up US resources to double down on its rivalry with China.

However, the scene changed after Trump’s win. Since then, the crypto industry has grown to a $1 trillion valuation. But the story doesn’t end there. The 2024 U.S. elections have set off a chain reaction, bringing unexpected financial gains for some of crypto’s biggest leaders and firms. So, what does this mean for the future of crypto? Keep reading to find out Major Crypto Leaders See Record Wealth Increases According to a Coindesk report , prominent figures like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) founders Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz have seen their wealth hit new highs after the elections.

Major investors like MicroStrategy hold $44 billion worth of Bitcoin, while Elon Musk spent $200 million supporting Trump’s campaign. Since Election Day, Musk’s net worth has risen by $70 billion, giving him a jaw-dropping 34,900% return on his investment. As 2024 comes to a close, the crypto market is looking strong, with many hoping that 2025 will bring even more changes and opportunities for the industry.

His company’s market value surged by $21 billion, and Armstrong’s personal stake in Coinbase increased by nearly $2 billion, now valued at $6.4 billion. His stock sales following the elections earned him $129 million.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Benefits from XRP Surge Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also seen substantial gains. XRP’s price jumped from $0.50 to $2.32 after the elections, boosting Ripple’s market cap and pushing XRP to third place among digital assets.

Garlinghouse’s wealth has soared, with his XRP holdings now worth three times as much as before. His stake in Ripple, estimated at over 6%, plus his undisclosed XRP assets, places him among the wealthiest U.S. billionaires. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Advocate Michael Saylor Says He Was Wrong About Ethereum, Here’s Why , Andreessen Horowitz Reaps Rewards Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, co-founders of Andreessen Horowitz, also saw significant returns from their investments in crypto companies.

As the only ecological token for the Bitget exchange and Bitget Wallet , Bitget has announced that it will combine its wallet with Bitget token. This announcement comes after the Bitget token’s rapid expansion ( BGB ), which was fueled by its rising market value and the number of holders. As of the latest data, BGB’s market cap has reached over $9.32 billion, and its price has shown a steady upward trend, reflecting growing investor confidence as the token’s price reaches an all-time high of $6.82. The trading volume for BGB is around $1.32 billion, which is a 271% rise over the past 24 hours, showcasing its liquidity and strong market activity. BGB token price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitget aims to support continued ecosystem growth by broadening BGB’s use cases, empowering launch pool initiatives, and increasing its presence across both on-chain and off-chain platforms.

38135707,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114344,1735208214,Pantera Capital CEO Predicts Bitcoin Bull Cycle to Peak by August 2025,"Pantera Capital CEO Predicts Bitcoin Bull Cycle to Peak by August 2025 Dan Morehead, the CEO of Pantera Capital, has made a compelling prediction about the trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. During a recent appearance on the Bankless podcast, Morehead shared that he expects the next significant Bitcoin bull cycle to peak by August 2025. His prediction hinges on the cryptocurrency’s historic four-year halving cycle, which has consistently triggered substantial price rallies in the past. The Role of Bitcoin’s Halving Cycle in Market Trends Bitcoin’s halving event, which occurs approximately every four years, is a pivotal factor in determining the market’s price dynamics. By reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined, the event creates scarcity, historically leading to increased demand and subsequent price surges. Morehead believes that this fundamental mechanism will once again act as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s next bull cycle. “The halving cycles have consistently aligned with significant price movements in Bitcoin, and I expect the same pattern to unfold,” Morehead stated during the podcast. Current Market Conditions and Future Outlook Despite market conditions being less volatile than during previous cycles, Morehead expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s potential growth. He emphasized that the cryptocurrency market has matured, attracting institutional investors and gaining mainstream recognition. Key factors supporting his prediction include: Political Landscape : Growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by governments and regulatory frameworks designed to foster innovation. Macroeconomic Trends : Global economic uncertainties are driving interest in decentralized and inflation-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Morehead’s insights suggest that these factors will sustain and accelerate Bitcoin’s growth trajectory in the coming years. Comparing Previous Bitcoin Bull Cycles 2017 Bull Cycle The 2017 bull cycle saw Bitcoin prices soar to nearly $20,000, driven largely by retail investors and initial coin offerings (ICOs). This cycle was marked by extreme volatility and a subsequent crash. 2021 Bull Cycle The 2021 bull cycle brought Bitcoin to an all-time high of $69,000. Institutional adoption played a significant role, with companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy investing in Bitcoin. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) also contributed to market enthusiasm. 2025 Prediction Morehead’s forecast for 2025 aligns with the timeline of Bitcoin’s next halving in 2024. With a more mature market and increasing adoption, the 2025 cycle is expected to reflect a blend of sustained growth and reduced volatility. Favorable Macro and Political Factors for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s growth is no longer solely reliant on technological innovation or market sentiment. Macroeconomic and political developments are now playing a crucial role: Global Economic Uncertainty : Rising inflation and currency devaluation in some regions are driving investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. Government Adoption : Nations like El Salvador have embraced Bitcoin as legal tender, setting a precedent for broader adoption. Institutional Investment : Major financial institutions are offering Bitcoin-related products, increasing accessibility for retail and institutional investors. These factors collectively create a robust foundation for Bitcoin’s continued expansion. Dan Morehead’s Track Record in Cryptocurrency As the CEO of Pantera Capital, one of the first investment firms focused exclusively on cryptocurrencies and blockchain, Dan Morehead has a track record of accurate market predictions. His insights are informed by years of experience in analyzing market trends and identifying growth opportunities within the crypto sector. What the Community is Saying The cryptocurrency community has responded to Morehead’s prediction with cautious optimism. Many agree that the halving cycle is a reliable indicator of Bitcoin’s price trajectory. However, skeptics argue that external factors, such as regulatory crackdowns or unexpected economic shifts, could disrupt the anticipated pattern. Social media platforms are abuzz with discussions about the potential for Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs in 2025. Key Takeaways for Investors For investors looking to capitalize on the predicted Bitcoin bull cycle: Timing Matters : Historical data suggests that Bitcoin’s price momentum typically builds up several months after a halving event. Diversify Investments : While Bitcoin may lead the bull cycle, other cryptocurrencies could also see significant growth. Stay Informed : Keeping up with macroeconomic trends and regulatory developments will be crucial for making informed decisions. Conclusion Dan Morehead’s prediction of the Bitcoin bull cycle peaking by August 2025 provides valuable insight for investors and enthusiasts alike. Grounded in the cryptocurrency’s halving cycle and supported by favorable macroeconomic and political factors, this forecast paints an optimistic picture for the future of Bitcoin. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Morehead’s vision underscores the importance of understanding key trends and adapting investment strategies accordingly.

Binance Coin’s role in powering the largest crypto ecosystem remains unmatched, while Toncoin’s potential to surge beyond $10 in 2025 has caught investors’ attention. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) continues to shine, with its presale hitting a remarkable milestone of 376 million tokens sold, raising $7.8 million. Could these three be the best cryptos to buy in December 2024? What sets Qubetics apart is its ability to tackle real-world adoption challenges in cryptocurrency. Its revolutionary wallet integrates seamlessly with Apple Pay and Google Pay, eliminating the complexities often associated with crypto transactions. Let’s take a closer look at why Qubetics, Binance Coin, and Toncoin are grabbing headlines and investor confidence. Qubetics ($TICS): Making Crypto Simple and Secure Qubetics isn’t just a presale success—it’s a solution to many of crypto’s biggest hurdles. Picture this: you’re a freelancer working with global clients. Getting paid in Bitcoin or Ethereum sounds great until market volatility eats into your income. Qubetics solves this with its smart contract conversion mechanism , which automatically converts crypto into fiat at the point of sale. The Qubetics Wallet integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making crypto transactions as easy as paying for coffee at Starbucks. And for those running international businesses, its cross-border payment feature is a game-changer, cutting fees and transaction times compared to traditional payment methods. This innovation is backed by Qubetics’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain, which introduces cross-chain functionality for lightning-fast, secure transactions across multiple blockchains. With advanced encryption, the wallet offers a seamless experience for both beginners and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. As of now, Qubetics has raised $7.8 million in its presale, selling over 376 million tokens in Stage 14. Tokens are priced at $0.0377, but they’re set to increase by 10% in Stage 15 this weekend. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Qubetics is a standout. Binance Coin (BNB): The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin is much more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s the lifeblood of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Whether it’s used for trading fee discounts, staking, or powering the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB’s utility makes it an invaluable asset for millions of users. Recent market activity has shown BNB climbing steadily in value. With Binance continuing to expand its ecosystem—think DeFi platforms, gaming projects, and NFT marketplaces—the demand for BNB remains strong. Regular token burns further enhance its value by reducing supply, creating scarcity that drives prices higher. For investors seeking stability and growth, BNB is a no-brainer. Its proven track record and ongoing innovation make it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned trader. Toncoin (TON): The Telegram-Backed Powerhouse Toncoin has been quietly making waves in the crypto world, trading at $5.48 as of December 2024. As the native token of The Open Network, Toncoin boasts a unique advantage with its ties to Telegram, one of the world’s largest messaging platforms. This integration paves the way for mass adoption, as Telegram users can easily access TON’s ecosystem. Toncoin’s architecture is built for speed and scalability, making it an ideal choice for gaming, decentralized applications (dApps), and DeFi solutions. Analysts are bullish on its future, predicting that TON could surpass $10 in 2025 due to its strong technological foundation and expanding use cases. Despite some market corrections, Toncoin’s potential for bridging Web3 applications with real-world use cases keeps it in the spotlight. If you’re looking for a promising crypto with room to grow, Toncoin is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Three Cryptos, Infinite Potential Qubetics, Binance Coin, and Toncoin each bring something unique to the table. From Qubetics’ groundbreaking wallet innovation to Binance Coin’s ecosystem dominance and Toncoin’s scalability, these projects are shaping the future of blockchain technology. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Binance Coin (BNB), and Toncoin (TON) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Don’t wait—these opportunities won’t last forever!

38135637,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114346,1735208129,Analysis: Crypto OTC Trading Volume Surges Following U.S. Presidential Election,"Analysis: Crypto OTC Trading Volume Surges Following U.S. Presidential Election Crypto over-the-counter (OTC) trading volumes have experienced a dramatic surge in recent months, with the U.S. presidential election serving as a key catalyst. According to reports from industry insiders and major firms, this upward trend has been driven by institutional activity, increasing investor confidence, and renewed interest in managing crypto treasuries. Understanding Crypto OTC Trading Volume OTC trading refers to transactions conducted outside of standard cryptocurrency exchanges, often involving large sums traded directly between parties or through brokers. This method is favored by institutions and high-net-worth individuals to minimize market impact and maintain privacy. The surge in OTC trading activity following the U.S. election highlights a broader trend of institutional adoption and market maturity in the cryptocurrency space. A 220% Year-Over-Year Increase in Trading Activity Tim Ogilvie, head of institutional at Kraken, shared remarkable data reflecting a 220% year-over-year increase in OTC trading volumes. He noted that the election outcome acted as a pivotal moment for many investors. “The interest in OTC trading has been building steadily, but the election provided the momentum needed for many to finally enter the market,” Ogilvie explained. Other leading firms reported similar growth, with many attributing the surge to macroeconomic factors, increased institutional interest, and the broader cryptocurrency market rally. Market Insights from Key Players Jake Ostrovskis, Wintermute Jake Ostrovskis, an OTC trader at Wintermute, noted that the market remained relatively quiet in early 2024. However, as the election approached, prices began rising, prompting renewed activity. “Clients who had been in discussions for years saw the election as the signal to begin trading,” Ostrovskis stated, underscoring the growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrency. Embert Lin, GSR Embert Lin, a trader at GSR, highlighted the broader implications of the post-election rally. He noted that the surge in Bitcoin, Ether, and altcoin prices has motivated projects and investors to become more proactive in managing treasuries and mitigating risks. Factors Driving the Surge in OTC Trading Volume Several factors have contributed to the significant rise in crypto OTC trading volumes, including: U.S. Presidential Election : The election acted as a catalyst, instilling confidence in investors and marking a pivotal point for market activity. Market Maturity : Institutions are exploring opportunities beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, reflecting a more sophisticated approach to cryptocurrency investments. Price Rally : The rally in Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies has driven interest in actively managing crypto holdings. Institutional Adoption : High-profile entries into the crypto space have created a ripple effect, encouraging more institutions to participate. Institutional Interest Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant, many institutions are diversifying their portfolios to include a wider range of assets. This trend highlights the evolution of the cryptocurrency market from being Bitcoin-centric to encompassing a broader ecosystem. Tim Ogilvie noted that institutions are particularly drawn to OTC trading for its flexibility, allowing them to customize trades and explore unique opportunities without impacting the broader market. Impact on Crypto Treasury Management The rise in OTC trading has also spurred changes in how projects and companies manage their crypto treasuries. The rally in crypto prices has encouraged businesses to explore innovative strategies for risk management and growth. For instance: Projects are using OTC trading to rebalance their portfolios. Institutions are leveraging OTC platforms to gain strategic exposure to altcoins and DeFi projects. Companies are adopting dynamic treasury management to capitalize on market trends. A Broader Trend of Crypto Market Maturity The post-election surge in OTC trading volumes underscores the ongoing maturation of the cryptocurrency market. No longer dominated by speculative retail traders, the market is now shaped by institutional players, sophisticated strategies, and long-term investments. Embert Lin emphasized that this shift is indicative of a more stable and robust ecosystem, which bodes well for the future of cryptocurrencies. Key Takeaways for Investors For investors looking to navigate the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency trading: Monitor Market Trends : Events like elections and economic shifts can significantly influence trading activity. Consider OTC Options : OTC trading provides a discreet and efficient way to execute large trades without impacting the market. Diversify Portfolios : Exploring assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum can offer unique opportunities for growth. Conclusion The surge in crypto OTC trading volumes following the U.S. presidential election highlights the growing maturity and institutionalization of the cryptocurrency market. With a 220% year-over-year increase reported by Kraken and similar trends observed across the industry, it is clear that the election acted as a pivotal moment for investors and institutions alike. This trend reflects broader shifts in the market, including increased interest in treasury management, diversification beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, and proactive risk mitigation strategies.

It also appears that the analyst believes XRP has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern in the same time frame. An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is considered a bullish signal in technical analysis. “Still the most bullish-looking chart in the entire space off the lows in my opinion. Just a powder keg building pressure…” Source: CredibleCrypto/X XRP is trading at 0.00002323 BTC ($2.28) at time of writing. Next up is Ethereum ( ETH ). CredibleCrypto says that ETH is likely to trade in a range of between $3,000 and $3,800 before bottoming out at around $2,800. Based on the pseudonymous analyst’s chart on the 12-hour time frame, he suggests Ethereum could then rally to a new all-time high above $6,000. Source: CredibleCrypto/X Ethereum is trading at $3,492 at time of writing. Turning to the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair, the widely followed analyst says he is still targeting Ethereum to drop to around the 0.02700 BTC to 0.02800 BTC level before he can enter a long position. According to CredibleCrypto, ETH/BTC is now “grinding back down” after initially rallying. “Would be an absolutely epic entry if we get it that will probably mark this cycles pico bottom on ETH/BTC as well.” Source: CredibleCrypto/X ETH is trading at 0.03542 BTC at time of writing.

38135592,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114350,1735207987,"ETH Could Break $4,000 Before Trump’s Inauguration, Analysts Predict","ETH Could Break $4,000 Before Trump’s Inauguration, Analysts Predict Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing strong bullish momentum heading into the new year. According to multiple experts cited by Cointelegraph, ETH is poised to break the $4,000 mark before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. This prediction comes amidst growing market optimism, technical signals, and broader cryptocurrency trends. Ethereum’s Momentum: From Resistance to Support Crypto analyst Satoshi Flipper highlighted Ethereum’s recent price action in a December 25 post on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing its attempt to flip the $3,500 resistance level into support. This key technical milestone, if achieved, could pave the way for further price gains. “ETH is gaining momentum. Flipping $3,500 from resistance to support is the next step toward breaking $4,000,” Satoshi Flipper wrote. Institutional Optimism on Ethereum’s Prospects A Bybit spokesperson echoed this sentiment in a statement to Cointelegraph, predicting that ETH could rally above $4,000 by mid-January. They attributed this outlook to several factors: Positive Market Sentiment : Renewed investor interest in cryptocurrencies ahead of significant political events. Improved Network Activity : Ethereum’s increasing usage in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems. Technological Upgrades : The Ethereum network’s continued advancements, including scalability improvements following the Merge. Post-Holiday Rally Could Drive ETH Higher Another analyst, Lucky, noted that Ethereum’s bullish potential extends beyond the immediate future. In a separate X post, Lucky suggested that ETH could surpass $5,000 during the 2025 market cycle. “After the holidays, we may see increased activity and investment in ETH, pushing its price to new heights,” Lucky predicted. This optimism aligns with broader expectations of a cryptocurrency market rally fueled by macroeconomic factors and renewed retail and institutional interest. Key Drivers Behind Ethereum’s Bullish Outlook 1. Strong Technical Indicators Ethereum’s price chart shows a series of higher lows, signaling upward momentum. The $3,500 resistance level is a critical barrier, and breaking it could lead to rapid price appreciation. 2. Growing Institutional Interest With major players entering the crypto space, Ethereum has seen a surge in adoption for applications beyond trading, including DeFi and enterprise solutions. 3. Market Sentiment The anticipation of Trump’s inauguration and potential policy implications for the economy are driving investors toward alternative assets like Ethereum. 4. Ethereum’s Utility The network’s dominance in DeFi and NFT markets continues to position it as a critical infrastructure for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. ETH vs. Bitcoin: A Tale of Two Leaders While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, Ethereum’s price movements frequently outpace Bitcoin during bullish market cycles. This dynamic stems from Ethereum’s broader use cases, including smart contracts, decentralized applications, and tokenization. Satoshi Flipper pointed out that ETH tends to perform exceptionally well during periods of market euphoria, often exceeding Bitcoin’s percentage gains. Potential Risks to Ethereum’s Price Rally Despite the optimism, several factors could hinder ETH’s ability to surpass $4,000: Regulatory Uncertainty : Potential crackdowns on cryptocurrencies could dampen investor confidence. Market Volatility : Sudden price corrections are common in crypto markets, particularly during periods of rapid growth. Global Economic Factors : Macro events, such as interest rate decisions or geopolitical instability, could influence risk-on assets like Ethereum. Investors are advised to remain cautious and consider these risks while navigating the market. What This Means for Investors For investors eyeing Ethereum’s potential rally: Monitor Key Levels : Keep an eye on the $3,500 resistance and $4,000 psychological barrier. Diversify Investments : While Ethereum shows promise, a diversified portfolio helps mitigate risks. Stay Updated on Market Trends : Follow news about Ethereum’s network upgrades and macroeconomic developments. Conclusion Ethereum’s bullish momentum heading into 2025 has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. With predictions of breaking $4,000 before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration and potential long-term growth exceeding $5,000, ETH remains a focal point in the cryptocurrency market. The combination of strong technical indicators, growing institutional interest, and Ethereum’s unparalleled utility positions it as a key asset in the evolving crypto landscape. However, potential risks underline the importance of cautious optimism and strategic investment.

38135715,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633408,1735207937,"Which predictions were fulfilled in 2024: Bitcoin (BTC) rallied as expected, the NFT market did not come back","The past year brought a shift in the crypto market, extending the recovery from the stagnant period of 2022-2023. Bitcoin (BTC) remained the leading narrative, fulfilling even the more optimistic price predictions. The crypto market fulfilled most of the bullish expectations for 2024 , though some narratives failed to deliver. Bitcoin (BTC) fulfilled the prediction by Bitwise that it would trade above $80,000, while setting new all-time highs. Bitwise renewed its bullish stance for 2025, expecting a BTC rally to $200,000, with new all-time highs for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). The effects of BTC were felt by the whole market, fulfilling the prediction that ETH still had no chance of becoming the #1 asset. The price of BTC and the US elections fulfilled the promise of driving $100M into prediction markets. VanEck started out overly-optimistic about NFTs. While several collections were still exchanging hands, the NFT market did not return to the levels of 2021. Instead, Miladies adapted to the meme token market, while Pudgy Penguins came to prominence after issuing the Pengu (PENGU) token on Solana. VanEck also failed in its prediction that Binance would lose its position as the top centralized exchange. The trading hub in fact became a staple for the 2024 bull market for both BTC and altcoins. Over the past year, Binance increased its registered user count to over 240M , increasing both its visits and trading volumes. The past year did not have the expected prolonged altcoin market, but brought some diversity to the DeFi space , as new chains onboarded stablecoins and saw inflows of liquidity. BTC fulfilled the more measured predictions this year BTC managed to trade above $108,000 after a rally in November and December. Several factors worked to bring the price to that range, including the all-time high supply of stablecoins. The stablecoin market was another successful prediction by VanEck, as the supply of tokens is close to 200B. Bitwise expects the trend to continue, doubling the supply to 400B for all stablecoins. Predictions by prominent thought and business leaders ranged from $70,000 at the end of 2024 to out of the ballpark prognoses of $1M per BTC by Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest. Adam Back is the closest to the real BTC price, with a $100K prediction. Arthur Hayes did not miss his shot with the $70,000 price prediction, though he underestimated the late 2024 rally. Investment influencer Robert Kiyosaki shifted his prediction down to $100K, also hitting the mark. A set of more optimistic predictions suggested BTC may range as high as $125,000 to $150,000. Those predictions were set out by JP Morgan, Pantera Capital, and Standard Chartered. Tim Drapper set out a prediction of $250,000, while Tom Lee stopped short at $180,000. Although inaccurate, those predictions served to boost the overall optimism. While the predictions were not fulfilled, BTC also spent the year with no catastrophic drawdowns. The deepest losses were capped at 32%, and BTC resumed its rallies soon after each crash. The past year also had a halving event, usually expected to push the price to a new range. The overly-optimistic predictions also coincided with high levels of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which spent the larger part of the year in the greed territory. VanEck optimistic on DeFi and BTC L2s in 2025 VanEck was optimistic about DeFi as a whole, expecting the total value locked to exceed $200B. Bitcoin’s DeFi space and L2s are also expected to grow, locking up to 100K BTC. In late 2024, that milestone is still in its early stages, with Babylon Labs locking in upward of 23,000 BTC. Unfazed by its failed NFTs prediction, VanEck made another prognosis for 2025, expecting speculative hype and cultural relevance to return to NFTs. The fund also expects dApp tokens to outperform L1 and L2 tokens, based on real economic activity and fee generation. Bitwise added predictions that suggest the BTC bull market will lead to smaller booms and new trends. The fund expects institutional adoption to increase and to lead to crypto IPOs, where crypto companies return to mainstream fundraising. The other big trend will be AI agents , which will bring further integration between social media AI bots, SocialFi and Web3 apps.

38136562,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53165,1735207933,BitBoy Says XRP Is Poised to Flip Bitcoin Dominance Growth,"Market analyst Ben Armstrong, widely recognized as BitBoy, has suggested that XRP might outpace Bitcoin in dominance growth during the ongoing bull market. While he does not foresee XRP surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization anytime soon, Armstrong expressed confidence that XRP would deliver better returns for investors in this cycle. XRP vs. Ethereum: Competing for Second Place Armstrong discussed the rivalry between XRP and Ethereum for the second position in the market. Although Ethereum has held this spot for several years, XRP briefly overtook it in 2018. Armstrong speculates that XRP could reclaim this position as the bull market progresses, highlighting its increasing prominence in global finance. He noted that XRP is gaining recognition from both BRICS nations and Western institutions, including organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On the other hand, Ethereum continues to appeal to institutional investors and enterprises due to its stability and role in decentralized finance (DeFi). However, Armstrong pointed out that Ethereum’s slower transaction speeds might deter some retail investors, who could favor faster blockchains such as Solana. Despite this, he believes Ethereum will maintain its standing among institutions that prioritize reliability over speed. Will XRP Overtake Ethereum? Armstrong believes that XRP could surpass Ethereum’s market capitalization during this cycle, though he acknowledges that the outcome is uncertain. For this to happen, XRP’s market value would need to climb significantly. At present, Ethereum’s market cap is over $410 billion, roughly four times greater than XRP’s $130 billion. According to Armstrong, XRP’s price would need to exceed $7 to match Ethereum’s current market cap. He has even predicted that XRP could reach $22 this season , taking its market cap to $1.26 trillion. This projection underpins his optimism about XRP surpassing Ethereum later in the future. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Impact on Bitcoin Dominance Although Armstrong does not expect XRP to rival Bitcoin’s market cap in the foreseeable future, he anticipates that XRP will continue to chip away at Bitcoin’s market dominance. He noted that XRP’s impressive rally in November caused a noticeable drop in Bitcoin’s dominance. A tweet from CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju revealed that Bitcoin dominance fell by 6% during this period, with XRP contributing 3% to the decline. Between November 3 and December 3, XRP’s price surged by over 450%, pushing its market cap from $28 billion to $154.83 billion. This temporary surge caused Bitcoin’s dominance to dip to 52% before recovering to around 60%. Armstrong predicts a similar dynamic could unfold through 2025, with XRP continuing to impact Bitcoin dominance during market upswings.

38135426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114360,1735207729,Russian Firms Embrace Cryptocurrency for International Trade Amid Sanctions,"Russian Firms Embrace Cryptocurrency for International Trade Amid Sanctions Russian businesses are increasingly using cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, for international payments in response to Western sanctions. Recent changes in legislation have enabled this shift, offering companies an alternative to traditional payment systems that are hindered by geopolitical restrictions. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed the development, emphasizing its role in countering economic pressures. This strategic move underscores Russia’s efforts to adopt alternative financial mechanisms, with the potential to reshape global trade dynamics. Why Russian Firms Are Turning to Cryptocurrency Western sanctions have limited Russia’s access to traditional international banking systems, including the SWIFT network. This has forced businesses to explore decentralized financial systems like cryptocurrency, which are not subject to the same geopolitical constraints. Key reasons for the shift include: Circumventing Sanctions Cryptocurrencies operate independently of traditional banking systems, allowing Russian firms to engage in international trade without relying on sanctioned financial intermediaries. Increased Government Support Recent laws in Russia now allow the use of cryptocurrencies mined within the country for foreign trade transactions, providing a legal framework for adoption. Decentralized Nature of Crypto Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a decentralized payment mechanism, reducing reliance on centralized systems influenced by Western policies. Finance Minister’s Confirmation In an interview with the Russia 24 television channel, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov highlighted the growing role of cryptocurrency in Russia’s international trade strategy. “Cryptocurrencies mined in Russia are being used for foreign trade transactions, and we expect this approach to expand next year,” Siluanov stated. The minister’s comments reflect the government’s endorsement of crypto adoption as a key tool for mitigating economic isolation. Putin’s Critique of the Dollar’s Dominance Russian President Vladimir Putin has long criticized the politicization of the U.S. dollar in global trade. Earlier this month, he reiterated these concerns, stating that the U.S. is undermining the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency by using it as a tool for political leverage. Putin’s remarks highlight a growing trend among nations to seek alternatives to the dollar, with cryptocurrencies emerging as a viable option. Cryptocurrency Mining and Usage in Russia Russia is one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency mining hubs, thanks to its abundant energy resources and cold climate, which reduce mining costs. By leveraging domestically mined cryptocurrencies for international trade, Russia is effectively monetizing its mining capabilities while bypassing traditional financial barriers. Implications for Global Trade Russia’s adoption of cryptocurrency for international trade could have significant implications: Increased Crypto Adoption : Other sanctioned nations may follow Russia’s lead, accelerating global cryptocurrency adoption. Shift in Global Reserve Assets : The move away from the U.S. dollar could prompt broader diversification in global trade payments. Regulatory Challenges : Western nations may introduce new regulations to counteract the use of cryptocurrencies for sanction evasion. Potential Benefits and Risks for Russia Benefits : Resilience Against Sanctions : Cryptocurrencies provide an alternative payment system unaffected by Western financial controls. Economic Efficiency : Faster and cheaper cross-border transactions reduce trade friction. Financial Independence : Reduces reliance on traditional currencies and systems. Risks : Volatility : Cryptocurrencies are known for price fluctuations, which could impact trade values. Regulatory Backlash : Increased scrutiny from international regulators could create challenges. Security Concerns : Dependence on digital assets exposes trade transactions to potential cyber threats. Global Response to Russia’s Crypto Adoption The international community is closely monitoring Russia’s growing reliance on cryptocurrency. While some nations see it as a workaround to sanctions, others view it as a legitimate use of decentralized finance. Sanctioning Entities : Western nations may consider stricter regulations or targeted measures to curtail Russia’s use of cryptocurrencies. Neutral Parties : Countries not involved in sanctions may see this as an opportunity to strengthen trade ties with Russia through crypto-based systems. Crypto Advocates : Proponents of decentralized finance view this as a validation of cryptocurrency’s potential to enable financial inclusion. What This Means for the Crypto Market Russia’s shift toward cryptocurrency could have far-reaching effects on the global crypto market: Increased Demand for Bitcoin : As one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin could see heightened demand. Mainstream Legitimacy : The use of crypto for international trade could boost its reputation as a viable alternative to traditional systems. Regulatory Evolution : Governments may need to update regulations to address the growing use of crypto in international trade. Conclusion Russia’s adoption of cryptocurrency for international trade marks a significant milestone in the global financial landscape. By leveraging Bitcoin and other digital assets, the country is navigating around Western sanctions and exploring a new frontier in decentralized trade systems. While this approach offers numerous benefits, it also raises questions about global trade dynamics, regulatory responses, and the future role of cryptocurrencies in the international economy. As Russia continues to expand its use of cryptocurrency in 2025, the world will be watching closely to understand the broader implications for finance, trade, and geopolitics.

38135374,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114371,1735207582,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 79, Enters ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone","Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 79, Enters ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key indicator of market sentiment, has surged to 79 as of December 26, marking a six-point increase from the previous day. Provided by the analytics platform Alternative, the index has shifted from the “Greed” zone into the “Extreme Greed” zone, reflecting heightened optimism among cryptocurrency investors. This significant rise signals a notable shift in market sentiment, driven by improved momentum and increasing activity across key factors tracked by the index. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a widely followed metric that evaluates investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating “Extreme Fear” and higher scores representing “Extreme Greed.” How the Index is Calculated The index is derived from six key factors, each contributing to the overall score: Volatility (25%) : High volatility often correlates with fear, while stability indicates confidence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Increasing trading volume and momentum are signs of greed. Social Media (15%) : Sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter tracks public opinion. Surveys (15%) : Polling market participants helps gauge collective sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Higher Bitcoin dominance may indicate fear as investors retreat to safer assets. Google Trends (10%) : Searches for crypto-related terms often reflect market interest levels. What Does ‘Extreme Greed’ Mean? The “Extreme Greed” zone indicates heightened optimism and confidence among investors, often driven by rising prices and strong market momentum. While this can signal bullish sentiment, it also serves as a cautionary flag for potential market corrections. Historical Trends In bull markets , Extreme Greed often precedes significant rallies as euphoria drives prices higher. In bear markets , such levels can signal overconfidence, making the market vulnerable to sharp corrections. Factors Driving the Current Sentiment Market Momentum A surge in trading volume and strong price performance across major cryptocurrencies have fueled optimism, boosting the index. Social Media Buzz Conversations around Bitcoin and altcoins have intensified, with mentions of bullish price targets dominating platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Bitcoin Dominance A balanced Bitcoin dominance level suggests diversification into altcoins, reflecting broad confidence in the market. Improved Economic Outlook Global macroeconomic conditions, including reduced inflation concerns and favorable regulatory developments, have created a conducive environment for crypto growth. Implications of Extreme Greed While Extreme Greed indicates strong bullish sentiment, it also carries risks. Positive Indicators Bullish Momentum : Rising prices and market participation can attract more investors, sustaining the rally. Increased Adoption : Positive sentiment can drive mainstream and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. Potential Risks Overvaluation : Overconfidence can lead to inflated asset prices, making the market susceptible to corrections. Market Volatility : Sudden shifts in sentiment can trigger sharp price swings. Comparison to Past Market Cycles The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has historically been a reliable predictor of market behavior: 2021 Bull Market : The index reached the Extreme Greed zone before Bitcoin’s peak at $69,000, followed by a sharp correction. 2023 Recovery : Moderate levels of greed signaled steady growth as the market recovered from a prolonged bear phase. The current surge to 79 aligns with patterns seen in the early stages of bull markets, indicating room for further growth but also the potential for volatility. Investor Strategies in an Extreme Greed Market Navigating the cryptocurrency market during Extreme Greed requires a balanced approach: Take Profits : Lock in gains on assets that have seen significant price increases. Diversify Holdings : Spread investments across different assets to mitigate risks. Monitor Sentiment : Stay informed about shifts in the index and other sentiment indicators. Avoid Overleveraging : Limit exposure to high-risk trades that could amplify losses in the event of a correction. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 79 suggests that the market is riding a wave of optimism. Key factors to watch include: Price Movements : Sustained rallies could push the index higher, while corrections may bring it back to neutral levels. Regulatory News : Developments in crypto regulations could significantly influence market sentiment. Macro Trends : Broader economic factors, such as interest rate decisions and inflation data, will play a crucial role in shaping the market. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaching 79 and entering the “Extreme Greed” zone reflects heightened investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. While this surge signals bullish sentiment and potential for further growth, it also calls for caution as markets may be vulnerable to corrections. Investors should remain vigilant, balancing optimism with strategic risk management to navigate the dynamic crypto landscape effectively.

38136560,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53170,1735207570,"Solana Flashes First Buy Signal Since the Post-FOMC Meltdown, Ready for a New ATH Alongside XRP and 1 Other Altcoin","Many investors confident in Solana purchased it after the Fed interest rate dipped the price of many top cryptocurrencies, including SOL. Solana’s increasing trading volume signals a new ATH for SOL. However, XRP and RXS, a new altcoin, are also ready to soar and reach all-time highs in the coming days. Solana (SOL): Cryptocurrency With A Bullish Outlook After facing significant losses last week, many investors rushed to buy SOL. The Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator identified this buy signal as a chance for a bullish reversal. Analysts observe that SOL tested a crucial support zone between $188 and $179. Historically, this level has acted as resistance but now serves as a potential foundation for recovery. Santana, a TradingView analyst, has identified Solana’s ongoing correction as a strategic buying opportunity, emphasizing the coin’s history of higher highs and lows since December 2022. SOL’s price is currently $181, reflecting a 17% decline over the week. Despite the downtrend, data reveals that the asset has seen positive capital inflow since September, with a peak daily inflow of $776 million. This shows enduring interest from both short-term traders and long-term holders. Analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s future. If the current support levels hold, some predict a potential return to its previous swing highs. Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio further suggests that Solana’s market is far from overheating, leaving room for growth before entering a macro downtrend. Institutions have also grown interested in Solana, especially in Europe, where financial products like Solana Staking ETPs are becoming more relevant. Investors are watching closely for signs of a bullish breakout for SOL, with some analysts estimating a potential rise to $300 soon. Ripple (XRP): Preparing For A Third Wave According to analysts, XRP’s price retesting of $2 signifies the conclusion of its negative second wave in the Elliott Wave cycle. This opens the path for a third wave, with multiple elements driving this optimistic view. The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has been a significant boost, as XRP’s price surged following its release. Additionally, the pro-crypto stance of the US president-elect and Ripple’s financial contributions to his campaign add optimism. Recent regulatory changes, such as Paul Atkins’s appointment and the potential end of the SEC’s appeal against Ripple, support positive market sentiment. The anticipated approval of XRP ETFs also contributes to this outlook. XRP’s technical indicators are also encouraging. Analysts note that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has room to expand, with two bullish targets at 87 and 96. Furthermore, XRP’s price currently sits above the equilibrium level on the 2-month chart, a position that historically preceded significant price increases. Predictions suggest a rally to $13 could be achievable. XRP’s recent price rebound from $1.95 to $2.35 in the short term highlights its resilience. Whale activity is another bullish indicator, with 80 million XRP accumulated since December 17, signaling strong investor confidence. For sustained upward momentum, XRP must maintain its position above $2.20 and break through the $2.60 resistance level. If it can remain bullish, it could soon reach a new all-time high. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Game-Changer In The Crypto Market Rexas Finance is quickly becoming the next big thing in the crypto market. It focuses on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which positions it as a game-changer in asset management. Using blockchain technology, Rexas Finance transforms assets like real estate and commodities into digital tokens, making them accessible to everyday investors. The platform’s innovative tools further highlight its potential. Products like the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot simplify token creation, even for non-technical users. Meanwhile, AI-powered features like the Rexas AI Shield ensure robust security, and GenAI helps artists create and market NFTs seamlessly.

After raising over $32 million and selling over 375 million tokens, the project has already seen a 400% price increase. It’s currently at stage ten, with RXS priced at $0.15. However, it’s closing on a new all-time high at stage eleven. At the next stage, RXS’s value will soar to $0.175, a notable achievement, and the token will launch at $0.20. Analysts predict that RXS will surge to $12 after its launch, representing a 5900% increase. This growth will be fueled by listings on top-tier exchanges, further boosting visibility and accessibility. After undergoing a thorough audit by CertiK, it is currently listed on CoinGecko and CoinmarketCap. Rexas Finance uses an innovative approach and has strong community support. This feature is set to reshape the crypto landscape, making it a significant opportunity for investors looking to invest in the next big thing in digital finance.

While both offer opportunities for profit, they differ significantly in terms of market structure, trading strategies, and risk factors. Understanding these differences is essential for choosing the market that aligns with your trading goals and style. In this guide, we’ll break down the key aspects of Forex vs stock trading to help you make an informed decision. What is Forex Trading?

High Liquidity : The Forex market offers unparalleled liquidity, making it easy to enter and exit positions. Leverage : Brokers provide leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with smaller capital. What is Stock Trading?

Market Hours : Trading is limited to specific hours, typically 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM (ET). Variety of Sectors : Stocks offer exposure to various industries, from tech to healthcare.

38135190,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398220,1735207299,Web3 Gaming: The Role of Rewards in Achieving Mainstream Adoption,"The post Web3 Gaming: The Role of Rewards in Achieving Mainstream Adoption appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Web3 gaming has surged in popularity following the debut of Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse during the 2021 bull run. According to the latest report by DApp Radar, the blockchain gaming sector accounted for the largest share of on-chain activity, with a 28% market dominance while the average number of daily active wallets stood at $6.8 million. But despite the remarkable growth within the last three years, it is evident that Web3 gaming is yet to achieve the levels of adoption that stakeholders envisioned in the earlier days. For context, a popular Web2 game such as Fortnite has over 650 million registered players while Call of Duty (CoD) enjoys over 100 million monthly users as per the latest statistics . So, what are Web3 games missing to achieve mainstream adoption? The most obvious shortcoming is the quality of Web3 games, but more importantly, are players getting the value that was initially promised in the concept of incentivized gameplays and can these rewards be redeemed for external value outside the crypto ecosystem? Incentives: The Key to Mainstream Adoption in Web3 Gaming The Web 3.0 ecosystem is often touted as the incentivized economy; what this means is that participants are rewarded with value, often in the form of tokens or in-game items in the case of Web3 games. This model has seen pioneer blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum achieve mainstream adoption for the simple fact that miners and validators are compensated with ‘valuable’ digital assets. Similarly, the Web3 gaming ecosystem has an opportunity to bounce back to its glory by paying more attention to the lucrativeness and sustainability of the incentivization models. There have been several instances where games such as Axie Infinity that almost went globally viral became just another name in the industry. To provide some context, SLP, the reward token for Axie Infinity players, is down 99% from its all-time high. A two-fold Shock and Awe Approach On the brighter side, innovators in the Web3 gaming ecosystem have the flexibility to try out more flexible incentivization models. A two-fold shock and awe approach is one of the effective ways that stakeholders in this space can leverage to achieve mainstream adoption. But what exactly does this strategy entail? Simply put, this means allocating a significant amount of funds towards life changing rewards for participating or completing tasks in a Web3 game, massive prize pools and the scalable infrastructure to match the level of incentives in more advanced gaming ecosystems such as the esports industry. A good example of a Web3 gaming ecosystem that is already implementing an incredible rewards strategy is Funtico . This full stack chain-agnostic platform is designed to bridge the gap between the fun and the rewards aspect by introducing a Web3 gaming ecosystem that is fueled by incredible rewards. At the core, Funtico prioritizes big rewards for the Web3 games within its ecosystem. The platform features multiple tournaments, including branded tournaments, community tournaments, leaderboards and private rooms that organizations looking to host organized Web3 gaming tournaments can leverage to incentivize the players. Currently, Funtico is running a tournament dubbed “THE BIG BANTER SHOWDOWN Quarter Final” for one of its in-house games, Formula Funtico, with a prize pool of up to $5000 USDT. The platform’s tap-to-earn game, Lucky Funatic, also features big prize pool tournaments coupled with the thrill of players seamlessly engaging with the game by simply tapping to earn these rewards. It is also interesting to observe other Web3 games in the tap-to-earn ecosystem that are using the incentive model to attract more users such as Hamster Kombat. This TON-based game involves a gameplay where players act as hamsters tasked with running a crypto exchange to earn in-game rewards. More importantly, the shock approach doesn’t end with initial rewards. Many are the times when Web3 gamers have been left holding devalued coins as was the case with Axie Infinity, not to mention the fact that most Web3 gaming ecosystems lack sustainable continuity models hence no more incentives for users that have already been onboarded. For Web3 gaming innovators to consistently attract new audiences, innovators need to adopt more sustainable incentivization elements such as affiliate programs coupled with advanced UI, transparency and superior gaming systems that can not only match the likes of Fortnite and CoD but enhance the participation with rewards that can be redeemed both internally and externally. Wrap Up As mentioned in the introduction, the Web3 gaming ecosystem is one of the most active crypto sub sectors but it is still nowhere close to the levels of adoption it should be. While implementing more ‘incentivized tokenomics’ may seem cliche, the key is in making these rewards sustainable. The next era of Web3 gaming adoption will likely be defined by incredible rewards that are not limited by speculative narratives but by the value these rewards provide to players and the models innovators use to keep them valuable for longer periods, accompanied by more incentive programs throughout the lifecycle of Web3 games.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/web3-gaming-the-role-of-rewards-in-achieving-mainstream-adoption/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38135532,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114352,1735207217,"Altcoin Season Index Rises to 48, Bitcoin Season Persists","Altcoin Season Index Rises to 48, Bitcoin Season Persists The Altcoin Season Index, a popular metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), rose by one point to 48 at 00:29 UTC on December 26, signaling that the cryptocurrency market remains in Bitcoin Season. This subtle increase highlights ongoing trends in the market, with Bitcoin maintaining dominance as most altcoins fail to outperform the leading cryptocurrency over the past 90 days. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index serves as a valuable tool for assessing market trends and sentiment. Its score ranges from 1 to 100 and is updated daily, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Altcoin Season : Defined as a period when at least 75% of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season : Occurs when 25% or fewer coins outpace Bitcoin. With the index currently at 48, the market is firmly in Bitcoin Season, reflecting Bitcoin’s resilience and altcoins’ relative underperformance. What the Current Score Indicates At 48, the Altcoin Season Index is close to a neutral zone but still leans toward Bitcoin dominance. This indicates that while some altcoins are performing well, the majority are lagging behind Bitcoin’s growth. Recent movements in the index reflect: Bitcoin’s Strength : Bitcoin’s performance continues to set the pace for the market. Altcoin Challenges : Many altcoins have struggled to maintain momentum in a market environment favoring Bitcoin. The slight uptick from 47 to 48 suggests a gradual shift, but not enough to signal an incoming Altcoin Season. Why Is It Still Bitcoin Season? Several factors contribute to the current Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin’s Safe-Haven Appeal Amid global economic uncertainties, Bitcoin remains the go-to asset for investors seeking stability and proven market leadership. Institutional Adoption Increased interest from institutions has largely focused on Bitcoin, reinforcing its dominance over altcoins. Market Cycles Historically, Bitcoin tends to lead during the initial stages of a bull market before altcoins gain momentum. Altcoin-Specific Challenges While some altcoins have shown promise, others face regulatory scrutiny or lack the adoption and use cases that drive sustained growth. Implications for Traders and Investors The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it offers actionable insights for traders and investors: Bitcoin Focus : With the market in Bitcoin Season, investments in Bitcoin may carry less risk compared to altcoins. Altcoin Opportunities : Altcoins nearing breakout levels could present significant upside potential if the index trends toward 75. Risk Management : A mixed market environment calls for caution, especially in highly volatile altcoins. Key Metrics to Watch To anticipate shifts in the Altcoin Season Index, traders should monitor: Bitcoin’s Market Dominance : A declining dominance could signal altcoin strength. Performance of Leading Altcoins : Coins like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon are often bellwethers for broader altcoin performance. Macro Events : Economic, regulatory, and market developments can influence sentiment and investment patterns. Recent Trends in the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index’s gradual increase mirrors broader trends in the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin Price Stability : Bitcoin’s consistent performance has kept it at the forefront of market activity. Altcoin Volatility : Many altcoins have seen sharp fluctuations, underscoring the challenges they face in outperforming Bitcoin. Institutional Interest : While institutions are slowly exploring altcoins, Bitcoin remains their primary focus. Outlook: Will Altcoin Season Return? While Bitcoin Season currently dominates, a shift to Altcoin Season is possible under certain conditions: Market Maturity : As investors gain confidence in altcoin projects with strong fundamentals, the index could trend upward. Bull Market Cycle : Historically, Altcoin Seasons occur in later stages of bull markets when speculative interest in smaller assets grows. Regulatory Clarity : Clearer regulations around altcoins could drive adoption and investment, boosting performance relative to Bitcoin. For now, Bitcoin continues to lead, but altcoin enthusiasts are closely watching for signs of a breakout. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s rise to 48 underscores Bitcoin’s ongoing dominance in the cryptocurrency market. With the metric signaling Bitcoin Season, traders and investors are focusing on Bitcoin while remaining cautious about altcoin investments. As market dynamics evolve, the potential for a shift toward Altcoin Season remains, but it will depend on broader market trends, altcoin performance, and investor sentiment. Staying informed and adapting to changes will be key for success in this dynamic landscape.

Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer stated in his statement that AVAX is similar to Bitcoin (BTC) and listed their similarities. Emin Gun Sirer drew attention to a critical aspect of Avalanche in his X post, emphasizing its similarity to Bitcoin's 21 million supply. At this point, the famous CEO pointed out that AVAX has a supply of 715.74 million and said that this aspect is similar to BTC. Implying that the limited supply feature is the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s value, Sirer argued that it attracts long-term investors and increases confidence in its deflationary nature. The famous CEO said that this feature is the same in AVAX, and that AVAX's limited supply and deflation mechanism of burning transaction fees make a difference, and compared it to Ethereum (ETH). Stating that Avalanche is similar to Bitcoin but different from Ethereum in these aspects, Sirer stated that no one understands this similarity and difference. “Not enough people understand that AVAX has a limited supply like Bitcoin and is similar but different from Ethereum.” Emin Gün Sirer underlined the similarity of AVAX to Bitcoin and increased speculations about a possible AVAX price increase. At this point, experts said that the current price of AVAX indicates upward momentum. Experts stated that $34.71 is an important support area for AVAX and stated that the AVAX price could reach $64 and $79 in the short term.

38134935,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633394,1735206488,AI phones may keep US chip sector afloat as data center growth slows,"AI-powered smartphones could rescue the US chip industry as data center investments begin to slow. With tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft scaling back their spending, the semiconductor market risks a significant downturn. Doug Lefever, CEO of chip-testing machine giant Advantest, warns that any cutbacks in data center development could ripple through the supply chain with brutal force. “The concentration of hyperscalers in the market makes any slowdown in data center buildout a major issue,” Lefever said. While he avoided labeling it a “bubble,” he cautioned about cycles that could hit the industry hard. And with no immediate slowdown in sight, all eyes are on the next possible growth catalyst: artificial intelligence smartphones. AI smartphones: Waiting for the killer app AI smartphones are still a gamble , but the potential for a breakout moment keeps the industry on edge. Lefever described demand as “slow” but predicted a revolution if the right app triggers mass adoption. “Everyone’s waiting for that killer app. When it happens, people will replace their phones like crazy,” he said. For companies like Advantest, the stakes are high. Based in Tokyo, the company supplies chip-testing machines critical to Nvidia’s advanced GPUs. Advantest holds more than half of the global market in this niche, and demand for its equipment has exploded as semiconductors become more advanced. These machines now test chips 10 to 20 times throughout production, compared to just a handful of tests five years ago. The testing process has grown even more complex with Nvidia’s new Blackwell GPUs , which require three to four times longer to test than their predecessors. This trend allowed Advantest to raise its fiscal 2024 income target by 16%, aiming for ¥122 billion ($792 million). Increased demand has also driven massive stock gains. Advantest’s share price soared 80% this year and over 500% in the past five years. However, concerns about US-China tensions under President-elect Donald Trump briefly cooled investor enthusiasm. US-China tensions and chip resilience The company’s exposure to China has decreased, with 20–25% of its revenue now tied to the region. Although US sanctions want to restrict China’s chip production capabilities, Advantest has largely avoided direct impact. When a major Chinese customer was hit by sanctions, Advantest quickly recovered lost sales through other clients. “We thought it could take a year to offset those losses, but it only took months,” Lefever said. Despite these challenges, Nvidia continues to dominate Wall Street. The company’s stock, up more than 180% this year, has propelled its market cap to over $3 trillion. NVDA is now the second-most valuable company in the US and a top performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Retail investors are also fueling Nvidia’s momentum. The company has nearly doubled net inflows compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). It’s on track to surpass Tesla as the most-bought stock, a feat amplified by its 10-to-1 stock split earlier this year. While Nvidia hasn’t experienced the inflated price-to-earnings multiples seen with Tesla or Palantir, its retail investor base remains substantial. This enthusiasm was evident during a New York City watch party in August, where fans gathered to celebrate Nvidia’s earnings report.

38134755,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398166,1735206476,Is CHILLGUY Meme Copied? Crypto Coin Crashes 20% Amid Controversy,"The post Is CHILLGUY Meme Copied? Crypto Coin Crashes 20% Amid Controversy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Chillguy (CHILLGUY), the meme coin that recently took the crypto world by storm, is now facing a major setback. Once a fan favorite, its price has plummeted by 20%, dropping from $0.22 to $0.17. What’s behind this sharp decline? The answer lies in fresh allegations that CHILLGUY’s beloved mascot may not be as original as many thought. Could the character be a copy of an old Thai booklet character? Read on to find out how this controversy is shaking up the meme coin’s future. The Rise and Fall of CHILLGUY CHILLGUY’s mascot, “Just a Chill Guy,” became a hit on the internet, helping the meme coin gain widespread popularity after its launch in late 2023. However, recent allegations have raised doubts about the token’s authenticity, leading to a drop in interest and value. A Reddit user recently shared an image of a Thai booklet featuring a character called RELAXBOY, which looks very similar to CHILLGUY. Some users claim the booklet is at least six years old, while others believe it could be even older. Is It Plagiarism? The resemblance between RELAXBOY and CHILLGUY is hard to ignore. Both characters look nearly identical, with only minor differences in their faces. This has sparked a lot of debate, and many are now questioning whether the token’s mascot was copied. Some users have suggested that the RELAXBOY reference could have been created using AI, possibly to spark controversy and draw attention back to CHILLGUY. Whether this theory is true or not, the ongoing debates have increased selling pressure on the token, causing its price to drop further. Legal Trouble Builds Philip Banks, the creator of the original “Just a Chill Guy” meme , has already expressed his frustration with the meme being used in crypto projects and promotions. He has previously issued legal warnings, which led to a drop in CHILLGUY’s price. Now, the new plagiarism claims have added more pressure on the token. ChillGuy Market Impact At its peak, CHILLGUY had a market value of $650 million and was listed on major exchanges like Bybit anAs of today, CHILLGUY’s price has fallen to $0.1732, reflecting a 16.6% drop in the last 24 hours. Its market cap has also dropped to $173.58 million. At its peak, CHILLGUY had a market value of $650 million and was listed on major exchanges like Bybit and KuCoin. But with these new allegations, the future of the token now seems uncertain. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38135212,https://thecoinrise.com/hong-kong-stablecoins-bill-advances-in-legislative-council-details/,1735206463,Hong Kong Stablecoins Bill Advances in Legislative Council: Details,"Hong Kong Legislative Council has begun deliberations on the proposed Stablecoins Bill, marking a major step towards a robust regulatory framework for stablecoins in the region. On December 6, the government officially published the bill in its Gazette, and by December 18, it had advanced to the first reading in the Legislative Council. This process, consisting of three readings, will involve thorough debates, examinations, and potential amendments before it can be signed into law by Hong Kong’s chief executive. If enacted, the Stablecoins Bill aims to address the growing demand for regulatory clarity in the crypto space. Its introduction reflects Hong Kong’s intent to position itself as a global hub for digital assets while safeguarding market participants and fostering innovation. Key Features of the Stablecoins Bill The Stablecoins Bill is designed with three core components: licensing for issuers, stablecoin-specific offerings, and marketing restrictions coupled with enhanced consumer protections. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the region’s central bank, will oversee the licensing process. Issuers must comply with stringent requirements, including evaluations of their resources, governance structures, reserve assets, and mechanisms for maintaining stablecoin value. Only regulated entities and platforms will be permitted to issue or market stablecoins within Hong Kong. Beyond licensing, the bill introduces a framework to protect consumers, targeting all market participants involved in issuing and distributing stablecoins. This approach mirrors Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which have reshaped the stablecoin market across the continent. Implications for the Stablecoin Landscape Should the bill pass into law, Hong Kong’s stablecoin market could undergo transformative changes. A similar shift occurred in Europe following MiCA’s implementation , where compliant issuers like Circle and Societe Generale captured 91% of the market share by late 2024. Meanwhile, non-compliant players, such as Tether, were forced to withdraw certain offerings. Analysts believe that Hong Kong could replicate this success, fostering a stablecoin ecosystem built on trust and compliance. As global regulators tighten their grip on digital assets, Hong Kong’s proactive stance may provide a blueprint for other jurisdictions navigating the complexities of stablecoin oversight. By aligning regulatory measures with consumer protection and market stability, the Stablecoins Bill positions Hong Kong as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape .

As expected, the altcoins have suffered even more, with substantial price declines from the likes of LINK, AVAX, ADA, SUI, and many others. Bitcoin Stopped at $100K Bitcoin went through a massive correction last week following the latest FOMC meeting. It dumped all the way from $108,000 to $92,000 in a matter of days. It bounced off on Friday and Saturday as the bulls drove it to almost $99,500. However, it failed there and retraced hard once again at the start of the business week toward $92,000 once more. The bulls stepped up again at this point and initiated a notable price increase that pushed bitcoin up to $99,200 on Christmas Eve and almost $100,000 yesterday evening. Once again, though, the cryptocurrency was stopped at this point. The subsequent rejection has driven it south hard, as the asset now struggles below $96,000. Its market capitalization has declined to under $1.9 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has increased to 54.6%. Bitcoin/PriceChart 26.12.2024. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out The alternative coins registered some gains in the past few days as well, but red dominates all charts now. Ethereum was stopped at $3,500 and is below $3,400 after a 3.5% daily drop. Similar declines are evident from XRP, DOGE, SOL, BNB, TRX, and TON. Even more painful corrections come from the likes of ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, HBAR, XLM, and DOT, with losses of up to 9%. AAVE has plummeted by 10%, and so have ONDO and HYPE.

Analysts predict a potential price rally for FLOKI if support levels hold. The FLOKI chart shows strong support at $0.00017532, with resistance near $0.00028. Floki Inu, the seventh-largest meme coin by market cap, is set to launch an exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe by early 2025. This development has sparked excitement and speculation around the FLOKI token price. At press time, the meme coin is trading at $0.0001758, reflecting a 2.2% drop over the last 24 hours.

38136188,https://invezz.com/?p=2403795,1735206000,The epic 2024 crypto journey: crypto ETFs to Bitcoin hitting $100k and more,"2024 was nothing short of a blockbuster for the crypto world. From regulatory milestones to technological breakthroughs, each month unfolded like chapters in an epic saga, redefining the digital financial landscape. Let’s rewind the clock and relive the highlights of this transformative year, step by step, from January’s fireworks to December’s triumphs. January: A new era with Bitcoin ETFs 2024 kicked off with a bang on January 10, as the US SEC finally gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs . This landmark approval unlocked a regulated pathway for institutional investors, sparking a frenzy in the crypto market. After the ETF approvals, Bitcoin’s price surged past $40,000, signalling the dawn of a new age where cryptocurrencies became an appealing asset class for even the most conservative investors. March: Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade In March, Ethereum made waves with the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade , a technological leap that significantly slashed transaction costs on Layer 2 solutions, such as zk-rollups and optimistic rollups. The Dencun upgrade enhanced Ethereum’s efficiency, narrowing the gap with its competitor, Solana. It marked a pivotal step in Ethereum’s journey towards solving its long-standing scalability challenges. April: Bitcoin’s fourth halving event April 19 saw Bitcoin’s fourth halving event , a momentous occasion in the crypto calendar. The halving reduced mining rewards, effectively curbing the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. While the immediate price surge was more of a slow burn than an explosion, history hinted at the bullish momentum brewing beneath the surface causing traders and hodlers to brace themselves for the much-expected bull run. June: Europe’s crypto regulatory dawn Summer brought regulatory clarity to the European Union as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation took effect in June after the EU Council endorsed the regulation in May, marking a bold step toward legitimizing and nurturing the burgeoning crypto industry. This comprehensive framework aimed to protect crypto investors in the EU while fostering innovation, setting a potential global standard for crypto regulation. July: Ethereum ETFs approval July added another feather to the crypto cap as the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs . Though Ethereum’s price didn’t skyrocket overnight following the ETF approvals, the approval was a significant step in positioning the blockchain as a mainstream investment asset. Meanwhile, Bitcoin experienced volatility, briefly dipping below $54,000 before rallying to end the month above $67,700, fueled by growing optimism. October: Redemption for FTX October’s headline story was the phoenix-like rise of FTX. After its dramatic collapse in 2022, the exchange announced plans to begin compensating customers in January 2025. November: Eclipse mainnet launch and Donald Trump’s victory November was a game-changer, with two breakthroughs stealing the spotlight. First, Eclipse launched its mainnet , becoming the first Ethereum Layer 2 built on Solana’s technology. This innovation showcased the potential of cross-chain collaboration, setting a new benchmark for blockchain interoperability. Second, Donald Trump won the US presidential election , boosting cryptocurrency optimism. Bitcoin reacted by hitting an all-time high of $89,800, driven by optimism over Trump’s perceived crypto-friendly stance. December: Bitcoin hit an ATH above $108k The year concluded with fireworks in December as Bitcoin broke through the psychological barrier of $100,000 to hit an all-time high of $108,268.45 on December 17 according to to CoinMarketCap. This historic milestone was fueled by a mix of institutional investments, political tailwinds, and economic uncertainties. Ethereum ETFs have also seen record inflows, hinting at the onset of an altcoin season with Ethereum leading the pack. Ethereum briefly tapped $4,000 as several altcoins like ONDO and memecoins like Baby Doge and PEPE hit new all-time highs. On December 20, the SEC approved Bitcoin-Ether index ETFs for Hashdex and Franklin , offering investors a diversified entry point into the crypto market. Conclusion: 2024 will be a year to remember for crypto enthusiasts 2024 wasn’t just another year in crypto; it was a defining one. Each milestone, from Bitcoin’s halving to Ethereum’s advancements, from regulatory victories to technological innovations, reinforced the narrative of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and integral part of the global financial ecosystem. As the curtain closed on this epic journey, one thing is certain: the story of crypto has only just begun and 2025 is expected to be even spicier with Donald Trump at the help of the new administration in the US.

Will It Rise Above $4,000? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market does not seem to be recovering soon and investors are still waiting for the Santa Rally. The overall crypto cap has reached $3.32 trillion after falling 3.19% since yesterday. Ethereum has also suffered another hit of around 4% and is currently trading at $3,354.5. Even though the market sentiment is in greed, the market metrics say otherwise. Let’s explore why Ethereum is going down today. Analysing ETH Chart As we check the four hourly charts of Ethereum, it becomes clear that the price has received a heavy rejection from $3,524 zone and moving average 50 did not act as a friend. The MA 20 also failed to provide any support. On December 23, we witnessed a death cross over in this time frame that suggested a price dip which we are looking at right now. Source : Tradingview 10.06% fall in the trading activity suggests that traders are keeping distance from ethereum today. Even though the open interest has seen a surge of around a billion dollars, the long/short ratio is at 0.846. Breaking it down we can see that 54.17% of the total open future trades for ETH are shorts, suggesting the traders are indeed bearish for the price movement. Source : Coinglass Exchange Reserves and ETFS Flow According to the data by CryptoQuant, Ethereum exchange reserves are going down. This means investors are moving their assets from exchanges to cold wallets. This signals the rising confidence in the crypto and an upcoming price rise. At the time of writing, the exchanges only hold 19.05 million ETH tokens. Source : CryptoQuant Farside data revealed that on the last open day of ETFS, i.e. on December 24, they only witnessed an inflow of $53.6 million and there was no outflow. Blackrock’s ETHA received the highest inflow of $43.90 followed by ETHW by Bitwise – $6.19 million and Fidelity’s FETH – $3.45 million. What to expect? Even though the market feels it is going into a bearish mode however, the drop in exchange reserves clearly highlight investors’ confidence. This price might be going down however the momentum is building slowly. People will keep wondering why is Ethereum down today and the market maker will make money from their lack of knowledge. As we discussed in our Bitcoin analysis earlier, the market takes the traders by surprise and when people are bearish, crypto will start to move in the other direction.

According to the Bangkok Post , Thailand is working towards making the ex-Prime Minister’s suggestion for a Bitcoin ( BTC ) payment pilot project a reality. Binance’s Thai arm will reportedly support the pilot project that aims to establish Phuket as a Bitcoin sandbox for tourism. “Given our country’s reliance on tourism and foreign inflows, integrating cryptocurrencies into Phuket’s economy could align well with Thailand’s strategic strengths, potentially attracting tech-savvy visitors and investors.” Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance, a joint venture between Binance Thailand and Gulf Innova. Fuwattananukul viewed the idea as a positive step towards boosting Thailand’s position in the global economy as more and more regions like the U.S . and Japan are looking towards making use of Bitcoin as an alternative currency. He believes Thailand “must not be left behind” in regard to crypto adoption. Though unlike those countries, Thailand is bound by government law to restrict payments to only its local currency. Therefore, the Bitcoin pilot project will give the central bank a chance to assess the risks and benefits associated with cryptocurrency. “Introducing Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a payment method could have implications for monetary flow and the Bank of Thailand’s ability to manage economic stability,” said Fuwattananukul.

According to the Gulf Binance head, both the central bank and SEC will need to work together to align their regulatory frameworks and coordinate in seeing this pilot project through. Key considerations would include consumer protection, anti-money laundering measures, and the potential impact on Thailand’s financial stability. “The regulatory framework would also need to ensure that crypto payments operate within the country’s existing monetary policies and currency controls,” he said. As previously reported by crypto.news in November, Binance has been eyeing Thailand as a key market for pushing widespread crypto adoption as the country progressively becomes more open to crypto regulations. Binance chief marketing officer Rachel Conlan said Thailand was among the top 20 Binance markets, with local crypto penetration estimated at 12%, double the global average of 6%.

Showing the explosive possibilities of meme coins, the token rose from fractions of a penny to an ATH of $0.74. The market is enthusiastic as a fresh cryptocurrency promises to be the next DOGE. This fresh competitor is a possible game-changer since it is expected to turn a $450 investment into an impressive $83,250 within 100 days. Rexas Finance: The next Dogecoin Rexas Finance has been attracting considerable interest as the cryptocurrency that will replicate Dogecoin’s achievements. Unlike DOGE , which began as a meme coin, RXS is a new effort meant to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and actual assets. The technology lets users tokenize almost any real-world asset, real estate, art, intellectual property, or goods, allowing flawless ownership and blockchain trading. Rexas Finance’s use presents it as more than simply a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform that will completely reshape the worldwide financial landscape. Priced at $0.15 as of writing, the RXS presale, currently in its 10th stage, has shown amazing momentum. Stage 9 closed considerably ahead of time, and earlier presale stages sold out faster than expected. The presale’s success thus far indicates great investor confidence, as it has generated nearly $30.68 million. Unlike many other initiatives, the Rexas Finance team prioritized community ownership. By declining venture capital funding, it ensured that regular investors could participate in the project’s success. This original strategy has inspired hope since many believe RXS will be the next major cryptocurrency with exponential gains. Analysts expect an 18,400% increase to a price of $27.75 within 100 days, and with its listing on major platforms, including CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS is positioned for a huge boom. Though RXS provides a more substantial basis with practical uses, Dogecoin and Rexas Finance have interesting similarities. DOGE depends on community buzz and celebrity sponsorships, while RXS is supported by a clear use case in tokenizing actual assets (RWAs). By allowing users to tokenize assets with only a few clicks from anywhere globally, RXS has entered a trillion-dollar market, fueling its long-term expansion. Rexas Finance’s possibilities go far beyond transient benefits. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, its creative method of real-world asset tokenizing distinguishes it. On the blockchain, investors can tokenize and sell real estate, gold, and even intellectual property, removing obstacles to access and supporting fractional ownership. This distributes access to priceless resources and creates fresh paths for wealth-building. Rexas Finance poised for an 18,400% rally Foreasts of an 18,400% increase make Rexas Finance rapidly rising as a must-watch coin. The project’s capacity to provide outstanding returns results from its unique mix of utility, creativity, and community support. Unlike speculative initiatives, RXS appeals to individual and institutional investors since it is based on addressing actual issues. Analysts predict a quick rise in price since the presale stages are selling out quickly, and the coin is approaching public listing. Its listing on leading platforms like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, robust community support, and the rising acceptance of real-world asset tokenization will drive this increasing trend. For those who lost out on DOGE’s impressive ascent, RXS gives a second shot to ride the wave of a high-potential crypto project. Furthermore, the choice to start without any participation from venture capital has sparked a grassroots movement akin to the early years of DOGE. Demand has surged due to the buzz about the presale, effective marketing, and early uptake. With the token predicted to hit $27.75 in 100 days, investors saw RXS as a possibility for life-changing rewards. With this pricing aim, a $450 investment would become $83,250, with returns in line with DOGE’s renowned performance. Conclusion Rexas Finance has all the ingredients to become the next Dogecoin. With its approach to real-world asset tokenization, strong presale performance, and predictions of an 18,400% rally, RXS is poised to make an $83,250 return from a $450 investment in just 100 days. As the token prepares for its public launch and listings on major platforms, the time to invest in RXS is now.

On a broader scale, macroeconomic factors could also support $LINK’s growth. Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance for the 2024 election introduces a tailwind that could drive a wave of adoption across the sector. If combined with institutional validation from a player like BlackRock, Chainlink could be positioned for explosive growth.

Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies, has suggested integrating Bitcoin into tourism payments to attract tech-savvy visitors and boost the local economy. Thaksin emphasized that Thailand’s reliance on tourism and foreign investment makes it an ideal candidate for crypto adoption. He proposed creating stablecoins backed by government bonds to enhance economic liquidity. Additionally, he predicted Bitcoin could reach a price of $850,000, urging the country to stay aligned with global crypto trends. However, the Bank of Thailand currently prohibits Bitcoin payments , as the central bank controls the national payment system. Any pilot project would require cooperation between the central bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees digital asset regulation. Nirun Fuwattananukul, CEO of Gulf Binance, supported Thaksin's vision, highlighting that cryptocurrency integration could align with Thailand's economic strengths. Yet, regulatory approval remains a major hurdle. Collaboration between the central bank and SEC is crucial for any progress. Thaksin suggested focusing on tourist hubs like Phuket and Hua Hin for pilot programs, allowing Bitcoin holders to use their assets for spending. He clarified that his advocacy is not financial advice but rather a push to align Thailand with the evolving digital economy . He also pointed out the growing presence of cryptocurrencies, predicting a future where digital currencies outnumber national currencies. Data from Statista indicates that in 2024, over 15.43 million people in Thailand —about 21% of the population—are cryptocurrency users. However, growth in crypto adoption is expected to slow, with projections showing around 17.67 million users by 2028. Despite this significant user base, Thailand dropped from 10th to 16th place in the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis.

Announced in June, the deal would merge Bitstamp’s global exchange with Robinhood, broadening its international footprint while leveraging Bitstamp’s trusted reputation. Adding to the optimism, the anticipated pro-crypto stance of the incoming Trump administration is seen as a potential catalyst for innovation and support for companies like Ripple. This week, Ripple reportedly donated a historic $5 million XRP to President-elect Trump’s inaugural fund, the largest in U.S. history, further solidifying its presence in the regulatory landscape. The excitement surrounding XRP is also driven by Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The XRP community remains hopeful that a favorable resolution could bring much-needed regulatory clarity, opening the door to broader institutional adoption. Industry chatter also points to the potential launch of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the growing adoption of the XRPL. Furthermore, the recent approval of RLUSD by the New York Department of Financial Services highlights the XRPL’s role in enterprise-level payments, tokenization of real-world assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently described RLUSD as the “gold standard for the enterprise sector,” underscoring its alignment with XRP’s ecosystem. Furthermore, every transaction on the XRPL burns a small amount of XRP, potentially increasing its scarcity and value over time. However, while RLUSD’s launch initially caused some price volatility, analysts anticipate it will drive increased activity and adoption on the XRP Ledger. “Since RLUSD went live, transactions are surging, scalability is proving itself, and liquidity is flowing. These are the first steps toward consolidating all the world’s money. Once every country has its own stablecoin, the new global banking system will be locked in,” noted Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist. Beyond fundamentals, analysts like Javon Marks are optimistic that XRP will outperform expectations. On Friday, the pundit highlighted that XRP recently demonstrated strength not seen since its 2017 rally, with potential for even more growth. “Given XRP’s previous performance, which saw a 600X increase, its next bull cycle could see prices soar by over 6,800%, potentially reaching $168,” Marks tweeted .",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | XRP | ZRX,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitstamp-says-ripples-xrp-is-going-to-make-history-in-2025-heres-why/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

38133229,https://coinpaper.com/6717/animoca-brands-co-founder-targeted-in-cyberattack,1735203600,Animoca Brands Co-Founder Targeted in Cyberattack,"SBI VC Trade has stepped in to acquire the accounts and assets of DMM Bitcoin after the exchange suffered a $320 million hack earlier this year, attributed to the North Korea-linked cybercrime group TraderTraitor. Meanwhile, blockchain gaming leader Animoca Brands faced its own crisis as co-founder Yat Siu’s social media account was compromised to promote a fraudulent token. Animoca Brands Co-Founder Yat Siu Falls Victim to Phishing Hack, Promoting Fake Token on X Blockchain gaming giant Animoca Brands has confirmed a cyberattack on the social media account of its co-founder and chair, Yat Siu, marking yet another instance in a growing wave of attacks targeting cryptocurrency-focused accounts on X. On Dec. 26, Animoca Brands issued a statement via X revealing the breach: “Unfortunately [Siu’s] social media account has been compromised. The token launch on Solana as claimed in a post was made by the hacker.” The fraudulent post had promoted a token named Animoca Brands (MOCA), falsely associating it with the company and its affiliated Mocaverse NFT collection. The fake token was launched on Pump.fun , a Solana-based meme coin platform, and the now-deleted post lured unsuspecting followers to interact with the fraudulent asset. Renowned blockchain investigator ZachXBT took to X to elaborate on the attack, suggesting that Siu likely fell prey to a phishing email sent by the same malicious actor responsible for a string of similar hacks. This threat actor has reportedly used social engineering techniques to compromise at least 15 cryptocurrency-focused accounts on X in the past month, amassing over $500,000 from unsuspecting victims. ZachXBT highlighted that the fake MOCA token was deployed by the same address used to launch counterfeit tokens linked to other recent breaches. These scams often use compromised accounts to lend credibility to their fraudulent schemes, making them particularly effective in targeting the cryptocurrency community. One common method employed by the attacker involves impersonating the X support team to send fake copyright infringement notices. These notices create a sense of urgency, coercing victims into clicking a phishing link that leads them to reset their account passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials. Once this information is compromised, the attacker gains full access to the victim’s account. The fake MOCA token experienced a brief surge in value after being shared from Siu’s compromised account. According to blockchain analytics platform Birdeye , the token peaked at a market capitalization of over $36,700 shortly after the post went live. However, this was short-lived, as the token’s value plummeted within seconds, falling to $7,700 and continuing to decline to around $6,200. Trading activity around the token quickly dried up, leaving victims with valueless tokens. This pattern aligns with other scams perpetrated by the same hacker, where the primary objective appears to be siphoning funds through initial hype and rapid price inflation. A String of Attacks on Crypto X Accounts Siu’s account is just the latest in a series of attacks that began in late November. The first known incident occurred on Nov. 26, targeting the X account of Bitcoin infrastructure provider RuneMine. Subsequent attacks followed, including the Dec. 24 compromise of the account for crypto trading video streaming platform Kick. These breaches have sparked concerns about the vulnerability of high-profile cryptocurrency accounts on X, particularly as the platform remains a critical space for crypto-related announcements and engagements. The incident brings attention to the persistent threat of phishing attacks in the crypto space, particularly on platforms like X where trust and rapid communication are paramount. Siu’s position as a prominent figure in blockchain gaming and his association with Animoca Brands made his account an attractive target for attackers seeking to exploit the trust of his followers. Animoca Brands has since warned its community to remain vigilant against phishing attempts and fraudulent schemes. The company emphasized the importance of verifying announcements through official channels and adopting robust security practices. As phishing tactics grow increasingly sophisticated, experts have stressed the importance of adopting stronger security measures. Recommendations include enabling hardware-based two-factor authentication (2FA), being wary of unsolicited communications, and avoiding clicking on unfamiliar links. This incident also highlights the need for platforms like X to improve account security, especially for high-profile users in the crypto sector. Enhanced verification processes and better detection of suspicious activities could help mitigate the risks of such attacks. The hacking of Yat Siu’s account serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities within the cryptocurrency space. For users, the lesson is clear: always double-check the authenticity of announcements and ensure your accounts are safeguarded with the highest levels of security. The broader crypto community, meanwhile, must remain on high alert as malicious actors continue to target influential figures and organizations. Only through collective vigilance and proactive security measures can the ecosystem defend itself against these persistent threats. SBI VC Trade to Absorb DMM Bitcoin Following $320 Million Hack In other cybersecurity news, Japanese cryptocurrency-focused financial firm SBI VC Trade has officially announced its acquisition of the assets and customer accounts of hacked crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin. The transition, set to be completed on March 8, 2025, follows a devastating cyberattack earlier this year that forced DMM Bitcoin to shutter its operations. In a Dec. 25 statement, SBI VC Trade confirmed its agreement to take over all customer accounts and assets from DMM Bitcoin. The firm assured DMM customers that they would not need to initiate any account setup processes, as SBI will automatically create accounts for all transitioning users. The saga began on May 30, 2024, when DMM Bitcoin disclosed a security breach in which attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the exchange’s wallet infrastructure. The breach resulted in the theft of 4,500 Bitcoin, worth approximately $320 million at the time. The stolen funds were moved swiftly by the attackers, leaving DMM Bitcoin in financial turmoil. Despite pledging to reimburse affected customers, the exchange ultimately decided to liquidate its operations and transfer all user accounts to SBI VC Trade. On Dec. 23, US and Japanese authorities publicly attributed the attack to TraderTraitor, a notorious North Korea-linked cybercrime group. The FBI, Japan’s National Police Agency, and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) revealed the intricate details of the heist, which spanned months and involved advanced social engineering tactics. According to the FBI, TraderTraitor began the operation by targeting an employee of Ginco, a Japanese crypto wallet firm responsible for maintaining DMM Bitcoin’s wallet management system. Masquerading as a recruiter on LinkedIn, the attackers approached the Ginco employee with a seemingly legitimate pre-employment test. The test, however, contained a malicious script that the employee unwittingly uploaded to their GitHub page, enabling the attackers to exploit the vulnerability. Months later, the group leveraged their access to Ginco’s communications to impersonate the compromised employee. Using this stolen identity, TraderTraitor manipulated a transaction request from DMM Bitcoin, enabling them to siphon off the massive Bitcoin haul. The DMM Bitcoin breach is one of the largest crypto exchange hacks of 2024 and highlights the persistent vulnerabilities within centralized cryptocurrency platforms. Blockchain security firm Hacken reported that losses from such attacks have surged to $694 million in 2024, more than double the figure from 2023. Notable incidents this year include the DMM Bitcoin hack and the $235 million breach of Indian crypto exchange WazirX. The sharp rise in losses has raised alarms about the need for more robust security measures and decentralized solutions within the crypto industry. SBI VC Trade’s Role in Recovery As SBI VC Trade steps in to absorb DMM Bitcoin’s accounts, the firm is positioning itself as a stabilizing force in the wake of the crisis. By ensuring a seamless transition for DMM’s customers, SBI aims to restore trust and minimize the disruption caused by the hack. SBI’s statement emphasized its commitment to customer protection and operational security. The automatic account creation process is intended to simplify the transition for users, many of whom remain wary of the risks associated with centralized crypto services. The DMM Bitcoin breach serves as a stark reminder of the critical need for enhanced cybersecurity protocols in the cryptocurrency sector. Experts point to several key takeaways: Social Engineering Vulnerabilities: The attack underscores the dangers of social engineering tactics, which exploit human vulnerabilities rather than technological flaws. Decentralized Alternatives: The growing number of high-profile hacks has intensified calls for the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which eliminate single points of failure. Collaboration Across Borders: The joint efforts of the FBI, DC3, and Japanese authorities highlight the importance of international cooperation in combating cybercrime. For DMM Bitcoin’s former customers, the transition to SBI VC Trade represents a fresh start. However, the broader implications of the hack will likely resonate within the crypto industry for years to come. As centralized exchanges remain attractive targets for sophisticated cybercriminals, the pressure to bolster security measures has never been greater. SBI VC Trade’s takeover of DMM Bitcoin’s operations marks a critical step in restoring stability and confidence within the Japanese crypto market. Yet, the events leading to this point serve as a sobering reminder of the persistent threats facing the cryptocurrency sector.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6717/animoca-brands-co-founder-targeted-in-cyberattack,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
38133235,https://finbold.com/?p=222995,1735203600,Will SHIB reach 1 cent in 2025?,"Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has made remarkable progress since its modest beginnings as a meme coin. Once dismissed as a speculative token with limited utility, SHIB has established itself in the cryptocurrency space through continuous development and strong community-driven efforts. Investor interest in SHIB has recently been reignited by a sharp increase in the token’s burn rate. Millions of SHIB tokens have been permanently removed from circulation, fueling optimism about the potential impact of reduced supply alongside ongoing ecosystem advancements. As these developments unfold, investors are left pondering whether the meme coin can defy expectations and achieve the ambitious $0.01 milestone by 2025. Shiba Inu’s journey so far In 2024, Shiba Inu experienced a volatile journey in the cryptocurrency market. After a relatively flat start to the year, the token skyrocketed by 259.30%, climbing from $0.0000101 to a yearly high of $0.00003629. SHIB one-month price chart. Source: Finbold However, this momentum was short-lived as SHIB retreated to $0.00001316 by September. Currently trading at $0.00002225, SHIB has suffered a 7.5% weekly decline, cutting its monthly returns by 11%. Despite the setback, the token boasts a remarkable 114% gain year-to-date (YTD). The ecosystem’s expansion The launch of Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain, has significantly improved its scalability and transaction efficiency. Shibarium’s rapid adoption is evident in its milestone of surpassing 700 million total transactions as of December 25, just months after its launch last summer. Accompanying this milestone are several ecosystem upgrades, including a revamped user interface for better compatibility with wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Enhancing its appeal further, the project has announced plans to develop a stablecoin pegged at $0.01, aiming to broaden SHIB’s utility and expand its market presence. Adding to the positive sentiment, SHIB’s burn mechanism has gained significant traction. On December 25 alone, 6.26 million SHIB tokens were permanently removed from circulation, marking a 97% increase in the burn rate. This aggressive reduction in supply has bolstered investor optimism, aligning with the classic economic principle of supply and demand. The anticipated release of the TREAT token further adds to the bullish sentiment, with TREAT designed to serve as the reward token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, offering multifaceted utility. Technical analysis and market sentiment Shiba Inu presents mixed signals from a technical perspective, with recent indicators suggesting potential upward momentum. The TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal, hinting at a possible trend reversal. Analyst Ali Martinez has identified resistance at $0.000026, with SHIB possibly targeting $0.000029 if buying pressure intensifies.

Such a move would represent a 3.33-fold increase, translating to a staggering 234% gain from its current levels, reinforcing a cautiously optimistic outlook for the token. At the same time, market sentiment surrounding SHIB remains cautiously optimistic, with notable activity from major investors and whales. Such significant whale movements suggest renewed interest from large investors. However, data retrieved by Finbold from the crypto on-chain analysis platform IntoTheBlock on December 25 shows that 55% of Shiba Inu holders are in profit, 8% are at breakeven, and 37% are at a loss. This distribution highlights the potential for increased selling pressure as profitable holders may look to capitalize on their gains, while those at breakeven or in loss may choose to hold amid market uncertainties. The road to 1 cent While Shiba Inu’s ecosystem developments and technical indicators show promise, reaching $0.01 by 2025 remains an extremely ambitious goal. Significant ecosystem advancements, increased adoption, and a strong bull market will be essential to achieving such a target. For now, SHIB’s realistic milestones are focused on breaking resistance levels like $0.000026 and $0.000029, with long-term growth dependent on sustained efforts by its community and developers. Investors should approach with caution, balancing the coin’s speculative nature against its evolving ecosystem.

His campaign has raised $14 million for brain tumor research, proving that these digital assets can go beyond profit to create real social impact. Siqi, the founder of Runway, faced a heartbreaking challenge when his 4-year-old daughter, Mira, was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor called craniopharyngioma in September 2024. Although benign, the tumor was located in a critical part of her brain. Thankfully, after surgery, Mira’s health improved. Instead of raising funds for his family, Siqi asked supporters to donate to children’s brain tumor research. Unexpectedly, an X user named Waddles created a meme coin called MIRA on Solana to support this cause, sending half its supply to Siqi. Waddles shared that the idea was to rally the Solana community behind a meaningful cause. Siqi pledged to donate 100% of the proceeds from MIRA to research. He sold 1% of his holdings daily and posted sale updates online. Instead of declining, MIRA’s price soared , supported by a community inspired by its purpose. Siqi was amazed as the token's value surpassed $14 million. The story quickly spread, with MIRA’s market cap exceeding $80 million and trading volumes surpassing $100 million, according to GeckoTerminal. The higher MIRA’s value climbed, the more funding Siqi could channel toward rare disease research. He reminded everyone that every dollar gained directly supported research, as he wasn’t keeping any for himself. Despite the success, fake tokens featuring images of Siqi and his family appeared on Pump.fun, highlighting challenges in the crypto space. However, MIRA’s rise supports Vitalik Buterin’s belief that meme coins can have meaningful societal contributions.

38133136,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376217,1735203395,Here’s Why Bitcoin (BTC) Might Experience Another Correction Soon,"TL;DR Bitcoin dropped below $96,000 after $3.2 billion worth of BTC was sent to exchanges, signaling potential sell-offs and increased price pressure. Despite the dip, analysts predict a rebound, with targets ranging from $110K this year to over $320K in 2025. Heading South Again? Bitcoin (BTC) became the talk of the town in mid-December, reaching a new all-time price of over $108,000. However, the Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting and, more specifically, Jerome Powell’s comments changed the scene in the crypto market. While the Chairman of America’s central bank announced another rate cut of 0.25%, he hinted that concerns of rising inflation mean that they might not cut rates going forward in 2025 . Powell added that the Fed is not allowed to hold BTC, casting doubt on Trump’s proposed plan to establish a strategic BTC reserve. The disclosure occurred on December 18, with the primary cryptocurrency experiencing enhanced volatility in the following week. The price hovered between $92,600 to almost $100,000. In the past several hours, BTC fell by 2% to its current $95,600 (per CoinGecko’s data), and one important factor indicates that the plunge could intensify in the near future . BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The popular X user Ali Martinez revealed that over 33,000 BTC (valued at approximately $3.2 billion) have been sent to exchanges in the last seven days. This move suggests that investors may be preparing to offload their holdings. Large sell-offs would result in increased circulating supply, which, combined with non-rising demand, could negatively impact the BTC price. Martinez previously outlined $97,300 as a critical support zone for the asset due to the numerous investors who had bought roughly 1.5 million BTC there. As mentioned earlier, though, the price plunged below that level. The Opposite Scenario Contrary to the aforementioned assumption , many analysts remain optimistic that the asset’s valuation could soon rally beyond $100,000 again. X user Captain Faibik envisioned a rise to around $110K by the end of the year, while Crypto Rover believes BTC “is about to go parabolic” next year. Jelle and Mags are also among the bulls. The former predicted a new ATH once BTC reclaims $102,000, while the latter thinks the bull cycle is still far from reaching its peak. Mags forecasted a jump to over $320K sometime in 2025, after which bears might take control.

In an effort to tighten up internal auditing procedures for financial institutions, the country’s regulator (FSA) will hold a roundtable in 2025 featuring participation from the Japan Virtual and Crypto assets Exchange Association (JVCEA). Japan’s Virtual and Crypto assets Exchange Association (JVCEA), a “self-regulatory” industry group promoting the advancement of regulated crypto businesses in Japan, will participate in a Financial Services Agency roundtable on January 25 next year, according to local media . In the wake of this year’s DMM Bitcoin “leak” incident in May, which is said to have cost the group $305 million in BTC, the regulator is looking to hold a “Roundtable on Advanced Internal Audits of Financial Institutions.” Joining other more mainstream financial groups will be the crypto (relative) newcomer to the scene, the JVCEA. The news comes as closed-door FSA meetings are also said to be happening with the aim of combatting “unregistered” use of crypto. Roundtable set for January 2025, PM Ishiba still cold on crypto The hack/leak of BTC from the now-defunct DMM Bitcoin exchange was said by police to have been caused by a careless employee in charge of DMM assets clicking on a malicious social media message. The attack was then reportedly traced to infamous North Korean hacking syndicate “Lazarus.” As Cryptopolitan previously reported, some Japanese have been skeptical of official statements and a lack of detailed information regarding the DMM hack. Further, the Lazarus Group, and North Korea in general, have for years now been a catch-all scapegoat for any malicious event in the crypto-sphere, and in Japan, generating further skepticism. The FSA roundtable talks will focus on security and surveillance of the internal affairs of financial institutions, in the interest of detecting “suspicious” activity. Other groups that will be participating are listed as (translated by Google): “the Japanese Bankers Association, the Japan Regional Banks Association, consulting organizations, and external experts.” While the development will likely be seen as bullish for cryptocurrency investors and speculators in Japan, the country’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, is still fairly anti-crypto in his public stance, and ideas about a strategic Bitcoin reserve to supplement the government’s foreign exchange has just recently been shot down by officials.

According to a Friday report by blockchain analytics firm Messari, the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) saw a notable increase of 19% quarter-over-quarter to reach $620 million, indicating growing trust and activity within its DeFi platforms. This growth is particularly highlighted by Liqwid, a DApp whose TVL surged by 77.2%, showcasing the platform’s increasing adoption and utility within the Cardano network. In the realm of stablecoins, Cardano’s market has expanded, with the total stablecoin market cap growing by 5.4% to $20.7M. Notably, newer stablecoins like USDM from USDM Official have experienced a remarkable rise, with their market cap increasing by 145.5% to $7.9M. This growth outpaces established stablecoins, suggesting a dynamic and evolving stablecoin ecosystem on Cardano. The Cardano ecosystem also witnessed the launch of new applications like Rocket by JPG Store and Snek by Splash Protocol, which are similar to Pump.fun for token launching and trading, adding to the diversity and functionality of Cardano’s DeFi landscape. Despite these advancements, Cardano faced some downturns in Q3. The average daily decentralized application (dApp) transactions decreased by 54.2%, and the daily DEX volume dropped by 41.4%. These declines reflect broader market trends but do not overshadow the positive developments in DeFi and stablecoin sectors. That said, the Cardano community continues to engage actively with the platform’s development, as evidenced by the successful completion of the Chang Hard Fork’s first phase in early September. This technical bootstrapping phase was crucial for transitioning Cardano towards a fully decentralized governance model, empowering ADA holders with more control over the network’s evolution. Looking forward, Cardano is preparing for major governance advancements with the recently announced Plan 529, also known as Chang 2”, which lays the foundation for the Plomin hard fork. This upgrade will further enhance governance and network capabilities. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has shared his vision of Cardano becoming a leader in community-driven on-chain governance by 2025, with plans for a dynamic constitution to empower the community and transform the network into a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Innovations focused on scalability and interoperability are also expected to position Cardano at the forefront of decentralized finance, bridging traditional and blockchain systems. Despite a lackluster performance for most of the year, which caused a drop in its market cap rank to 11th position, ADA has shown a strong resurgence.

That stance could become a dilemma for President-elect Donald Trump, who has touted both goals for his next administration. Case in point: As U.S. sanctions complicate Russia's international trade, the country is turning to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other digital currencies for payments across its borders. ""As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia [in foreign trade transactions],"" Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Russia-24 TV channel.

The news follows the Kremlin's recent approval of a tentative legal framework involving Russian crypto miners and supportive comments of the sector earlier this month by the country's top leader. ""A legitimate question: why accumulate [dollar] reserves if they can be lost so easily?"" Vladimir Putin said at the Investment Forum in Moscow. ""Who can ban Bitcoin? Nobody.

38132748,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633378,1735202455,Elon Musk says his D.O.G.E wouldn’t destroy US job market: “There is infinite potential”,"Elon Musk doesn’t want to hear about the scarcity mindset. The eccentric billionaire, co-leading Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), says the U.S. job market is nowhere near as fragile as people make it out to be. Elon believes in limitless possibilities for job and business creation, especially when driven by innovation. “The ‘fixed pie’ fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking,” he said on X (formerly Twitter). “There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago!” D.O.G.E and its bold goals have triggered a heated national conversation this Christmas, not just about job creation but about immigration reform, AI policy, and America’s fiscal future. The bold promises and harsh realities of D.O.G.E D.O.G.E is an advisory group with a sweeping mandate: cut $2 trillion from federal spending. That’s nearly equivalent to the U.S. government’s projected deficit for 2024. Their plans are massive layoffs, slashing agency budgets, and gutting all regulations they see as “bloated.” The proposal is ambitious to a fault. Elon and his co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy envision reducing the federal workforce by up to 75%. That’s three-quarters of federal employees potentially losing their jobs—a figure staggering enough to send chills through Washington. But experts aren’t buying it. Around 75% of federal spending is tied to mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare, which are politically untouchable. This leaves only $1.7 trillion in discretionary spending to target, with half of that earmarked for defense, an area Trump has historically been reluctant to trim. Even with aggressive efficiency cuts—estimated savings of $150 billion to $200 billion annually—the numbers fall laughably short of the $2 trillion target. Critics say the math doesn’t add up, and failing to meet these goals could backfire. Higher borrowing, ballooning deficits, and escalating interest payments (already devouring $880 billion annually) could seriously destabilize the economy. Immigration reform and innovation debates collide While D.O.G.E has its sights set on trimming bureaucracy, Elon’s comments about “infinite potential” renewed debates about immigration and the workforce. Entrepreneur Joe Lonsdale brought immigration reform to the forefront, referencing Trump’s senior AI policy adviser pick, Sriram Krishnan. Krishnan has been vocal about eliminating country-based caps for green cards, arguing that the U.S. needs to prioritize skills over nationality. “Anything to remove country caps for green cards/unlock skilled immigration would be huge,” he wrote on X. He called the current system “bizarre,” pointing out how it penalizes individuals based on their birthplace rather than their contributions. David Sacks , Trump’s White House crypto and AI czar, weighed in, supporting Krishnan’s merit-based approach. “Sriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited,” Sacks said, adding that it is critical to maintaining America’s leadership in AI and emerging technologies. Elon didn’t miss the chance to tie the immigration discussion back to his D.O.G.E ambitions, doubling down on his belief in innovation as the ultimate driver of economic growth. Trump himself underlined Krishnan’s importance to the administration, saying that he would work closely with Sacks on AI policy across government agencies. Is D.O.G.E fiscal disaster in the making? First, the target savings of $2 trillion appear wildly out of reach, even if inefficiencies are ruthlessly cut. The U.S. is already swimming in over $36 trillion in national debt, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting it to hit 166% of GDP by 2054. If D.O.G.E fails to deliver substantial savings, the government will have no choice but to borrow even more. Trump has already called for eliminating the statutory debt ceiling , which could temporarily avoid debt crises but risks unchecked borrowing in the long term. And then there’s the issue of tax cuts. If Elon and Trump propose cutting taxes without slashing spending proportionately, deficits will explode further. During Trump’s first term, his administration added nearly $8 trillion to the national debt, thanks partly to tax breaks. If D.O.G.E adopts a similar strategy, the U.S. could see its debt spiral even faster, making an already precarious situation worse.

38132843,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99362,1735202405,XRP Funds Record Weekly Inflows as Institutional Investors Dump SOL,"The crypto market saw mixed trading patterns last week, with large retail outflows in an attempt to avoid liquidations. Several assets like Solana (SOL) and XRP were at both ends of the flow yardstick as institutional activity declined. The general outlook led to plummeting prices, keeping SOL at $191, below the $200 level. CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows shows institutional investors poured $8.8 million into XRP last week. This spiked monthly inflows of over $288 million after bulls dominated community narratives in December. Although the previous week’s numbers were higher, XRP traders showed signs of a wider market rebound. This year, the asset’s products have seen $430 million, a little shy of the $500 million mark as projected by bulls with less than two weeks to end the year. XRP fee massive activity around Q4 2024, soaring to highs not seen in years. The asset recorded exits in recent months as institutional and retail saw plunging sentiments due to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit. The outcome of the US elections fueled XRP inflows as commentators stressed pro-crypto regulations in the country. The aftermath saw the asset’s market cap move over $130 billion, temporarily outpacing USDT to become the third-largest crypto asset. This month, XRP was the most traded altcoin on Binance, boosting confidence ahead of 2025. Notably, key drivers of the asset are Ripple’s global partnerships to facilitate cross-border payments and anticipated spot XRP ETFs in the United States. Wider Market Records Mixed Flows “ Recent price corrections resulted in a $17 billion reduction in total assets under management (AUM) for Digital Asset ETPs, likely in response to the hawkish dot plot released by the FOMC on Wednesday. While these outflows may sound alarming, they comprise just 0.37 of the total AUM ranking as the 13th largest single-day outflow on record. The largest single-day outflow took place in mid-2022,” CoinShares wrote. Solana funds recorded outflows as institutional investors parted ways with the asset in the last seven days. The asset saw 8.7 million exits, with monthly outflows soaring to $22 million. Solana was hailed as an institutional favorite based on consecutive weekly inflows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin attracted $375 million in inflows in the same time frame, taking monthly numbers slightly over $5 billion. Institutional investors continue their strategy ahead of anticipated BTC price growth next year. Ethereum also saw $51 million weekly inflows, which added to its yearly numbers.",POSITIVE,SOL | XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-funds-record-weekly-inflows-as-institutional-investors-dump-sol/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Here’s why,"EGRAG Crypto recently shared a technical analysis of XRP’s price action in the 1-hour timeframe. The chart provided detailed insights into critical price levels, market behavior, and upcoming targets for traders and investors. His post emphasized the importance of strategic decision-making, particularly during periods of price retracement, and challenged the community to reflect on their trading behavior. #XRP – Did You Buy or Chickened Out? The 1 Hour Time Frame chart is showing some noise, but the real question is—did you take advantage of the discounted prices? A) Discounted Price 1 B) Discounted Price 2 Or did you chicken out? Remember, the next Purple… pic.twitter.com/G7D90smCcK — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 23, 2024 Key Observations from the Chart Discounted Price Levels: Two significant areas of discounted prices are highlighted on the chart: Discounted Price 1: This level represents the initial retracement, marking an opportunity for accumulation during a corrective phase. Discounted Price 2: A secondary discounted zone, serving as another entry point for buyers aiming to capitalize on lower prices. These levels coincide with a period of market consolidation and a shift in market structure, indicated by the “Break of Structure” (BOS) and “Change of Character” (ChoCH) annotations. Critical Targets for Bulls: EGRAG emphasizes two pivotal price targets that mark critical milestones for bullish momentum. The first, at $2.72, lies within the “premium” price zone and requires sustained buying pressure to be reached. The second, at $2.91, represents a higher resistance level. Surpassing it would signal stronger bullish dominance. According to the analysis, these levels hold significant importance, with movements outside these zones dismissed as mere “noise” rather than meaningful trends. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Future Expectations EGRAG’s commentary reflects a shift in market sentiment, as XRP’s price discussions have transitioned from sub-dollar levels to the current multi-dollar targets. The statement, “We used to talk about $0.50 and $0.75, now we’re eyeing $2.50 and $2.75,” highlights the evolving perspective on XRP’s potential. Furthermore, his mention of future targets, such as $20.50 and $27.50, suggests a long-term bullish outlook. EGRAG Crypto’s analysis provides a comprehensive overview of XRP’s price action, emphasizing the importance of identifying and acting upon discounted price levels. With targets at $2.72 and $2.91 as key milestones, the focus remains on whether the bulls can maintain momentum and push XRP toward a higher valuation. For investors, this chart serves as a reminder to remain disciplined and capitalize on opportunities, even amid market “noise”.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rollblock emerges as the next 100x GameFi gem, poised to rival Solana’s parabolic rise with its gaming ecosystem and smart investor incentives. Table of Contents 30,000 users and over 7,000 games: Discover Rollblock’s bullish potential Solana continues to make waves in the crypto space Secure an early position with the new potential 100x gem Rollblock The bull run is here, though Bitcoin’s overwhelming dominance closely trailed by a major market crash in mid-December has dampened expectations. Rest assured, the market will recover, and this crash closely mirrors 2020’s December before altcoins like Solana experienced parabolic growth throughout 2021. As the crypto cycle picks up steam, Rollblock is set to emerge as a major contender. In portfolios that lack exposure to gaming, Rollblock could fill this gap as a GameFi gem that combines impressive entertainment options, investor incentives, and top-tier security into one comprehensive package. Here’s why investing in RBLK today could be like investing in Solana at just $0.50. 30,000 users and over 7,000 games: Discover Rollblock’s bullish potential Following the recent market downturn, Rollblock is positioned for significant growth in the iGaming space, with projected 25x returns by Q1 2025 and potential 100x gains in the peak of the bull run. The platform’s ecosystem continues to evolve with the addition of sports betting and a library exceeding 7,000 games. With 100+ new games planned for 2025, Rollblock leverages community feedback and partnerships with leading developers to stay ahead of the curve in the competitive iGaming sector. Rollblock’s rapidly growing user base will soon benefit from staking rewards, play-to-earn mechanics, and a token-burning strategy that enhances the RBLK token’s long-term value. This number is expected to drastically increase in the upcoming months, a testament to Rollblock’s vast appeal. Through its revenue-sharing model, Rollblock allocates 30% of weekly profits to RBLK token buybacks, burning half to reduce supply while distributing the remainder to stakers. This approach fosters token stability and incentivizes investor participation. Solana continues to make waves in the crypto space Setting new records with its December 2024 performance during a market downturn, Solana continues to dominate the blockchain space. The debut of the PENGU token, tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT project, pushed Solana’s daily transaction count to an unprecedented 66.9 million, outpacing the combined activity of competing blockchains including Ethereum and Binance Coin. Known for its high speed and low transaction fees, Solana remains a preferred platform for developers and users, steadily gaining ground as a viable Ethereum alternative. Solana’s global traction is evident in markets like Brazil, where transaction volumes have surged to nearly $84 million, a twofold increase year-over-year. Innovations like pump.fun, responsible for 62% of Solana’s DEX activity, exemplify how the blockchain’s affordability and efficiency foster growth. Even while the market is permeated by extreme fear on the “fear and greed index”, Solana’s robust on-chain activity highlights its potential to redefine the layer-1 landscape as it continues to become a household name. Institutional interest could further propel Solana’s rise, particularly if the SEC greenlights the conversion of Grayscale’s Solana Trust into a spot ETF. This move would boost investor confidence and position Solana to rival Ethereum and claim the top spot among layer-1 blockchains. Secure an early position with the new potential 100x gem Rollblock RBLK, priced at $0.043 in its ninth presale phase, is shaping up to be a game-changer for investors. Predictions indicate 10x returns by early 2025 and up to 100x gains as Rollblock becomes a frontrunner in blockchain gaming during the next bull cycle.

38132724,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53067,1735201854,Analyst Maintains $10 Target For Dogecoin Despite Market Dump While FXGuys Sets Up For A Massive Surge,"Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price downtrend in the past week has left most traders reconsidering their decision to hold on to DOGE after the November 2024 rally. Sure, Bitcoin set the DOGE price off to a flying start, but the following market dump has been massive. While some analysts still back Dogecoin to make a comeback and reach the $10 mark, DOGE has the new DeFi coin, FXGuys ($FXG) , with which to compete. $FXG is tipped to make a 100x surge in 2025, but that’s only one reason investors are flocking to the presale token. Here’s more on DOGE and the new crypto project! Dogecoin’s (DOGE) $10 Dream Amid Market Dump Concerns There aren’t many people who think Dogecoin will make a $10 jump, but Dima Potts on Twitter/X believes the DOGE token will get there next year. Dima records 2024 as the third year in a four-year trading cycle, stating that the spike comes in the fifth year. According to their analysis, Dogecoin peaks some three to four weeks after Bitcoin, based on historical data. Next year, the Dogecoin price is set to jump any time between February 11th and May. Despite the market dump earlier this year, Dogecoin is finishing this year with its best three-year performance at $0.31. The DOGE token could be heading into bigger profits in 2025, even if $10 sounds a tad unrealistic. In any case, DOGE is currently valued at $0.3156 , 22% down on the monthly charts, and still at the risk of a market dump as investors continue to favor the $FXG presale token. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys: The New Crypto Project Transforming Trading Forever Currently, only a few crypto trading platforms provide an extensive range of options for traders.

38132723,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53062,1735201808,Move Over Ethereum and Solana: Rollblock Emerges as the Top Crypto To Buy Now For 2025,"Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as a standout contender set to surpass Ethereum and Solana in investor buzz. Positioned to revolutionize GambleFi with its innovative blockchain-powered platform, Rollblock combines transparency, security, and unmatched versatility. The project’s recent milestones, including sports betting integration and strong tokenomics, have sparked excitement among crypto enthusiasts. With RBLK’s deflationary model and growing adoption, Rollblock is shaping up to be the top crypto pick for ambitious investors in 2025. Rollblock Leverages Ethereum To Offer Gamers Transparency Rollblock is a GambleFi protocol that offers over 7,000 casino games to players. The platform has now added sports betting, including soccer, the NBA, and the UFC. Rollblock accepts over twenty cryptocurrencies, including ETH. What sets Rollblock apart is its GambleFi platform which utilizes Ethereum blockchain technology and guarantees complete transparency and immutability of all transactions. Every wager made is permanent and cannot be reversed. The platform uses the $RBLK token for all transactions, services, and interactions. To expand its appeal, Rollblock plans to introduce at least a dozen new games in early 2025. This will complement its recently launched sports betting feature and attract a broader audience. The platform has been audited by SolidProof and licensed by Anjouan Gaming, ensuring top-tier transparency and security. Advanced security measures and AI technology protect all transactions. Rollblock’s ecosystem revolves around the RBLK token, which powers its play-to-earn model and revenue-sharing initiatives. The platform regularly buys back RBLK tokens from the market, burns a portion to maintain deflationary tokenomics, and allocates 40% of repurchased tokens as rewards for stakers. This approach incentivizes long-term engagement and strengthens the token’s value. Ethereum’s Price Continues To Fall Ethereum has dropped by 15.2% this week, settling at $3.390 after failing to turn the $4000 level into support. This price drop has left Ethereum searching for a solid support zone. Ethereum recently surged to $3.500 before retreating. This altcoin is now trading below the 100-hour simple moving average, which might be a resistance in the coming days. If the market continues its decline, the next key support level is around $2800. Attempts at a rally have faced strong resistance, highlighting the challenge of sustaining upward momentum. However, Ethereum has shown resilience in corrective phases, with whales making aggressive purchases during these times. Over the past five days, whales have bought 340,000 ETH, valued at over $1 billion. This whale activity reflects confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Their strategic accumulation suggests optimism about an impending market breakout. Crypto analysts believe this demand driven by whales indicates a significant price increase for Ethereum in the coming weeks. Solana’s Price Falls By 14% In 7 Days Solana has dropped by 12% this week, reaching $190. The coin recently slipped to sixth place in crypto rankings, with a market cap of $91.2 billion. Solana hit a new all-time high of $264 before experiencing significant selling pressure from whales at this level. This selling is not surprising, as major buyers from the 2021 cycle finally broke even after three years and chose to cash out. Analysts believe support for Solana at $200 should hold, offering hope for recovery. The falling wedge pattern on Solana’s chart is catching attention, as this pattern often signals a bullish move ahead. Sentiment remains positive, supported by consistent funding rates and Open Interest. Additional optimism stems from Grayscale’s Solana ETF filing, which has added to the excitement surrounding SOL’s potential price increase. Rollblock Set For 25X-100X Gains Market corrections offer unique chances to buy cryptocurrencies at lower prices during times of uncertainty. With Donald Trump preparing to take office in January, the current market conditions resemble December 2020—a period that led to massive gains during the subsequent bull run. RBLK, recently audited by SolidProof, is priced at just $0.043 in its ninth presale phase. Rollblock has become a top pick for investors looking for 25-100x returns in a booming sector.

Here’s the Most Exciting Presale You Can Join Today,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with new opportunities. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, has been making waves with its transition to proof-of-stake and expanding use cases in DeFi and NFTs. But as Ethereum solidifies its position as the go-to platform for decentralised applications, another name is stealing the limelight: Qubetics ($TICS) . Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s a revolutionary Web3 aggregator that’s designed to tackle the inefficiencies that projects like Ethereum have struggled to resolve. From a unique Decentralised VPN to bridging disparate blockchains, Qubetics is making big promises and delivering. Let’s dive into why Qubetics and Ethereum are the top altcoins to join today for exponential gains in 2025 , and how they stack up. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain Solutions Qubetics is making headlines for all the right reasons. Its presale is already in its 14th stage, raising over $7.8 million from more than 11,800 holders. With each $TICS token priced at $0.0377, it’s an opportunity that’s catching the attention of seasoned investors. Analysts are bullish, predicting a $0.25 price at presale close—a 564% ROI. Post-presale, the numbers skyrocket: $1 for a 2,555% ROI, $5 for 13,176%, and a jaw-dropping $15 after the mainnet launch, equating to a 39,729% return. Let’s do some maths. A $200,000 investment today at $0.0377 per token would bag you 5,305,039 $TICS. If Qubetics hits $15 after its mainnet launch, that investment could balloon to $79.57 million. It’s not just about numbers—it’s about timing and innovation.

Its transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake has slashed energy consumption and bolstered its green credentials. But the buzz doesn’t stop there. Ethereum ETFs are expected to roll out soon, opening doors for institutional investors. Analysts believe this could be a major catalyst for price growth, positioning Ethereum for new all-time highs in the coming years.

A small business in Rio de Janeiro could use Ethereum-based smart contracts to automate payments to vendors, saving time and eliminating middlemen. In the NFT space, Ethereum continues to dominate. Artists from all over South America are minting and selling digital artwork on Ethereum-powered marketplaces, proving that the blockchain’s appeal goes far beyond tech enthusiasts. Ethereum also plays a crucial role in cross-border payments. For families in Venezuela sending remittances, Ethereum-based stablecoins are a reliable and fast alternative to traditional banking systems. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List?

As part of the community holiday celebration called “BURNmas”, BonkDAO has unveiled an ambitious plan to burn 1.69 trillion Bonk ( BONK ) tokens, or $54.52 million. By decreasing the amount of BONK in circulation, this deliberate move seeks to make it more scarce and may affect its market dynamics. https://twitter.com/bonk_inu/status/1872061550871060745 Approximately 1.8% of BONK’s entire supply, which is now approximately 92.7 trillion tokens, will be burned. According to officials, BonkDAO will execute the burn through a multi-signature vote, emphasizing the project’s community-driven governance. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.0000330, with a market capitalization of $2.51 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $279.21 million. The token’s price has fluctuated ahead of the burn event, as investors speculate on the effects of reduced supply. BONK’s close ties to the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain and its ecosystem have often led to price increases when Solana experiences positive momentum. The upcoming burn could amplify these dynamics, positioning BONK for increased market attention from crypto investors. BONK Price Chart | Source: Crypto.news The last major BONK token burn occurred on July 9, 2024, when BonkDAO burned 84 billion BONK tokens, worth $2 million at the time. That event triggered a 25% price increase within a single day, showcasing the strong commitment of the community to maintaining a balance between supply and demand. You might also like: BONK leads meme coin rally with 25% surge amid token burn and whale activity Token burns are a common strategy in the cryptocurrency market to reduce supply and create scarcity. The basic economic principle of supply and demand suggests that when fewer tokens are available, the value of the remaining tokens may rise, provided demand stays the same or increases. While token burns often lead to short-term price increases, heightened trading activity, and greater investor interest, their long-term impact depends on the project’s utility and broader market conditions. With “BURNmas,” BonkDAO continues to innovate within the meme-token space, leveraging its vibrant community to drive growth and relevance. This event is a major milestone for BONK, further cementing its position as a cornerstone of the Solana ecosystem and one of the most dynamic meme tokens on the market.

Understanding SHIB: The Metaverse The new platform aims to transform the Shiba Inu ecosystem with community-centered developments and immersive experiences. Meanwhile, the metaverse project represents a crucial milestone in blockchain evolution. It allows participants to interact with a dynamic environment on the L2 platform Shibarium. Moreover, SHIB: The Metaverse provides personalized avatars, interactive experiences, and virtual land ownership. Lastly, the immersive experience aims to transform how users connect and build communities within the digital space, linking physical and digital realms.

Nevertheless, their transformative apps and sleek design triggered a revolution that changed how users interact and communicate. SHIB price outlook The dog-themed digital coin traded at $0.0002216, exhibiting bearishness after losing 4% of its value in the past 24 hours. Chart by Coinmarketcap . Shiba Inu’s outlook reflects broad market sentiments. Digital assets witness notable selling pressures, with the global cryptocurrency market cap down 1.10% in the past day to $3.39 trillion. In summary, SHIB: The Metaverse represents a vital milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Besides being a mere digital world, the platform is a massive experiment in virtual ownership. Moreover, the metaverse ecosystem positions SHIB for increased use cases, pivoting from its meme origins. That could translate to stable price actions for the meme token.

38131779,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633373,1735200588,Stocks and crypto see gains. Has the Santa Rally begun?,"The Santa Rally could have already started, and this year, it’s packing a punch. Every trader worth their salt knows about the magic week that starts on Christmas Eve and stretches to New Year’s Eve. It’s a golden time for the S&P 500, with an average return of 1.3%—a track record that’s hard to argue with. Monday alone saw the index jump by 1.1%, cruising back above the 6,000 mark. History has spoken, and it’s clear: December loves a good rally. Since 2009, only three years—2015, 2016, and 2023—failed to deliver gains during this festive window. Data from the Carson Group shows the rally often comes alive later in the month. And if you zoom out to December 15–31, the S&P 500 has posted a median return of 1.4% since 1950. The odds of back-to-back losses during this stretch are slim, happening only twice in the last 74 years. If the index pulls off another gain, it’ll keep its record of finishing this period higher 80% of the time intact. Equity inflows, options frenzy, and market optimism This year, markets are buzzing with more than just seasonal cheer. Over the past nine weeks, U.S. equity ETFs have sucked in $186 billion—more than twice the average inflow from the first half of 2024. It’s not just about numbers; it’s about appetite. Investors are going all-in, chasing record-high trading volumes . Daily options trading now averages 48 million contracts, with half of those being zero-day-to-expiration (0DTE) options. Last Friday was wild. A record $6.6 trillion worth of options contracts expired, fueling even more trading activity. Election years add an extra kick to the mix. Historically, the S&P 500 climbs an average of 3.7% between Election Day and year-end, finishing higher 67% of the time. This year? It’s already up 4.5% since November 5, blowing past that average and setting the stage for a bigger finale. Meanwhile, the S&P Risk Appetite Index is living its best life. It jumped another two points this month, hitting 41%—its highest level since April 2021. This is a massive surge from where it stood in August, up by a staggering 70% points. If sentiment were a stock, it’d be mooning right now. Crypto starts a comeback Crypto markets are riding the wave too. Bitcoin edged up 0.32% to $98,747 on Thursday, riding on news that MicroStrategy plans to issue more shares to buy even more Bitcoin. The company has been on a buying spree, adding $561 million worth of Bitcoin last week alone. That was the seventh straight week of accumulation. The rest of the crypto gang isn’t sitting idle. Ether , Solana, and even Dogecoin rebounded from midweek losses, riding on Bitcoin’s coattails. But traders are wary of what’s coming. Friday will see a record $43 billion in open interest expire on Deribit, including $13.95 billion in Bitcoin options and $3.77 billion in Ether options. That’s a lot of money on the line, and some are preparing for turbulence as market makers adjust their positions. Though many analysts think Bitcoin might reclaim $100k before January 1st.

38131757,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99360,1735200483,"Can Ethereum Reclaim $4,000? Key Indicators Point Upwards","Ethereum (ETH) price has dropped below multiple resistance following increased sell pressures. ETH price drop is linked to wider crypto outflows in the same time frame after Bitcoin slumped below the $100K mark. At press time, ETH trades at $3,392, a 1% gain in the last 24 hours and a huge 14% weekly decline. The drop below $3,500 sparked outflows and negative reactions from the community. However, this led to new trade positions and speculations among traders with few days to 2025. This month, Ethereum bulls market $5,000 as a price to end the year; while this looked high, a slight recovery can propel the asset in the coming days. Analyst Flags Bullish ETH Metrics Despite sell pressures, a new CryptoQuant report shows several green zone metrics for Ethereum. The asset’s funding rates are averagely positive. This becomes crucial to know the long-term sentiment in the ecosystem. Present funding rates show that the long position remains dominant on average. An extreme funding rate can spark huge liquidations in anticipation of future sell pressures. Secondly, Ethereum’s institutional fund holdings have grown in recent weeks. The move away from the narrative has ignited whales to make key accumulations, tipping a steady market inflow. Last week, ETH products bagged $51.3 million in inflows, with yearly figures soaring to $4.5 billion. Most consecutive institutional flows were on the back of its staking feature and projected altcoin rally. “ …the Korea Premium Index for Ethereum, which measures the price gap between South Korean exchanges and those in other regions, has not only turned positive but is also showing a substantial premium. This shift highlights the Korean market’s growing interest in Ethereum and bodes well for overall market sentiment,” the analysts added. Furthermore, Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio is still at its peak, signifying a further price jump despite the fact that it leaves room for risks. The metric shows institutional investors’ propensity to high leverage in the derivatives market. These factors have propelled speculations for a bull swing around the ecosystem. Similarly, a bull run for Bitcoin in January will lead to the altcoin season, a cycle marked by fund flows to Ethereum and other assets. While these factors point north, the asset has recorded sharp outflows in the last two days as bears grip the market.

38132721,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53159,1735200383,Cardano Faces 4.3 Billion ADA Sell Wall. Here’s the Significance,"Cardano (ADA) is encountering a significant obstacle on its path to recovering the $1 price level. On-chain data reveals a sell wall comprising 4.3 billion ADA, standing as a barrier to further price recovery. The data, sourced from IntoTheBlock’s Global In/Out of the Money indicator, highlights that these 4.3 billion ADA were purchased between $0.947 and $1.09, with an average cost of $1.03. This range, encompassing approximately 309,450 addresses, represents a zone of heavy selling pressure as these holders may seek to break even or minimize losses by selling at or near these levels. Such a substantial concentration of sellers creates resistance technically and psychologically as it coincides with a high-volume zone for Cardano (ADA). Until this sell wall is cleared, Cardano’s path toward sustaining a price above $1 may remain challenging. Cardano (ADA) Price Movements and Current Levels As of the latest data, ADA is trading at $0.919, reflecting a 13.99% decline over the past week. The broader cryptocurrency market has also witnessed a downturn, with Bitcoin experiencing its first weekly loss in several weeks—a trend that has similarly affected alternative cryptocurrencies, including ADA. Cardano is currently battling to maintain support near $0.86, a level close to its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Analysts warn that if this support fails, ADA could face further declines. The next significant support cluster lies between $0.659 and $0.834, where approximately 238,860 addresses had previously accumulated ADA. This zone may offer buying support and temporarily stabilize the price. However, if ADA fails to hold these levels, bearish momentum could push the cryptocurrency lower, with possible declines to $0.69 or even $0.50. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Breaking Above $1 and Potential Consolidation Despite current market uncertainties, a bullish scenario remains possible. A decisive move above $1 would indicate strong buying interest and could invalidate the short-term bearish outlook. In such a scenario, ADA’s price may consolidate between $0.80 and $1.20 before attempting to chart a course toward higher levels, including the $2 mark. According to crypto analyst Ali, Cardano’s price action closely mirrors patterns observed during its previous market cycle. He suggests if history repeats itself, ADA could reach a long-term target of $6. This optimistic projection reflects the potential for recovery and growth if the broader market sentiment improves. Cardano’s price action remains at a critical point, with bullish and bearish scenarios in play. The 4.3 billion ADA sell wall between $0.947 and $1.09 represents a significant resistance zone that may delay ADA’s recovery to $1. At the same time, strong support levels below $0.834 could help cushion the cryptocurrency from further declines.

Zeberg tells his 171,400 followers on the social media platform X that Solana ( SOL ) may be about to surge after a retracement. The analyst uses the Elliott Wave theory to forecast a massive run for Solana. The theory states that an asset tends to witness a five-wave rally with wave three being the longest and the strongest move up. “Altseason has begun and is now about to move into its most explosive phase. Solana has been leading after a strong wave two pullback. It should now begin its most powerful move up towards its final target.” Solana is trading at $196 at time of writing, down 5.5% in the last seven days. Zeberg also believes altcoins will now start outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ) during this phase of the market cycle. “Wave three in alts now beginning. Hold on!” The analyst predicts Bitcoin will head higher in the short term as 2025 kicks off. “BTC update! Just touched down on daily 50-day simple moving average. Still see this as a potential wave two in a rising wedge. It is my working hypothesis. We should see a nice rally into early January!” Bitcoin is trading for $98,871 at time of writing, flat on the day.

The market cap shows regained strength in altcoins, though Bitcoin still holds dominance. Analysts predict Altcoin Season could start in 2025, with Ethereum showing potential growth. The Altcoin Season Index (ASI) has increased to 48 as of December 26, 2024, marking an increase from the previous day. This uptick indicates that the market is in a neutral phase, between Bitcoin and altcoin season. Source: CoinMarketCap The ASI, which tracks the performance of the top 100 coins over the past 90 days, revealed that although the altcoins have gained leverage, Bitcoin continues to lead the market. Notably, the index has experienced several shifts over the last month. After reaching the peak at 52 earlier this month, it dropped drastically to 47 over the last week before recovering to 48 on December 26.

The Tron Network executive has driven several reactions from the community due to on-chain digital asset movements and partnerships to drive wider adoption. Ethereum continues sideways movement after its price correction alongside Bitcoin. Justin Sun Stress Long-term ETH Holdings In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Justin Sun quelled concerns about offloading part of his Ethereum holdings. Crypto enthusiasts flagged large amounts of ETH flowing from Sun’s wallet to HTX. Fund transfers included assets from Lido Finance and EtherFi, increasing the sale rumours. However, Sun noted that it wasn’t a sale but merely a transfer between wallets. Generally, transfers from other custodians to exchanges are characterized as potential sales due to the ease of transactions, while movements to other custodians signify long-term holdings. The transfer to HTX sparked these concerns, mounting the shift in sentiments. The Tron executive remains bullish on the second-largest cryptocurrency with previous asset movements. However, Sun has moved 108,919 ETH to HTX after the November polls. These inflows came from the price jump that followed Donald Trump’s victory. Bitcoin hit new highs above 90K, driving up other crypto assets. Although Ethereum didn’t hit an all-time high, the largest altcoin attracted huge inflows, taking the price above $4K. This led to some traders recouping gains as the wider market’s profit-taking surged. On the other hand, some traders want mega bullish on the asset, tipping a price surge above $5K to end the year. “ The rumors circulating online about us liquidating ETH are false. This is simply a transfer of ETH between our different wallets. We remain long-term bullish on the Ethereum ecosystem,” Justin Sun tweeted. What’s Next For ETH Price? The last few days have been bearish for ETH prices and other crypto assets. Total liquidation topped $2 billion, sparking doubts over more peaks in the bull cycle. Despite negative trading, hourly trading shows a resurgence of positive signals as many metrics remain green. Ethereum has posted slight gains in the last 24 hours, while other top altcoins have pulled larger numbers. A major reason for the drive in ETH remains institutional investor activities taking funds to a string of weekly inflows. Altcoin traders are still warned about a patch of sideways trading before a bull swing.",POSITIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trons-justin-sun-goes-mega-bullish-on-eth-denies-selloff-rumours/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
38131375,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398198,1735199956,Pudgy Penguins Crypto Scam: Google Ads Used to Steal Web3 Wallets!,"The post Pudgy Penguins Crypto Scam: Google Ads Used to Steal Web3 Wallets! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new and clever phishing scam has been uncovered, targeting users of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project through Google ads. But what makes this attack particularly alarming is the method behind it—attackers are using trusted ad networks to deceive Web3 wallet users. How safe are we really in an online world that seems increasingly vulnerable to such threats? Read on to discover how this scam works and why it could pose a serious risk to the crypto community. How the Scam Was Discovered According to ScamSniffer , the attack was uncovered after a user complained of being led to a fake Pudgy Penguins site through a Singapore news site. Subsequent research showed that this case is part of a malicious advertising campaign aimed at deceiving Web3 wallet users. The most worrying part of this attack is the use of Google Ad Network to spread phishing scripts. The ads, hosted on the Adloox tracking domain (.com), contain harmful code that targets Web3 wallets. How the Attack Works The malicious code scans users’ browsers for Web3 wallets. If one is found, the user is redirected to a fake Pudgy Penguins site—pudqypenguin[.]com—that is designed to steal wallet credentials. While the attack currently targets Pudgy Penguins users, it could easily be used to target other Web3 projects, making it a significant threat to the broader crypto community. The attack also reveals vulnerabilities in sites using Prebid.js , a popular header bidding library. If these sites use the Adloox analytics module, they risk running malicious scripts through their ads, which can lead to malware infections. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Joins SBI VC Trade to Secure DMM Bitcoin Users Post $320M Hack , How to Protect Yourself from Phishing As a result of this attack, experts are urging users to be extra cautious when interacting with Web3 platforms. To reduce the risk, it’s recommended to use ad blockers, access cryptocurrency-related websites in a separate browser, and always double-check URLs before entering wallet details. ScamSniffer is also a useful tool for detecting and preventing phishing attempts. Once the campaign was discovered, security researcher ZachXBT immediately alerted Adloox to the issue. As a result, the malicious JavaScript files in Adloox’s CDN were removed, preventing further damage to users. Thank you, @zachxbt , for helping to contact Adloox to resolve this issue. It appears the malicious code has been removed from the latest CDN JavaScript file. https://t.co/vTbamrHoOQ pic.twitter.com/ZHmNyoJpNG — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) December 26, 2024 .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The community dubbed ETH killer picked up gains in price and on-chain activity alongside other altcoins. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) continued to move sideways, losing strength in overall market dominance. SOL Price Soars 6% Solana’s price is up 6.1% in the last 72 hours alongside surging network activities boosting trading volumes. The asset trades at $194.59, soaring to a market cap above $93 billion. SOL bulls have also picked up new assets and are spotting positive on-chain factors. The new accumulation and offload to other custodians point to possible long-term holdings away from sell pressures. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance has fallen since it touched its all-time high above $107K. The top crypto’s outflows led to large losses, with traders losing positions. Bitcoin pulled its worst daily trading after the last bull peak on Dec 23, sliding 1.7%. From that point, altcoins have picked up 4.5% of the total BTC ratio, signaling signs of capital flow. This led to a surge in SOL price, an asset tipped to lead the altcoin season. Solana’s rising institutional demand is a major reason for the price gains above other top assets. Traditionally, SOL outpaces the market during bull seasons. Apart from its institutional flows, Solana’s decentralized finance activities continue its forward trajectory with soaring assets under management (AUM). Furthermore, Solana meme coins have attracted a buzz to the ecosystem from its Q1 frenzy to last month’s gains. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade wrote on X on SOL, completing a pullback. “ #Solana could potentially have completed the Pullback. $SOL has fallen onto a Supporting Confluence, which comprises of an Ascending Trendline and a horizontal level from a previous top. Early signs of price rejection and rebound have also been observed at the level, giving more confidence in completing the pullback.” Altcoins Records Significant Growth The market correction led to altcoin declines, wiping out gains recorded in November. The outcome of the US elections saw traders pitch a possible altcoin season at the start of 2025. Capital outflows from Bitcoin will characterize an altcoin season as compared to other crypto assets. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum rose 2%, while XRP regained 4% after sharp declines. Cardano and Tron increased 1%, respectively, while meme coins picked up slightly higher gains as traction builds in the ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solana-price-spikes-btc-dominance-slumps-how-close-is-the-altcoin-season/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

North Korean hackers stole 4,500 Bitcoins, worth about $320 million at the time. The attack severely impacted the company’s operations, and despite multiple efforts to recover the stolen funds, DMM Bitcoin was unable to restore the lost assets. This led the company to halt its business and focus on transferring customer accounts to a more secure platform. With the rise in hacking incidents, these events are raising concerns about the risks of investing in digital assets. Keep reading to know more. A Look at the Transition Plan In response to the breach and recovery challenges, DMM Bitcoin announced plans to shut down its operations and move all customer accounts and assets to SBI VC Trade, a crypto exchange owned by SBI Group. The transfer is expected to be completed by March 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO And Crypto Moguls Enjoy Billions in Wealth Growth After Trump’s Election , To make this transition smoother, SBI VC Trade partnered with Ripple, a trusted blockchain company, to ensure the safe transfer of DMM Bitcoin’s users and assets. Ripple’s involvement adds extra confidence, thanks to SBI’s long-standing partnership with the company and its reputation for secure digital asset management. DMM Bitcoin users will not need to open new accounts with SBI VC Trade, as their assets will be transferred directly. New Offerings to Enhance User Experience Along with the account transfer, SBI VC Trade plans to offer 14 new crypto products, focusing on security and stability. However, high-risk options like crypto-to-crypto trading pairs (e.g., ETH/BTC) and leveraged trading will not be included, ensuring that the offerings prioritize safer alternatives for users. Ripple’s Role in the Transfer DMM Bitcoin’s decision to work with SBI VC Trade and Ripple is a strategic move to restore customer trust and provide a safer environment for trading. With SBI VC Trade’s experience in handling account transfers, the process should be as seamless as possible for affected users. This incident highlights the urgent need for better security across cryptocurrency exchanges . The rising number of hacking incidents, particularly those linked to North Korean hackers , shows a deep understanding of system vulnerabilities and should serve as a warning for other crypto firms.

CEOs like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong and Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse experienced major financial gains after the election results. Armstrong, for example, earned an additional $129 million from stock sales, while Coinbase’s market value surged by $21 billion. Armstrong’s stake in Coinbase increased by nearly $2 billion, bringing its total value to $6.4 billion. Coinbase also made a notable political contribution, donating $74 million to various political action committees (PACs) to support the election. Armstrong’s stock sales were part of his diversification strategy, ensuring continued control over his company. Ripple’s Garlinghouse saw even more dramatic gains after the value of XRP, the company’s native token, soared from $0.50 to $2.32 post-election. This surge in XRP’s value led to a 54.7% increase in its market cap over the past 30 days, sending it to the third position among all digital assets. Garlinghouse also owns more than 6% of Ripple and a significant amount of XRP, which has now increased in value by over three times since the election. “The crypto market is up over $1 trillion since Trump won — that’s the price of Gensler’s foot on the neck of the market, and he’s not even officially gone yet,” Garlinghouse told Coindesk. Although Ripple Labs’ private valuation was last estimated at around $11 billion earlier this year, the election has likely increased the value of Garlinghouse’s stake, causing his personal wealth to soar. Additionally, major investors in crypto firms such as Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) also enjoyed major gains, outpacing their election-related investments. Ripple and A16Z each donated tens of millions to political causes, with Ripple contributing $73 million and A16Z $70 million.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-and-crypto-moguls-enjoy-billions-in-wealth-growth-after-trumps-election/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38130865,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53157,1735198443,Ripple CTO Sparks Debate On Possible XRP 10x Price Rally,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, recently ignited a lively discussion among XRP enthusiasts with a tweet referencing the phrase “10x times.” This came shortly after XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, saw a significant 13% price surge over the weekend. Ripple CTO Comments on “10x Times” Phrase Schwartz posted an image of a plastic can labeled “Pre-Mix Bubble Solution,” which advertised “10x times the bubbles.” Rather than focusing solely on the claim of a 10x increase, Schwartz highlighted the grammatical redundancy of the phrase. His tweet drew attention from the XRP community , prompting speculation about whether it was a subtle hint toward XRP’s price trajectory. In response, community members debated the implications of a potential 10x increase in XRP’s price. Some interpreted the tweet as a possible reference to XRP reaching $10, while others engaged in broader discussions about the token’s future performance. Ripple Moves 90 Million XRP in Major Transfers Over the weekend, the blockchain tracking platform Whale Alert reported two large XRP transfers conducted by Ripple. The transactions, totaling 90 million XRP, were valued at approximately $200 million. The first transfer involved 50 million XRP worth $111.7 million, while the second moved 40 million XRP valued at $89.7 million. Both transactions were executed within one minute, and the destination wallets for these transfers remain unidentified. In addition, Whale Alert documented other significant XRP transactions totaling 182 million XRP with an aggregate fiat value of $411 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Highlights Key Levels for XRP Price Movement Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez recently identified $2.20 as a critical price level for XRP. Posting on his X account, Martinez suggested that XRP could consolidate at this level before attempting a move toward the next resistance at $2.70. However, the analyst also warned that a failure to maintain support at $2.20 could result in a decline to $1.96. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.24, showing minimal price movement after its recent rally. XRP’s Recent Price Fluctuations Last week, XRP experienced a sharp decline, losing over 20% of its value. The token fell from $2.71 to $1.96 before recovering over the weekend to its current price of $2.26. This volatility has kept traders and analysts closely watching the market for further developments. As discussions about XRP’s potential continue to unfold, Schwartz’s tweet and Ripple’s significant token transfers have added fuel to the speculation surrounding the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Whether XRP can achieve the speculated 10x growth remains uncertain, but the community remains actively engaged in analyzing the token’s performance.

38132307,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322750,1735198376,"Bitcoin Price Holds Steady Near $98,000 as Russia Embraces BTC for Trade and MicroStrategy Expands Holdings","Bitcoin is increasingly gaining traction as a tool for international trade in Russia. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed that the country is using Bitcoin and digital financial assets (DFAs) under an experimental legal framework. These developments come as Russia looks to mitigate reliance on traditional currencies amid geopolitical shifts. Siluanov emphasized Bitcoin’s role in “creative settlements,” positioning it as a viable alternative to the US dollar. According to Reuters, Russia's finance minister said on Wednesday that Russian legislation has changed to allow companies to use Bitcoin and other digital currencies in international payments and take steps to legalize the mining of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 25, 2024 This adoption follows Russia’s plans to expand domestic Bitcoin mining and increase its use in sovereign-level transactions throughout 2024. While Siluanov cautioned against cryptocurrency investments due to their speculative nature, the integration of Bitcoin into international trade bolsters its utility and demand. This strategic move is expected to positively influence Bitcoin prices, particularly as geopolitical uncertainties persist. MicroStrategy Fuels Bitcoin Rally with Aggressive Accumulation MicroStrategy, already renowned as a key institutional player in Bitcoin investment, announced plans to issue additional shares to expand its cryptocurrency holdings. This follows its purchase of $561 million worth of Bitcoin, marking its seventh consecutive acquisition week. Currently trading at $98,117, Bitcoin saw a slight bump of 0.32% following the announcement, showcasing the market’s bullish sentiment. Bitcoin rose on Thursday after the digital asset’s stockpiler MicroStrategy announced a plan to issue more shares, a move that would allow it to buy even more tokens https://t.co/KOz4tc4d28 — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) December 26, 2024 MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings reinforce institutional confidence in digital assets, providing a layer of stability amid market volatility. With Bitcoin’s annual growth surpassing 135%, outperforming traditional assets like gold and global equities, institutional purchases like these are likely to sustain long-term price momentum. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Promotes Blockchain Adoption Ripple introduced the RLUSD stablecoin on Singapore’s Independent Reserve exchange, marking its debut in the region. The stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, aims to streamline cross-border transactions and enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Supported by USD reserves under strict New York financial regulations, RLUSD integrates with Ethereum and XRP Ledger networks. While primarily focused on stablecoins, Ripple’s innovation indirectly boosts the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, including Bitcoin, by fostering institutional and retail interest in blockchain-based financial solutions. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Consolidation with Bullish Potential Bitcoin is stabilizing after completing a 50% Fibonacci retracement from its recent low of $92,126 to its high of $108,400. Trading at $98,117, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $102,207. A breakout could target subsequent resistance levels at $104,954 and $108,400. Conversely, failure to hold the $100,293 pivot may lead to a pullback toward $95,717, with further downside risk at $92,139. Technical indicators suggest neutral to bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 57.39 signals moderate buying interest, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $97,427 offers robust support. Traders should watch for a decisive move above $102,207 to confirm an upward trend. Key Takeaways: Russia’s Bitcoin adoption for trade highlights its growing utility in global transactions. MicroStrategy’s continued accumulation reinforces institutional confidence and long-term price support. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch expands blockchain adoption, indirectly supporting Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Bitcoin’s broader integration across trade, institutional holdings, and blockchain innovations underscores its position as a transformative global asset.

Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, has seen a remarkable presale success, raising over $5.34 million in a short period. This layer-two solution for the Solana blockchain promises to solve scalability issues by providing zero congestion, errors, and delays — addressing the ongoing congestion Solana has faced.

Crypto traders are pointing to Avalanche ( AVAX ) and Toncoin ( TON ) as these two solid crypto projects are showing signs of recovery. While optimism surrounding AVAX and TON is strong, investors look further for projects with immediate upside potential. Right now, these crypto traders have set their sights on Rollblock’s presale , as it has accumulated over $7.6 million within a short period. This highlights Rollblock’s explosive growth potential, as it captures attention most tokens can only dream of in the crypto space. Let’s investigate why the Rollblock presale is stealing the spotlight as AVAX and TON gear up for their next move. Rollblock presale hits stage 9: Large investors flock in with more gains ahead Rollblock’s ICO launch is making waves in the crypto market, with its new GambleFi protocol attracting significant whale investment. Unsurprisingly, Rollblock is delivering the goods by bringing two coveted values, trust and transparency, into the iGambling sectors. With its innovation on the reliable Ethereum chain, Rollblock is redefining the way online gambling is perceived while ensuring a top-notch gaming experience. This is the game-changer punters have been searching for! Rollblock uses its Ethereum-backed security protocol to ensure that there are no data breaches. Even better, Rollblock ensures that all 7,000 gaming titles on its crypto casino are regulated and audited by top providers like Gaming Anjouan and SolidProof, providing an additional layer of security. Rollblock also appeals to AVAX and TON investors with its unique revenue-sharing model. As part of this system, Rollblock distributes up to 30% of its casino profits. Holders receive the first 40% of this allocation through staking rewards, while the remaining 60% is used for token buybacks that are burned immediately, taking its price to new heights. AVAX price to surge 50% as positive news builds momentum towards $60 The AVAX price has only found new lows since it touched down on its yearly high of $62.38 in March. At one point in the AVAX price decline, it lost 120% as it found a support level at $20. However, based on positive news on the synthetic dollar deUSD coming to Avalanche in collaboration with Securitize, the AVAX price has entered a recovery phase as it trades in the $35 consolidation range. From all indications, the AVAX price is steadily climbing toward its yearly high after its recent breakthrough above a major resistance level. Toncoin to soar amid prolonged range bound price movements The Toncoin’s recent price action has been volatile, with sharp fluctuations in support and resistance levels. Moreover, TON has undergone a 65% slump after reaching its all-time high of $8.25 in June. Several crypto analysts believe that TON is on track to bounce back after briefly falling below $5. These experts see an inverted heads and shoulders on TON’s price charts, suggesting a positive slow and steady trend reversal. When it comes to this move, savvy investors are still cautious not to jump in when the move is still in its early phase. Conclusion Despite AVAX and TON’s signs of market bullishness, Rollblock presale is undoubtedly the highlight of the current market opportunity for traders seeking immediate profit and long-term value. Interestingly, the Rollblock presale is live and active at $0.043. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

38130384,https://coinpaper.com/6718/market-momentum-builds-as-bitcoin-reserves-decline-on-binance,1735198100,Market Momentum Builds as Bitcoin Reserves Decline on Binance,"Analysts now predict that Bitcoin could climb to $187,500 in the coming months. On the other hand, Ethereum shows signs of outperforming Bitcoin in 2025 due to a potential breakout in the ETH/BTC ratio and increasing inflows into ETH-based ETFs. Adding to Bitcoin’s momentum, Israel is launching six Bitcoin-tracking funds next week, and Russia is embracing Bitcoin for global trade as part of its efforts to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Binance Reserves Signal Investor Confidence in Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) reserves on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, have dropped to levels not seen since January of 2024, right before a 90% surge in Bitcoin’s price by March. Bitcoin currently trades close to $98,160, and some analysts suggest that a similar trajectory could see its price reaching $187,500 in the coming months. The decline in reserves dipped below 570,000 BTC according to CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost , and it is considered to be a bullish signal because investors typically move Bitcoin into cold storage during periods of long-term confidence. Binance Bitcoin exchange reserve (Source: CryptoQuant ) This trend is very similar to early 2024 when Binance’s reserves also plummeted before Bitcoin’s price surged to a then all-time high of $73,679 on March 13. According to Darkfost, withdrawals from exchanges often signal positive momentum building in the market, and current conditions align with this historical pattern. Despite this, Bitcoin’s dominance stands at 58.40%, just shy of the critical 60% level, which analysts like Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen believe could trigger a rotation toward other crypto assets. Cowen predicted Bitcoin dominance will reach 60% by December, a milestone it last achieved on Oct. 30. Bitcoin faced some challenges holding above the psychological $100,000 level since first breaking it on Dec. 5. The price stayed below this mark since Dec. 19, after reaching a new high of $108,300 on Dec. 17. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, predicts that Bitcoin’s price could surpass $105,000 once liquidity returns after the holiday season. He believes the current downtrend is due to typical holiday illiquidity and expects increased market activity post-Christmas. For this week, Lee predicted that Bitcoin will likely trade within the $94,000 to $105,000 range. Israel to Launch Six Bitcoin Funds Bitcoin’s price could also receive a nice boost from the launch of six Bitcoin-tracking funds next week in Israel after the approval by the Israel Securities Authority. These funds will be available for purchase at banks and investment firms from Dec. 31, and will mirror Bitcoin's price movements by using various indexes and strategies. Among the funds, some will track U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), while one will be actively managed to outperform Bitcoin’s performance. The funds will also be managed by leading Israeli firms like Phoenix Investment, IBI-Kessem, Meitav, More, Ayalon, and Migdal, and will charge management fees ranging from 0.25% to 1.5%. The regulatory approval came after two years of requests from asset managers asking for local investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin using Israel’s fiat currency, the shekel. Transactions will initially be processed once daily, and will reflect Bitcoin’s price at the time of execution. Eyal Haim, vice president of Ayalon Mutual Funds, shared that their investment house wanted to engage with the digital currency sector for a long time now by offering mutual funds tied to companies in the field. Since May, Israel also made strides in progressing on its central bank digital currency initiative, the Digital Shekel Challenge . This project plans to encourage innovation by encouraging participants to develop real-time payment systems by using the digital shekel. The Bank of Israel offers a sandbox environment for testing. A key objective of the digital shekel initiative is to increase competition among local banks. While the project has received public support, there are still some concerns about privacy. Russia Embraces Bitcoin for Global Trade Russia is advancing its use of digital financial assets (DFAs), including Bitcoin, in foreign trade as part of its strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov shared these developments in a recent interview on Russia-24, and revealed that legislation has been passed to allow these transactions under an experimental legal framework that was established in September of 2024. According to Siluanov, the adoption of DFAs, like Bitcoin, offers a modern and innovative approach to international settlements. He even described it as a vision for the future of global trade. According to the finance minister, Russia already initiated foreign trade transactions using DFAs and plans to scale these efforts in the coming year. Siluanov also pointed out that Bitcoin mined in the country could be used in these transactions. This shift is made possible by Russia’s legalization of Bitcoin mining earlier in the year, which paved the way for its use in regulated trade operations. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov Despite advocating for the use of digital assets in trade, Siluanov still maintained a more cautious stance on cryptocurrency investments. In November, he warned against speculative investment in cryptocurrencies due to their volatility and the risks involved. Russia’s experimentation with DFAs builds on its earlier efforts to regulate digital assets. The country officially recognized Bitcoin as a digital financial asset in 2021 under the ”On Digital Financial Assets” law, which granted it legal status while restricting its use as a payment method in the nation. Ether Gears Up to Outpace Bitcoin in 2025 Despite these developments, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of outperforming Bitcoin as 2025 approaches, according to crypto analysts. The ETH/BTC ratio , which is currently close to 0.0356, has attracted a lot of attention. MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe suggested it could break above 0.04 in January 2025. The last time this level was reached was on Dec. 8, when ETH’s price climbed just above $4,000. Van de Poppe expects increased inflows into Ether, potentially accompanied by outflows from Bitcoin. This could lead to Bitcoin price consolidation and trigger an “altcoin run.” Supporting this outlook, Ethereum-based tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mantle (MNT) recently saw impressive gains after recently rising by 7+% and 3+%, respectively. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still trading below $100,000 after first breaching the six-figure mark on Dec. 5. Analysts also pointed out the growing potential of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Nate Geraci , president of ETF Store, shared that net inflows into ETH ETFs are keeping pace with gold ETFs and are expected to accelerate. Similarly, pseudonymous trader Brent described Ethereum as an undervalued asset, and also compared its potential to a submerged ball ready to surge upward. This optimism aligns with earlier views that Ethereum’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin may be concluding. Benjamin Cowen , founder of Into The Cryptoverse, stated in early December that the ETH/BTC collapse appears to be over, and predicted a stronger performance for Ethereum over the next 6 to 12 months. These factors all point to a promising start to 2025 for Ether.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6718/market-momentum-builds-as-bitcoin-reserves-decline-on-binance,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Not long after, Chen stated that someone launched a meme coin named after his daughter on the Solana network to help raise money for the brain tumor research. uh so some random guy 20 minutes made a SOL memecoin called $MIRA to help with research fundraising and sent me half the entire supply and it's now worth like $400K and i literally don't know what to do because i certainly don't want to rug a bunch of random people https://t.co/P78bLq52fB — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 26, 2024 You might also like: New Binance listings ‘god candle’ led by ACT and PNUT The token developer sent Chen half of its entire supply, which is worth $400,000 at the time. Though, he expressed he was hesitant in selling the tokens because he does not want to rug pull the people who invested in the meme coin. Despite people in the comments saying they donated their funds to MIRA willingly. In the end, Chen declared that he plans to sell 10% of the supply and use 5% of the tokens for Hankinson Lab research, which is worth $49,263. He intends to hold onto the other 5%, adding that he will not be selling more than that without a 24-hour prior notice. He also clarifies that all proceeds will go to funding research for the rare brain tumor at Hankinson Lab and that his family will not receive a single cent from the token. “I just want to say that whoever said crypto has no legitimate use cases, you can tell them that funding for rare disease research is a pretty legitimate use case,” said Chen.

The South Korean government has announced sanctions on the 313 Bureau, a North Korean cyber unit involved in widespread crypto theft. In a Dec. 26 public statement , the government noted that the bureau, which operates under the North Korean Ministry of National Defense, has been linked to numerous cyberattacks aimed at stealing digital assets from around the world. South Korean officials cite data by U.S. blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, which claims that North Korea is responsible for more than 60% of global crypto theft in 2024, totaling a record $1.3 billion. These stolen funds are believed to be funneled into North Korea’s weapons programs, including its missile and nuclear development initiatives. In addition to targeting the 313 Bureau, the sanctions also cover 15 North Korean IT personnel and one related institution. The South Korean government says these individuals and organizations are accused of engaging in foreign currency-earning activities abroad, which directly contribute to the regime’s nuclear and missile programs. “In particular, North Korean IT personnel, working under the Ministry of National Defense and other regime-affiliated organizations, are dispatched to countries in China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa.” South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs You might also like: US shuts down North Korean crypto laundering network The move comes just three days after crypto.news reported that the United States and South Korea are working together to create new mechanisms to prevent crypto thefts linked to North Korea. The two countries have reportedly signed an agreement to jointly create technologies to stop crypto thefts. While details remain unclear, South Korea’s science ministry will also support the initiative through 2026. It is understood that researchers from both countries, including experts from Korea University and RAND Corp., will focus on tracking stolen crypto and preventing attacks. They will also investigate how criminals launder stolen funds into crypto using methods like ransomware.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-fuks-santa-muskfsan-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-bonk-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The sanctioned individuals are reportedly linked to Bureau 313, an organization under the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Machine-Building Industry Department, which oversees weapons production and ballistic missile programs. The department has been under UN sanctions since 2016, according to a statement from South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. North Korean IT Professionals Seek to Secure Contracts with Global IT Firms The Ministry revealed that North Korean IT professionals, often deployed to countries like China, Russia, and Southeast Asia, work undercover to secure contracts with global IT firms. Some of these individuals are involved in information theft and cyberattacks. Among the sanctioned individuals, Kim Cheol-min was identified for infiltrating IT companies in the U.S. and Canada, transferring substantial funds to Pyongyang. South Korea also sanctioned a North Korean entity responsible for sending IT personnel abroad and remitting significant amounts of foreign currency to support the regime and its military activities. The move follows increasing evidence of North Korean involvement in major cryptocurrency hacks.

According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion worth of cryptocurrency across 47 incidents in 2024, representing 61% of global crypto theft for the year. The report noted the increased sophistication of North Korean IT workers, who use tactics such as false identities, third-party hiring intermediaries, and remote work opportunities to infiltrate crypto and Web3 companies. South Korea’s Crypto Investors Cross 15 Million As reported, South Korea’s cryptocurrency investors crossed 15 million in November. According to figures submitted by the Bank of Korea, 15.59 million South Koreans held accounts on the nation’s top five cryptocurrency exchanges by the end of November. Deposits in crypto exchanges also doubled, rising from 4.7 trillion won ($3.2 billion) in October to 8.8 trillion won ($6.03 billion) in November. The growing adoption of digital assets in South Korea comes as a recent survey revealed that most young South Koreans are losing faith in the national pension system , with many stating they see crypto and stocks as a better alternative. The study found that more than three-quarters of people aged 20-39 “don’t trust” state-issued pensions. Over half of respondents who said they were making their own pension plans claimed they were building their retirement funds with stocks and crypto.

As reported by a Japanese media outlet, the government of Japan, on Dec. 20, released its official answer to several queries Senator Satoshi Hamada put forward concerning the adoption of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as part of Japan’s foreign exchange reserves. Under the name of Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru, the statement explained that, at present, Japan has no intention of considering cryptocurrency reserves.

The government responded that it does not have enough knowledge about global movements in that respect and said that discussions on the adoption of cryptocurrencies for reserves are in very preliminary stages. That is, the government has said it would be “difficult to express a view” on this at this point. The response also mentioned that, under Japan’s legal system for special account management, cryptocurrencies such as BTC do not fall under the category of foreign exchange assets. Moreover, a “crypto asset” is not regarded as a “security” pursuant to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act under Japanese law . The Payment Services Act provides the definition of “crypto assets” and requires any provider of crypto-asset exchange service (CAES) to register with the Financial Services Agency. Operating CAES without registration entails criminal penalties, says Anderson Mori & Tomotsune, a full-service law firm in Japan.

However, it was stopped there and pushed south by a few grand amid reports of a growing number of investors realizing profits. What Needs to Change The analytics company Santiment has frequently reasserted the importance of the overall crowd expectations for the underlying asset’s prices. But, what happens is usually the opposite of the general anticipation. The developments in the past 48 hours have only solidified their theory. BTC’s price went from around $94,000 on Christmas Eve to just shy of $100,000 yesterday evening, but its rally was halted at that point, and the asset is back to $98,000 now. Santiment indicated that “traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculations of $110K getting rampant.” Although this might sound bullish for bitcoin at first, the company reaffirmed its belief that the cryptocurrency tends to oppose what the majority expects by saying, “Historically, we will see $100K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn’t expect it.” ‍ Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance.

He noted that 1.51 million wallets have spent nearly $150 billion to turn that level into support now. Usually, when new investors see their positions go into red, they tend to start panic selling, which is why it’s important for BTC to remain above $97,300.

Fast forward to today, and we see a strikingly similar scenario in the world of cryptocurrency. BTFD Coin presents an incredible chance for those looking to multiply their gains. With a presale price of just $0.000064, investors can secure a jaw-dropping 837.5% return when BTFD Coin lists at $0.0006. Don’t forget to use the bonus code BIG50 for an extra 50% discount on your purchase! Meme coins have skyrocketed in popularity over the years, captivating both seasoned investors and newbies alike. BTFD Coin is ready to take this phenomenon to the next level. With its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) game , a stellar referral program, and enticing staking rewards, BTFD Coin is poised to tap into the vibrant community that fuels meme coin success. It’s not just about the laughs; it’s about real opportunities to engage and earn. The buzz around BTFD Coin’s presale is palpable, with over $4.5 million raised in just a few weeks. As we dive into the details of BTFD Coin and compare it with other emerging players like Fartcoin and Gigachad, it’s clear that BTFD is not just another meme coin; it’s a serious contender in the market. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin stands out as one of the top meme coin presales to buy now. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star of Meme Coins BTFD Coin is making waves in the cryptocurrency ocean, and for good reason. The presale has gone remarkably well, hitting over $4.5 million in just a month. With 59 billion coins sold and more than 6,600 holders, the community is already buzzing about the potential for massive returns. The current presale price of $0.000064, available due to a significant 50% discount, is hard to ignore. Investors can leverage the presale stage to buy in at this discount before the anticipated price jump to $0.0006 upon listing. What does this mean in practical terms? If you invest $40,000 at the current price, you’d snag a whopping 625 million BTFD coins. When the coin hits the expected listing price, that investment could balloon to $375,000! That’s a staggering 837.5% return on your investment, making it one of the top meme coin presales to buy now. But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin is designed with community engagement in mind. Through its P2E game, users can earn while having fun, and the referral program incentivises spreading the word. The staking rewards offer passive income opportunities, creating a well-rounded investment strategy that resonates with both casual and serious investors. Don’t forget the bonus code BIG50! This code grants you an additional 50% discount when you buy. It’s a smart move to use this code while you can, as it amplifies your purchasing power during the presale. The excitement around BTFD Coin is infectious, and being part of its journey could be one of the best decisions you make this year. Fartcoin: A Meme Coin with a Twist Next up is Fartcoin, a project that’s garnered attention for its quirky branding and community-driven initiatives. While Fartcoin may not have the same financial clout as BTFD, it’s certainly carving out a niche in the meme coin arena. The project has a playful approach, appealing to those who love to embrace the lighter side of cryptocurrency. Fartcoin has been gaining traction, especially among younger investors who appreciate its humorous take on the crypto landscape. The project leverages social media and community events to rally support and boost visibility. Although it pales in comparison to BTFD’s presale success, Fartcoin still has a loyal following ready to ride the wave of its growth. However, the critical distinction lies in the utility and structure of Fartcoin. Unlike BTFD, which boasts a robust P2E game and staking rewards, Fartcoin primarily thrives on its meme culture. This could limit its long-term potential, especially as investors increasingly seek coins that offer tangible benefits beyond just a laugh. As meme coins continue to rise and fall, Fartcoin’s success will hinge on its ability to maintain community engagement and find innovative ways to enhance its value proposition. For now, it’s a fun project but may not be the top choice for those looking to invest seriously. If you want solid returns, BTFD Coin remains the top meme coin presale to buy now. Gigachad: The Heavyweight Contender Enter Gigachad, another name that’s been making headlines in the meme coin sphere. With a focus on building a community around strength and empowerment, Gigachad has attracted a dedicated fan base. Its branding is sharp, and its community initiatives are designed to foster loyalty and engagement. Gigachad has also embraced the meme culture, using humour and relatability to connect with potential investors. The project has received attention for its unique approach, and it’s doing well in the presale arena. However, when compared to BTFD Coin, the differences become apparent. While Gigachad is gaining traction, it lacks the comprehensive ecosystem that BTFD Coin offers. The P2E game, staking options, and rewarding referral programme set BTFD apart as the more enticing option for investors. Gigachad may be fun, but it’s BTFD’s real-world utility that could lead to substantial returns. Investors looking for the top meme coin presales to buy now should consider what each project brings to the table. Gigachad’s community-driven approach is commendable, but when it comes to potential returns and innovative features, BTFD Coin is the clear winner. How to Buy BTFD Coin Go to the Presale Page Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50, and click “Apply”. Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as a beacon of opportunity in the meme coin landscape. With its presale success, innovative features, and a vibrant community, it’s hard to ignore the potential for massive returns. The current presale price of $0.000064, along with the 50% discount from the BIG50 bonus code, makes this an unmissable chance. As the presale progresses, more investors are joining the movement, and the excitement is palpable. With $4.5 million raised and counting, BTFD Coin’s trajectory is set for success. If you’re serious about finding the top meme coin presales to buy now, look no further than BTFD Coin. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your future in the crypto world. Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity to invest in a project that’s poised for greatness!

38130861,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53150,1735197047,Analyst Says It’s Biggest Mistake to Ignore XRP This Bull Run,"A prominent market analyst has warned that failing to include XRP in a portfolio during the ongoing bull run may be one of investors’ most significant missed opportunities. Crypto Vilian, a well-known chartist and Cambridge graduate, recently analyzed XRP’s historical price action. In a detailed post on X, he highlighted the asset’s current price movements and compared them to its performance during the late 2017 bull run. XRP’s Market Behavior Mirrors 2017 Patterns Crypto Vilian’s analysis identified similarities between XRP’s current trajectory and its historical pattern that led to its all-time high in early 2018. The market structure outlined in his chart illustrates a sequence of phases: a prolonged bearish decline, a gradual recovery, and a consolidation period. These phases were followed by a significant breakout that propelled XRP to its peak price. According to his findings, XRP appears to follow a similar structure over the past seven years. After breaking out of a long-term bearish trend, the asset has recently entered a recovery and consolidation phase. This pattern and the notable breakout in recent months suggest that XRP could be preparing for another upward surge. Crypto Vilian posited that this breakout, if realized, could push XRP to new all-time highs, potentially replicating the explosive gains seen in the 2017/2018 cycle. Based on his projections, XRP might even surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization during this bull run, equating to a price of over $17. One of the Biggest Mistakes The possibility of a trillion-dollar valuation has sparked widespread attention within the crypto community. Xoom, another respected market commentator, underscored the importance of holding XRP during this cycle. He warned that ignoring the asset now could represent a significant misstep for investors aiming to capitalize on the bull market’s potential. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.24, having declined by approximately 10.51% over the past week due to broader market trends dominated by Bitcoin’s recent downturn. Despite this, the asset remains one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the cycle, having reached a seven-year high of $2.90 three weeks ago. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Levels and Caution for Investors Although Crypto Vilian’s analysis presents an optimistic outlook, he stressed that XRP’s performance is closely tied to Bitcoin’s trajectory. A bullish Bitcoin market could propel altcoins, including XRP, to new highs, while a bearish trend might dampen their growth. The analyst identified potential price levels for XRP between $8 and $13, which he considers pivotal targets. The asset could see further gains if these levels are exceeded, reaching the technical target associated with a contracting triangle Elliott wave pattern. Such a move would imply nearly 100x growth from XRP’s lows of $0.30. However, Crypto Vilian cautioned investors against aiming to sell at the exact market top. Instead, he recommended taking profits at key levels during the upward trajectory. “After all, no one went broke taking profits early,” he remarked. As XRP continues to trade within a consolidation phase, market analysts are keeping a close eye on its potential for explosive growth.

38130557,https://invezz.com/?p=2405142,1735196647,Why iDEGEN’s AI-driven rise outpaces XRP in 2025’s crypto race,"The cryptocurrency market continues its roller-coaster ride, with AI-driven tokens emerging as a dynamic force. Among these, iDEGEN has positioned itself as a game-changer in the AI-based memecoin sector, where its innovative auction presale mechanism redefines market engagement. With growing popularity in the US and UK, iDEGEN is drawing comparisons to established tokens like XRP, which is currently priced at $2.25. Despite XRP’s steady market presence, iDEGEN’s unique model and viral adoption provide compelling reasons for its superior positioning in 2025. iDEGEN’s innovation against XRP’s stability iDEGEN operates on an adaptive auction model where token prices fluctuate every five minutes based on demand. This mechanism has fuelled a total raised amount of $9.18 million, signalling strong market interest before the token even reaches exchanges. By contrast, XRP, trading at $2.25 with a $128.84 billion market cap, has displayed stability through whale accumulation and subdued selling pressure. Despite this, XRP’s recent failure to break past the $3.00 resistance and subsequent triangle consolidation pattern highlights a more cautious growth trajectory. Regarding market activity, iDEGEN thrives on volatility, driving enthusiasm among traders. Its price-adjustment strategy, moving up or down by 5% based on buying momentum, makes it a magnet for speculative investments. XRP, while offering resilience with its investor hold rates and accumulation trends, lacks this level of engagement. For risk-tolerant traders, iDEGEN presents an avenue to ride the volatility wave, while XRP’s appeal remains with long-term holders banking on potential ETF launches or favourable regulatory changes. Why iDEGEN outshines XRP in 2025’s altcoin landscape iDEGEN’s standout feature is its dynamic AI integration, which evolves in real-time. Initially modelled to interact with crypto Twitter, iDEGEN’s AI now engages directly with traders and influencers, creating an ever-expanding network effect. Future updates, including Telegram integration and automated video AI capabilities, promise to amplify its viral appeal. This progressive roadmap has already led to the token trending across social platforms, marking it as a cultural phenomenon in the crypto space. XRP, on the other hand, is primarily driven by macroeconomic catalysts such as potential regulatory clarity and the expectation of an ETF approval. While these factors maintain its relevance, they lack the innovative edge iDEGEN brings to the table. Furthermore, XRP’s technical indicators show mixed signals, with its RSI slightly bullish and stochastic oscillator nearing a crossover. This momentum contrasts sharply with iDEGEN’s aggressive market ascent. Another key difference lies in accessibility and adaptability. iDEGEN’s auction presale ensures equitable price discovery, whereas XRP’s centralised Ripple Labs backing limits its flexibility. This decentralised ethos gives iDEGEN an edge in appealing to the broader crypto community, aligning with the sector’s decentralised finance ideals.

38129572,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398159,1735196544,Grayscale XRP Trust Ends 2024 with Over 300% Gains,"The post Grayscale XRP Trust Ends 2024 with Over 300% Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As 2024 comes to a close, the Grayscale XRP Trust has emerged as one of the hottest topics in the cryptocurrency world. With a stunning 300% growth, the trust’s performance is catching the eye of investors everywhere. What a year it has been for XRP, especially! This is a story of how XRP overcame challenges, sparked investor excitement, and set the stage for even bigger things in 2025. What’s Driving the Surge? September Relaunch Since its relaunch in September 2024, the Grayscale XRP Trust has seen a dramatic increase in its share price. Starting at $10.85 per share, it has now surged to $45.46, offering significant returns for early investors. This rise mirrors XRP’s strong performance, which has been fueled by a wave of optimism in the crypto market. The Trump Effect A key factor behind XRP’s recent surge is the pro-crypto sentiment sparked by Donald Trump’s election victory. His promises to support the crypto industry have reignited investor enthusiasm, fueling a bullish run for XRP. Regulatory Clarity Another important factor boosting XRP’s performance is the clearing of regulatory hurdles. After years of legal challenges with the SEC, XRP scored a partial victory in July 2023. With the potential for further legal clarity, investors are growing more confident about the asset’s future. Is An XRP ETF Coming? One of the most exciting developments for XRP is the growing speculation around the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts believe that if XRP ETFs are approved, they could attract billions in investment, further strengthening the asset’s position in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For December 26 , Influential crypto figure Ben Armstrong, also known as Bitboy, recently pointed to the Grayscale XRP Trust’s impressive gains as a catalyst for speeding up ETF approvals.

Institutional Interest Grows for XRP The success of the Grayscale XRP Trust has sparked discussions about increased institutional interest in XRP. If s pot XRP ETFs are approved , the asset could see a surge in institutional investments, pushing its value even higher. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a heartfelt post, Chen shared that his daughter, Mira, was diagnosed with a rare and challenging brain tumor called craniopharyngioma on September 23rd. Despite the lack of a definitive cure for this condition, Chen and his team of researchers have been working tirelessly to support Dr. Hankinson’s lab in identifying promising new drugs to treat Mira’s tumor. Chen’s Christmas Eve post was a plea for help, asking his followers to support Dr. Hankinson’s groundbreaking research. “If not with funds, I would be just as grateful for a repost or a like on this thread,” he wrote. if you could press a button that cures your child’s brain tumor in exchange for ending your life immediately, every parent would hesitate for zero seconds before fighting to be the first to press it the cruelest thing is that no such button exists. but there is always a move pic.twitter.com/mlAbmeOpvx — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 25, 2024 In a remarkable turn of events, just three hours after his post, Siqi shared that the campaign had already raised $75,000, nearing the goal of $100,000. Overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, Chen expressed his gratitude, writing, “Yi and I are in tears. We are so grateful to all of you.” To further encourage donations, Siqi and his family decided to personally match every dollar raised beyond the $75K mark, up to a total of $100,000. This means that if the campaign reaches $200,000, Hankinson Lab will receive at least $300,000, which could be a game changer for research into craniopharyngiomas. going to take the family out for christmas dinner hope this is worth at least $1.80 when i get back pic.twitter.com/41rp8D2jig — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 26, 2024 However, the fundraising efforts took an unexpected twist.

38129465,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398147,1735196335,Pepe Coin (PEPE) Competitor at $0.15 Poised to Beat PEPE’s Market Cap in 2025,"The post Pepe Coin (PEPE) Competitor at $0.15 Poised to Beat PEPE’s Market Cap in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Massive token releases redefining the scene overnight are not new in the Crypto market. Rising on the scene in 2023, Pepe Coin (PEPE) enthralls investors with its meme-based appeal and shockingly large market valuation. However, the focus is moving to a growing rival, Rexas Finance (RXS)—as the industry develops and investors hunt tokens with real-world utility and scalability. Rexas Finance is more than just a meme coin, designed to transform blockchain applications, priced at merely $0.15 during its presale stage. Driven by its creative features, expanding community, and ambitious objectives, analysts now estimate that this underdog might surpass PEPE’s market valuation by 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance possesses applicable value, unlike PEPE, which mainly depends on community-driven hype. Designed as an ERC-20 token, RXS provides concrete answers for practical problems rather than only a speculative play. Its primary concentration is tokenizing actual objects, including fine art, intellectual property, and real estate. Bridging conventional banking with blockchain releases liquidity and accessibility for once non-liquid assets. Rexas differs from other meme coins like PEPE, which mainly find appeal from speculative trading, with this original idea. Rexas Finance positions itself as a long-term participant in the crypto market, ready to appeal to individual and institutional investors by including a use case that fits rising market trends. Explosive Early Success Exploding During its presale, Rexas Finance has raised approximately $30.4 million and sold more than 362 million tokens, grabbing the market’s interest. These figures show great project investor confidence and an increasing need for alternatives with actual value that mix cost with usefulness. Early investors stand to gain immediately. For those wishing to ride the wave of this fast-growing ecosystem, the ongoing presale price of $0.15 offers a good starting point. CertiK Audit and Key Listings Increase Investor Trust. Transparency and security are vital in a business often beset by fraud and rug pulls. A thorough CertiK audit passed by Rexas Finance offers a sign of approval that increases investor confidence. Moreover, the initiative is listed on essential tracking sites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, improving its legitimacy and exposure. RXS is safer and more appealing for investors looking for a long-term increase. These elements set it apart from speculative meme currencies like PEPE. Rexas Finance vs. PEPE: What Sets Them Apart PEPE’s value is confined to its meme status, even though it depends on its viral appeal and committed community. This limits its future growth possibilities since the market always moves towards initiatives with more significant value. Conversely, Rexas Finance is designed for scalability and usefulness. Features of its ecosystem, meant to assist companies and developers in creating and tokenizing blockchain-based assets, include the Rexas Launchpad. Its Token Builder lets users create and distribute tokens effortlessly, encouraging innovation and expansion inside the Rexas ecosystem. These qualities draw companies and developers and stimulate demand for RXS tokens, fostering a sustainable growth model beyond speculative frenzy. Road to a $10 Billion Market Cap To exceed PEPE’s market valuation, Rexas Finance would have to reach $10 billion; analysts say this is realistic considering its momentum and market placement. With its price of $0.15, Rexas is an unmatched starting point for investors trying to maximize their returns in the next bull run. The ongoing $1 million giveaway stimulates market activity and community involvement even more. Twenty lucky participants will receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens apiece, increasing the project’s appeal and encouraging acceptance during its crucial presale stage. https://x.com/rexasfinance/status/1871307028498685992 Why Rexas Could Dominate by 2025 Rexas is driven towards market dominance by emphasizing real-world value, a safe and open basis, and an ecosystem-supporting invention. Investors increasingly seek tokens combining affordability with high-growth potential as the next bull market phase approaches. Rexas Finance is a powerful opponent to PEPE, surpassing its market capital value since it checks all these criteria and more. Projects like Rexas that combine scalability, usability, and community involvement will likely be the major winners as the crypto terrain develops. Conclusion Pepe Coin’s explosive ascent captivated the crypto community, but its lack of use limits its long-term development possibilities. Using its creative environment, pragmatic use cases, and strong community involvement, Rexas Finance provides a clear road to continuous success in comparison. At only $0.15, Rexas Finance is not only another rival but also a game-changer ready to rewrite the story around meme coins and blockchain innovation. Rexas is a must-watch for investors looking for the next great chance in the crypto market since projections show a $10 billion market cap by 2025. Regardless of your experience with investing, now is the moment to review Rexas Finance before it becomes the buzz of the town—and the pillar of portfolios all around.

38129386,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376171,1735196157,Russian Firms Embrace Bitcoin for Global Trade Amid Western Sanctions,"Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed on Wednesday that domestic firms are now utilizing Bitcoin and other digital assets for international payments, which is enabled by recent legislative adjustments designed to offset Western sanctions. It is important to note that these sanctions have posed challenges to Russia’s trade with significant partners such as China and Turkey, as local banks adopt a cautious approach to avoid regulatory backlash from the West. In a statement to a Russia 24 television channel, Siluanov said, “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year.” Putin Backs Bitcoin as Alternative President Vladimir Putin stated earlier this month that the US administration’s use of the dollar for political leverage is diminishing its role as the world’s reserve currency. This, in turn, has prompted many countries to explore alternative assets. Highlighting Bitcoin as a prime example, he noted its resistance to regulation on a global scale. These remarks essentially suggested Putin’s endorsement of the growing use of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s price surge above $100,000 fueled global excitement this month, with Russia seeing an 8% rise in crypto exchange web traffic, as recently reported by MegaFon. Regulatory changes and global trends have also contributed to this growth. MegaFon’s research further noted an 8%-10% monthly increase in visits to the top 20 exchanges globally, with Russian users comprising 27%-30% of total traffic. Expansion, Crackdown, and Extended Winter Bans This year, Russia authorized cryptocurrency use in foreign trade and has ramped up efforts to legalize mining activities in a bid to solidify its position as one of the world’s top Bitcoin mining countries. Russian authorities also intensified their crackdown against illegal crypto-mining with the latest focusing on the Irkutsk region. The Irkutsk Electric Grid Company, in collaboration with law enforcement, shut down an unregistered operation using over 200 ASIC rigs, consuming 600,000 kWh monthly – equal to 80-100 homes. Though registered as a business, it reportedly failed to meet crypto-mining registry requirements. This comes after Russia extended its winter crypto-mining ban to 2031 which would target regions like Dagestan, Chechnya, and Siberia. Effective January 2025, the ban impacts mining during peak energy seasons. Crypto mining, consuming 1.5% of national power, has caused imbalances in electricity payments and grid strain.

According to a Dec. 25 document published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey, users conducting transactions exceeding 15,000 Turkish lira ($425) will be required to share identifying information with crypto service providers. The Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations aim to prevent illicit fund laundering and terrorism financing through cryptocurrency transactions. However, crypto providers are not mandated to collect information for transactions below the $425 threshold. These regulations align with a global push for stricter crypto oversight and precede Europe’s comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which takes effect on Dec. 30. New Rules Target “Risky” Crypto Transactions Turkey’s regulations, effective Feb. 25, 2025, also require service providers to verify information from customers using unregistered wallet addresses. Transfers without sufficient sender information may be flagged as “risky.” The new law states: “In case sufficient information cannot be obtained, the issues of not performing the transfer or limiting the transactions made with the financial institution in question or terminating the business relationship will be considered.” As of September 2023, Turkey ranked as the fourth-largest crypto market globally, with an estimated trading volume of $170 billion, surpassing markets like Russia and Canada, according to Chainalysis. Crypto Regulations Drive Activity in Turkey In 2024, Turkish crypto firms ramped up activity, with 47 license applications submitted to the Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB) by August. This followed the July implementation of the “Law on Amendments to the Capital Markets Law,” which established a regulatory framework for crypto service providers.

The now-deleted post promoted a fake token called Animoca Brands (MOCA), mimicking the firm’s name and its affiliated Mocaverse NFT collection. Incident is Part of a Larger Phishing Campaign The incident, reported on December 26, is part of a recent surge in attacks targeting crypto-focused X accounts, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. The on-chain seluth revealed that the phishing attack was likely carried out by a group behind similar scams, which have stolen approximately $500,000 in the past month. The fake MOCA token briefly peaked at a market cap of $36,700 but plummeted to $7,700 shortly after, with its current value hovering around $6,200 as trading volume dried up. ZachXBT linked the fake MOCA token to the same wallet address responsible for deploying fraudulent tokens from other hacked X accounts. Update: Yat Siu (co-founder of Animoca) likely fell for the same phishing email a few hours ago as the scam token was deployed by the same address as the Kick & Vanar CEO ATOs Deployer address BL1hs3jw58d1S9xw7cKRUx9wXY94se9Ydt7bCgN1W3pL pic.twitter.com/bTA1QUjJ7b — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 26, 2024 The investigator also noted that at least 15 X accounts have been targeted by this group using sophisticated phishing tactics. The attackers impersonate X’s support team, sending fake copyright infringement notices to their victims. These notices direct users to phishing websites where they unknowingly reset their X account credentials, including two-factor authentication details, handing control to the hackers. The wave of hacks began on November 26 with the account of Bitcoin infrastructure provider RuneMine and continued with crypto trading video streaming site Kick on December 24. Animoca’s Siu appears to be the latest victim in this ongoing campaign, underscoring the vulnerabilities in social engineering attacks. X Accounts of Major Crypto Projects Fall Victim to Hacks The growing prominence of crypto projects on X has attracted cybercriminals who exploit the platform to spread phishing links and target creators with scams. On December 8, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked. The attacker promoted a fake “ADAsol” token and falsely claimed the Foundation would stop supporting ADA. The scam generated $500,000 in trading volume before the token’s value plummeted by 99%. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the breach but warned of the increasing threat to social media accounts. This incident is one of many recent hacks targeting X accounts. In October, Symbiotic’s X account was compromised , and the attacker posted phishing links disguised as airdrop checklists, leading to stolen tokens. EigenLayer, another restaking protocol, faced a similar hack with a fake airdrop campaign . On Oct. 29, Truth Terminal AI founder Andy Ayrey’s account was hijacked to promote fraudulent meme coins, resulting in $1.5 million in profits for the hacker. In November, rapper Wiz Khalifa’s X account was used to shill a fake meme coin called WIZ. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT linked this hacker to Ayrey’s account compromise.

38132304,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322739,1735194958,"Thailand Mulls Bitcoin Pilot Project, Binance to Endorse","Thailand is planning to execute ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s proposal for a Bitcoin pilot payment project. The pilot, which aims to foster Thailand’s tech-savvy investors, will be backed by crypto giant Binance. Binance’s Thai arm has called for the Bank of Thailand’s oversight, emphasizing that the nation “must not be left behind.” Speaking to Bangkok Post , Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance, highlighted Thailand’s potential in leading digital innovation. He said that there is a need for a regulatory framework to tackle the industry’s volatility and monetary stability risks. Shinawatra’s proposal for a pilot Bitcoin pilot “is extremely positive for the digital asset industry,” he noted. “It reflects not only the momentum of global crypto adoption but also demonstrates that leaders at the highest level are embracing these transformative technologies.” The former premier Shinawatra proposed of using Phuket as a Bitcoin sandbox for tourism. Shinawatra did not advocate for Thailand to purchase cryptocurrencies but encouraged the nation to study and engage with digital assets. Binance to Back Thailand’s Bitcoin Pilot Plan Binance’s Gulf head Nirun stressed on Thailand’s reliance on tourism and foreign inflows. He said that integrating cryptocurrencies into Phuket’s economy could align well with the country’s strengths. He also cautioned the inherent risks, including volatility, security concerns and regulatory challenges that comes in embracing the asset class. A proper sandbox approach “is a prudent strategy,” the Binance executive added. “It provides a controlled environment where regulatory authorities can closely monitor and assess the implications, while businesses and consumers gain practical experience.” He believes a sandbox approach would help understand risk controls, before planning for wider implementation. Nirun also compared Bitcoin payments of other nations such as the US and Japan. He said Thailand can learn from these countries’ experiences. “The central bank of Thailand should first thoroughly study the risks and benefits associated with Introducing Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a payment method,” the Binance head noted. In January, Binance launched its joint venture crypto exchange Binance Thailand , which comes in collaboration with Gulf Innova, a subsidiary of Gulf Energy Development. It has also integrated with local banks in Thailand and forged a partnership with Binance Kazakhstan for brokerage services.

38128681,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/if-big-companies-buy-altcoins-like-xrp-and-hbar-will-their-price-increase-analyst-thinks-otherwise/,1735194789,"If Big Companies Buy Altcoins Like XRP and HBAR, Will Their Price Increase? Analyst thinks Otherwise","Cryptocurrency analyst Jake Claver made statements about the cautious yet significant entry of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market. While retail investors often speculate that institutional participation in assets like XRP and HBAR will trigger major price swings, Claver argues that institutions are already deeply entrenched in the market and are operating with sophisticated strategies to maintain vigilance and stability. Unlike individual investors who depend on public exchanges, institutional investors use Over-the-Counter (OTC) desks to execute large trades without triggering significant price movements. These brokers allow institutions to build significant crypto positions while keeping their activities out of the public eye. Claver highlighted two key strategies that institutions use to optimize operations: Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP): This strategy averages out the price by spreading trades over a period of time, preventing sudden market spikes. It is ideal for buying or selling millions in crypto without causing noticeable market disruptions. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP): An algorithm-based approach that times trades according to trading volume, targeting optimal market moments to secure better-than-average prices. It helps institutions trade within certain price bands, buy on declines, and minimize slippage. “For example, an institution investing $50 million does not make a single purchase,” Claver explains. “Instead, they spread the purchases out over days or weeks to avoid market volatility.” Related News: Experienced Analyst Reveals: “For Bitcoin Price to Surpass $108,000...” One of the main reasons institutions prefer OTC desks is liquidity. Executing large trades on public exchanges can lead to large slippage, where the last purchase in a series costs significantly more than the first due to price increases. “OTC desks break large trades into smaller pieces and coordinate orders across multiple brokers,” Claver said. “This results in stable prices, lower fees, and better execution for large trades.” Moreover, secrecy is essential for institutions. These transactions are not immediately reflected in public order books, and the market only becomes aware of their existence when prices tend to rise or fall gradually over time. Claver noted that contrary to the belief that institutions are waiting for regulatory clarity or market maturity to enter crypto, they are already active. “There are large institutions that have quietly accumulated significant crypto positions without causing major volatility,” he said, adding: “When you see sharp market moves, it’s usually individual traders reacting to the news, not institutions buying or selling.” According to Claver, institutions are moving long-term using tools and strategies that are not typically accessible to retail investors. Claver concluded: “The market is playing at a level that most people can’t see. The next time someone says, ‘Institutions will enter the market soon,’ remember, they have already entered.” *This is not investment advice.

38130555,https://invezz.com/?p=2404247,1735194668,Bitcoin mutual funds to launch in Israel next week following regulatory approval,"Six Bitcoin-tracking funds are set to launch in Israel next week, marking a major development in the nation’s cryptocurrency investment landscape. The funds, approved by the Israel Securities Authority, will begin trading on December 31 and will be accessible through banks and investment firms. The funds aim to replicate Bitcoin’s price movements using various indices and strategies. Some will track exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in the United States, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), while one of the funds will be actively managed to outperform Bitcoin’s returns. As of December 25, the combined market capitalisation of Bitcoin ETFs globally stands at over $100 billion. These new Israeli funds are being launched by leading mutual fund managers, including Phoenix Investment, IBI-Kessem, Meitav, More, Ayalon, and Migdal. Management fees for the funds will range from 0.25% to 1.5%. Initially, transactions will be limited to one daily buy or sell order, reflecting Bitcoin’s price at that moment. The approval for these funds follows two years of persistent requests from asset managers, providing local investors with exposure to Bitcoin priced in the Israeli shekel. This initiative coincides with Israel’s ongoing exploration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Since May, the Bank of Israel has been developing its digital shekel under the “Digital Shekel Challenge.” The project encourages participants to create real-time payment systems using the digital currency, supported by a sandbox testing environment. The digital shekel initiative aims to boost competition among local banks while addressing privacy concerns raised by the public. The introduction of Bitcoin-tracking funds and the progress on the CBDC underscore Israel’s efforts to integrate cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies into its financial ecosystem. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs The launch of Bitcoin-tracking mutual funds in Israel comes at a time when crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are experiencing remarkable success globally. Since their approval in January , US spot Bitcoin ETFs have rapidly gained traction, attracting billions in investor inflows and establishing themselves as prominent financial products in the cryptocurrency sector. According to data from SoSoValue, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have garnered total inflows of $35 billion and collectively manage assets exceeding $100 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads this thriving market, reflecting strong investor confidence and growing demand for cryptocurrency-based financial instruments. Crypto ETF offerings are also continuing to evolve. Just last week, The cryptocurrency market achieved a major milestone with the approval of two groundbreaking ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and the Franklin Crypto Index ETF stand out by offering a unique proposition, combining spot Bitcoin and Ethereum investments into a single, streamlined package. These ETFs are expected to enhance accessibility for investors looking to gain exposure to the top cryptocurrencies, offering a more convenient way to invest in digital assets through traditional financial markets.

38128954,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52905,1735194638,"LINK Rallies Nearly 50%: LNEX Holders Anticipate Another Price Increase, Uniswap To $40?","Major crypto players like Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK), and Lunex Network (LNEX) are drawing considerable interest as investors search for the next bullish altcoin. Uniswap’s open interest has jumped by 12%, indicating a bullish sentiment, whereas Chainlink’s price has risen nearly 50% in the past month. However, with its creative features and explosive presale momentum, which resulted in over 50% of the presale token allocation sold out, Lunex has attracted huge attention. The project has already raised over $5.4 million in revenue after selling over 2 billion tokens. With great growth prospects for early adopters, Lunex could be the next big DeFi revolution. Lunex Holders Anticipate Another Price Increase Lunex Network ( LNEX ) has quickly gained ground in the broader crypto market due to its trader-focused features and impressive presale performance. The project has removed KYC verification requirements and provides a seamless trading experience free from third-party wallet connections. This new DEX protocol is perfect for casual and high-volume traders seeking a secure and private trading environment due to its focus on user anonymity and cross-chain functionalities. Notably, Lunex users have access to over 50,000 crypto assets across 40+ blockchains and instantaneous connectivity of up to 65 RPC nodes. The project has ultra-low rates and institutional-level liquidity, providing one of the most competitive transaction cost structures in the DeFi market . This guarantees traders access to a large range of crypto assets without compromising the economy of cost. So far, Lunex is in presale and available at $0.0048, a notable discount from the predicted launch price of $0.0216. Investors are quickly joining the LNEX presale before the token release, especially with the expected price surge in the coming days. Early adopters who bought the token at its starting price of $0.0012 have witnessed a 300% return. Chainlink Price Surges Nearly 50% Chainlink’s price has grown remarkably, surging by nearly 100% in the past month. The recent rally could be due to investors shifting their funds into altcoins as several tokens― BNB, TRX, and SOL hit new peaks over the last few weeks. Per Santiment data, there is a very low retail frenzy around LINK’s latest rally. This could be interpreted as the rally could sustain itself and continue over the next few months. Moreover, this rally coincided with ongoing whale accumulation. Per Lookonchain data , an unknown whale has transferred LINK coins worth $9.6 million from Binance to Aave (AAVE). Moreover, Etherscan data indicated another whale had moved Chainlink cryptos worth $7.16 million from Coinbase to a self-custody whale. Despite this positive outlook, technical indicators highlight the price of Chainlink might not reach the anticipated $40 milestone in 2024. For Chainlink’s price to achieve its anticipated three-year highs, additional buying catalysts like increased whale activity and positive on-chain metrics might be necessary. However, if Bitcoin (BTC) reclaims its $100K milestone, Chainlink’s price could quickly breach this level. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) has exhibited a strong bullish outlook in the past few weeks. The token has gained nearly 100% in the past month and broken critical resistance levels along the way. Uniswap open interest has increased, a sign of bullish sentiment after its bulls exceeded its March 2024 high of $17.05. Moreover, UNI’s OBV has risen strongly to highlight high demand. Notably, UNI’s RSI has entered overbought territory but hasn’t made a bearish divergence. UNI price could witness a consolidation around the $16 and $17 levels before the next leg materializes in the coming days. Ideally, the $15.45 and $15.95 levels will likely become strong demand zones should the UNI price take a southbound dip. Meanwhile, the number of UNI addresses has yet to record an uptrend. Its MVRV ratio has increased to hit its March high, suggesting rising profitability. This could mean that the UNI token is incredibly overvalued, and traders could embark on profit-taking behaviors that fuel a price pullback, potentially presenting an opportunity to buy the dip. Three Bullish Tokens In December As more investors shift their funds into altcoins, Chainlink, Uniswap, and Lunex Network are receiving considerable attention for their rare opportunities to make high returns. Lunex, in particular, has created major excitement, with over 50% of its presale tokens already sold. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Lunex Network (LNEX) Presale Today!

38128405,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398117,1735194264,XRP Price Prediction For December 26,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 26 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Currently, XRP is trading within a range, and the market is quiet due to the holiday period. There hasn’t been any significant breakout in price yet. The key question now is whether XRP will experience a price surge after the holiday season ends. At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than two percent and is trading at $2.25. Potential Triangle Pattern Developing At present, XRP could be forming a triangle pattern, which typically signals a period of consolidation before a breakout. However, it’s important to note that triangles are not always reliable and this pattern doesn’t seem to be fully formed just yet. It’s essential to be cautious as the pattern could evolve into something different, and a clear breakout may still be some time away. XRP’s Price Could Go In Two Directions Upward Breakout Scenario: A breakout to the upside remains possible, but at this stage, the triangle doesn’t seem fully developed. If the correction is to complete, it may need more time, either through a continued D-wave in the triangle or through a downward move. If the market stays above the recent support level of around $1.94-$1.95, XRP could potentially move higher, targeting the $2.59 level, which would be a significant milestone in the pattern. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Price Today (Dec 26th, 2024): Bitcoin Price Stays Firm at $98k | BGB Leads Gainers! , Downside Risk: If XRP fails to break higher and instead breaks below the $1.94-$1.95 support, the price could fall to lower support levels. Key levels to watch on the downside include $1.80, $1.63, and $1.53. The $1.40 region is particularly important, as it aligns with a common retracement target for corrective phases. Conclusion XRP’s price action is at a critical point. While a breakout could still happen, the triangle pattern is not yet fully complete, and there are several potential corrective scenarios to consider. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This sensational all-sports meme token has hit the market with unstoppable momentum, knocking out weak competitors and scammy cryptos. As it charges ahead, XYZ is set to deliver jaw-dropping gains, leaving the likes of BOME and WIF far behind.

XYZ is currently undervalued , and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! JasmyCoin (JASMY) JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency developed by Jasmy Corporation, a Tokyo-based Internet of Things (IoT) provider. The IoT connects devices like computers, cars, and phones, allowing them to transmit data. Jasmy aims to restore and protect individual data sovereignty by combining IoT technology with blockchain. The platform connects service providers and data users, enabling them to exchange data securely without relying on trust. The main goal of Jasmy is to create a secure environment where users have full control over their personal information. By decentralizing data storage using edge computing and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), users can treat their data as personal assets. This infrastructure allows service providers to offer services by accessing user-owned data with permission. The integration of IoT and blockchain in JasmyCoin presents potential for growth in data security and user privacy sectors. The attractiveness of the coin in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including technology adoption and market trends. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard blocks created in parallel, GHOSTDAG allows these blocks to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means the Kaspa blockchain is a block directed acyclic graph (blockDAG) rather than a linear chain. This approach enables secure operation with very high block rates. Currently, Kaspa processes 1 block per second, with plans to increase to 10 blocks per second and ambitions for 100 blocks per second. The confirmation times are very short, mainly limited by internet latency. Kaspa includes features such as Reachability, which allows querying the DAG’s topology, and block data pruning, with future plans for block header pruning. It also supports SPV proofs and aims to implement subnetwork support to facilitate future layer 2 solutions. These technologies position Kaspa as a scalable and efficient cryptocurrency. In the current market cycle, Kaspa’s high throughput and innovative consensus mechanism may attract interest from those looking for advanced proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Conclusion JASMY and KAS have strong potential to surpass XRP, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims higher by uniting sports fans in a memecoin targeting 20,000% growth with a community-driven ecosystem.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! PEPE: A Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a cryptocurrency launched as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme. It runs on Ethereum and is classified as a memecoin. PEPE does not have practical uses, following the theme of playful assets like Dogecoin. It has no transaction tax and uses mechanisms like token burning to increase rarity. A reward system encourages long-term holding. The coin reached a market cap of $1.6 billion in 2023, gaining attention among crypto users. Its roadmap includes goals for social media exposure and exchange listings. Available on platforms like Binance and Uniswap, it remains popular in the memecoin space. PEPE adapts Ethereum technology, offering secure transactions and decentralized access. BONK: Solana-Based Memecoin with Community Focus BONK is a cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain. It features a Shiba Inu mascot and aims to strengthen Solana’s community. Half of BONK’s supply was distributed through airdrops to Solana’s NFT and DeFi users. It gained prominence after a Coinbase listing and became the third-largest memecoin by market cap in late 2023. Its value surged over 10,000% year-to-date. BONK supports the Solana ecosystem with tools like its decentralized exchange, BonkSwap. While its high total supply and price swings are notable challenges, BONK’s role in the growing Solana network gives it utility. Its appeal depends on market trends and its further integration into decentralized applications. Conclusion While PEPE and BONK may offer less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as the token for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and aiming for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like WIF and Popcat, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

38127813,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398090,1735193144,Bitcoin Looms Under $100k : A Bullish Momentum Is Coming,"The post Bitcoin Looms Under $100k : A Bullish Momentum Is Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin investors and traders are always trying to perfectly time the market movement, however it is not possible for all. The reason? Understanding and deciphering the market sentiments. Though there are many indicators that help in predicting the movement, most of them are delayed, that is why they are called lagging indicators. Let’s explore the possibility of when Bitcoin can reach $110k. Exploring Bitcoin Chart Before we talk about the sentiment side, let’s have a look at what is happening in Bitcoin right now. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $98,268, just 0.08% up as compared to the last 24 hours. The price rose as high as $99,950 a few hours ago but moving average 100 sent it back down. The current support is MA 200. Also this is a zone where previously BTC had faced high resistance so this will also act as support now. Source : Coinglass The concern here is the RSI which is currently at 53.60 and constantly falling alongside price. The trading volume is down by 17.90% today as well. Even though the Fear and Greed Index was recorded at 79 which is extreme greed, the market sentiment feels bearish. The Market Sentiment The market intelligence platform Santiment shared deep insights in their X post. It has described how Bitcoin plays against market sentiments. On December 15, the social media was filled with speculations of BTC touching $110k, however it topped out at $108k, disappointing the market. Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant. Historically, we will see $110K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn't expect it, as this image shows. pic.twitter.com/j4w3VQ4Zio — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 26, 2024 The same thing happened when the crypto was at $104k and there were mentions of it reaching $110k, it backed again. If we analyse the history of Bitcoin movement and compare it with market sentiments, things go in the opposite direction of major market mentions. When the market gets filled with high bearishness, suddenly Bitcoin pumps and vice versa. As people are again going super bullish and market sentiment is of greed, we should expect a price drop and not a rise. As soon as people stop expecting the market to rise it will shock them again. Bitcoin Dominance and Exchange Reserves The market dominance of Bitcoin is at 58.43%. This means investors hold more Bitcoin than other cryptos. Historically, whenever BTC dominance fell below this point the price of BTC followed it, so this particular zone can be said to be a support zone. Currently we can see the price is falling however the dominance is rising, this means soon the money will start flowing out of alts and into the btc. But before that the price must take a correction and create a bearish market sentiment. Source : Tradingview BTC exchange reserve data shows that since February 2024, the reserve has been falling and the price has been increasing. This metric shows how much Bitcoin is at the exchanges. A falling number shows that people are moving their crypto out of the crypto to a cold storage, giving a signal for a bullish momentum. Source : CryptoQuant Zooming into the past few days we can see that the exchange reserves increased for a while. This happened because whales moved out their crypto to sell when the price was above $100k. Now, the downside curve is signaling an upcoming bullish movement again. What to Expect? From what we have already discussed, it should be pretty clear by now that the market moves against the market sentiment. Even though we can see the BTC reserve falling, the price is falling as well but the bitcoin market dominance is rising. This is a clear indication that the market is planning to catch traders by surprise. People will go bearish and open short trades, this is an opportunity for the big and smart traders to capture this money from the market and fill their bags. Nothing of this is financial advice but should be taken as an educational content.

Over the years, SHIB has grown its ecosystem to include the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, NFTs, and staking alternatives. These innovations are designed to give SHIB real-world utility and longevity. SHIB’s tokenomics are also key to its attractiveness, with a deflationary approach and token burns targeted to build value and reduce circulating supply. Shiba Inu’s network utilized a creative token-burning model to accelerate its deflationary goal. This strategy, which is closely linked to the growth of Shibarium (Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution) uses each transaction in the ecosystem to help lower token supply. As the market approaches 2025, SHIB investors are depending on new use cases and a dedicated community to drive growth. DOGE: The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin is indisputably the pioneer of meme coins, having a legacy that no other token can equal. Known for its lighthearted beginnings and strong celebrity endorsements, DOGE won over millions of hearts worldwide. DOGE has also, of course, benefited significantly from the patronage of Elon Musk. Despite its playful beginnings, DOGE has established itself as an authentic cryptocurrency, with growing popularity for microtransactions and tipping systems. Donald Trump’s election triumph caused DOGE to surge by more than 160% in November. However, the market now appears unsure of where DOGE will head next. DOGE’s early November rally was followed by a sluggish climb upward as the price lost momentum and investors began to take profits. Nevertheless, analysts anticipate that Dogecoin bulls may present a case for price suppression, sending the cryptocurrency back up around $0.485. 1Fuel’s Increasing Momentum While SHIB and DOGE occupy the meme coin scene, 1Fuel paves the path as a strong utility token in the DeFi space. Now in the second presale phase and selling for a low price of $0.012/token, 1Fuel has received much attention for its creative solutions that address key blockchain concerns. 1Fuel offers a one-click cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet, peer-to-peer exchange, and staking rewards up to 30% APR, amongst other benefits. Market analysts maintain that 1Fuel’s emphasis on practical applications and flexible user experiences establishes it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for long-term returns. For individuals interested in buying cryptocurrencies with real-world utility, 1Fuel stands out as a top choice, sparring with meme coins and carving out a niche in the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion SHIB, DOGE, and 1Fuel each offer unique prospects for investors . Shiba Inu continues to shape a system that extends its meme roots, whereas Dogecoin relies on its legacy and community strength. Meanwhile, 1Fuel is emerging as a functional utility token with the potential to reshape DeFi standards. Ahead of 2025, 1Fuel clearly positions itself as a worthy contender for one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in.

According to a statement released by SBI on December 25, all customer accounts and assets from DMM will be transferred to SBI on March 8. The transition will be seamless for DMM customers, as SBI will automatically create accounts for them, eliminating the need for manual registration. DMM Bitcoin to Liquidate Following Hack DMM Bitcoin announced earlier this month that it would liquidate following a devastating security breach in May 2024. Hackers managed to compromise the exchange’s crypto wallets, stealing 4,500 Bitcoin—valued at approximately $320 million at the time. DMM pledged to reimburse affected customers, ensuring their funds would be restored despite the breach. The attack was attributed to the North Korea-linked cybercrime group TraderTraitor, according to findings shared on December 23 by the FBI, Japan’s National Police Agency, and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center. DMM Bitcoinからの口座・預かり資産移管について いつも当社サービスをご利用いただきありがとうございます。 当社は、2024年12月2日に公表した「DMM Bitcoinからの口座・預かり資産移管に向けた基本合意に関するお知らせ」の通り、株式会社DMM… — SBI VC Trade (SBI VCトレード） (@sbivc_official) December 25, 2024 Investigators revealed that a North Korean operative posed as a recruiter on LinkedIn, targeting an employee at Ginco, a Japanese crypto wallet firm that maintained wallet management systems for DMM. The operative tricked the employee into executing a malicious script disguised as a pre-employment test. The script was uploaded to the employee’s GitHub repository, which hackers later exploited. In May, TraderTraitor reportedly used compromised communications channels to impersonate the Ginco employee, enabling them to manipulate a transaction request from DMM Bitcoin and steal the funds. This heist is one of the most significant cybercrimes in the cryptocurrency industry in 2024. Blockchain security firm Hacken noted that attacks on centralized crypto services more than doubled in 2024, with losses reaching $694 million compared to the previous year. The DMM Bitcoin hack and a $235 million breach on Indian exchange WazirX are among the most prominent incidents. Crypto Industry Lost $1.49B to Hacks and Fraud in 2024 As reported, the crypto industry witnessed losses totaling $1.49 billion in 2024 due to hacks and fraud, marking a 17% decrease from 2023. According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, hacks were overwhelmingly the primary cause, accounting for $1.47 billion or 98.1% of the total losses across 192 incidents. Fraud, including rug pulls and scams, represented just 1.9% of the losses at $28 million, though this category saw a 72% increase year-on-year. The decline in total crypto losses reflects improved security measures, as the number of successful attacks also fell by 27.5%, from 320 in 2023 to 232 in 2024. Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remained prime targets, representing 51.4% of the losses, while centralized finance (CeFi) platforms accounted for 48.6%. Notably, CeFi losses surged by 77.5% year-on-year, reaching $726 million. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain were the most attacked blockchains, with Ethereum facing 104 incidents that led to 44% of total chain losses.

Hackers are now using his account to market questionable tokens and contracts under the pretense of an Animoca Brands coin release. Animoca Brands asks users to remain vigilant and not to interact with Siu’s account On December 26th, Animoca Brands disclosed via their official X account that their co-founder and CEO Yat Siu’s X account had been hacked. They warned users to stay alert, clarifying that the company had not formally issued any crypto tokens or NFTs. The firm added that information concerning the release of Solana-based tokens was also hacker-initiated. The company emphasized : Please DO NOT engage with the account and stay vigilant. We will provide an update when the account is restored. ~Animoca Brands Yat Siu’s account adds to the long list of X accounts hacked to push scam tokens On December 24, the live-streaming platform Kick’s official X account was also compromised. The account was used to promote fraudulent Solana-based tokens. Hackers even pushed the “Kick Token” to users, directing them to malicious wallet links. However, co-founder Bijan Tehrani, dismissed any plans to launch the Kick Token, warning users not to trust any of the scam posts on the token. On December 20, hackers also breached the X account of Vivek Ramaswamy, co-lead of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). They used his account to propagate false claims of a partnership between the agency and the stablecoin project, under the guise of fostering financial inclusion and fiscal responsibility. Celebrity and rapper Drake’s account also fell victim to a breach, with hackers using his account to market scam token $ANITA. Attackers tied his Anita Max Wynn Tour to the fraudulent token and the crypto betting platform token Stake, hoping to entice unsuspecting users. Crypto investigator, ZachXBT called attention to the hack and debunked any connections of Drake to Stake or the $ANITA token. Moreover, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao even took to X to caution his followers against scam accounts trying to impersonate him.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-solana-memecoin-will-skyrocket-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Meanwhile, its memecoin rival, Shiba Inu, is capturing attention as analysts predict significant growth for the asset in 2025. Adding to the excitement is 1Fuel, a rising star in the DeFi space, which is set to drive altcoin growth with its anticipated public listing in Q2 2025. With Shiba Inu gaining traction among whales and 1Fuel’s innovative features increasing investor confidence, the altcoin market is gearing up for a dynamic year ahead. Dogecoin Slows Down After Huge Gains Dogecoin hit its all-time high of $0.4672 in early December but has since experienced a steady decline, now resting at $0.336. As the recent crypto market selloff eases, Dogecoin has faced the steepest losses. The largest memecoin by market cap has tumbled by 16% in the last week. Following its three-year high, the original memecoin has shed nearly half its value, causing investors to wonder whether it would recover. While Dogecoin struggles, attention has turned to another memecoin that will explode in the next altcoin rally, which is Shiba Inu. Analysts Predict 250% Growth for Shiba Inu in 2025 Shiba Inu has attracted the attention of a lot of investors, especially since analysts have predicted a staggering 250% growth in 2025. After reaching an all-time high of $0.00003556 in March, SHIB experienced a decline before rebounding to $0.00003293, only to drop again. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating potential for a significant price movement. Analysts suggest that a breakout above the upper resistance line could propel SHIB to a target price of $0.00003255, representing a potential 32% increase from current levels. Despite being a memecoin, the main reason why SHIB has a bullish outlook is Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain. Shibarium is making SHIB, making it one of the best utility tokens. Investors are turning to tools like MetaMask and Ledger to securely hold and manage SHIB. 1Fuel OFT Predicted to Grow by 1000% Upon Listing Investors are buzzing about 1Fuel OFT, a promising new altcoin currently in its live presale stage. With stage 1 already complete and stage 2 over 50% finished, the presale has sold more than 86 million tokens. At its current presale value of just $0.012, OFT offers the lowest entry point for investors eager to secure the token before its anticipated public listing in Q2 2025. Analysts predict a 1000% growth upon listing, making it one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto space right now. Unlike the memecoins that will explode, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, 1Fuel OFT stands out as a utility token with intrinsic value driven by its robust features. OFT’s growing appeal highlights its potential as one of the best utility tokens to watch in 2025. 1Fuel’s DEX wallet has proven itself as a good alternative to tools like MetaMask and Ledger, especially since it facilitates cross-chain transactions without third-party tools. Its cutting-edge privacy mixer also exceeds the capabilities of wallets like MetaMask and Ledger, which currently lack integrated privacy tools. Investors Anticipate Altcoin Growth in 2025 As 1Fuel OFT gains traction in the altcoin market, it’s becoming a top contender for the next crypto rally. Unlike top memecoins, 1Fuel comes with a comprehensive ecosystem for long-term growth potential. Its value has attracted the attention of many investors, who are rushing to accumulate it in the presale.

The company originally focused on developing mobile games but shifted its focus in 2018 to blockchain gaming and NFTs, becoming a key player in the Web3 space. Vulnerabilities on the Solana blockchain This is not the first time that Solana blockchain has been used to execute a scam. Solana’s infrastructure makes users prone to specific vulnerabilities. A recent case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice shone a light on this issue, with the Justice Department charging two California men, Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo, with running NFT rug pulls on Ethereum and Solana that cost buyers over $22 million. Such rug pulls included touting fake NFT projects like Vault of Gems and Faceless and fleeing with investors’ money. The case is the largest NFT fraud the DOJ has prosecuted. Further, Drake , the Canadian singer, also had his account compromised to promote Solana-based meme coin Anita. You might also like: KickStreaming X account hacked, now pushing Solana-based crypto scam tokens Why is Solana vulnerable to scams ? While Solana’s architecture may have been designed for efficiency, it introduces a number of risks that render it more susceptible to scams compared to other networks. The token account structure Solana uses lets attackers reassign ownership of assets using specific commands, leaving funds virtually unrecoverable. You might also like: Solana hits $250, Dogecoin nears $0.5, Lightchain AI soars 30,000% to $5 Also, Solana’s one-step transaction approval—versus Ethereum’s multiphase allowance of contract functions—can result in instant and irreversible losses once a malicious transaction is authorized. The platform’s capacity to group multiple sub-transactions into one approval also compounds the risk of unseen thefts. Scammers also take advantage of Solana’s Durable Nonce capability to postpone the implementation of fraudulent operations, evading alerts and surprising victims. This, along with users’ ignorance of the operational risks of Solana, results in it being a prime target for scams.

Bitcoin does not have the high transaction and other costs and risks associated with many other alternative assets, which is why mainstream investors are including it pursuant to MPT. As the price of any asset such as Bitcoin rises, adherents to Modern Portfolio Theory should buy more to maintain its proportion in the Market Portfolio. Those who have profited from Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) surge to over $100,000, owe their good fortune, more than any other factor, to Harry Markowitz whose 1952 paper Portfolio Selection for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1990, led to what is now referred to as Modern Portfolio Theory. As taught in finance courses, Modern Portfolio Theory says that the most efficient portfolio is the Market Portfolio, one that includes all assets. Students are sometimes surprised when told that everything that one can possibly invest in, including baseball cards and beanie babies should be included in the most efficient portfolio. This has created a situation where professional portfolio managers who might not include baseball cards and beanie babies in their portfolios might now include Bitcoin. Anyone who has taken a graduate finance course and many others are familiar with the work of Markowitz which led to Modern Portfolio Theory. This led to the Capital Asset Pricing Model and Jensen's alpha which is the Alpha in ""Seeking Alpha."" In my Seeking Alpha article 30% Yielding MORL, MORT And The mREITS: A Real World Application And Test Of Modern Portfolio Theory I gave a concise explanation of how and why Modern Portfolio Theory leads to the conclusion that the most efficient portfolio is one that includes all assets. I have reproduced it below. Those who are familiar with this topic may want to skip down to Why Bitcoin is the Perfect Asset to Benefit from Modern Portfolio Theory . The basis for the theory is that investors evaluate all assets in terms of expected return and risk. Risk can be quantified by standard deviation. Any asset is more efficient than another asset if it has a higher expected return than the other asset but no more risk or has the same expected return but less risk. Markowitz CAL frontier (Wikipedia) Markowitz frontier.jpg If all possible assets and portfolios of assets are plotted on a graph with expected return on the vertical axis and risk on the horizontal assets as shown above, there will be some assets and portfolios of assets that are more efficient than others. The most efficient assets and portfolios of assets, those which have the highest expected return for any given level of risk (standard deviation) form the Efficient Frontier. This, as shown above, is the line connecting those assets and portfolios of assets that are more efficient than those below then in terms of risk and return. Portfolios of assets will generally be more efficient than individual assets. Compare investing all of your money in one security that had an expected return of 10% with some level of risk, to a portfolio comprised of 20 securities each with an expected return of 10% with same level of risk as the single security. The portfolio would provide the exact same expected return of 10% but with less risk than the individual security. Thus, the portfolio is more efficient than any of the individual assets in the portfolio. This principle of diversification has led to the boom in index funds and ETFs. Markowitz demonstrated that the most efficient portfolio will be the Market Portfolio, which consists of all assets that anyone could invest in. That would include not just all domestic and international stocks and bonds but all other assets as well including art and collectibles such as baseball cards. In a model where a risk free interest rate exists at which all investors can borrow and lend, all investors should own the Market Portfolio, as the line labeled ""Best possible CAL"" on the graph indicates. The best possible capital asset allocation for any investor, regardless of risk preferences, lies along a capital asset line that connects the risk free rate with the Efficient Frontier. The risk or standard deviation of an investment at the risk free rate is zero. A line originating at the point of the risk free interest rate on the Expected return vertical axis and zero on the Standard Deviation axis can be drawn to tangency point on the Efficient Frontier. Any investor should invest at some point on that Best possible CAL. An extremely risk averse investor should invest only in the risk free asset. Someone slightly less risk averse should have most of their assets in the risk free asset with the remainder in the market portfolio. A risk seeking investor could have 200% of their assets in the Market portfolio by buying on margin by borrowing at the risk free rate. The important implication is that any point on the best possible CAL is more efficient than any individual asset or portfolio below that point, since it has a higher return with the same risk. Modern Portfolio Theory has had its ups and downs in both the financial and academic communities. Critics of the theory and model point to the difficulty in determining or creating a ""market portfolio"" and the assumption that investors can borrow and lend at a risk free rate. Many use the S&P 500 ( SPX ) as a proxy for the market portfolio and the T-bill rate as the risk free rate. There still remain numerous issues with the model. One could argue that the Wilshire 5000 is a better proxy than the S&P 500. Why Bitcoin is the Perfect Asset to Benefit from Modern Portfolio Theory. Some market participants who may be devoted adherents to Modern Portfolio Theory, probably do not include baseball cards, beanie babies and similar alternative assets in either their own portfolios or those they manage. Those adherents could cite various reasons for why certain risk and cost factors associated with alternative assets are sufficient to make one forgo the benefits of the Market Portfolio, which should include those alternative assets according to Modern Portfolio Theory. The risks associated with those alternative assets include what might be called fashion risk and the associated dual-use risk. Residential real estate and collectibles have dual uses, both as investments and that they can generate utility for their owners, separate from any returns they may generate as investments. Certainly, there are some who invest in art and other collectibles purely for investment purposes, and keep their collections locked in warehouses. However, those only interested in capital gains from collectibles, may have to bid against buyers who love the objects in question and have no compunction about paying too much. More importantly what might be called fashion risk can occur if the objects in question fall out of favor with collectors. Some collectibles now have various metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation that comes closer to that of securities such as stocks and bonds, which have metrics such as earnings, yields and ratings, However, even those collectibles that have metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation have fashion risk. Coins are an example of collectibles that now have various metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation that comes closer to that of securities but have fashion risk. Rarity and condition are metrics that can be used to evaluate coins. The mintage number of any American coin is known and there are a number of professional rating agencies that can assign a number from 1 to 70 for any coin, where 70 is the highest grade indicating a pristine flawless coin. Any coin graded 60 or above is in the uncirculated category. However, just knowing the mintage and condition of a coin does not necessarily mean that you know its relative value. For example, there were only 3,700 gold US one dollar coins minted in 1865 and 52,000 Standing Liberty quarters minted in 1916. However, in any given condition, a1916 Standing Liberty quarter is worth considerably more than an 1865 gold dollar. In terms of investment outcomes, in 1916, an 1865 gold dollar was already a collector item and could have been purchased in uncirculated condition for about $10, according to Gemini 1.5. For $10, in 1916 someone could have acquired 40 uncirculated Standing Liberty quarters, each of which is now worth about $70,000 in grade 67 according to pgcs-coinfacts . The same service shows an 1865 gold dollar in grade 67 at $42,500 . Diamonds are dual use and still in many investment portfolios. However, lab-grown diamonds, which cannot be differentiated from natural diamonds, without extremely sophisticated equipment, if at all, now are taking an estimated 50% of the bridal diamond market . A similar situation occurred when the development of cultured pearls caused a massive decline in the value of natural pearls. Alternative investments such as oil and metals, which can have transactions costs as low as securities, have considerable custodian costs, including insurance. Crude oil for spot delivery actually went negative during the pandemic as there was no capacity to store it. Many collectibles have enormous transaction costs. For example, in the Sotheby’s auction sale NY7617 NYC June 4, 2001, I sold a small bench that I had been using as a seat to take off muddy shoes in my summer home, when I sold the home. I had bought It from the artist for $1,200 in 1987. It had faded from being exposed to the sun through a skylight and someone had left a cold can of soda on it, which left a noticeable ring. Sotheby's included it in the June 4, 2001 catalog and gave it an estimate of $4,000-6,000. It sold for $12,000. However, I received only $7,200, even though I had absolutely minimized the costs involved, by taking it to Sotheby's in my own car. Later that year I saw an identical bench from that artist in a store in Santa Fe NM, in much better condition offered at $4,000. Bitcoin has none of the transaction or custodial costs associated with other alternative assets. It really cannot now be considered a dual use asset like collectibles and residential real estate. At one point it was thought that it would have some use for transactions, especially those involving illicit activities, that does not seem to be materializing. In my 2018 articles The Cryptocurrency Craze May Be Not So Crazy and Cryptos Revisited I pointed out that in a blockchain, all transactions are recorded by all participants of the blockchain, this could lead to digital cryptocurrency eventually replacing money as we know it today. But before this could occur, I also suggested that government could take control of the cryptocurrency universe. The government would then know the exact real identity of all blockchain wallet owners, giving government knowledge of all transactions. Possibly, the individuals in a group known as DarkSide which extorted a ransomware payment from Colonial Pipeline in May 2021 did not read my articles, since on June 7, 2021, a press release from the Department of Justice included: WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice today announced that it has seized 63.7 bitcoins currently valued at approximately $2.3 million. These funds allegedly represent the proceeds of a May 8, ransom payment to individuals in a group known as DarkSide, which had targeted Colonial Pipeline, resulting in critical infrastructure being taken out of operation. The seizure warrant was authorized earlier today by the Honorable Laurel Beeler, U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of California. “Following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful tools we have,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco for the U.S. Department of Justice. Where Does That Leave Bitcoin? While in the future, Bitcoin will probably not be used in transactions any more than gold is today, that doesn't mean that, like gold, it will not inexorably be included increasingly in institutional and professionally managed portfolios. Those adhering to Modern Portfolio Theory, which increasing seem to be including the vast majority of portfolio managers who have not been able to consistently beat the S&P 500, do not have any of the reasons that limit their investments in collectibles, to preclude their including some of the 21 million Bitcoin in their market portfolios. That does not mean that Bitcoin will not continue to be very volatile and subject to event risk. However, just as Madoff on Enron did not permanently impair the stock market, various scandals and exchange collapses such as FTX will not permanently impair the Bitcoin market. One feature of the Modern Portfolio Theory conclusion that the total market portfolio will be the most efficient portfolio for all investors regardless of their risk aversion or risk seeking, is that since the weighting of an individual asset or asset class in the market portfolio, is that asset’s proportion of the total market value of all assets. Thus, as an asset class increases in price, adherence to Modern Portfolio Theory requires that more of it be purchased. In the short term there may be some disappointment when it becomes obvious that the USA has no business having a sovereign wealth fund and especially that the American government should not buy Bitcoin, anymore that the US Government should buy dollars for investment purposes. However, it is possible that countries for whom having sovereign wealth funds makes sense, they might increasingly be buying Bitcoin, since those running those funds probably studied Modern Portfolio Theory in whatever college or university they attended.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746433-bitcoins-rise-is-due-to-modern-portfolio-theory?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38126903.jpeg
38126776,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398064,1735191109,Japan Rejects Bitcoin Reserves as Global Discussions Heat Up,"The post Japan Rejects Bitcoin Reserves as Global Discussions Heat Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s year-end rise to $100K has created a huge storm in the earlier stagnant market. With massive potential, the countries globally are planning to tap this trillion-dollar industry to support their economy. Japan’s Cautious Response While the market is bullish in the long term, the Japanese government has officially responded to the idea of holding Bitcoin as part of its national reserves , taking a cautious approach. This came after Senator Hamada Satoshi suggested that Japan should consider following in the footsteps of countries like the U.S. and others, which are reportedly exploring the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves. Hamada believes that incorporating Bitcoin could strengthen Japan’s economy and act as a safeguard against potential financial risks. The government clarified that it currently has no detailed understanding of similar developments in other countries and pointed out that discussions about Bitcoin reserves are still in their early stages. They explained that the legal framework governing Japan’s foreign exchange reserves prioritizes safety and stability, which are not characteristics typically associated with volatile assets like Bitcoin. In simple terms, the government doesn’t see Bitcoin fitting into its current system, which is focused on maintaining steady foreign currency reserves. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia Turns to Bitcoin to Fight Sanctions , Global Interest in Bitcoin Reserves This cautious approach comes as other regions are also debating the role of Bitcoin in national financial strategies. In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently stated that the Federal Reserve cannot hold Bitcoin . However, on a global scale political leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers, are pushing for the adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In Europe, MEP Sara Knafo urged the EU to adopt Bitcoin reserves , opposing a digital euro. She highlighted Bitcoin’s decentralization as a defense against authoritarian overreach. NON à l’euro numérique OUI à une réserve nationale stratégique de BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/o886lk9uV8 — Sarah Knafo (@knafo_sarah) December 16, 2024 While Japan is restricting innovation other nations are planning to add Bitcoin as a strategic reserve to support innovation. It will be interesting to see if Japan joins the trend or not. With Trump’s aggressive planning to become the top leader in Bitcoin , it will be a challenge for other countries to enter the game later. On the flip side, economists also see the downside of Bitcoin Reserve calling it a gamble, though Bitcoin is on a rising trend historically it can drop to its lowest as well creating a liquidation and overall economic crash hence a cautious approach is required while evaluating such high-risk assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38126800,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633307,1735191062,"Japan government cautions against Bitcoin as National Reserve, citing volatility and security concerns","The Japanese government is cautious about using Bitcoin as a National Reserve due to its volatility and security concerns, even though the adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) reserves at the national level is gaining attention in the US. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba communicated the position in a written response to House of Councilors member Satoshi Hamada, who had explored the position of adding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to foreign exchange reserves. The prime minister stated that they are not interested in what’s happening in the crypto space around the world, stating that they are not monitoring the movements of other countries, not even the United States. Thus, it was not easy for them to express a view. Government rejects cryptos for foreign exchange reserves The written submission explained that cryptocurrencies do not qualify as foreign exchange according to the legal guidelines on special account operations. Moreover, foreign exchange reserves are designed to stabilize foreign construction assets or bonds. The prime minister clarified that the government operates special accounts with a focus on safety and liquidity. He explained that in the operation of these accounts, the government ensures the smooth execution of necessary foreign exchange transactions to maintain the stability of the Japanese currency’s exchange rate, prioritizing safety and liquidity. He added that t his is achieved using bonds such as government bonds with high liquidity and repayment certainty or deposits with foreign central banks. He continued to say that there are absolutely no plans to consider holding cryptocurrencies. Countries race to establish Bitcoin National Reserves There are many talks regarding the setting up of Bitcoin National Reserves. Even better, the talks have grown from theoretical aspects to geopolitical realities. Russia’s parliament also joined the calls for the national bank to consider Bitcoin as a reserve. Currently, almost 13 countries already hold Bitcoin. The number of Bitcoins held by countries is often shrouded in mystery, but some data gives pointers to this emerging trend. Most countries with Bitcoin have seized them due to illegality or non-adherence from holders. This highlights the dilemma between the legal demands and opportunities in the sector. The daring move by El Salvador in 2021 kicked off this trajectory. However, the recent pronouncement by US President-elect Donald Trump to establish a crypto reserve has led to renewed energy. Trump was against Cryptocurrency in his first term as president, saying that crypto is not money. However, he changed his stand, and he is vocal about Cryptocurrency today.

Experts predict that the price of the Bonk coin may rise to $0.0000600. Also, they say the value of Lunex Network (LNEX) and Stellar (XLM) could cross $1 in the coming months. In the meantime, investors are taking advantage of the downtrend to stock their portfolios. Analyst Forecasts Uptrend For Bonk (BONK) Despite Price Drop The Bonk token has plunged to former lows after a recent correction. CoinMarketCap data showed its price soared to a peak of $0.000058 before it began to lose momentum. Currently, the value of Bonk (BONK) has dropped by 8.1% on the biweekly chart. Still, analysts believe the correction is just a phase. They expect another uptrend to begin in the coming days. One of such analysts is LEVERAGED_LABS.

Its Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) are flashing buy signals which means bulls are in control. So, we might see some upward movement in the next few days. Stellar (XLM) Predicted To Cross $1 The Stellar coin produced an overwhelming performance last month.

The 14D chart shows a decline of 15.3% on its price. Nevertheless, analysts are looking forward to a price surge. One of them is Arye. They believe the Stellar token is a better option than XRP. They forecast its price could increase to $0.9 in the coming months. Another analyst called PB told his followers there was a good buying opportunity at $0.3900-$0.4600. He predicts the Stellar price might rise to $2 in the coming months. Moving on to the technical indicators , the probability of this prediction is high. Stella’s relative strength index is above average, which means bulls are in charge. The Average Directional Index (14) is also in the by territory. Lunex Network (LNEX) Prices Soar to New Level Lunex Network (LNEX) is gaining attention in the DeFi market as it progresses through an appealing presale stage, where each token costs $0.0048. Lunex Network has a customizable cross-chain trading platform where one can trade over 50,000 assets across different blockchains.

According to a CoinDesk report , the election results have caused tremendous wealth gain among top leaders of crypto firms. For instance, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong received a windfall from sales of his company stock after the November 5 election. Armstrong’s stock sales alone have netted him an extra $129 million, while Coinbase’s market value has soared by $21 billion. Further, his stake in Coinbase has ballooned by nearly $2 billion since election day, which is now worth $6.4 billion. Coinbase first announced a $25 million donation to the super political action committee Fairshake prior to the election. Per the report, Coinbase and Armstrong devoted a total of $74 million, matching donations made by Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). According to ‘Armstrong Plan,’ he still owns 10% of Coinbase and about 24 million shares value in his trust, a recent SEC filing revealed . In a post on X prior to the election, Armstrong explained that his stock sales were part of a diversification plan, making him invest in moonshots, but retaining the remaining majority of his shares. For the small handful of folks are looking at my latest 10b51 plan, some context: I will diversify a bit over time to make investments in moonshots, but still retain the vast majority of my Coinbase holdings. For some reason in the disclosures it doesn't show the price targets,… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) November 2, 2024 Ripple, a16z Witness Gains Post Election Additionally, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also saw huge gains after its native token XRP skyrocketed from $0.50 to $2.32 post-election. According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP delivered gains of 54.7% in the past 30 days. This has propelled its market cap to third place in the list of digital assets. “The crypto market is up over $1 trillion since Trump won,” Garlinghouse told CoinDesk. Ripple donated $73 million, while a16z put in $70 million, including amounts held over for the next election cycle in 2026. The CoinDesk report added that Garlinghouse owns more than 6% of Ripple and a large undisclosed amount in the XRP token. He is also listed among the other top U.S. billionaires. The election has driven Garlinghouse’s holdings of XRP by more than three times since the token’s price increase, it added. As a result, the CEO’s personal wealth also saw a huge surge. On the other hand, Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz from a16z, had many stakes in crypto companies. Their holdings have outpaced the money they devoted to U.S. politics after the election date.

However, a rising star has entered the spotlight: Yeti Ouro (YETIO). This innovative token captures the imagination and can potentially deliver exponential gains. Analysts speculate that a $1,000 investment in Yeti Ouro could transform into $100,000 by 2025. With a 20% holiday bonus on YETIO purchases from December 24th to 26th, along with a referral campaign and meme contest, this project creates significant excitement. Pepe Coin Price Analysis: A Resilient Meme Token Inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, Pepe Coin has become a favorite among crypto traders. After recent market turbulence, Pepe Coin price has bounced back, proving its resilience. However, its primary appeal lies in its meme-based community, with little utility to back long-term growth. 1-month Pepe price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The absence of utility leaves space for tokens like Yeti Ouro to shine. YETIO is more than another meme coin; it embodies the fun and exuberance of meme culture while providing real value through harnessing it in the Yeti Go ecosystem, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game. While Pepe Coin may find short-term hype, Yeti Ouro provides a solid argument for long-term investment. New Market Leader: Yeti Ouro Yeti Ouro is on track to be the next big thing in cryptocurrency! Yeti Ouro combines the excitement of meme coins with real-world use cases built on the Ethereum blockchain. Its ecosystem will centre on Yeti Go, an Unreal Engine-based racing game where players can obtain rewards through YETIO tokens. Yeti Ouro stands out for its approach to value creation amongst its community. Tokenomics: The token has a capped supply of 1 billion, ensuring it will always retain an element of scarcity while staking and token burns, promising long-term price increases. That’s why from December 24th to December 26th, Yeti Ouro will give a 20% bonus for all acquired tokens, the best time for investors to enter the project. The referral campaign gives users the opportunity to receive additional rewards for inviting others to participate in the presale, creating a culture of membership and joint success. Yeti Ouro also hosted other community initiatives, cementing its status as a project to watch. The current Meme Contest inspires creativity and empowers participants to receive YETIO tokens. The contest has attracted considerable attention on social media, with an offer of a prize pool worth $3,500. The 10% referral program also allows community members to cash in. By spreading their customized referral links, users can attract additional people into the ecosystem and increase their wallet balance. The Path To $100,000 Yeti Ouro stands to be a market leader through its mix of scarcity, utility, and community involvement. Analysts expect the token’s ‘meme’ status to repeat the success of early meme coins Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With finite supply and an innovative use case in the P2E gaming space, Yeti Ouro could be the ticket to huge returns for early investors. With its well-structured tokenomics and growth potential, a $1,000 investment today could result in significant gains for investors who buy into Yeti Ouro. Investors looking to get in on the ground floor of this project will find even more value in the 20% bonus over the holiday period. Join the Yeti Ouro Revolution As Pepe Coin regains strength, Yeti Ouro will emerge as the next big opportunity in cryptocurrency. With its innovative ecosystem, community-focused initiatives, and holiday bonuses, Yeti Ouro is proving to be more than just a meme coin—it’s a utility-driven token with real potential.

Bitcoin Does Not Qualify as Foreign Exchange The response stated that Japan has no detailed understanding of such movements abroad and noted that global discussions on incorporating Bitcoin into reserves are still in their early stages. “It would be difficult for the government to express a view on the specific situation,” the statement added. The government reaffirmed that under current regulations, crypto assets like Bitcoin do not qualify as foreign exchange and that Japan’s reserves are designed to stabilize foreign currency-denominated assets and bond markets. Prioritizing safety and liquidity, officials reiterated that the high volatility of cryptocurrencies is inconsistent with Japan’s reserve strategy. In the United States, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently confirmed that the Fed cannot hold Bitcoin . However, President-elect Donald Trump and some Republican lawmakers are reportedly pushing to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve .

Leading the pack are $PENGU and $FARTCOIN. Investors and enthusiasts are now speculating on whether new meme coin presales like Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) and Flockerz ($FLOCK) could follow suit. Pudgy Penguins and Fartcoin Lead Christmas Meme Coin Rally The crypto market saw an explosive rally this Christmas Eve, with meme coins stealing the spotlight. While Bitcoin reclaimed $98,000, bringing renewed enthusiasm across the sector, it was Pengu and Fartcoin that captivated investors by reaching ranks #5 and #10 in the meme coin market cap rankings. Pudgy Penguins Reaches the Meme Coin Top 5 Pengu, the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, managed to reach a market cap of over $2.2 billion and claim the fifth spot in the meme coin market cap rankings. Spiking from $0.028 on December 24 to $0.038 today, the token has experienced a substantial 35% increase in just one day. While the momentum has subsided somewhat, the meme coin managed to keep most of the gains it made. However, while in consolidation at the moment, $PENGU’s push through the descending triangle chart pattern fueled additional speculation of further price gains. The token’s performance follows its controversial launch on December 17, which initially caused Pudgy Penguins NFT prices to plummet due to a large number of airdrop claims leading to additional sell pressure. Despite early backlash from NFT holders, Pengu’s accessibility has attracted a broader investor base. Analysts now predict the token could reach $0.05 before facing significant resistance. Fartcoin’s Meteoric Rise Not to be outdone, Fartcoin has become the 10th-largest meme coin after a record-breaking post-launch rally. Recording a jaw-dropping daily price increase of 1,712.76%, Fartcoin’s surge has even garnered attention from traditional finance figures. Charlie Billelo, a prominent TradFi financial analyst, highlighted Fartcoin’s rise on Twitter, adding credibility to the coin’s momentum: “With a market cap of $1.3 billion, Fartcoin is now worth more than 786 companies in the Russel 3,000 Index.” You’ll see tradfi accounts tweet about Bitcoin from time to time, rarely ever any alts But now we see tradfi accounts blasting out 3 tweets in a row about fartcoin No other coin has had this effect pic.twitter.com/vDDTsqkJOZ — HornHairs (@CryptoHornHairs) December 19, 2024 With the meme coin market regaining investor confidence, both Pengu and Fartcoin have become symbols of the sector’s resilience. Wall Street Pepe and Flockerz Next Meme Coins to Explode? As established meme coins like Pengu and Fartcoin dominate the market, attention is shifting toward up-and-coming projects, with investors hoping to get in as early as possible and catch the best token prices. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) and Flockerz ($FLOCK) have generated significant buzz in recent days, with presales showing promising results. Wall Street Pepe combines the appeal of the Pepe meme with a clever nod to Wall Street traders, creating a narrative of beating crypto trading whales at their game that has resonated with investors. The project has been raising close to $2 million daily, raising over $35 million to date in its presale, demonstrating its potential to capture the next wave of meme coin mania. The WEPE presale’s success lies in its community-focused approach, emphasizing the utility it will provide its investors – in the form of alpha calls, trading groups and competitions, short and long calls, etc. With its launch on the horizon, analysts predict that $WEPE could rival top-tier meme coins once it hits the open market. Flockerz , a bird-themed meme coin, has also garnered substantial attention, raising close to $8 million during its presale. Built around the FlockTopia DAO, the project introduces a Vote-to-Earn protocol, rewarding participants for engaging with the community. This approach to community governance addresses a common issue in DAOs: declining member engagement over time. FLOCK tokens can currently be purchased at a discounted price of $0.00653, with staking options offering an impressive APY of up to 353%. As the presale concludes in January, investors have limited time to secure tokens before Flockerz’s exchange debut.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/pengu-fartcoin-prices-pump-wepe-flock-to-explode-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The goal behind this decision is to mitigate risks associated with the company’s reliance on Canadian dollar-denominated assets, which marks a pivotal move toward diversifying its reserves. Matador Embraces Bitcoin Citing concerns over Canada’s dependence on oil exports and rising national debt, Matador highlighted the potential devaluation and loss of purchasing power of the Canadian dollar as key motivators. As part of its strategy, the company will make an initial $4.5 million allocation to Bitcoin in December 2024. It will also consider further acquisitions through measured buying programs. The firm also plans to transition the majority of its cash reserves from CAD to USD. Matador expressed its confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value, particularly as institutional interest in the cryptocurrency continues to rise across the world. The move also aligns with a growing trend among corporations seeking to hedge against currency debasement and explore alternatives to traditional financial assets like bonds. The latest move is also expected to drive Matador’s digital gold platform, which will enable users to trade digital gold backed by reserves at the Royal Canadian Mint. The Board picked Bitcoin over alternatives due to its stability, security, and growing use by institutions, making it the strongest foundation for the project, the company said in a statement . Following the development, Sunny Ray, President of Matador, commented, “Matador’s Board and management believe in using Bitcoin to future-proof our treasury. This step also supports our mission to explore using Bitcoin as a platform for our gold-based products.” Bitcoin Adoption Boom Firms like MicroStrategy , Metaplanet , and more have ramped up their Bitcoin holdings, while others have newly joined the growing trend. New research revealed that Bitcoin’s institutional adoption has grown significantly. As reported, BTC holdings rose to 31% of total supply. MicroStrategy leads with 440,000 BTC, worth over $46 billion. Meanwhile, ETFs have attracted large inflows, while the US, China, and El Salvador maintain substantial reserves. Combined, governments hold 2.45% of Bitcoin’s circulation, which is almost $49.36 billion. Additionally, several US states, including Ohio , Pennsylvania, and Texas, are exploring Bitcoin reserves as a strategy to safeguard public funds and adapt to modern financial innovations.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

ETH was able to climb above the $3,400 and $3,420 resistance levels. The price even cleared the $3,500 resistance level. However, the bears remained active below the $3,550 level. A high was formed at $3,535 and the price is now consolidating gains. It declined and traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,225 swing low to the $3,534 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,455 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,525 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,550. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,620 resistance. An upside break above the $3,620 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,680 resistance zone or even $3,750. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,550 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,455 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,375 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,225 swing low to the $3,534 high. A clear move below the $3,375 support might push the price toward the $3,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,110. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Imagine being one of the early adopters who turned small investments into massive wealth. For many, that opportunity came and went, leaving latecomers watching from the sidelines, wondering if another chance like WIF would ever come around. Well, here’s the good news: history is repeating itself, but this time with BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Taking the meme coin craze to unprecedented heights, BTFD Coin combines innovation with community-driven momentum. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, lucrative 90% APY staking rewards, and a referral programme that rewards loyal supporters, BTFD is rewriting the rulebook on what a meme coin can achieve. And right now, thanks to a festive 50% presale price rollback—offering tokens at just $0.000064—there’s never been a better time to seize the dip. Use the code BIG50 before January 5, 2025, and claim your spot in what could be the year’s biggest crypto opportunity. BTFD Coin: Your Next Big Opportunity For those who felt left out of the WIF surge, BTFD Coin is here to rewrite your crypto story. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BTFD embraces the iconic “Buy The Dip” philosophy, offering investors the chance to seize market lows and ride the highs. Currently, in its 12th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.000064, following a festive 50% price rollback. The presale has already raised over $4.5 million, with more than 59 billion tokens sold to 6,600+ bullish holders. But what makes BTFD stand out? Beyond its catchy name and presale buzz, this token offers real utility: Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game : The beta version of BTFD’s P2E game went live during Stage 10 of the presale, creating excitement among gamers and investors alike. Although rewards aren’t available during the beta, the full launch promises a unique way to earn while playing. 90% APY Staking Rewards : Staking went live on December 2, 2024, offering investors a generous 90% annual percentage yield. This feature alone makes BTFD a strong contender for both short-term gains and long-term growth. Referral Programme : The BTFD Rewards Programme incentivises community growth by offering 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens to top referrers. Massive ROI Potential : Starting at $0.000004 per coin, BTFD has already delivered an 837.5% ROI in its presale stages. Analysts predict a listing price of $0.0006, representing significant upside potential for early investors. Let’s break down what a $2,000 investment at the current presale price of $0.000064 could mean for you. You’d acquire approximately 31.25 million BTFD tokens . When the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your initial investment could grow to $18,750—a staggering 837.5% return! Dogwifhat (WIF): The Wealth You Missed Dogwifhat burst onto the Solana blockchain as a meme coin with a twist, quickly gaining attention for its rapid price swings and high-risk, high-reward nature. As of December 2024, WIF is trading at $2.01 with a market cap of $2 billion, but it wasn’t always this way. In its early days, WIF was available for a fraction of its current price, offering massive wealth-building potential to those who dared to invest early. The allure of Dogwifhat was its community-driven approach combined with the Solana network’s speed and efficiency. Early investors saw their portfolios skyrocket as WIF gained popularity. However, many newcomers found themselves chasing the hype too late, missing the golden window of opportunity. Analysts often cite WIF as a textbook example of why timing is critical in crypto investing. But the glory days of WIF don’t have to be a distant memory. History has a habit of repeating itself, and the ongoing BTFD presale is shaping up to be the next big thing in the meme coin world. Why Act Now? The crypto market rewards decisiveness. Just like the early days of WIF, BTFD Coin is presenting an unparalleled opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor. With over 59 billion coins already sold, this presale won’t last forever. The festive 50% discount (using the code BIG50 ) ends on January 5, 2025, making this the perfect time to act. Here’s how you can secure your BTFD Coin tokens: Visit the BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter the bonus code BIG50 to unlock the 50% discount. Specify the number of tokens you want to buy and confirm your purchase. It’s as simple as that. Don’t let another opportunity slip through your fingers. Conclusion: From WIF to BTFD—Your Second Chance Awaits Dogwifhat gave early investors a chance to generate life-changing wealth, but many missed out. Now, BTFD Coin is the ongoing top crypto presale , offering innovation, community-driven growth, and massive earning potential. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and referral incentives, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. So, don’t wait. Join the BTFD community today and claim your stake before the presale ends. Remember, the biggest gains come to those who act early. Will you be among them?

This $0.003 Token Will Soar Past $10 Faster,"As Solana (SOL) continues to make waves with its high-speed blockchain capabilities, investors are speculating whether it can achieve the ambitious $1,100 price target by Q1 2025. While Solana’s strong ecosystem and past performance are encouraging, a new contender— Lightchain AI (LCAI) —is drawing significant attention. Priced at just $0.003, LCAI is gaining traction for its potential to surpass $10 in value even more rapidly. With cutting-edge technology and an accessible entry point, LCAI may outpace some of the most established altcoins in the upcoming bull market. Solana’s Journey to $1,100 Prospects and Challenges Solana has come up as a top blockchain place, known for its fast deals and growth, mostly thanks to its smart Proof of History (PoH) way of agreeing. This ease has pulled in builders looking at shared money (DeFi) apps and unique tokens (NFTs). Yet, Solana has faced problems that could affect its chance to hit $1,100. Most importantly, t͏he network has had a few shutdowns, bringing up worries about its trustworthiness and central control. These breaks have caused doubts about the network’s ability for big business use. Also, Solana sees more rivals from old platforms like Ethereum and new ones such as Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI joins smart thinking with blockchain tech, giving better tools that attract a wide mix of fields. Market state, with rules that are not clear and swings, add to the troubles around Solana’s price path. While some thinkers feel good, guessing that Solana might hit $1,100 in this strong rise, other warn to be careful saying of the told problems. Lightchain AI (LCAI) $0.003 Gem With Unmatched Growth Potential While Solana battles scalability and stiff competition, Lightchain AI is storming onto the scene, blending blockchain with artificial intelligence in a way that’s turning heads. This altcoin isn’t just another player—it’s a game-changer, tackling real-world problems with cutting-edge tech and paving the way for explosive growth. Here’s why Lightchain AI is the project everyone’s buzzing about. Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism (PoI) Goodbye, outdated mining systems! Lightchain’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) flips the script. Instead of wasting resources on pointless computations, PoI incentivizes AI-powered tasks that actually matter—like solving real problems while being environmentally friendly. That’s right, it’s green tech with purpose! 2. Real Utility with AIVM Forget blockchains with vague promises. The AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) is the secret sauce fueling AI-focused decentralized apps (dApps). From predictive modeling to natural language processing (NLP), developers are already calling this the smartest platform for their big ideas. It’s not just promises—it’s real utility in action. 3. Numbers That Make You Double-Take A presale price of $0.003? You don’t see that every day for a project this innovative. Let’s break it down. $300 gets you 100,000 $LCAI tokens. If $LCAI hits $1 by 2025 (a very real possibility), that’s $100,000 in your pocket. Investors who got in early on Solana and Binance Coin saw similar mind-blowing gains—now it’s Lightchain AI’s turn. 4. A Rock-Solid Roadmap (With Real Progress) This is no “fly-by-night” operation. The Lightchain Roadmap is detailed, transparent, and already delivering. Phase 1 Prototype Development + Community Building Phase 2 Testnet Rollout + Performance Tweaks Phase 3 Mainnet Launch Testnets? Up and running. Validator nodes? Ready to roll. Partnerships? Already in the works. 2024 is going to be huge, and if Lightchain AI nails even half of its roadmap, 100x gains might sound conservative. Why AI-Blockchain Crossovers Are the Future The buzz around AI and blockchain isn’t just hype—it’s a full-blown revolution. Together, these two technologies are set to transform industries like fintech, healthcare, and beyond. What makes Lightchain AI special? Transparent governance through decentralization Boosted productivity in machine learning tasks Privacy-first frameworks for trustless data sharing This is Web3 innovation at its peak—solving today’s problems while building tomorrow’s solutions. AI alone is exciting, but when paired with blockchain, its potential is amplified. Ready to dive into the project that’s redefining the game? Lightchain AI isn’t just following trends—it’s creating them. Why Smart Investors Are Betting on Lightchain AI The key to massive crypto gains lies in early-stage investments, and Lightchain AI (LCAI) is ticking all the boxes. With a low entry point of just $0.003, LCAI is accessible to investors of all sizes. Unlike many speculative tokens, it offers real-world utility through its AI integration, addressing practical needs. Momentum is building as both institutional and retail investors take notice, with its presale success hinting at explosive future growth. What truly sets Lightchain AI apart is its innovative technology, blending AI and blockchain in a way that outshines the competition. As it prepares for its token launch, LCAI is a project to watch for potential 100x gains. Whether Solana hits $1,100 by Q1 2025 or not, Lightchain AI is positioned to soar past $10 in record time. Why Lightchain AI Is the Future of AI and Blockchain It’s clear that Lightchain AI is a project with immense potential, offering investors a unique opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for AI and blockchain integration. With its efficient consensus mechanism, real utility, low entry point, and solid roadmap, the project is well-positioned to capture a share of the booming DeFi market. Furthermore, Lightchain AI brings much-needed innovation to the blockchain industry by tackling real-world problems with cutting-edge technology. As other projects struggle with scalability and competition, Lightchain AI stands out as an innovative solution that has already gained traction among developers and investors alike. If you’re looking for a project that not only promises growth but also offers tangible utility and a strong development roadmap, look no further than Lightchain AI. It’s not just a gem—it’s the future of AI and blockchain.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

Whatever your reason, the crypto world is buzzing with updates, and savvy investors are keeping their eyes on the top altcoins to buy now. Recent news about Immutable X and Bitcoin Cash has stirred the market, but the standout opportunity is Qubetics ($TICS), an ambitious project redefining blockchain interoperability. This article will delve into the developments of all three coins: Qubetics, Immutable X, and Bitcoin Cash. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Interoperability In today’s blockchain ecosystem, fragmentation is a major hurdle. Many networks operate in silos, making it difficult for data, assets, and functionality to flow seamlessly across different chains. This disconnect slows innovation and limits the potential of decentralised applications. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), an innovative project to unify diverse networks into a single, collaborative Web3 framework . By integrating cross-chain functionality, Qubetics paves the way for smooth asset transfers and efficient data sharing. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s a bridge for ecosystems, empowering developers, enterprises, and users alike. Imagine a world where decentralised technologies operate without barriers—Qubetics is making that a reality.

This recovery follows a sharp 14.5% correction from its $108,275 all-time high on Dec. 17. Despite the recent volatility, Bitcoin derivatives maintained a neutral-to-bullish stance, supporting the potential for a rally above $105,000. Derivatives Signal Market Optimism Bitcoin futures monthly contracts are trading at a 12% premium over spot prices, signaling strong demand for leveraged long positions. Premiums between 5% and 10% are considered neutral, making the current level robust. Additionally, Bitcoin put (sell) options are at a 2% discount compared to call (buy) options. When significant corrections are expected, this indicator typically exceeds 6%, showing a preference for puts. Traditional Market Recovery Boosts Bitcoin Traditional financial markets also supported Bitcoin’s recent rise above $98,000. The S&P 500 index erased its monthly losses on Dec. 24, and the US 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.59%, up from 4.23% two weeks earlier. Higher Treasury yields often reflect inflation expectations, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more attractive during economic uncertainty. Economic Concerns and Stagnation Fears Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 index remains high at 64%, tying its performance to broader economic trends. The US Federal Reserve has reduced its 2025 interest rate-cut projections from four to two, lowering the immediate risks to corporate earnings and real estate markets. Margin and Derivatives Markets Stay Bullish On OKX, the Bitcoin long-to-short margin ratio is at 25x in favor of longs. Excessive confidence typically pushes this ratio above 40x, while bearish sentiment sees it drop below 5x.

However, the real excitement builds around Qubetics ($TICS) and its game-changing wallet innovation alongside a red-hot presale. This article will discuss the latest developments and updates for Qubetics, Stellar, and Monero, the top coins to buy and hold now.

As of the latest update, the digital asset trades around $0.43 and consolidates within a bullish flag formation. Notably, a renowned analyst, Dark Defender, highlighted a critical resistance level at $0.6367. Once this level is breached, XLM could target the $0.9203 Fibonacci level, marking a significant third wave in its Elliott Wave pattern. The ultimate target for the fifth wave is $2.3961, showcasing Stellar’s potential for upward growth. With such promising technical indicators, Stellar is undoubtedly a contender among the top coins to buy and hold now, offering robust potential for both short-term and long-term gains.

Qubetics Presale: Unmissable Opportunities in Phase 14 If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to invest, here it is. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 14, and the momentum is electrifying. Each phase brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% hike in the final stage. Currently priced at $0.037 per $TICS token, the presale has already raised an impressive $7.8 million. The structured price increase fuels a sense of urgency among investors, making Qubetics a compelling opportunity. Early adopters stand to gain significantly as the presale progresses, aligning perfectly with its growing reputation as one of the top coins to buy and hold now . With its innovative wallet and forward-thinking approach, Qubetics isn’t just building a cryptocurrency; it’s creating a legacy. Conclusion: A Future Filled with Promise Stellar ($XLM), Monero ($XMR), and Qubetics ($TICS) each bring unique strengths to the table. Stellar’s technical patterns point towards significant price surges, and Monero continues to dominate the privacy niche. However, Qubetics steals the spotlight with its innovative wallet and an electrifying presale.

38121478,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53135,1735177554,Failed to Join Stellar’s Groundbreaking Start? Discover Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Investment Opportunity of the Decade,"The cryptocurrency market is always evolving, and every few years, a project comes along that changes the game. Remember Stellar (XLM)? It launched as a bold new project aimed at revolutionising cross-border payments, and those who got in early have reaped the rewards. From empowering unbanked communities to creating efficient global payment systems, Stellar made its mark as a forward-thinking blockchain solution. But if you missed Stellar’s early rocket ride, don’t fret. Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping up as the best crypto presale to buy this week, combining cutting-edge technology with practical real-world applications. With its ongoing presale already raising over $7.8 million, Qubetics is positioning itself as the investment opportunity of the decade. Qubetics ($TICS): A Game-Changer for Everyday Crypto Transactions Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency—it’s a revolution in usability. At its core lies the multi-chain wallet, a tool designed to simplify crypto management for businesses, professionals, and everyday users alike. Unlike traditional wallets, Qubetics enables seamless transactions across multiple blockchains, making it an essential tool for anyone navigating the complex world of digital currencies. Imagine you’re a business owner running a global e-commerce store. You want to accept crypto payments but don’t want to deal with volatility or complicated conversions. Enter Qubetics. Its smart contract conversion mechanism instantly converts crypto payments into fiat currency at the point of sale, ensuring financial stability for your business. Now picture a freelancer working with international clients. Payments come in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptos, but managing these assets is often a hassle. With Qubetics, payments are converted into local currency instantly, streamlining financial management and eliminating unnecessary stress. Even for the average crypto investor, Qubetics is a game-changer. Its multi-chain compatibility allows users to manage diverse portfolios effortlessly, swapping tokens across blockchains with ease. Plus, integration with everyday tools like Apple Pay and Google Pay makes crypto transactions feel as simple as using a debit card. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, with over 376 million tokens sold and $7.8 million raised so far. Currently priced at $0.0377, $TICS tokens are a steal in their 14th presale stage. But don’t wait too long—the price is set to rise by 10% in Stage 15 this weekend. If you’re on the hunt for the best crypto presale to buy this week, Qubetics is your golden ticket. Stellar (XLM): A Blockchain Veteran with a Global Vision Stellar is a name that’s hard to ignore in the blockchain space. Launched with the goal of revolutionising cross-border payments, Stellar aimed to create a decentralised network that could handle international transactions faster and cheaper than traditional banking systems. Its mission to connect unbanked populations with the global financial system has earned it a loyal following and a solid reputation. Stellar’s real-world partnerships set it apart. Collaborations with financial institutions, NGOs, and governments have helped it build a strong use case for its technology. From facilitating low-cost remittances to enabling microtransactions, Stellar has proven its ability to deliver on its promises. The crypto’s price trajectory has been impressive as well, with analysts predicting continued growth as more industries adopt its technology. However, for new investors, Stellar may not offer the same explosive growth potential it did during its early days. Its established position in the market makes it a stable choice, but the biggest gains have already been realised by its earliest backers. For those who missed out on Stellar’s rise, Qubetics offers an exciting alternative, combining innovation, real-world applicability, and early-stage investment potential. How Qubetics Stands Out While both Qubetics and Stellar share a commitment to real-world impact, their approaches differ significantly. Stellar focuses on revolutionising international payments and connecting the unbanked, while Qubetics aims to make crypto accessible for everyone, regardless of their experience level or technical expertise. Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet is a standout feature, bridging the gap between crypto and everyday life. By integrating with familiar tools like Apple Pay and Google Pay, it ensures that using crypto is as easy as tapping your phone. Whether you’re managing a diverse investment portfolio or accepting payments as a business owner, Qubetics provides the tools you need to succeed. Stellar may have paved the way for global payment innovation, but Qubetics is taking things a step further by solving usability issues and catering to a broader audience. For those looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week , Qubetics offers a unique opportunity to invest in the future of blockchain technology. The cryptocurrency market is full of stories about missed opportunities, but it also offers plenty of second chances. Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the most exciting opportunities of the decade, with its innovative wallet, practical solutions, and massive early success. If you regret missing out on Stellar’s early days, now’s your chance to make up for it. With $7.8 million raised and over 376 million tokens sold, Qubetics is proving that it has what it takes to make waves in the crypto world. Don’t wait until the 15th stage kicks in with a 10% price hike—secure your $TICS tokens today and position yourself for future success.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others.

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 103,200 followers on the social media platform X that Dogecoin may be following in the footsteps of its 2017 and 2021 market cycles when the memecoin ignited a meteoric ascent after witnessing a severe correction. “In 2017, when Dogecoin began a parabolic run, it surged 212%, retraced 40%, then rallied 5,000%. In 2021, it went up 476%, retraced 56%, then skyrocketed 12,000%. Now, in 2024, DOGE is up 440% and has retraced by 46%. If history repeats, another parabolic rally is on the way!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, it seems that he predicts Dogecoin will soar above $1 if his parabolic rally materializes. Zooming in, Martinez says DOGE is flashing a bullish signal on the daily chart based on the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator. Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. “The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Dogecoin DOGE daily chart, anticipating a price rebound!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.32. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the trader says that the crypto king may be mirroring its early 2024 price action when it breached an immediate support level before triggering new rallies. “Throw it back! Bitcoin BTC.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that Bitcoin will briefly dip below $90,000 if it follows the early 2024 pattern. At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $94,133.

Shiba Inu, the “Dogecoin killer” that began as a meme, went from zero to a market cap in the billions, making early investors look like geniuses. Those lucky enough to scoop up Shiba Inu in its ICO at a minuscule price are now sitting pretty, while others are left asking, “Why didn’t I buy in earlier?” But here’s the good news: If you missed out on Shiba Inu’s ICO, BTFD Coin is your second chance at redemption. The presale for BTFD Coin is already crushing it, with over $4.5 million raised and nearly 60 billion coins sold. Now, with a 50% discount available using the BIG50 code, this is your opportunity to buy in at a price that could make you the next crypto success story. It’s the same kind of savvy move that was made back in 1973 during the oil market crash, where those who bought in during the panic were rewarded with significant gains when prices recovered. And just like those investors, you can seize this moment and potentially watch your investment grow. The Shiba Inu ICO: Making Millionaires Overnight Let’s rewind to 2020 when Shiba Inu launched its ICO. Initially priced at next to nothing, Shiba Inu seemed like a joke to many, but it turned out to be one of the most successful meme coins in history. The Shiba Inu community, or Shiba Army, grew quickly, and the coin’s popularity reached new heights with the celebrity endorsement of Elon Musk and other crypto moguls. The ICO price? Just a tiny fraction of a cent. And yet, today, Shiba Inu’s market cap is valued at 13 billion dollars. If you missed the chance to buy Shiba Inu at its ICO price, you’re probably thinking, “What if I had invested then?” Well, that moment has passed, but don’t let that be the end of your meme coin journey. BTFD Coin is here to offer a fresh opportunity, and it’s got everything to make waves just like Shiba Inu did. BTFD Coin: A New Era of Meme Coins, With Massive Potential BTFD Coin is poised to take over where Shiba Inu left off. The presale is well underway, and things are looking spectacular. With over $4.5 million raised, a growing community of 6,600 bulls, and a promising roadmap, BTFD Coin is on a fast track to success. The coin is currently priced at $0.000064 thanks to the BIG50 code, giving you more bang for your buck. So, why should you care about BTFD Coin? Let’s break it down: Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game: BTFD Coin’s P2E game offers rewards and engages the community in a fun way, making the token even more valuable for holders. Staking Rewards: Get rewarded handsomely with an APY of 90%, which means you can sit back, stake your tokens, and watch your portfolio grow. The Bulls Squad: This is no ordinary community. The Bulls Squad is a group of passionate investors committed to growing BTFD Coin and supporting each other’s investments. They’re your crypto family, rooting for success! A History-Inspired Move But here’s the kicker: the 50% discount on BTFD Coin’s presale is inspired by a historic event—the 1973 oil market crash. During this time, savvy investors realised that buying assets at their lowest point during times of panic was the smartest move. After the crash, the oil market rebounded, and those who made the purchase saw huge returns. The BIG50 code is BTFD Coin’s version of this strategy —an opportunity to buy in when prices are still low before the market takes off. It’s your chance to make a bold, strategic move. Let’s translate that into numbers: if you invest $4,000 at the presale price of $0.000064, you’ll get approximately 62,500,000 BTFD Coins. Hopefully, the coin will hit its predicted value of $0.0006 post-launch, and your investment could skyrocket to $37,500—that’s a 9x return! How to Buy BTFD Coin at the Discounted Price Noq Ready to grab your BTFD Coin while the price is still reduced? Here’s how (but act fast!): Head to the Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and choose your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Apply the Discount Code: In the Bonus Code field, enter BIG50 and click “Apply”. This will unlock your 50% discount. Select Your Purchase: Choose the amount of $BTFD you’d like to buy and double-check the discounted price. Confirm Your Purchase: Hit “Buy Now”, approve the transaction in your wallet, and you’re in! Conclusion: Invest in BTFD Coin’s Presale at the 50% Discount Today Shiba Inu may have had its moment, but BTFD Coin is the new wave —and with its 50% discount, this is the perfect time to get involved. With a promising presale, a Play-to-Earn game, 90% staking rewards, and a passionate community behind it, BTFD Coin is ready to make a big splash in the crypto world. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by! Use the BIG50 code today, get your discounted coins, and become part of the Bulls Squad before the price takes off after January 5th.

He was accused by some of creating false visuals and spreading misinformation because he used generative AI to create the photos. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted airspace, Keyzer couldn’t travel anymore and chose to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to produce a series of photographs about Russia. The AI-generated photos of Russia were included in his book Putin’s Dream , which was released in November. Creating Putin’s Dream To create the AI photos series, De Keyzer used real photos of Russia. Apparently, he visited Russia twelve times in a single year during the late 1980s. During the last days of the USSR, De Keyzer took pictures of the customs that would soon be lost. He has more photos from inside the prison camps in Siberia, which were taken in the 2000s. De Keyzer uploaded his own photos from the 80s and 2000s into an AI software. He then modified the output to fit his aesthetic preferences , and produced the Putin’s Dream series , The photojournalist explained that the usage of generative AI as a tool was for reflecting on the atrocities of the war in Ukraine, which was essentially the result of one man’s imagination. De Keyzer, who is pleased with the outcome, claims that the new visuals he has included in Putin’s Dream are a reflection of his earlier photography, which frequently examined power structures and propaganda. The artist sought to produce realistic AI-generated photos while fusing his trademark comedy, surrealism, and irony. His Instagram post announcing Putin’s Dream was met with scathing criticism despite his openness about utilizing AI. Many people called the photographs “fake,” but he also received some good feedback applauding the creative approach to photography. Magnum Photos, an international photographic cooperative, faced criticism as well since De Keyzer is a part of it . A week after , Magnum published a response on its website . “Magnum Photos respects and values the creative freedom of our photographers, supporting their diverse explorations and perspectives.” Other Magnum members like Jonas Bendiksen and Michael Christopher Brown have been experimenting with AI-generated photos. De Keyzer isn’t the only artist who faced backlash for using AI. Boris Eldagsen experienced criticism too, after winning the Sony World Photography Prize with an AI image. People create 34 million AI images daily Between 2022 and 2023, text-to-image AI algorithms produced over 15 billion images. An average of 34 million photos have been created every day since the debut of DALLE-2 . Adobe Firefly, a collection of AI algorithms integrated into Adobe Photoshop, is the product with the quickest rate of growth. Within three months of its introduction, it had produced one billion photographs. Midjourney has the highest number of users, with 15 million members , compared to other image generation platforms . In contrast, 30 million people use Adobe Creative Cloud, which includes graphic design and video editing tools, such as the generative AI tool Adobe Firefly. Roughly 80% of the photos, or 12.59 billion, were produced using open-source LLM models, platforms, and apps based on Stable Diffusion.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field.
