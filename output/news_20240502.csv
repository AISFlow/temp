Aiming to combine the capabilities of both blockchains, Eclipse has consolidated the compatibility between the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) by deploying Neon Stack. Solana And Ethereum Integration The primary objective of this collaboration is to integrate Solana’s transaction handling capabilities, which can process thousands of transactions per second, into Ethereum. Related Reading: Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion XRP From Escrow – How Will This Impact Price? This integration will be facilitated by Neon Stack, a standardized development stack that enables smart contract developers to achieve Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility on Solana Virtual Machine-based blockchain networks. Eclipse plans to leverage Neon Stack on its SVM L2 to facilitate this integration. The Neon Stack consists of Neon EVM smart contracts and Neon Proxy. It has been live on the Solana mainnet since July 2023. It has deployed numerous Ethereum-native Solidity decentralized applications (dApps), including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), on Solana from its existing codebase. Neon EVM-Eclipse Partnership For Cross-Chain Development Davide Menegaldo, Chief Commercial Officer (COO) of Neon EVM, expressed enthusiasm for Neon Stack and the collaboration, stating: With Neon Stack, we are paving the way for high-performance, scalable dApps infrastructure that transcends the limitations of traditional blockchain architectures and redefines computational efficiency. We are pleased to see Eclipse as the first industry partner to utilize the Neon Stack. On the other hand, Neel Somani, founder of Eclipse Labs, the company behind the development of the Layer 2 blockchain, also emphasized the importance of the partnership, saying: Our collaboration with Neon Stack enables developers to seamlessly deploy their dApps from EVM chains to Eclipse, further strengthening the harmonization between Solana and Ethereum. Solidity developers who wish to build on a high-performance L2 that leverages the strengths of the SVM can finally do so.” Interestingly, the Ethereum ecosystem hosts over 13,000 dApps, with only a small fraction, 0.4%, cross-chained with Solana. This collaboration between Neon EVM and Eclipse could also provide further opportunities for developers to build new dApps with the new integration. Related Reading: Whales Dive In, But Dogecoin Price Sinks 20%: What’s Going On? In sum, it is believed that developers will be able to build advanced dApps that leverage the features of Ethereum and Solana, along with their respective native ecosystems and virtual machines, by leveraging the design of the NEON Stack and Eclipse. As of the current update, the native token of NEON EVM, NEON, is trading at $1.0135. It has shown a 2.6% recovery over the past 24 hours, aligning with the overall positive movement in the cryptocurrency market. However, during the past 7 days, the token has witnessed a price decline, experiencing a nearly 8% drop.

Morgan cautious on crypto with retreat by retail investors, dearth of upside drivers","Retail investors selling off cryptocurrencies alongside other headwinds is keeping J.P. Morgan cautious toward the market. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) finished sharply lower in April, sinking 15% for the first monthly loss since August 2023. It traded close to $59,000 on Thursday, much lower than its all-time high above $73,000 in March. “The past two weeks saw significant selling/profit taking with perhaps retail investors playing a bigger role than institutional investors,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a Thursday note. Spot bitcoin ETFs logged outflows in April and retail investors appeared to have sold both crypto and equity assets during last month’s trade, the firm said. Panigirtzoglou also said the market is facing a trio of headwinds consisting of elevated positioning, high bitcoin prices compared with gold as well as estimated bitcoin production costs, and subdued crypto funding by venture capitalists. “In all, with a lack of positive catalysts, with the retail impulse dissipating and with the three headwinds mentioned … still in place, we maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets over the near term,” Panigirtzoglou said. In terms of institutional investors, J.P. Morgan said it’s mostly momentum traders such as Commodity Trading Advisors or other quantitative funds taking profit on previous extreme long positions in bitcoin as well as in gold.

26748935,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606284,1714687241,Ethereum “Has Been A Major Disappointment”: Trader Weighs In On This Crypto Cycle,"This crypto cycle achieved some remarkable feats during Q1 2024, including the highest monthly and quarterly close in Bitcoin (BTC) history. However, BTC suffered a retrace that dragged Ethereum (ETH) and the rest of the crypto market down as the year’s second quarter started. Now that we are one month into Q2, the market faces another correction. The most recent retrace became the deepest of the cycle, with Bitcoin nosediving into the $57,000 support zone and Ethereum falling below $3,000. Despite the market’s stumble, analysts remain optimistic for what’s to come. Related Reading: Is This Cycle’s Bitcoin Bottom In? Analysts Forecast BTC Bounce Back What Makes This Cycle Different? Traders and analysts have urged investors not to panic about the retraces yet. A broader look shows that the market is above levels not seen since the last bull run. As many have discussed, there’s a significant resemblance between this cycle’s performance and previous ones. However, analysts have also pointed out the singularities of this bull run. Compared to the 2020 cycle, altcoins “didn’t even run that hard over the last few months,” as renowned analyst Altcoin Sherpa highlighted. After Wednesday’s correction, trader and economist Alex Krüger weighed in on this cycle’s performance. Krüger concurs with some of Sherpa’s points, considering that the market’s “too many” options have made the playfield more convoluted. Some thoughts on the current crypto cycle #1 The crypto cycle has been almost entirely driven by the bitcoin ETF. #2 ETH has been a major disappointment, but it has performed well overall for stakers and airdrop farmers. #3 Solana established itself as the chain of choice for… — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) May 1, 2024 Similarly, he also has noticed the desire “to focus on making a quick buck” and investing in “short-term hype rather than on longevity.” The trader highlighted that the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have “almost entirely” driven this cycle. Besides BTC, memecoins have been the dominating narrative of the bull run, ranking among the top gainers of Q1 2024. Moreover, Krüger asserted that most market participants who missed the Bitcoin ETF run “went all in on altcoins to compensate.” As a result: They deployed late and poorly, going in larger at higher levels, and are now seething and at a loss, as too many altcoins have given up their entire 2024 gains in the last month. Ethereum “Disappointing” Run One of the crucial points of Krüger’s analysis is Ethereum’s overall unsatisfactory performance. To the crypto veteran, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization “has been a major disappointment” even though it has performed well for stakers and farmers. Despite seeing massive gains alongside Bitcoin’s run, Ethereum has not been able to challenge its all-time high (ATH) price set over two years ago. Furthermore, Solana overtook Ethereum after “establishing itself as the chain of choice for retail traders.” It’s worth noting that the turmoil surrounding Ether and the Ethereum Network has seemingly affected the token’s recent performance. The “king of altcoins” is currently facing severe regulatory scrutiny. The suspicion of a spot Ether ETF rejection from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alongside the news of the agency’s investigation on the asset’s classification as an “unregistered security,” seems to have created uncertainty around ETH. Ethereum’s current landscape has reignited deeming conversations against its founders and the asset, possibly fueling the doubtful sentiment surrounding a sector of the crypto community. Despite the challenging landscape, many analysts consider that investors should not be bearish on Ethereum. After falling 4.5% and 14.39% in the weekly and monthly timeframes, ETH has recovered 3.3% of its price in the past 24 hours. Ultimately, Krüger’s consideration concludes that “the cycle is not over.” However, he points out that investors “need to move out of the panic area and reignite the majors” before finding a new narrative for this run.

26746364,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606182,1714683643,"Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Descending Triangle Like It Did In 2021, Analyst Sets $6 Target","The Dogecoin price action seems to have turned bearish after a bearish close to April. Projections for the meme cryptocurrency are not bullish in the short term, especially considering the fact that it is now experiencing a 47% price correction from its highest point in the current market cycle. Despite its recent plunge, one analyst believes all is still well with Dogecoin, and the crypto asset is only gearing up for a bull run into new price territories. Dogecoin Repeating Behavior From Previous Bull Run According to a recent analysis by popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Dogecoin’s current price action is setting up for a potential bull run, despite the cryptocurrency’s ongoing price correction. His analysis is based on interesting patterns on the Dogecoin price chart. Although they are a very volatile asset class, patterns are an interesting way to predict the future movement of cryptocurrencies. Now, Dogecoin appears to be repeating some of the same patterns that led to its massive breakout in 2017 and 2021. Specifically, Dogecoin broke out of a descending triangle pattern in the last quarter of 2023, a seemingly occurring trend and a first step for the cryptocurrency. As Martinez noted, the first time this breakout happened was in 2017. However, DOGE went on a 40% correction shortly after before resuming a 982% bull run. Again, a similar breakout of a descending triangle in 2021 saw the crypto retracing by 56% before skyrocketing by 12,197% to reach its current all-time high of $0.7316. Now, in 2024, #DOGE has yet again broken out of a descending triangle! It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next $DOGE bull run! pic.twitter.com/ZmuHmvIwei — Ali (@ali_charts) May 1, 2024 Now, the recent DOGE correction in the past month after breaking out of a descending triangle means the crypto could be gearing up for a similar bounce up. According to the DOGE price chart shared by Martinez, the first step is breaking above resistance at $0.224. If it can hurdle that level, it opens up a run back to the 2021 high and a push-up to a first target of around $1.2. Looking further out, Martinez’s chart shows an ultimate price surge above $6 in this bull cycle. For this to happen, Dogecoin would need to regain momentum and rally over 4,700% from current levels over the coming months. While this price point looks overachieving, Dogecoin has pulled off epic rallies before, surging over 12,000% at one point in 2021 alone. It has only been a few months into 2024 Dogecoin has already been on a wild ride this year along with the rest of the crypto market. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.125 and is down by 16.92% in the past seven days. Trading volume is up by 50% in the past 24 hours, which suggests a return of investor interest.

26741533,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606257,1714676447,Bitcoin Slump Pushes New Whales Underwater: A Rare Opportunity To Buy?,"As Bitcoin slumps, on-chain data by Ki Young Ju, the founder of the blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, paints a stark picture: all new whales, including holders of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are now underwater. New Whales And Spot ETF Investors Are In Red Taking to X, Ju said that more losses would be incoming, predicting that HODLers will find “max pain” at around $51,000. The dip is less than $10,000 from spot rates, suggesting that although there are cracks, the correction might not be deep. Related Reading: Whales Dive In, But Dogecoin Price Sinks 20%: What’s Going On? This overview is welcomed, considering the recent sell-off. Even so, predicting price bottoms in a fast-moving market influenced by multiple forces is tough. As price action stands, Ju says believers may take the opportunity to double down on the coin. The founder adds that the current price discount presents an opportunity for savvy investors to outperform traditional finance whales, including institutions with BTC exposure via spot ETFs in the United States. Bitcoin is under immense liquidation pressure at the time of this writing. Though bulls soaked up the sell-off earlier today, the coin remains within a bearish breakout. Prices are trading below the support zone of between $60,000 and $61,000 and below April 2024. Inflow To Spot Bitcoin ETFs Decline As Sentiment Deteriorate This formation suggests that though bulls are optimistic, the path of least resistance remains southwards for now. BTC dropped after posting impressive returns from October 2023 to March 2024, when prices peaked. Some analysts think the current cool-off is inevitable following sharp gains in the last six months. The fact that whales are underwater was unexpected, considering the state of affairs in the last week of April. Then, the inflow from new whales nearly doubled the cumulative holdings of older whales. Analysts said this influx of fresh capital pointed to growing institutional interest. However, looking at the current price action, new whales are now in the red territory, and their excitement seems to wane. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Predicts What To Expect Now According to Lookonchain data, inflow into the eight-spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, has stalled. On May 1, all issuers, including Grayscale via GBTC, decreased by 1,950 BTC. Of note is that BlackRock’s IBIT has not seen inflows for five straight days. Still, confidence abounds. Inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are highly influenced by sentiment, which rests on how prices perform. If BTC shakes off the current weakness and tears higher in the expected post-Halving rally, spot ETF issuers will begin receiving new inflows.

The surveillance system includes international sanctions compliance and illicit transfer detection that could be associated with activities like terrorist financing, and would help Tether identify crypto wallets that could ""pose risks or may be associated with illicit and/or sanctioned addresses,"" according to Tether's blog post.  ""Our collaboration with Chainalysis marks a pivotal step in our ongoing commitment to establishing transparency and security within the cryptocurrency industry,"" Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.  The action comes as pressure from regulators and policymakers globally is mounting on Tether for USDT's alleged role to circumvent international sanctions and facilitate illicit finance. Venezuela's state-run oil company reportedly has been using USDT to bypass U.S. sanctions.

26739225,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606179,1714672809,"Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Must Hold Above $51,800 As ETF Outflows Trigger Crash","The Bitcoin price continues to trend below $60,000 as a 20% decline triggered a brutal market-wide crash. This has exposed multiple critical support points for the cryptocurrency, some of which the price has already fallen below. In light of this, a crypto analyst known as Norok has revealed the level the BTC price must not fall below to maintain its bullish trend. Bitcoin Price Must Hold Above $51,800 In an analysis posted on the TradingView website, crypto analyst Norok revealed that $51,800 is now the most important support level for Bitcoin. Norok pointed out that Bitcoin has since returned to its last support level which was last seen in December 2023, making this a crucial support. In the meantime, the support that had been built up by bulls at the $62,000 level has since been broken by bears and has now been turned into resistance. Nevertheless, the crypto analyst does not believe that the Bitcoin price has turned bearish, despite the crash that has rocked the crypto market. For Norok to turn bearish, he stated that the BTC price would have to break down below support at $51,800. According to him, such a move will invalidate whatever bullish thesis is in play for Bitcoin, ending the bullish trend of 2023-2024. Source: TradingView.com In the short term, Norok identifies $56,900 as a level that bulls must hold. He explains that this could help to reinforce the current bullish trend. “Price must hold here at this Support and then it can recapture the cloud to resume to Bullish Trend,” the crypto analyst said. “This is a highly decisive moment in Price action today.” BTC Suffers As A Result Of ETF Outflows One major driver of the Bitcoin price decline in the last few weeks has been a turn from inflows to outflows in Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since these ETFs require the issuers to hold BTC to support the assets they are selling to investors, inflows are incredibly bullish as these issuers have taken to buying BTC to fulfill this requirement. However, with investors beginning to withdraw their funds, the reverse has been the case, leading to a high selling pressure in the market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now recorded six consecutive trading days of outflows, reaching an all-time high outflow record $563.7 million on Wednesday, according to data from Coinglass. Source: Coinglass If these outflows continue, then the BTC price could continue to decline, and at the current rate, the pioneer cryptocurrency might be testing Norok’s $51,800 soon enough. However, a turn toward inflows would mean issuers have to buy BTC and this can translate to a price recover.

The market values MicroStrategy's analytics business at $10 billion, a 75% premium above fair value. The management team's poor execution, including buying BTC at its peak, has hindered the company's ability to maximize shareholder value. Investment Thesis MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is a dog business that has decided to buy Bitcoin (BTC) instead of buying back shares or issuing dividends. Due to Management’s high conviction in Bitcoin, it has leveraged the company by taking out loans and using the loaned funds to buy Bitcoin in large blocks as quickly as possible. The company has also issued new shares, diluting existing shareholders in the process, to buy more BTC when more debt is too expensive. This attitude and strategy that ignores buying a commodity at a discount has hamstrung MSTR’s ability to maximize its BTC holdings and by extension shareholder value. Valuation Some people struggle with how to value MicroStrategy. There are a few simple ways to do so; Find the fair value of all BTC holdings and then the remainder is the value of the business. Apply a business valuation based on sales, in line with its sector. Then you can tell if the company is overvalued, undervalued, etc. Based on information provided in the latest earnings report on April 29, MSTR holds 214,400 bitcoin as of 4/26/2024. Bitcoin is trading around $60,000 giving their BTC holdings a FMV of $12.864 billion. The current market cap of MSTR is $22.8 billion, meaning the market values the analytics business at about $10 billion. In the annual report issued in February, Total annual sales were $496 million and back in 2021 annual sales were $510 million. Obviously, the underlying analytics business is not growing. The Q1 results show more of the same with Q1 revenue down 5% year over year. Valuing a declining company with half a billion dollars in sales at $10 billion requires a multiple of 20x sales, which in the accounting profession is known as an unreasonable estimate. According to Seeking Alpha’s valuation ratings, the sector median for MSTR’s sector is a P/S multiple of 2.8x. This multiple would value the underlying analytics business at $1.4 billion. This gives MSTR a premium of $8.6 billion or a 75% premium above fair value. Some quick math also shows that if the price of BTC reaches $100,000, MSTR would be fairly valued with its current BTC holdings. For investors, the determining factor of whether MSTR is a good investment at the present comes down to the reader’s expectation of the fair value of Bitcoin. BTC Fair Value & MSTR Fair Value What is the fair value of Bitcoin, that is at what point will BTC reach a price that is stable and lacks the volatile highs and lows it is known for? I believe the answer is to look to gold. In my opinion, Bitcoin and its supporters have already proven the point that BTC is a store of value. If you are one of the few still skeptical of this, my best argument is that the AICPA now provides training to CPAs about bitcoin, and crypto in general. Today Gold has a market cap of approximately $16 trillion. If Bitcoin were to reach the same market cap in the year 2100 when the last bitcoin is mined, we would have a BTC price of approximately $760,000. Another popular tool that Bitcoin enthusiasts tout to show Bitcoin has much further to goo is the bitcoin power law. According to this chart, BTC should be at or above 100k by January of next year, but then it also says by 2040 bitcoin should be valued above $4 million. I personally find that to be a bit too optimistic unless bitcoin develops a real utility for humanity. If BTC hits parity with gold in 2100, the price will be $760,000 but how much BTC might MSTR accumulate by then? I believe 250,000 is a reasonable enough number. MSTR has about $1 million in free cash flow annually to buy BTC. At the current price of 60k that is 16.67 BTC a year, and as the price increases, MSTR will be able to buy less. I also believe their ability to issue new shares in meaningful enough quantities will be limited moving forward due to the desire of investors to make a profit. With all this information together, the expected fair value of MSTR in the year 2100 is $190 billion. This would result in a CAGR of 2.8%from today. Management’s Poor Execution The management team really blew some golden opportunities. They took out billions of dollars in loans to buy BTC and instead of waiting for a dip in his favorite volatile asset, he bought at the peak. While accounting rules will allow them to act as if they bought BTC at the bottom, the reality is they hold significantly less Bitcoin having bought so much at the peak of 2021 that they have permanently removed the possibility of maximizing shareholder value through bitcoin. In 2021, MSTR took out $1.5 billion in secured debt and $1 billion in equity to buy BTC at the top. Had he simply spread that money out equally over 25 months, i.e. $100 million a month in BTC purchases, the total BTC held today would be 237,200 BTC. Recent results show MSTR has not learned from its past mistakes as their Q1 results show they spent $1.4 billion buying 22k BTC. As I stated in articles, I wrote several years ago, I wish MSTR would spread their purchases out over time, instead they choose to execute poorly. For most companies, poor execution becomes a fatal mistake. Opportunities BTC Spike As shown above, the market tends to get ahead of itself when it comes to valuing MSTR. It is currently valued as if BTC were at $100,000. If Bitcoin does have a spike upward in value, it is reasonable to expect MSTR shares to move upward by a similar or larger amount. Currently, buying shares is the best way to play MSTR due to how expensive options are. As stated earlier, MSTR is valued far higher than its current fair value so there is a strong possibility its share price moves down significantly over the next 3 to 6 months. In the current environment, BTC has shown a strong correlation to the broader market in general, and the market has moved into a fearful phase predominantly due to the new expectation the Federal Reserve will have to wait to lower interest rates. BTC Usage If there is a breakthrough in how bitcoin is used, the fair value will rightly increase. If the breakthrough is big enough, the mistakes management has made will be irrelevant to investors. Conclusion Management has shown and continues to show they do not know how to execute a good strategy. If they did, they would probably be able to grow sales for their underlying analytics business as well. Their poor execution will continue to cap the potential rewards for their BTC investments, and perhaps more importantly, their poor execution will allow the underlying analytics business to continue to deteriorate and force a premature selling of its BTC holdings. MicroStrategy is valued significantly above its current fair value. Management’s track record of poor execution will continue to harm the company’s ability to maximize shareholder value, both through BTC investments and through growing their underlying analytics business.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4688572-microstrategy-execution-matters?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26737679.jpeg

26736872,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606167,1714669244,"Bitcoin On Track For $1 Million Per BTC “Fair Value”, Analyst Says","An analyst has explained how the “fair value” of Bitcoin appears to be on track to achieve the $1 million milestone by 2035. Bitcoin Total User Count Could Forecast Fair Value Path Forward In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about how the fair value of Bitcoin could look like in the future based on the growth curve in the total user count on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Greed No More: Sentiment Back At Neutral After $57,000 Plunge The “total user count” here refers to the total number of investors present in the BTC space. Often, this metric is equated with the total number of addresses on the network carrying a balance, but in reality, it’s not the most accurate method as a lot of investors own multiple wallets. To make an estimation of an adoption curve, Woo has referred to all past studies done on the user count. The analyst shared the below chart in an X post a few days back. The adoption curve of the cryptocurrency over its entire history | Source: @woonomic on X The early part of the chart here is based on Glassnode’s on-chain clustering of addresses into “entities.” An entity is a collection of Bitcoin wallets that Glassnode has determined to belong to the same investor. For the next part of the curve, Woo has added the Cambridge and Crypto.com data on verified exchange users. Finally, the analyst has projected the resulting growth rate forward. According to this curve, there are a total of 426 million Bitcoin investors at the moment, with the number estimated to hit the 0.5 billion milestone by October of this year. Interestingly, the price of the cryptocurrency has been oscillating around this total user count growth curve throughout the years, as the below chart depicts. The adoption curve of the asset compared against its price action | Source: @woonomic on X More specifically, this oscillation in the price around the adoption curve of the cryptocurrency has existed since 2012. This means that in the pre-2012 period (the shaded region in the graph), this pattern doesn’t quite hold. “In the early days price was slow to catch up to user count, BTC didn’t even have a price until the 1000th user came in,” notes Woo. “Price discovery started with early markets like New Liberty Standard and MtGox. By Aug 2011 Bitstamp launched and we had multiple global exchanges to properly price the asset.” Now, if the growth curve of Bitcoin is taken as a guide for its future value as well, then the analyst projects a $1 million per BTC fair value by the year 2035. “Fair value” here is based on the line around which the asset has been oscillating. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 244% Shiba Inu Rally Based On Bull Flag From the chart, it’s visible that BTC has historically gained distance over this line during bull markets, so the peak value in future rallies can be significantly more than this fair value. It now remains to be seen how the price of the cryptocurrency will develop in the coming years and whether this relationship between it and the total user count will continue to hold or not.

The fear of halved rewards since bitcoin halving could actually benefit Hut 8 due to increased demand and reduced competition. Despite challenges such as the recent halving and a shareholder lawsuit, Hut 8 is in a stronger position with a new CEO focused on efficiency and regaining shareholder trust. Investment Thesis & Stock Performance Hut 8 Corp. (HUT) is much smaller than competitors, but its higher growth potential together with a newly gained efficiency initiated by a new CEO since February make it the most interesting “cryptocurrency stock” bet in a bitcoin halving year for investors that wish to diversify their equities portfolio. Hut 8, despite being smaller than better known Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) and Mara Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA), remains a significant player in the bitcoin network, contributing to 1.3% of its overall processing power. 2024 is a bitcoin halving year, with the halving that occurred on April 20. The bitcoin halving fear sparked a stock sell-off for Hut 8 and for other crypto miners. The stock is currently trading at an attractive price level: approximately 60% below its high and 14% above its low. Stock Price Performance (Seeking Alpha) However, a good investor masters the art of catching falling knives. And that involves facing fears and investing despite the volatility. In the case of Hut 8, the fear of halved rewards could actually turn into a major tailwind. Indeed, the bitcoin supply being capped at 21 million coins, the rising demand typically outstrips the reduced rate of supply every four years, leading to a strong price increase. Therefore, although miners receive less bitcoin, the price increase of each bitcoin compensates for the reduced rewards. Furthermore, inefficient miners that cannot support a sudden halving of rewards run out of business. Only the most efficient ones survive, and they actually benefit from the reduction of competition in the sphere. For that reason, the stock rose after the 2020 halving with a time lag effect and, in my opinion, is likely to rise again this year after the most recent halving. But there will be some crypto miners that will drop out and Hut 8 needs to make sure it will be in the surviving lot. For now, after the halving two weeks ago, it would be too early to jump into conclusions. And that is precisely the reason why a long position initiated now would still be for speculative purposes and should remain a smaller portion of an investor's portfolio. Despite Challenges To The Bull Case, the Company Is In A Stronger Position Than Ever Hut 8 faces a double challenge: the reduction of BTC rewards from April 2024 and a lawsuit from the shareholders. Both could dictate the end of the company. Looking back at the halving, the company did seem to have taken the time to be well prepared. Indeed, the new CEO insisted on the “efficiency” of operations and took the difficult, yet wise, decision to shut down the Drumheller mine in Alberta, Canada, earlier this year. Given that the 2024 bitcoin halving caused the per-block rewards for bitcoin miners to decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, it is fundamental for the company to continue focusing on its efficiency even after the recent halving. The Drumheller mine in Alberta was the most inefficient one: it used 11% of Hut 8’s hash rate (i.e. the company’s computational power) to mine only 1.4% of the company’s bitcoin output ! The once successful and key mine in Canada turned into a burden because the energy cost has risen approximately tenfold in the last seven years, according to data from Energyrates.ca. On the other hand, Hut 8’s ambitious expansion plan includes the construction of a large facility in Texas, where the company expects a $275,000 construction cost per megawatt. This is a highly attractive opportunity, given it is about 40% less than the $460,000 per megawatt that Marathon spent on two mining facilities in December. Over the long-term, it is these types of ambitious decisions by the new CEO that could make Hut 8 beat or at least rival the top competitors. But at least as much as the newly gained corporate efficiency, it is the shareholders’ trust that the new CEO, Asher Genoot, wants to regain. The fast the top management changed in February is, in my opinion, bullish for the stock over the medium and long-term. Indeed, Asher Genoot replaced Jaime Leverton who resigned on February 8, after allegations of legal issues in relation to the merger between Hut 8 and US Bitcoin Corp causing the shareholders to file a lawsuit against the company. The shareholders essentially contest that insufficient information was disclosed to them in relation to the merger (de facto acquisition) of US Bitcoin Corp. (USBTC) with Hut 8, such as the existence of a common large shareholder which could be a potential conflict of interest. J Capital Research, a famous investigative U.S. company, published a report affirming that USBTC would have allegedly gone bankrupt without the merger… Thankfully, there has been a clean-up in the top management and the arrival of the new CEO in February could help improve the operational efficiency and regain the shareholders’ trust. Stock Picking Is Not Only About Management, It’s Also About Hard Numbers and Balance Sheet Looking at the figures, Hut 8 is on a bullish long-term momentum with growth recorded on many aspects. First, the earnings mark a positive evolution in the recent months. Indeed, in the 6-month period since the USBTC merger in June 2023 until December 2023, Hut 8 reported a net income of $6.2 million on revenue of $60.6 million. In the same period the year before, the company had incurred a net loss of $81.3 million. From an EBITDA standpoint, we witnessed the same extraordinary growth: its adjusted EBITDA reached $62.3 million, up from $12.8 million a year earlier. The rapid growth from a financial standpoint indicates the company is currently scaling its operations and that the business is also benefitting from a rise in bitcoin price. Based on their website, they have 23 openings at the time of writing against currently 219 employees, meaning there are approximately 10% of new open positions, which further confirms the stock is a high growth investment. It is very difficult and to some extent irrelevant to refer to traditional valuation metrics when evaluating high growth stocks, especially when it comes to so-called cryptocurrency stocks. Hut 8 remains indeed a speculative bet given the high growth profile and nature of operations: its entire revenue stems from the sale of digital assets, namely bitcoin, that is a recurring topic of heated discussions in the world of investments. The debates continue even after the (reluctant) approval of ETFs by the SEC and the growing institutionalization of the cryptocurrency, causing the buyer base to grow. One of the valuation metrics we would need to use would be a rather unconventional one, pegged to the value of a digital asset. Indeed, the BTC holdings already cover almost all of the stock value today, as Hut 8’s holdings in bitcoin ( 9,110 coins per last official figure of February 29, 2024 ) are valued at around $500-550m with the current price range of $55-60k per coin. The valuation per se is attractive, as it means that the sale of all bitcoins held by Hut 8 would cover the entirety of the shares’ value. Of course, bitcoin is extremely volatile, and the company’s shares tend to recurrently lose or gain over 5% per trading day. Therefore, from the balance sheet perspective, the business is in a good position to survive the halving of rewards that just happened given the large BTC holdings. When we zoom a little closer in our review, the business is rather healthy. Balance Sheet of Hut 8 (Q3 2023 Financial Statements) The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that shows the ability of a company to pay its short-term obligations. A current ratio equal or superior to 1 means the company is able to cover its short-term due expenses with the liquidity it possesses. Given the halving of BTC rewards and immediate reduction of new liquidity, this aspect is particularly important for crypto miners at the moment. Hut 8’s balance sheet from the last available financial statement (Q3 2023, post merger with USBTC) boasts an impressive 4.6x multiple of current assets over current liabilities. This ratio allows the company to accumulate bitcoin over time, as it needs to sell less BTC to finance its operations. Public Miners' Bitcoin Holdings (2022) (CryptoSlate) Indeed, Hut 8 is one of the very few miners which holdings grow over time. The chart is from 2022. The last available BTC holding figure of 9,110 from February 2024 shows that the accumulation of BTC continues. Last but not least, the total hash rate under Hut 8 management currently stands at 22.3 EH/s3, roughly where large competitor Marathon stood at the start of the year and above Riot Platforms . Hut 8, despite being considerably smaller than Riot in terms of market capitalization, owns more bitcoins than Riot, indicating the crypto miner runs its operations efficiently. This efficiency allows Hut 8 to have a low cost of bitcoin mining: each mined bitcoin cost the company $18,815, roughly 27-30% of each coin’s market value (currently $60,000 to $65,000). This allows for a significant margin of 70%, constituting a comfortable buffer to adapt to the halving of BTC rewards. Bottom Line The stock is highly attractive given the recent price drop. The price dropped due to BTC reward halving fears and shareholders’ lawsuit, but high growth potential, operational efficiency and renewed management may justify a speculative investment in the stock. The company has already shown that it is scaling its operations rapidly in an effort to catch up on its principal competitors, Riot (3x Hut 8’s market cap) and Marathon (6x Hut 8’s market cap), with investments in physical facilities and in staff growth. Investors who seek to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency sector to diversify their portfolios should definitely look at Hut 8, which has more room to grow in relation to its two much larger competitors, but also a key advantage: Hut 8 has deep knowledge of Canada and its energy infrastructure, and this could potentially play a crucial role for the sector, in case the U.S. regulators become stricter on cryptocurrency regulation due to money laundering, tax evasion and energy consumptions issues regularly raised in the public debate. Bitcoin remains a speculative bet, however investing in Hut 8 could reveal to be a lucrative investment given the current low share price beyond bitcoin price activity - as long as the bitcoin price does not extend its recent decline too far down.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4688525-hut-8-a-cryptocurrency-stock-with-high-growth-potential?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26735911.jpeg

42418335,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTetqP,1714665930,What Is Restaking? What Is Liquid Restaking? What Is EigenLayer?,"In less than a year, Ethereum ""restaking"" juggernaut EigenLayer has gobbled up more than $16 billion in ether (ETH) deposits – digital assets that will theoretically be used to help secure upstart cryptocurrency protocols.  Restaking – the idea of using a blockchain to secure other apps – has quickly become the crypto industry's biggest new investment trend. New restaking startups seem to arrive every week, and entire cottage industries, ""actively validated services"" and ""liquid restaking"" platforms, have seized on the hype with their own takes on the tech.  While some laud restaking as a promising investment opportunity and a major leap for crypto security, others see it as a much riskier gambit – a rehypothecation scheme that promises too-good-to-be-true rewards premised on flimsy fundamentals.  Staking and Proof-of-Stake  Restaking is the latest answer to the security question at the heart of everything in crypto: how to use economic games to protect decentralized computing systems  At the heart of all blockchains is the idea of ""decentralization"" – where a broadly distributed network of operators, rather than one single party, takes transactions from users, writes them to the chain's digital ledger, and ensures all other operators are reporting data honestly.  In contrast to proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin, where ""miners"" expend compute power to keep a chain secure, proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are run by ""validators"" who ""stake"" currency to help run the network.  Read more: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?  Validators earn interest as a reward for their work. The bigger their stake, the more they'll earn in rewards. The stake also acts like collateral; if a validator tries to lie to the blockchain or is misconfigured, a portion of the stake gets revoked by the network.  The exact mechanics behind staking can vary from chain to chain, but the important takeaway when it comes to staking is this: The cost of attacking (read: draining money from) a proof-of-stake system is roughly the amount of money that has been staked in its defense. That's why Ethereum, in particular, is considered so safe: there's over $100 billion worth of ETH staked with it.  Restaking  Restaking promises to apply this economic game to pretty much anything, leveraging the big staking numbers on incumbent protocols to help secure upstart blockchain apps. As an investment opportunity, it’s pitched as a way to juice a bit of extra interest out of conventional staking.  EigenLayer, Ethereum's restaking leader, lets users take ETH they've staked with Ethereum and then restake it with so-called ""Actively Validated Services,"" or AVSs. Today, that's mostly just blockchain protocols that provide support for Ethereum scaling solutions.  Proponents of the tech argue that restaking helps to improve the security of smaller blockchain apps since they might struggle to prop up their own proof-of-stake security systems, given that doing so requires substantial capital and an active community.  In an interview with CoinDesk last month, EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan explained how this works by using the example of 100 blockchain protocols that are each secured by $1 billion worth of stake: Imagine that ""instead of each of the protocols having $1 billion separately staked, there was $100 billion commonly staked across 100 protocols,"" said Kannan. ""To attack any one protocol, now you need $100 billion rather than needing $1 billion.""  The specifics might look different on other blockchains, but the gist is the same. On Solana, for instance, users will be able to restake SOL they've staked on that network to earn extra interest and to help secure other apps.  Liquid Restaking  Restaking via a platform like EigenLayer typically means depositing one's ETH (or select ETH derivatives) into the protocol, spinning up an operator, and then selecting which AVSs to secure in exchange for interest.  A simpler way to stake is via liquid restaking services like Puffer, Ether.Fi and Renzo. These are middlemen that take assets from users, deposit them into EigenLayer and equivalent platforms, and offer receipts, called ""liquid restaking tokens"" (LRTs), that accrue interest and can be traded in decentralized finance to earn even larger yields.  The liquid restaking platforms do all of the heavy lifting of setting up operator software and selecting which AVSs to work with. The LRTs let users easily enter and exit restaking positions, and they offer users the ability to increase their leverage by re-investing into decentralized finance protocols.  The services mirror platforms like Lido, the liquid staking behemoth on Ethereum that stakes assets on behalf of investors and offers a derivative liquid staking token, ""Lido staked ETH"" (stETH), that tracks the price of ETH. StETH is hugely popular in decentralized finance, and upstart liquid restaking platforms are hoping to replicate Lido's success with their convenience-oriented LRTs.  Considering Risk  While investors, developers, and venture firms have embraced restaking, some fret that the trend is crypto's latest ticking time bomb, a rehypothecation of trust that will inevitably collapse.  They point to the specter of contagion risk – the idea that if an operator is slashed by an AVS, the impact could ripple across the entire staking ecosystem, depleting the value of the entire restaking pool, and cutting down on the security of every other AVS as a result. (EigenLayer is adding an insurance program called ""attributable security"" to address this concern, but the details haven't been finalized.)  With the rise of LRTs comes an even larger fear of a mass catastrophe. If protocols start leveraging people's trust by allowing them to stake tokens, liquid staking tokens, and also liquid restaking tokens, then the surface area for a rehypothecation crisis grows. One slashing event or depegged asset could topple many.  Although versions of pooled security have existed for a while – most notably in the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem – the modern formulation of ""restaking"" remains more theory than reality. EigenLayer was technically the first restaking protocol to launch on Ethereum's mainnet, but it remains in limited beta. EigenLayer accepts deposits, but most of its key features – including slashing – had yet to exist at press time, and AVSs are only allowed to register with the program but can't yet deploy.  Read more: EigenLayer, Crypto's Biggest Project Launch This Year, Is Still Missing Crucial Functionality  The only incentive for restaking and liquid restaking thus far has been ""points,"" which are score counts tracked by EigenLayer and liquid restaking protocols that depositors hope will be tied to future airdrops of digital assets.  Points aren't designed to have any value, but users have begun buying and selling them outright – igniting a speculative frenzy around restaking that some fear isn't grounded in economic reality, and could lead to disappointment and big sell-offs down the line. EigenLayer and liquid restaking protocol Renzo have already shown how the point systems can set unrealistic expectations: Both projects sparked fury last month when they revealed token airdrop plans that featured smaller allotments for point-earners than some depositors had anticipated.  One prolific angel investor of Solana projects told CoinDesk he ""had not (yet)"" invested in any restaking teams for that ecosystem. When asked why, he responded cheekily: ""Just debating when restaking blows up crypto.""

The bank said retail investors have been taking profits in recent weeks.  The market is still faced with headwinds such as elevated positioning, the report said.  Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) said it's keeping its cautious stance on cryptocurrency markets in the near term due to a lack of positive catalysts and because the retail impulse is disappearing.  The bank notes that retail investors sold both crypto and equity assets in April and spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen outflows. The three headwinds the bank has already identified – elevated positioning, high bitcoin prices versus gold and versus the estimated bitcoin production cost, and subdued crypto venture capital (VC) funding – are also still in place.  Cryptocurrency markets have seen significant profit taking in recent weeks, with retail investors playing a bigger part in the sell-off than institutional investors, the report said. Bitcoin fell 16% in April, the biggest monthly decline since June 2022.  Investors sold U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs at the fastest pace ever on Wednesday. The 11 ETFs saw a cumulative net outflow of $563.7 million, the largest since the funds started trading on Jan. 11.  With regards to institutional investors, “it has been mostly momentum traders such as commodity trading advisors (CTAs) or other quantitative funds taking profit on previous extreme long positions in both bitcoin and gold,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.

26734564,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606224,1714665617,Bitcoin Déjà Vu: Analyst Identifies Trends Reflecting 2016 Cycle,"Cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital has come up with an intriguing narrative pointing to several trends in the current price action of Bitcoin that are similar to the price trends seen in the 2016 bull cycle, even as market sentiments continue to dwindle. Bitcoin Trends Reiterating 2016 Pattern According to Rekt Capital, more than a month after the initial analysis, Bitcoin keeps demonstrating how much it closely resembles the cycle of 2016. Similar to 2016, Bitcoin has experienced further declines over the past three weeks following the Halving below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range also known as the Post-Halving Danger Zone The post read: Over a month later Bitcoin continues to prove how it is more similar to the 2016 cycle. Just like in 2016, Bitcoin in this cycle is seeing additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range in the three-week window after the Halving (i.e. Post-Halving “Danger Zone”). Given that Rekt Capital already addressed the concept of the Post-Halving Danger Zone, the analyst is not shocked by this current price decrease. During the 2016 cycle, about 21 days after the Halving event, BTC saw a lengthy decline of 11% before transitioning toward an upward direction. It is worth noting that Rekt Capital noted that if downside volatility around the Re-Accumulation Range Low is going to happen in this cycle, 2016 history indicates it may happen during the 15 days following the Halving. Since the recent event was concluded about 12 days ago, the expert’s prediction could be realized in the upcoming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Danger Zone’ Post-Halving, Analyst Warns Of Potential Downside While the Post-Halving “Danger Zone” ends in 15 days, 2016 data suggests that there may be some negative volatility in the interim, possibly reaching the $60600 Range Low. Drawing attention to previous patterns, Rekt Capital highlighted a similar pattern between the 2016 and 2024 pre-Halving re-accumulation range. After a breakout from the re-accumulation range this year, BTC witnessed a Pre-Halving rally, as was observed in 2016. Pre-Halving Retrace Movement Just like in 2016, once the pre-Halving rally peaked, Bitcoin started its Pre-Halving retrace. Specifically, this occurred roughly 28 days prior to the Halving event in both 2016 and 2024. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Pre-Halving Retrace Echoing Troubling 2020 Trend A negative wick on the weekly candle indicates a significant reaction in the first week of the pre-Halving Retrace in 2016. However, this reaction was fleeting and came before an extended price decline. This cycle likewise saw a strong early reaction from Bitcoin via a downward wick, but there are indications that this reaction might not have lasted long. Thus, to avoid a fate similar to that of 2016, Rekt Capital believes that BTC will need to maintain highs around $60,000 and beyond.

42418339,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTetuX,1714665600,Crypto for Advisors: Digital Asset Custody’s Future,"Custody of digital assets is evolving, whether it be the technology itself, the plethora of new tokenized investment products, or the risks of leaving assets with service providers like centralized exchanges, whether real or perceived.  Colton Dillion, CEO of Hedgehog Technologies, breaks down the evolutions in digital asset custody, focusing on the shift of wealth to self-custody in the space and how advisors must support this shift.  In Ask an Expert, Jessy Gilger from Sound Advisory answers questions about direct bitcoin ownership within an IRA account.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Not Your Client’s Keys, Not Their Coins: The Future of Digital Asset Custody  Web3 rails will eventually swallow traditional finance, and there’s no question about it.  Weighing in at an impressive $2.3 trillion market capitalization, the digital asset industry still has some growing up to do before it can surpass the $110 trillion stock market, but in case you haven’t been paying attention, real-world assets (RWAs) and stablecoins have seen some recent big bets from major players like Blackrock, Stripe, Franklin Templeton and others.  These firms are slowly cloning traditional securities like money market funds and mutual funds for on-chain consumption and seamless peer-to-peer transfers, and it’s only a matter of time before regulators catch up with the market to allow the exchange of traditional securities, such as Fortune 500 stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in the same exact manner. Eventually every type of traditional asset will also be an on-chain asset. All we need is time.  So, what does that mean for custodians?  Chainalysis reported last June that personal wallets were increasing exponentially even while assets being sent back to exchanges were decreasing quarter over quarter. Both retail and institutional clients are choosing to keep their assets on-chain rather than trust them with custodians who may turn out to be another FTX or otherwise risk their funds in highly interconnected networks of rehypothecation. If you could avoid having your funds locked up in Silvergate’s bankruptcy proceedings, wouldn’t you?  While Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini all support at least one of the spot bitcoin ETFs as a primary custodian, and institutional use-cases are migrating more slowly, there’s a clear trend for Web3 asset holders to start transitioning their wealth to self-custody once they reach a certain level of sophistication. Once insurance methods catch up with wallet compromise, we expect that most individuals and institutions will choose to handle the segregation of their accounts directly and demand control of their own private keys.  As advisors and fiduciaries, it behooves us to be prepared for the day that clients come to us asking to support self-custody solutions. There are many options out there for intrepid self-custodians, from multi-sig accounts to account abstraction (AA) smart contract wallets, from institutional hardware to multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, but each entails their own security and usability tradeoffs, as well as cost considerations.  Multisig  Safe (originally known as Gnosis Safe) is the original multi-signature solution for Ethereum-based networks and comes with some handy tools for managing your treasury in a wallet where multiple people have to agree before a transaction can happen. On other chains, you have to find other solutions, like a dedicated wallet software that supports Shamir’s Secret Sharing. For under $500, one can set up a wallet with m of n signatures (eg 2 out of 3 or 8 out of 9 have to sign for a valid transaction), but the permissioning on these accounts is less robust without including the new account abstraction proposals, most notably ERC-4337. If you have one of the signatures, you can help sign away any privileges on the Safe account.  Account Abstraction  This is another EVM-only solution for the time being, but in principle, any chain that supports smart contracts can support the standard. Account abstraction allows a savvy developer to layer additional permissions and capabilities on top of a standard account so that certain signers can only sign on certain types of transactions. Many providers also leverage these capabilities to add transaction batching, non-native gas tokens, transaction forgiveness, and more. These players include Gnosis Safe and groups like ZeroDev, Biconomy and Fun.  Institutional Cold Storage  Many custodians out there offer a cold storage solution that leverages hardware security modules and robust physical security to keep your assets as safe as the gold bars under Fort Knox. By using specialized chips that are extremely expensive to crack, they can generate private keys and sign transactions securely on your behalf without the flexibility and speed of a hot wallet. Depending on the provider, these solutions are often combined together with a multisig, AA, or MPC solution, but the cost usually runs into double-digit basis points with hefty minimum balances and account maintenance fees.  Multi-party Computation  One of the most flexible options out there, MPC is not limited to a specific network by a smart contract, but it does require trust in potentially opaque partners. MPC is closer to the base layer of crypto, the private key entropy, and all the participants in an MPC wallet participate together to recreate the private key, instead of having multiple private keys send their own valid signatures. There’s Qredo and Lit protocols for those who are more technically savvy, which are fully decentralized solutions, but for advisors that want a little more white glove treatment and are willing to work with trusted third parties, Anchorage Digital just released their enterprise solution, Porto, and my own company Hedgehog just released an MPC account management product, powered by Capsule, with a focus on fund administration, sub-advisory, and turnkey asset management programs.  Obviously we agree with Nathan McCauley, the CEO of Anchorage, when he summarized their rationale for launching a self-custody solution:  ""Right now, many people look to self-custody solutions to allow them to do a more flexible set of activities on the blockchain. We really think of this as expansionary and additive.""  Whatever you choose as an advisor, it’s important to keep in mind the Custody rule and be certain that you don’t have arbitrary withdrawal privileges on your clients’ accounts. There hasn’t been a lot of guidance for some of these account structures, and there still remains some clarity to be had around the extent to which any particular multisig, AA, or MPC protocol qualifies as substantial control over client funds. Nonetheless, we must forge a path forward or be left behind in our clients’ dust.  – Colton Dillion, CEO, Hedgehog Technologies  Ask an Expert  Q. Can you hold bitcoin in an IRA account?  Yes, there are several ways to gain exposure to bitcoin in both traditional and Roth IRA accounts. The easiest method is through one of the spot bitcoin ETFs traded on major brokerages. However, this route only provides U.S. dollar exposure to bitcoin's price movements, not direct ownership of the actual coins.  For many bitcoin investors, the preferred option is opening an IRA through a specialized provider that allows direct ownership and storage of bitcoin within the account. Key control is crucial here – the ability for you to maintain the private keys means you have full ownership and control of the bitcoin in your IRA, without entrusting it to a third-party custodian. This avoids the centralization and counterparty risks of other options.  Q. What’s the benefit of holding bitcoin in an IRA?  The main advantage is being able to invest in bitcoin as a long-term store of value while enjoying the tax benefits of an IRA account. Since bitcoin is viewed by many as a superior form of savings, it aligns well with the long-term horizon of retirement accounts.  Specific benefits include tax-deferred or tax-free growth (traditional or Roth), allowing your bitcoin holdings to compound more efficiently over decades. Bitcoin has historically appreciated in consistent 4-year cycles, so capturing those gains tax-free can significantly accelerate your retirement timeline.  Holding bitcoin in an IRA also enables taking distributions in bitcoin itself rather than having to sell for dollars and realize taxable gains. For clients wanting full sovereignty, key control over their IRA's bitcoin is paramount to avoid third-party custody risks. The downside is reduced liquidity and increased rules and age restrictions compared to a standard brokerage account. But for long-term investors convinced of bitcoin's role as hard money, the tax benefits of an IRA can outweigh this.  - Jessy Gilger,CCO & Senior Advisor, Sound Advisory  Keep Reading  Spot bitcoin ETFs commenced trading in Hong Kong on April 30th.  BlackRock's BUIDL fund grew $70 million last week becoming the largest tokenized treasury fund.  According to Morningstar, $89 billion was invested in US mutual funds and ETFs in March, the highest total since August 2021.

The company pitched itself as a ""bitcoin development company"" earlier this year, saying it would work on development of the Bitcoin network through financial markets, advocacy and innovation.  MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, unveiled plans to develop a decentralized identity service using Ordinals inscriptions.  The software consulting firm began pitching itself as a ""bitcoin development company"" earlier this year, saying it would work on development of the Bitcoin network through financial markets, advocacy and innovation. ""MicroStrategy Orange,"" as it has been called, is a sign the company is putting this aim into practice.  The goal of MicroStrategy Orange is to provide ""trustless, tamper-proof and long-lived"" decentralized identities using the Bitcoin blockchain, founder Michael Saylor said at the company's Bitcoin For Corporations conference on Wednesday.  The service allows users to issue decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which enable pseudonymity. Just as bitcoin transactions are not linked to real-world identities, neither will DIDs.  Orange harnesses Bitcoin's Ordinals Protocol, which allows for information to be stored and communicated on individual satoshis (the smallest increment of bitcoin {{BTC}}, equal to 1/100,000,000th of a BTC).  MicroStrategy has already built one application using its service called ""Orange For Outlook,"" which integrates digital signatures into emails to enable recipients to verify the identity of the sender.  MicroStrategy holds 214,400 BTC ($10 billion), which is more than 1% of the all the bitcoin will ever exist.

26732264,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606183,1714662045,Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion XRP From Escrow – How Will This Impact Price?,"On-chain data recently showed that Ripple carried out its monthly escrow unlock for May. As expected, this has raised concerns about how it could affect the XRP price, especially since Ripple has been accused of manipulating the token’s price. Ripple Unlocks 500 Million XRP Tokens Onchain data revealed 500 million XRP tokens were unlocked from Ripple’s escrow on May 1. The crypto firm is known to unlock 1 billion tokens monthly, although it looks to have only unlocked half this time around. The magnitude of these tokens always raises concerns, considering the negative impact they could have on the altcoin’s price if dumped on the market. Further analysis of the on-chain data shows that Ripple sent 300 million XRP out of the unlocked tokens to an escrowed account (2Not4co2op). Meanwhile, the crypto firm sent the remaining 200 million XRP tokens to another wallet (4vt5x1o91m). Considering that the 200 million XRP tokens weren’t sent to escrow, Ripple may have plans to sell them at some point, although it has yet to do so. It is also worth mentioning that Ripple received another 500 million XRP tokens from an unknown wallet (ymFZmKxEsF). However, these funds were immediately sent to an escrow account. As such, the community can heave a sigh of relief since most of the XRP tokens Ripple received in the last 24 hours have been sent back to escrow. Talks About Ripple Dumping On The Market Resurface Following the latest token unlock, the crypto community has reignited talks about Ripple’s alleged dumping on XRP holders. The question of whether or not Ripple’s XRP sales influence the token’s price has been a long-standing discussion, with notable figures like pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall even accusing Ripple of intentionally suppressing the altcoin’s price with its sales. On the other hand, people like Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) have clarified that the crypto firm’s XRP sales do not impact the crypto token’s price. Moreover, Ripple already discontinued programmatic sales, which means that its transactions cannot affect prices on crypto exchanges. Ripple also noted in its recent court filing in its ongoing legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had taken measures to ensure its institutional sales did not violate securities laws. This suggests that Ripple conducts its sales over the counter (OTC) to avoid further scrutiny from the Commission. At the time of writing, the token is trading at around $0.5, up over 2% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Institutional asset manager Fasanara Capital and The Credit Collective, a Celo community-led ecosystem development organization, were early investors in the facility.

The interoperability protocol's developers indicated that more airdrops are coming.  Cross-chain interoperability protocol LayerZero said a snapshot for its first airdrop was taken on May 1.  The firm announced plans to issue a token in December, saying it would be released “in the first half of 2024.” In a post on X, LayerZero developers referred to the operation as “snapshot #1,” indicating that there will be a series of airdrops.  LayerZero is a protocol that connects various blockchains through technology that removes the need for a third party. It is currently used by Stargate and Radiant Capital, both of which experienced slight gains in their native tokens after the snapshot was confirmed.  Last April, LayerZero raised $120 million at a $3 billion valuation in a Series B round that included investment from Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital.  Snapshots typically act as a precursor to outflows as airdrop farmers – investors that use protocols to increase airdrop allocations – can then move liquidity to other projects without losing rights to future claims.

26729970,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606070,1714658430,Crypto Analyst Predicts 244% Shiba Inu Rally Based On Bull Flag,"An analyst explained how Shiba Inu could be heading towards a massive rally based on a bull flag pattern that forms in its daily chart. Shiba Inu Has Been Consolidating Inside A Bull Flag Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about a bull flag that has recently appeared in the daily price of Shiba Inu. The bull flag is a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, is shaped like a flag on a pole. The pattern forms when an uptrend is followed by a period of consolidation inside a parallel channel toward the downward direction. The starting uptrend makes up for the pole, while the channel acts as the flag. Related Reading: Bitcoin Greed No More: Sentiment Back At Neutral After $57,000 Plunge Like other TA patterns, the consolidation channel or flag here comprises two parallel lines. The upper level connects the price tops, while the lower one joins the bottoms. When the asset retests either of these levels, it’s probable to undergo a reversal, with the upper line of the channel acting as a point of resistance and the lower one as support. A break above the resistance line is considered a bullish signal for the price. The uptrend resulting from such a break may be the same length as the flag’s pole. On the other hand, a drop below the flag (that is, a breakdown of support) invalidates the formation and may even suggest the takeover of bearish momentum for the asset. Similar to the bull flag, there is also the bear flag in TA, which works much in the same way, except that it occurs during a downtrend (with the flag signifying consolidation towards the upside following a downward pole). Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that shows the bull flag pattern Shiba Inu has potentially been forming on its daily price recently: The formation that the memecoin's price has been displaying during the last few weeks | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s clear that the Shiba Inu 1-day price has been consolidating inside what appears to be a bull flag pattern channel in the past few weeks. “I’m placing buy orders around $0.000018343, aiming for a bullish breakout that sends $SHIB to $0.000072323,” says the analyst. The former level is about where SHIB should meet the flag’s support next if it continues in its current trajectory, while the latter target is based on the height of the pole. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $92,190: Crypto Analyst Reveals Path To ATH Target A run to the bullish target of $0.000072323 would imply a rally of more than 244% from the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, while from the lower support of $0.000018343, any such surge would correspond to a growth of over 294%. It remains to be seen whether Shiba Inu will show a break above this bull flag pattern and, if it does, whether the price will benefit from bullish effects.

Some analysts believe DOGE’s struggles are a canary in the coal mine for the entire crypto market.

Dogecoin market cap currently at $18 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Whales Accumulating DOGE: A Glimmer Of Hope? However, a glimmer of hope flickers for the dethroned meme king. On-chain data suggests an increase in large wallet purchases of DOGE, hinting at potential accumulation by wealthy investors.

26729605,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606255,1714655545,Fresh Money From Retail Traders Flows Into Copy Trading As Crypto Derivative Expands: Margex Report,"Coinbase won approval to offer cryptocurrency derivative trading to U.S. retail customers, fueling much hope and momentum to the $2.1 trillion cryptocurrency derivative market. Coinbase’s approval arrived following a significant decline in derivative trading volume due to economic uncertainties, regulatory struggles, and a reduction in risk from high wealth accounts and retail traders. Derivative trading, such as futures, options, and others, has dominated the cryptocurrency market since 2014 as investors snap at the opportunity to place bets with little investment for a higher percentage return. A large percentage of the derivative market is influenced by retail traders, fueled by manic meme-stock trading and social media trends on platforms such as X, YouTube and Reddit. Although heavily favoured by institutional investors, who have maintained a fair, open position in the derivative market, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) make up a large share of traded assets. Futures and options trading have had a fair share in the derivative market, but the recent dominance of copy trading is often cited as a key reason for the high volume of the derivative market over the past few months. Copy trading is slowly evolving into a big tool for retail traders looking to explore the derivative market, as many of these traders favour automated trading over spot or manual trading. The data from Margex highlights much attention shifting to copy trading as a new strategy for retail traders looking to increase their profitability while leveraging an experienced trader to produce great profit returns with a profit share automated for both the user and pro trader. Copy Trading And Gen Z Influence On The Derivative Market Copy trading involves users replicating the trading strategies of expert traders. This method allows users to diversify their portfolios, minimize risk, and increase their profitability in the financial market while trades are executed automatically and instantly. The idea of copy trading is to enable users to benefit from the knowledge and skills of well-experienced traders. The users work to enhance their trading outcomes or build better trading or investment skills. Research has shown that 44% of traders are copy traders, signifying an extreme surge of copy trading solutions in the last few years and is greatly influenced by the social age experiencing exponential growth as web3 technologies evolve. Social media and Generation Z users (GEN Z) have amplified the popularity of trading strategies like copy trading through investment threads on X, Reddit, and even YouTube channels, with over 500,000 community individuals actively participating in such financial market discussions. Through social media and online communities, young users have seen a high demand for copy trading as their interest grows through the consumption of financial information. This shows the social aspect significantly influences the adoption of copy trading. By leveraging on the power of online communities and social aspects of trading, copy trading eliminates the rigorous learning phase of analyzing trades for retailers, simplifies trading processes and improves strategies to remain profitable. Copy Trading A Community Building Tool Investors and retail traders have a long history of following the leader or forecaster of the financial market, be it for short-term, medium-term, or long-term portfolio moves. Copy trading has long existed, with many sharing trade ideas or mimicking the trades of experienced traders such as Warren Buffet. These patterns in the past among retailers are seen in the present generation as many retailers or users follow well-experienced traders to replicate their open positions. With more retail traders adopting copy trading, it remains a dominant strategy in the derivative market compared to the spot market. Over 91% of futures trading participants are actively involved in copy trading while recording over 92% of profit returns. According to CCData, the growth of the cryptocurrency derivative market has been influenced by retail traders’ demand for more innovative trading strategies, such as automation tools (copy trading) and AI algorithms, to enhance their trading approach. Many centralized exchanges recorded a new peak of $2.3 trillion in the derivative market. CCData has shown much adoption in the derivative market as compared with spot trading. A large community of retail traders is approaching copy trading to earn a great profit on their investment. Over the past few years, the copy trading community have earned a profit margin of over 74 million USDT, reflecting increased engagement and the copy-trading method by retailers in the derivative market. Many crypto trading platforms have adopted copy trading to fill the needs of retail traders looking for improved and robust trading methods to boost profitability. Margex, a copy trading platform, remains at the top of the list of copy trading platforms for these users.

""The company is considering a wide range of alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including, but not limited to, the sale of all or part of the Company, or another strategic transaction involving some, or all of, the assets of the Company,"" the miner said in a press release on Thursday.  Stronghold, the company that turns piles of coal waste into energy to mine bitcoin, said the move comes as there is a ""valuation dislocation"" of the stock compared to its other mining peers in the market.  “Stronghold’s Board and management team are committed to maximizing value for our shareholders and, to that end, have commenced a comprehensive and thorough review of strategic alternatives,” said Greg Beard, chairman and chief executive officer of Stronghold.  The company has hired Cohen and Company Capital Markets as financial advisers and said there isn't any specific timeline set for the completion of the review. The shares fell about 2% on Thursday.  The stock fell 62% this year, while peers such as Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) fell about 40%. Bitcoin rose 39% so far this year.  Stronghold went public during the peak of the bull market in 2021. However, like many of its peers, it faced financial difficulties during the crypto winter due to a heavy debt load on its balance sheet. The company was able to avoid a similar fate as some of its peers that went bankrupt by restructuring its debt and shoring up the balance sheet in 2022 and 2023.  Mergers and acquisitions have been touted as one of the areas that will gain momentum after the halving, which made the mining landscape more competitive for the miners as rewards were cut in half.

42418333,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTetnJ,1714654800,TradFi Veterans Pitch Tokenized Asset Marketplace With Eyes on U.S. Regulatory Approval,"Ironlight aims to be an SEC-supervised marketplace for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).  The company secured $12 million of investment, mostly from individual investors with a Wall Street background, co-founder Celebuski said in an interview.  Asset tokenization has become one of the hottest trends in crypto, with estimates of growing into a multitrillion-dollar industry.  With global financial heavyweights hopping on the red-hot tokenization trend to bring conventional assets onto blockchain infrastructure, a new company started by traditional finance veterans is building a digital marketplace with eyes on a U.S. regulatory nod.  Ironlight, started by Rob McGrath and Matt Celebuski, aims to tokenize private securities that are typically illiquid such as real estate, natural resources, fine art, public infrastructure and private equity while serving as a trading venue with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) blessing as a so-called alternative trading system, or ATS.  McGrath previously served as global head of trading at asset manager Schroders and Abu Dhabi's government-owned sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), while Celebuski founded a brokerage that did trade-cost analysis and was acquired by financial technology company Abel Noser.  They are also joined by Greg Braca, former president and CEO of TD Bank, as a strategic adviser and board member.  Ironlight's entrance comes as traditional capital markets and the digital asset industry are becoming increasingly intertwined, with crypto firms and traditional finance giants like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and HSBC racing to put old-school investment products – real-world assets, or RWAs in crypto parlance – onto blockchain plumbing in the form of tokens.  Read more: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable  Proponents tout this as a multitrillion-dollar opportunity, betting that tokenization could disrupt the current infrastructure behind global financial markets. Potential benefits include faster settlements, around-the-clock trading and increased efficiency. The RWA market could mushroom to over $10 trillion by the end of the decade, according to separate reports by Boston Consulting Group and digital asset manager 21.co.  ""It was obvious that there was going to be a sea change in the financial markets and we wanted to be a part of that,"" Celebuski, who serves as president and chief operating officer at Ironlight, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  After leaving their TradFi tenures, the founders raised $12 million from mostly high-net-worth individual investors in their network to put together a team and build the tech from the ground up, Celebuski said.  With no plans for allowing cryptocurrency trading on the platform, the company's goal is to leverage distributed ledger technology, or DLT, to connect buyers and sellers in a more seamless way. They also plan to partner with sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and traditional market makers to facilitate trading tokenized assets.  The development behind the trading venue is at advanced stages, and the company has already applied to be a regulated broker-dealer by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and expects an approval in the next few months, Celebuski said.  After that, Ironlight will start the SEC registration process for an ATS, which is necessary to operate a digital marketplace, he added.  ""We felt that making this work under U.S. regulations would be important to be seen as completely regulatory compliant no matter which venue or regulation we would be under,"" Celebuski explained.  A regulated ATS could make a positive impact on liquidity for tokenized assets, especially if it manages to attract sufficient subscribers, Doug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research, told CoinDesk in an email.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/02/tradfi-veterans-pitch-tokenized-asset-marketplace-with-eyes-on-us-regulatory-approval,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbf1b88ece5754e32cbf42c616b1ecb545187f45-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418322,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTetcz,1714654800,"Web3 Publishing Platform Mirror Sells to Paragraph, Pivots to Social App 'Kiosk'","Web3 publishing app Mirror is being acquired by Paragraph, a competing platform.  Mirror's team will continue to operate independently and will shift its focus to developing ""Kiosk,"" a Web3 social app based on Farcaster that blends blockchain and e-commerce.  Mirror and Paragraph will eventually merge into a single, unified product suite according to Paragraph's founder.  Paragraph, the company behind a suite of blockchain-based publishing tools, has acquired Mirror, its biggest competitor in the Web3 creator space.  The Mirror team will continue to operate as a separate company but is pivoting to focus exclusively on Web3 social media. The team's main project post-mirror will be ""Kiosk,"" a Twitter-like micro-blogging platform based on the Farcaster protocol.  Mirror was one of the breakout stars of blockchain's foray into the creator economy. The platform launched in 2020 and offers writers the ability to monetize their work by minting individual articles as NFTs. It was designed as a more decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to Web2 publishing tools like Medium.  Paragraph was released in 2022 with similar functionality to Mirror, but it was more akin to Substack, focusing on newsletters and other publications rather than one-off articles.  Paragraph founder Colin Armstrong says that his product differed from Mirror, at least initially, in that it tried to appeal more to a Web2 audience. Armstrong, who has written for tech publications in addition to working as an engineer at Google and Coinbase, says he also focused his product more on referral programs and other features to help authors widen their distribution. Mirror, meanwhile, managed to develop a stronger brand and design language, said Armstrong.  Ultimately, Mirror and Paragraph ""have evolved and then ended up somewhat in a similar place,"" said the Paragraph founder. ""I think for users it's often not a clear choice, which one to go with.""  Mirror, meanwhile, has shifted much of its focus to Kiosk, its Web3 social platform.  ""The vision for Kiosk is to be the synthesis of social and commerce,"" said Mirror founder Denis Nazarov. Nazarov will remain as an ""advisor"" to Paragraph, but he and the rest of his team have sold the product so that they can focus more on their new platform.  Armstrong says Paragraph's user base is ""substantially smaller"" than Mirror's, and his three-person team is half the size of Mirror's six-person operation. Neither team disclosed the terms of the acquisition, but Armstrong says the plan was proposed by Union Square Ventures, an investor in both companies.  ""Everyone is very happy with the outcome. Mirror gets to pursue their new product, and the Mirror product gets to continue under someone who's fully dedicated to publishing,"" said Armstrong. ""Obviously, it's great for us because it elevates our user base and products to a pretty large degree.""  According to Armstrong, Mirror and Paragraph will eventually be merged into a single, streamlined product.  ""We want to combine the products at some point, but in the short to medium term we are just going to be chatting with the top creators on both products just to determine what people love on each,"" he said.  Welcome, Kiosk  Kiosk is the Mirror team's attempt to infuse blockchains and e-commerce more deeply into social media.  It is technically a ""client"" for accessing Farcaster, which is an X-like app built on Ethereum. Clients like Kiosk act as unique lenses for viewing Farcaster's underlying data; In addition to providing more rich views of Farcaster content, clients can imbue extra functionality and use-cases into the protocol.  ""There's this potential for an experience where you not only see what people are saying, what they're liking and who they're following – but also what assets they are buying,"" said Nazarov. ""We think that the whole idea of asset ownership and collection is not just transactional, it's also social.""  Mirror boasted a polished interface by crypto industry standards when it first launched, and Nazarov says he plans to bring a similar design philosophy to Kiosk.  With Mirror, ""we were one of the first web3 products that really brought strong product design, brand, and go-to-market DNA – which I think is still quite rare in the ecosystem – combined with a deep understanding of the potential of the technology,"" said Nazarov. ""We learned it's really powerful to combine a social container – so, telling a story – but then embedding this economic call to action.""  Kiosk's main function will be to make it easier for users to embed digital assets directly into their social media posts. One could imagine a post that references an NFT: Whereas a conventional tweet or Facebook post would just contain a jpeg image representing the NFT, Kiosk would bake extra blockchain features directly into the image – such as the ability to view the NFT's blockchain address, or a feature to buy it directly via the post.  ""I think a lot of what held back crypto growing to the next concentric circle of a million, 10 million users, was UX,"" said Nazarov. UX stands for user experience. ""Seeing products like Farcaster pioneer a mobile native experience, we think that there's this big opportunity for this unified social experience that brings e-commerce natively to it.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/02/web3-publishing-platform-mirror-sells-to-paragraph-pivots-to-social-app-kiosk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7213529b64306c22f1498b258903ff562fbba7-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The partnership means MoonPay users in the U.S. can seamlessly buy crypto with PayPal through wallet transfer, bank transfer, and debit card transactions, according to a press release.  Buying and trading crypto is an ongoing project, which, has not been facilitated by the high street banks of this world.  PayPal has over 426 million active accounts globally; MoonPay, which is focused on crypto, is no slouch, with over 15 million users.  MoonPay co-founder and CEO Ivan Soto-Wright called the partnering “symbiotic” because users of his app increase their reach and have a new flexible payment option, while PayPal’s limited range of major cryptocurrencies on offer is now extended to the full gamut of popular tokens.  Soto-Wright pointed out the partnership is not a single integration of the type the fintech giant has been exploring with the likes of Web3 wallet MetaMask, but rather PayPal coming embedded inside MoonPay’s infrastructure.  We are the first company to do this with PayPal, and it was a long process to get them comfortable,” Soto-Wright said in an interview. “We process billions of dollars on debit and credit cards in terms of cryptocurrency, and we think this is going to be a big step up for us in terms of helping us reach more customers, people that may have had their card declined from one of their banks.

42418338,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTettV,1714651674,First Mover Americas: BTC Stabilizes Around $58K Following Yesterday's Rout,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin stabilized around the $58,000 mark after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday. Chair Powell said the economy is too strong to cut rates while ruling out increases despite disappointing inflation figures. Having lost the $60,000 support level late on Tuesday, BTC fell as low as $56,500 yesterday, with U.S. spot ETFs seeing outflows of $563.7 million, the highest daily figure since the funds listed in January. At the time of writing bitcoin was priced at $58,282, up 1.4% over 24 hours. The digital asset market at large is up around 4%, according to CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), as altcoins such as SOL and AVAX led a recovery from Wednesday's rout.  The 11 spot bitcoin ETFs saw combined net outflows of $563.7 million on Wednesday, according to Farside Investors and CoinGlass, extending a five-day losing streak. Fidelity’s FBTC spearheaded outflows on Wednesday, losing $191.1 million in withdrawals, while Grayscale's GBTC saw $167.4 million pulled. Bitcoin, like other risk assets, is sensitive to changes in liquidity conditions and witnessed a brief rally from $56,620 to $59,430 on Wednesday after the Fed said it would curtail its quantitative tightening measures in June and introduced a program to buy back billions of dollars of government debt to improve liquidity in the bond market. The bounce was, however, short-lived and did little to stem the ETF outflows.  BlackRock's head of digital assets predicts that a new wave of inflows from a different type of investor is coming to bitcoin ETFs. Robert Mitchnick told CoinDesk in an interview that the coming months will see sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and endowments start to trade in the spot ETFs. BlackRock is seeing “a re-initiation of the discussion around bitcoin,” which turns on the topic of allocating to bitcoin and how to think about it from a portfolio construction perspective. He added that BlackRock has been talking about bitcoin to these sorts of institutions for several years, suggesting there could be a lot of pent-up demand for exposure via the ETFs.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the spread between bitcoin's price on Bitfinex and the cryptocurrency's global average price.  The spread has widened this week, with bitcoin trading at a premium of over $100 on Bitfinex.  The discrepancy may indicate traders on Bitfinex are buying the dip.

42418331,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTetmH,1714650521,Bitcoin’s Volatility Is Falling and This Will Continue as It Matures: Fidelity,"Bitcoin is becoming less volatile as the digital asset matures, the report said.  The crypto’s volatility has reached new all-time lows on a yearly scale, Fidelity noted.  Fidelity said bitcoin has been less volatile than Netflix over the last two years.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has long been viewed as a highly volatile asset, but its volatility is falling and will continue to do so as the cryptocurrency matures, Fidelity Digital Assets said in a research report on Wednesday.  “New assets typically take time to undergo price discovery, maturation and then settle into lower volatility,” analyst Zack Wainwright wrote, noting that even gold exhibited high volatility when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in the 1970s.  Bitcoin has already shown signs of maturation in its 15 years of existence and the volatility has reached new all-time lows on a yearly scale, the report said.  “There is a clear downward trend in volatility for bitcoin over its lifetime and we believe this trend will continue as bitcoin continues to mature over time,” Wainwright wrote.  Bitcoin is currently less volatile than 33 of the S&P 500 companies and was less volatile than 92 of the stocks in the index as recently as October 2023, when using 90-day realized historical volatility figures, Fidelity said.  Over the last two years the cryptocurrency has been less volatile than Netflix (NFLX), and when compared with the “magnificent seven,” a group of high-performing stocks, “bitcoin’s volatility does not appear as an outlier,” the report noted.  As is the case with all emerging asset classes with a small market cap, the cryptocurrency is more likely to experience higher volatility due to new capital flows, the note said. “However, as the asset class matures and its total market cap grows, the inflow of capital is expected to have a smaller impact because it will be flowing into a larger capital base.”  The approval of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January and the ensuing inflows were predicted to damp the cryptocurrency’s volatility. Still, the cryptocurrency fell over 16% last month.  “New capital inflows will not move the market or the marginal buyer or seller as much,” the report added.

26724177,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606169,1714649422,Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Predicts What To Expect Now,"The recent plummet in Bitcoin’s value below the $60,000 mark has sparked widespread speculation within the crypto community, raising questions among investors and market watchers about the future direction of its price. Marco Johanning, a well-known crypto analyst and founder of The Summit Club, took to X (formerly Twitter) to provide his insights on the current market conditions and what might be expected next. According to Johanning, the recent price action does not signify a market downturn but rather a correction within an ongoing bull market. He emphasizes, “Bitcoin lost the range. What now? First and foremost, a reminder: we are in a bull market, and this is a correction. This is not a rally in a bear market. Or in other words, the high time frame trend is up no matter what.” He supported this assertion with several indicators of a continued bullish trend. First, Bitcoin reached its bear market bottom in November 2022 and subsequently broke above the 200-day moving average, a critical indicator of long-term market trends. Following a drop below the 200-day moving average, there was a significant breakout above this level and THE major high time frame resistance in October 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dips Below $57,000: 4 Key Reasons Moreover, Bitcoin achieved a new all-time high in March 2024. Over the last 18 months, Bitcoin has consistently recorded higher highs and higher lows, which are typical characteristics of a bullish market. “This can’t be a bear market,” Johanning explained. “These elements underscore a fundamental bias crucial for assuming that the current drop is part of a broader bull market trend. Therefore, Bitcoin will eventually find a local bottom and ascend higher.” Bitcoin Price Analysis: What To Expect Next? Johanning provided a detailed breakdown of possible future scenarios based on technical analysis. His first scenario is based on the monthly chart where the most crucial level is at $48,000-$49,000. This level is key because it was a major hurdle overcome in February 2024. Now, it might serve as the perfect point for a bullish retest. Furthermore, there’s a significant market imbalance down to the $48,000-$49,000 range, coinciding with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level from the last monthly swing low. This setup suggests a strong potential for price stabilization and reversal at this level, according to Johanning. The second scenario grounds on the weekly chart where the important level is at $52,000. This level acts as a major high time frame support/resistance, marked by a weekly imbalance that extends up to $52,000, and it matches the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement from the bottom to the top of the last major rally, and the 0.618 level from the last swing low to the top. The third scenario is based on the lower timeframes. Here, the most significant level is at $57,000. This mark is critical as it represents the 0.5 Fibonacci level from the last swing low and was a key area during the February climb. This level might serve as the stage for a potential deviation or price trap. “The recent bearish engulfing pattern breaking the monthly levels, followed by a bearish retest, signals significant market shifts,” noted Johanning. “If Bitcoin swiftly reclaims these key levels, particularly the $57,000 mark, we could see a deviation scenario unfold. Otherwise, the $52,000 or $48,000-$49,000 levels will likely be tested, each representing a higher low in the ongoing uptrend.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Fine As Long As It Holds Above $49,000: Analyst Impact on Altcoins And Market Strategy Altcoins have displayed remarkable resilience in the face of Bitcoin’s volatility, which Johanning finds particularly promising. “Usually, a significant drop in Bitcoin accompanied by a loss of a higher time frame range would lead to severe declines in altcoins. However, their strength yesterday is a good indicator that the worst may be over for altcoins,” he commented. Johanning concluded his analysis with an optimistic outlook for both Bitcoin and altcoins, expressing confidence in the continuation of the bull market. He is actively accumulating more at current prices, anticipating substantial returns: “No matter which scenario plays out, I am committed to this trend until proven otherwise. I’m investing heavily, and if we truly remain in a bull market, the potential for profit is tremendous.” At press time, BTC traded at $58,328.

BlackRock has been talking about bitcoin to these sorts of institutions for several years.  While becoming the biggest spot bitcoin ETF would be an impressive milestone, BlackRock says it isn’t really focused on the size competition with Grayscale’s GBTC.  Don't be fooled by the first break in inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after 71 straight days. The current lull is likely to be followed by a new wave from a different type of investor, said Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets for BlackRock, the world's largest asset-management company.  The coming months could see financial institutions such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and endowments start to trade in the spot ETFs, Mitchnick said in an interview. The firm is seeing “a re-initiation of the discussion around bitcoin,” which turns on the topic of allocating to bitcoin {{BTC}} and how to think about it from a portfolio construction perspective.  Read More: BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Posts First Day of Outflows, Leading Record $563M Exit From U.S. Spot Products  “Many of these interested firms – whether we're talking about pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, other asset managers, family offices – are having ongoing diligence and research conversations, and we're playing a role from an education perspective,” Mitchnick said. And the interest is not new: BlackRock has been talking about bitcoin to these sorts of institutions for several years, he said.  Pent-up demand for the much-anticipated ETFs has seen more than $76 billion accumulated across these products since their approval in January. So far, some registered investment advisors (RIAs), a decent-sized subset of wealth advisory, are already offering BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, but only on an unsolicited basis. The next step is expected to be the unrestricted offering of bitcoin ETFs to clients of large wealth advisory players like Morgan Stanley.  AUM Horse Race  A lot of social media focus has been on the ETF assets under management (AUM) horse race, and in particular the comparison between IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC, which can be considered an incumbent because the existing BTC trust uplisted to an ETF. At last count IBIT stood at $17.2 billion and GBTC at about $24.3 billion.  A chunk of the current IBIT assets comes from Grayscale substitutions. Other sources could be outflows from higher priced international products in Canada or Europe, and some of it comes from bitcoin futures ETFs being recycled into spot products.  There are also existing bitcoin holders who would rather own the cryptocurrency in a brokerage account and not have to worry about custody, tax reporting complexities and other challenges associated with holding bitcoin on an exchange, Mitchnick said. And while becoming the biggest spot bitcoin ETF would be an impressive milestone, BlackRock isn’t really focused on that competition, but rather on educating its clients, he said.  Backing Ethereum  BlackRock filed for an ether {{ETH}} ETF back in November of last year, followed by CEO Larry Fink talking up the potential of tokenization, the representation of traditional assets on blockchains.  But an ether ETF raises the question of how BlackRock would go about educating clients, given the complexity of the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Moreover, why would investors want exposure to another crypto ETF if the Sharpe ratios of their portfolios had already been boosted by a spot bitcoin ETF? The ratio measures the return from an investment adjusted for its risk.  “When we think about this space, we see the potential for digital assets to benefit our clients and capital markets, with a focus in three areas: cryptoassets, stablecoins and tokenization,” Mitchnick said. “And these pillars, they're all interrelated. That's a really important thing for people to understand. And the work that we do across each informs our strategy and our insights for the others.”  UPDATE (May 2, 12:45 UTC): Changes ""will probably see"" to ""could see"" in second paragraph.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/02/blackrock-sees-sovereign-wealth-funds-pensions-coming-to-bitcoin-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5c08dc9387d1092dc49e57a74c1093c66d43773-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418336,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTetsT,1714642578,Bitcoin 'Call Writing' Back in Vogue as Cash And Carry Strategy Loses Shine,"Traders are back to selling higher strike, out-of-the-money bitcoin calls to generate yield.  The bitcoin futures premium has collapsed, weakening the appeal of the cash and carry arbitrage strategy.  Writing or selling bitcoin {{BTC}} call options, one of the most favored yield-generating strategies a year or so ago, is back in vogue as the recent market swoon has dented the appeal of the cash and carry arbitrage.  Selling a call option is a way of offering insurance to the buyer against bullish price moves in return for compensation, called a premium. The premium received is the maximum profit a call option seller stands to make.  In late 2022 and the first half of 2023, traders consistently sold bitcoin and ether call options at strikes well above the going market rate, generating additional yield on top of their spot market holdings. Now they are selling $80,000 BTC call options expiring at the end of May, according to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute. Bitcoin is currently trading around $58,000.  ""One popular strategy among traders is to sell out-of-the-money call options at higher strike prices, like the $80,000 mark set for the end of May. These strikes are beyond the current high range and are less likely to be exercised, allowing traders to collect premiums while reducing their risk exposure,"" Wintermute said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  If bitcoin ends May below $80,000, the sellers will walk away with the entire premium received. However, they stand to lose money if the price surges above $80,000 and they don't hedge or hold spot market longs.  Renewed demand for selling bitcoin options is evident from the slide in the leading crypto options exchange Deribit's implied volatility index (DVOL), an options-based measure of expected price volatility over the next 30 days.  The implied volatility is influenced by demand for options and increased preference for writing usually drives the metric lower.  The DVOL has collapsed from an annualized 72% to 59% in 10 days, according to charting platform TradingView. The ether {{ETH}} DVOL fell from 80% to 60% last week, only to bounce back to nearly 80% this week.  Singapore-based QCP Capital also noted a heavy selling of BTC call options last week.  ""This is the result of spot price being stuck in a tight range and the basis yields drying up. The desk has seen many customers pivot back to option selling strategies,"" QCP said in a market note last week.  Bitcoin fell as low as $56,600 Wednesday, diving out of a four-week consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 due to several factors, including dwindling demand for spot exchange-traded funds and a resurgent dollar index.  Cash and carry yield tanks  The cash and carry arbitrage involves buying the underlying asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling futures contracts when the latter trades at a notable premium. It's a strategy that helps traders capture the premium, or the pricing discrepancy, while bypassing volatility associated with price moves.  The strategy, however, is now a lot less appealing than during the first quarter because the futures premium has declined sharply in recent weeks.  The annualized three-month futures premium in bitcoin futures listed on Binance, OKX and Deribit has dropped to nearly 5%, down significantly from the high of 28% at the end of March. The premium in the regulated futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has seen a similar slide.  In other words, the so-called market-neutral bets no longer offer a significantly higher return than the much-safer U.S. Treasury notes. As of writing, the yield on the 10-year note, the so-called risk-free rate, was 4.61%.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/02/bitcoin-call-writing-back-in-vogue-as-cash-and-carry-strategy-loses-shine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8b30bbc2bfaf7a8162e8ae15b4d3a5989559ba3-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top Analysts Unanimously Call $56,000 The Bottom","Bitcoin (BTC) has been battered by a relentless bear market over the past month, with its price tumbling 20% from its record highs. However, amidst the carnage, glimmers of hope emerge as prominent analysts predict a potential bottom forming around the current $57,000 mark. Related Reading: Solana Crawls: Network Update Fails To Fix Traffic Jam, Price Feels The Pinch Tough Opening Month For Bitcoin The start of May has not been kind to Bitcoin. The once-dominant cryptocurrency has seen a steady decline, plunging back to levels last witnessed in March before its monumental surge to $73,700. This recent price drop represents the most significant decline of this cycle, raising concerns about a prolonged bear market. The pain extends beyond Bitcoin, with the broader altcoin market feeling the tremors. Litecoin (LTC), the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, has mirrored the downward trend, shedding a staggering 25% of its value in the past month. While historically seen as a more stable alternative to Bitcoin, Litecoin seems to be tethered to its big brother’s fate in this current downturn. Finding The Bottom: Bullish Predictions Surface Despite the prevailing gloom, a chorus of optimism is rising from the crypto analysis community. Several heavyweight analysts believe Bitcoin may have found its footing around the current price range of $56,000 to $58,000. Rekt Capital, a popular crypto analyst, emphasizes a historical pattern where similar 20% dips have been followed by significant rebounds. Michaël van de Poppe, another well-respected voice, echoes this sentiment, suggesting Bitcoin may be nearing the end of its price consolidation phase. He cautions of potential short-term fluctuations but highlights the $56,000 to $58,000 zone as a crucial support level. #BTC This is officially the deepest retrace in the cycle (-23.6%)$BTC #BitcoinHalving #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Gcapbl0Nu6 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 1, 2024 Uncertainty Looms As Market Awaits Fed Decision While analyst optimism is a welcome sign, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the crypto market. The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates could significantly impact investor sentiment and, consequently, Bitcoin’s price trajectory. A more hawkish stance from the Fed could trigger further selling, while a dovish approach might provide the tailwind needed for a Bitcoin rebound. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Dive: Will This Spark A Surge In Network Activity? Buckle Up For A Bumpy Ride The next few weeks will be crucial for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. The Federal Reserve’s decision and investor reaction to the current price slump will likely dictate the short-term direction.

Gruhn said he used money earned from the sale of his companies and did not know about the fraud at FTX before it imploded.  Patrick Gruhn, the former head of FTX Europe, has paid nearly $1.5 million, “the largest sum ever spent at auction on a piece of Titanic memorabilia,” for a gold pocket watch recovered from the body of the Titanic’s richest passenger, The Wall Street Journal reported.  The watch belonged to American property magnate John Jacob Astor IV, who was returning from a European honeymoon with his pregnant wife, Madeleine Astor.  When the Titanic hit an iceberg in 1912, an officer told Astor he couldn’t join his wife on a lifeboat until all women and children were safe. A week later, Astor’s body was found in the water, along with his possessions - a 14-karat “Gold watch, cuff links gold and diamond, diamond ring,” and a “gold pencil,” the report said.  Gruhn said he used money earned from the sale of his companies to buy the watch for his wife, Maren Gruhn, and that they would display the watch in museums.  In July 2023, the FTX bankruptcy estate asked a U.S. bankruptcy court to award recovery of more than $323.5 million from FTX’s Europe leadership. Later, as part of a settlement, Gruhn and others agreed to buy back FTX’s European assets for about $33 million. Grohn also said he did not know about the FTX fraud before it imploded.  Since the FTX collapse in Nov. 2022, Gruhn has moved to Oregon, from where he runs a German Catholic TV network and is attempting to build a crypto derivatives exchange in Europe.

26714304,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606121,1714634101,Buy Dogecoin Now? Analyst Believes DOGE Is Primed For A Surge,"In an analysis shared via X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez elaborated on the ongoing price correction of Dogecoin (DOGE), positing that it is a consistent precursor to major bull runs, drawing on historical patterns to forecast future price movements. Martinez’s commentary centers on the chart pattern known as the “descending triangle.” This is a bearish formation that occurs when the price follows a downward trendline intersecting a flat support line. Typically, this pattern indicates a continuation of a downward trend, but in the context of Dogecoin, Martinez suggests it precedes significant bullish breakouts. “The ongoing Dogecoin price correction is part of its usual behavior before massive bull runs! Let’s dive in,” Martinez shared. He explained the historical significance of this pattern in Dogecoin’s trading history: “In 2017, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle. Then, DOGE retraced by 40% before entering a 982% bull run!” Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price For May 2024 Martinez further analyzed more recent cycles to reinforce his observations, “In 2021, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle again. Then, DOGE retraced by 56% before skyrocketing by 12,197%!” According to Martinez, these retracements are not random but are characteristic of how Dogecoin has behaved in previous cycles, setting the stage for explosive gains. The analyst drew parallels to the current market conditions: “Now, in 2024, DOGE has yet again broken out of a descending triangle! It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run!” This assertion suggests that the current market downturn might be an opportune buying moment ahead of potential gains. Martinez’s analysis underscores the cyclical nature of Dogecoin’s price movements, suggesting a pattern of sharp declines followed by dramatic recoveries. “Over the years, Dogecoin appears to mirror its previous bull cycles! All you need is a little bit of patience,” he concluded. Short-Term Dogecoin Price Analysis Amidst this optimistic prediction, the Dogecoin price is in a precarious scenario in the short-term. Since mid-April, DOGE has experienced significant technical resistance. Particularly, the DOGE price was consistently rejected at the 50-day EMA over multiple instances, indicating strong selling pressure at higher price levels. Related Reading: Alarm Bells Ring For Dogecoin: Bearish Signal Points To 40% Crash Amid a broader market downturn, the trajectory was accentuated when Dogecoin’s price broke below the crucial 100-day EMA. This level, often watched by traders for signs of medium-term market direction, had previously offered support. The breach underscores a weakening market sentiment and could signal extended losses. As of press time, Dogecoin’s price hovered near $0.1259 after narrowly holding above the 200-day EMA yesterday, a key psychological and technical barrier. This moving average is now a pivotal point for Dogecoin; its sustained breach on the daily chart could significantly alter the market structure, potentially triggering a slide towards the $0.1005 support level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 31.63, edging close to the oversold territory but not conclusively signaling an imminent reversal. This indicates that while the market is nearing oversold conditions, the selling pressure has not fully abated. One last leg down might be necessary to get DOGE into “oversold” territory in order to mark a local bottom.

Previously, Rabotnik was extradited to the U.S. from Poland and then pleaded guilty to an 11-count indictment.  Yaroslav Vasinskyi, the Ukrainian national who is also known as Rabotnik, has been sentenced to 13 years and seven months in prison for his role in conducting over 2,500 ransomware attacks and demanding over $700 million in ransom payments, the Department of Justice announced on Wednesday.  The sentencing is part of a wider crackdown on ransomware groups which U.S. President Joe Biden promised in Nov. 2021. That promise came after REvil demanded $70 million in bitcoin {{BTC}} after hacking Miami-based software provider Kaseya.  In March 2022, on requests from the U.S., Russian authorities raided and dismantled REvil.  “As this sentencing shows, the Justice Department is working with our international partners and using all tools at our disposal to identify cybercriminals, capture their illicit profits, and hold them accountable for their crimes,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.  Rabotnik, 24, has also been ordered to pay over $16 million in restitution for his role as an affiliate of the groups that use the ransomware variant known as Sodinokibi or REvil to demand payments in cryptocurrency and using mixing services to “hide their ill-gotten gains.”  Previously, Rabotnik was extradited to the U.S. from Poland and then pleaded guilty to an 11-count indictment charging him with ""conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.""  In 2023, the DOJ confiscated nearly 40 bitcoin, worth nearly $2.3 million based on current prices, and $6.1 million in funds traceable to ransom payments received by other conspirators.

DOGE is now testing an important support at $0.1200. DOGE gained bearish momentum below the $0.140 and $0.1350 levels against the US dollar. The price is trading below the $0.1350 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price must settle above $0.1420 to move into a positive zone and start a fresh surge. Dogecoin Price Extends Losses After a close below $0.150, Dogecoin price extended losses and moved into a short-term bearish zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.1350 support zone. A low was formed at $0.1201 and DOGE is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $0.1250 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1640 swing high to the $0.1201 low. However, the bears protected more gains above the $0.130 resistance. Dogecoin is also below the $0.1420 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.130 level. Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $0.1350 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The main hurdle is at $0.1420. A close above the $0.1420 resistance and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1640 swing high to the $0.1201 low might send the price toward the $0.1550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1620 level. More Losses in DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.1350 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1220 level. The next major support is near the $0.120 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.120 support, the price could decline further.

Fidelity's FBTC led outflows, shedding $191 million, followed by GBTC, ARKB and IBIT.  Fed Chair Powell ruled out a rate hike as the next move, catalyzing a brief bounce in BTC.  Investors dumped U.S.-based spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the fastest pace ever on Wednesday, even as Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Jerome Powell dismissed the prospect of a rate hike.  The 11 ETFs saw a cumulative net outflow of $563.7 million, the largest since the funds began trading on January 11, extending a five-day losing streak, according to data source Farside Investors and CoinGlass. Investors have pulled out nearly $1.2 billion from the ETFs since April 24. Also notable Wednesday were the first-ever outflows from BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $36.9 million exiting the fund.  Read More: BlackRock Sees Sovereign Wealth Funds, Pensions Coming to Bitcoin ETFs  Fidelity’s FBTC led outflows on Wednesday, losing $191.1 million in withdrawals. This might be alarming to bulls as FBTC and BlackRock’s IBIT consistently attracted funds in the first quarter, more than compensating for the regular large outflows from the relatively costly Grayscale ETF (GBTC).  On Wednesday, GBTC witnessed the second-largest outflow of $167.4 million, followed by ARKB’s $98.1 million and IBIT's $36.9 million. Other funds also bled money even though Powell's net-dovish approach put a floor under risk assets, including bitcoin. A dovish stance is one where the central bank prefers employment and economic overgrowth over excessive liquidity tightening.  The Fed on Wednesday kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5% as expected. During the press conference, Powell said the economy is too strong to cut rates while pushing back against fears of renewed rate hikes or liquidity tightening stoked by recent disappointing inflation figures.  The Fed also said it will significantly curtailits alternate liquidity tightening program, called quantitative tightening (QT), starting June. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury announced a program to buy back billions of dollars in government debts for the first time in over two decades to improve liquidity in the bond market.  Like other risk assets, bitcoin is sensitive to expected changes in liquidity conditions and witnessed a brief rally from $56,620 to $59,430 following Powell’s comments. The yield on the 10- and two-year Treasury notes fell along with the dollar index.  BTC’s bounce, however, was short-lived, with bitcoin falling back to $57,300 at press time.

This investor, known for his skepticism toward Bitcoin, suggests that the cryptocurrency is entering a “do or die” phase, potentially marking the end of its bullish run if current trends continue. Breaking Points And Bearish Signals Peter Schiff has often voiced his bearish outlook on Bitcoin, and his latest comments come as Bitcoin has just slipped below the crucial $60,000 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Greed No More: Sentiment Back At Neutral After $57,000 Plunge This level had previously served as strong support during the short-term bull run, and its breach has intensified the bearish sentiment among investors. Schiff warns that staying below this threshold could spell doom for the bullish fervor, potentially derailing Bitcoin’s momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $57,054, teetering close to its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Schiff points out that remaining below this EMA could confirm a bearish trend, signaling an end to the rally. Amidst these developments, the market has seen an increase in trading volume, coupled with the price drop, indicating strong selling pressure. Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped from $45 billion to $48 billion, coinciding with a 6.3% price dip during the same period. This heightened activity is a traditional bearish indicator, lending weight to Schiff’s prediction of a downturn. Moreover, investor sentiment is treading thin ice with significant outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs, hitting a weekly high of $162 million. This departure of funds is particularly poignant as it unfolds just before the FOMC meeting, where potential interest rate hikes are on the agenda. These outflows reflect a broader market trend, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experiencing a substantial daily outflow of $93.23 million. According to SoSoValue, total net outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs yesterday, April 30, were as high as $162 million.

Despite the cryptocurrency witnessing declines of more than 15%, the financial expert has uncovered a significant pattern that indicates a potential bull flag following Bitcoin’s price correction. Crypto Expert Unveils “Banana Zone” Rally For Bitcoin In an X (formerly Twitter) post published on Tuesday, April 28, Pal shared a yearly chart depicting Bitcoin’s price movements from October 2023 to April 2024. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading below the $60,000 mark, at $59,185, marking monthly declines of 15.12% and weekly lows of 11.31%, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Bullish Signals, Can It Rally 50% From Here? The crypto analyst has suggested that Bitcoin’s recent price correction was a temporary setback. He predicts that once the market fully refreshes, what he calls “the Banana zone” will kick in. He also described Bitcoin’s recent price declines as a “pause that refreshes.” The pause emphasizes the final days of the crypto spring, a period marked by renewed optimism after bearish markets. A prime illustration of this phase occurred when Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs, surpassing $73,000 in March, following its decline from 2022 to 2023. On the other hand, the Banana zone represents a phase characterized by intense market excitement and the possibility of significant price increases. However, Pal has described this distinctive period as “when the market begins to anoint the new big L1 or L2, which explodes even vs SOL.” The financial expert noted that once the Banana zone commences, it may pick up momentum towards the end of the year and continue well into 2025, potentially reaching peak mania. He also shared a historical pictorial analysis illustrating his Bitcoin predictions. In the chart, the price of Bitcoin witnessed a Banana zone rally from $1,000 to $5,000 between 2014 and 2016 and from $10,000 to $60,000 between 2019 and 2020. Basing his predictions on this unique historical pattern, Pal suggested that Bitcoin’s price action from 2022 to 2024, starting at $50,000 could potentially skyrocket to a new all-time high of $300,000. Crypto Summer Is The Start Of Altcoin Season Pal has predicted that after the crypto spring, a new season for cryptocurrencies will occur, termed “the crypto summer.” The financial expert has confirmed that this period will be the start of the altcoin season, highlighting that it is typically marked by an intense bubble in the crypto fall. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Mark 3rd Consecutive Weeks Of Outflows With $435 Million In Withdrawals During the crypto summer, Pal projects that Ethereum would begin to outperform Bitcoin while Solana would accelerate its outperformance of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The financial CEO disclosed that the crypto summer and fall are often confusing, as cryptocurrencies tend to adopt a narrative and may get caught up in the prevailing euphoria. He predicts another two or more “nasty corrections” triggered by excessive leverage before the onset of the Banana zone. Additionally, Pal has indicated that three or four cryptocurrencies are set to lead the altcoin season, with one particular cryptocurrency emerging as the “Big new entrant,” much like Solana did during the previous cycle alongside Avalanche and Polygon.

Optimism’s spokesperson expressed enthusiasm for the investment, acknowledging the energy and momentum surrounding the protocol. The partnership with a venture capital firm like a16z is expected to fuel further development and innovation within the Optimism ecosystem. On March 7, the Optimism Foundation disclosed the sale of approximately 19.5 million OP tokens, valued at nearly $90 million, to an undisclosed buyer. These tokens were reportedly sourced from a 30% pool of OP’s original treasury, dedicated to the foundation’s working budget. Reports indicated that the buyer could delegate their tokens to third parties, enabling them to participate in Optimism’s governance. The foundation clarified that, due to the private nature of the sale, specific details regarding the terms and purchaser were not disclosed. Key Levels To Watch For Optimism Despite the recent surge in the Optimism ecosystem and its native token OP, the token still trades well below its all-time high (ATH) reached on March 6, 2024, currently down over 47% from that level. However, OP’s trading volume has experienced a notable surge, indicating continued interest in the token. According to CoinGecko data, the OP trading volume has increased by over 113% compared to the previous trading day on April 30, amounting to nearly $600 billion in 24 hours.

However, a clear indication of a positive trend for the Optimism token would require a successful consolidation above the $3.92 zone, marking the end of the month-and-a-half downtrend structure. Conversely, the $2.37 zone has proven to be a crucial support level for OP, as it has held for the past five days and prevented further price decline for the token. Digging deeper, the $2.25 mark is also a key support, with the most critical support level at $2.11. This level holds the key to Optimism’s macro bullish structure, as it initiated the token’s current uptrend.

42390908,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPyXT,1714608454,CZ’s Trial Proves It Pays to Cooperate,"A contrite Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has been sentenced to four months in federal prison, for his apparently limited role in the illegal activity at Binance, the crypto exchange he founded in 2017. U.S. District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle specifically noted CZ’s many contributions to charity, as well as willingness to accept responsibility, all while downplaying the idea CZ had any foreknowledge that Binance was intentionally committing crimes.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The sentence is more than CZ’s lawyers had asked for (they were bargaining for house arrest at most), but less than both the official sentencing guidelines (around one year) and what U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors sought (36 months). We don’t know exactly why CZ received the sentence he did. But it’s notable that, instead of fighting extradition, CZ willingly came to the U.S. to stand trial. The outcome is the latest signal that if caught doing a crime, cooperate, cooperate, cooperate.  See also: How Changpeng Zhao's 'Good Guy' Reputation Secured a 4-Month Prison Sentence  This is the plain and simple understanding drawn from comparing CZ to Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and fraudster behind rival exchange FTX, who, in March, was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and never really admitted to his multi-billion dollar theft of client funds. CZ, of course, wasn’t accused of stealing from customers, but instead of failing to implement the necessary compliance infrastructure expected of a money transmitter.  For a prehistoric, i.e. pre-crypto, comparison: 20 years ago, Martha Stewart showed no remorse after being convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice, maintaining her innocence and even comparing herself to Nelson Mandela. She served five months in prison – a month more than CZ will.  It’s also worth noting that in addition to Zhao’s prison sentence to be served in Washington State, he paid a $50 million fine alongside the gargantuan $4.3 billion settlement agreement Binance paid.  Dennis Kelleher, co-founder of Better Markets, a public service nonprofit, says the relatively short sentence proves that “crime pays.” Zhao will be able to keep his ownership stake in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume and vast personal wealth. DOJ attorney Kevin Mosley echoed this point: “Breaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.”  CZ, the family man  Whether or not you see the punishment as fitting the crime, Zhao’s appearance in court was revealing. Despite his influence, Zhao has lived a largely private life. I, for one, was unaware the former executive had a college-age son, who sat beside Zhao’s mother and nephew during his sentencing hearing. Dozens of letters written in support of Zhao’s character described him as a “family man.”  Zhao’s testimony at several points during the case emphasized his guilt over his actions (and inactions) and his willingness to take responsibility for mistakes made while he led Binance. In contrast, as the judge overseeing SBF’s case noted, SBF never offered ""a word of remorse for commission of terrible crimes.""  See also: As CZ Gets His Sentence, Michael Lewis Should Rewatch 'Star Wars'  It’s worth noting CZ wasn’t alone in complying with the U.S. government, but Binance itself also bent the knee. Once an entity that bragged about not having a home base, Binance has agreed to admit an “independent compliance monitor” to oversee the transactions that happen on the platform for the next three years. That could be invaluable data for government agencies looking to track down criminals leveraging blockchains.  Given that states like Venezuela, Iran and North Korea have all turned toward crypto as a means of funding, this information could even be, as The Verge’s Liz Lapatto points out, “geopolitically significant.” Who knows.

Analyst Signal Turnaround Amid Market Slump,"Bitcoin has recently concluded April, marking its most significant monthly decline. Despite the bearish momentum, leading market analysts, including Michael van de Poppe, believe that the worst may soon be over, suggesting that Bitcoin is nearing the end of its current correction phase. Bitcoin At The End Of Correction? April was challenging for Bitcoin, as its value plunged nearly 20%, dipping below $57,000, the lowest level traded since late February. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Profit Crunch: Hash Price Hits Record Low Post-Halving—What’s Next For Miners? This drop is part of an intense market sell-off that has slashed the combined cryptocurrency market cap by nearly 10%, bringing it down to $2.2 trillion. Amid these declines, Michael van de Poppe, a revered figure in the crypto analysis space, provided hope. In his recent statements on the social platform X, Van de Poppe suggested that Bitcoin’s current price levels might be nearing the bottom of this correction cycle. He highlighted the critical price range of $56,000 to $58,000 as pivotal for Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory, indicating potential areas for a rebound. #Bitcoin is at the end of the correction. It’s already down 20% from the highs and we’ll have some more downside to happen from here. If the correction continues, then I think the green zones between $56-58K are essential to watch.#Altcoins to bounce before. pic.twitter.com/4Mu3NA1HSg — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 1, 2024 A Closer Look At Predictions And Market Sentiments Van de Poppe isn’t alone in his optimistic outlook. Other analysts, like Checkmate, an on-chain expert, have analyzed Bitcoin’s historical data to predict future movements. Checkmate introduced the term “chopsolidation,” describing it as a phase of stagnant yet volatile market conditions that could precede a significant bullish run. He expects this phase to last about six months, followed by a potential 6 to 12 months of explosive growth reminiscent of past cycles. Furthermore, historical data from Bitcoin’s Halving years support the theory that after a halving event, the market tends to perform strongly towards the end of the year.
