Bitcoin Flutters Around $19K; Ether Holds Under $1.4K  By James Rubin  Investors didn't need a crystal ball on Tuesday to know that the U.S. central bank will likely announce a 75 basis point interest rate increase in less than a day.  They mostly shrugged as the weeks-long, telegraphed move neared, sending bitcoin and most other major cryptos lower. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just below $19,000, down more than 3% over the last 24 hours. BTC alternated fluttering above and below $19,000 for much of the U.S. trading day.  ""Bitcoin is lower as risk aversion runs wild as rates continue to surge,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for Oanda, wrote in an email.  Moya added that ""this week’s central bank decision fireworks, which could help fuel any sell-offs to retest the (bitcoin) summer lows. Peak pessimism is almost here for crypto, which is needed before longer-term money piles back in.""  Ether was recently changing hands under $1,350, a more than 4% drop from the previous day. The second-largest crypto by market value, which traded in a narrow range, has fallen about 18% over the past four days and more than 32% since reaching a pre-Merge, euphoric high over $2,000 in August.  Most other altcoins stood unsteadily in a red swamp with ATOM and LUNA recently down about 11% and 7%, respectively, over the previous 24 hours.  Stocks  Crypto prices dovetailed with stock indexes, which also plummeted on Tuesday as investors continued their recent exile from riskier assets. The tech-focused Nasdaq, the S&P 500, which has a heavy technology component, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all declined about a percentage point. The Fed's continued monetary hawkishness aims to quell inflation, which has reached four-decade highs in recent months, but risks casting the global economy into recession.  Central banks globally have been wrestling with the same dilemma and a number of them have raised their interest rates in recent weeks. Sweden's Riksbank became the latest, boosting its rate 1% on Tuesday, its largest increase in nearly two decades.  ""The Riksbank is setting the tone for this week, and expectations should grow for more central banks err(ing) on the side of being more aggressive with fighting inflation,"" Oanda's Moya wrote.  Crypto news  Earlier Tuesday, Nasdaq (NDAQ) announced that it was starting a cryptocurrency custody service to cash in on the demand from institutional crypto investors. The initiative by the second-largest U.S. stock market operator follows a wider trend among large institutional investors and other Wall Street organizations that will be offering crypto products and services.  Last month, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, announced that it will provide cryptocurrencies for its institutional clients, and Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., which processes almost all U.S. stock market trades, released its own blockchain as it looks to speed up the settlement of trades.  Analysts have suggested that the trend bodes well for cryptos, although Bruno Ramos de Sousa, head of global expansion at crypto asset manager Hashdex, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that TradFi initiatives would have little affect on crypto prices.  ""Looking forward is how much does news like this in terms of institutional adoption have the ability to impact the price action, and I think less and less,"" Ramos de Sousa said. ""We're gonna see that. It's become normalized to think that institutional players are into the crypto space.""

The Case Against Ian Balina  By Sam Reynolds  Crypto promoter Ian Balina was the subject of a criminal complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), filed Monday charging him with conducting an unregistered securities offering in early 2018 for his SPRK token initial coin offering (ICO).  The SEC’s case against Balina relies on an extraterritorial claim: ""Their ETH contributions were validated by a network of nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country. As a result, those transactions took place in the United States.""  To be sure, nodes on the Ethereum network are largely based in the U.S. Much has been written about the concentration of Ethereum – and other protocols – nodes within commercial data centers. Research from crypto data provider Messari shows that 52% of Ethereum nodes are based on Amazon Web Services cloud servers while 42% of Solana’s nodes are on Hetzner (a German cloud provider) servers.  Ethernodes data shows that 43% of these nodes, regardless of what cloud provider they are hosted on, are based in the U.S. while 11.6% are based in Germany.  But that’s the network of today. The SEC’s complaint is about activity in 2018.  Historical data about node distribution by country isn’t as readily available as current data. But the information that’s online shows that the Ethereum network of yesterday is more evenly distributed around the world.  In a 2018 paper, University of Massachusetts researcher Sunny Katkuri created a script to analyze geographical information about 19,000 public Ethereum nodes. Katkuri’s data shows that 33.6% of these nodes were in the U.S., 12.6% in China, 6.2% in Malaysia and 42.5% in other countries.  Earlier data from a 2016 paper by researchers at Technische Universität Berlin shows that IP addresses of data centers in Germany, Canada, Bulgaria and Singapore hosted the most nodes.  There’s also a technical issue here. Ethereum miners, which also run nodes to validate transactions, were at the time largely based in Europe and China.  So with that in mind, it's tough to conclude that the Ethereum network of 2018 was “clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country” and thus under the control of U.S. securities laws. It’s not in dispute that U.S. nationals purchased the ICO tokens, but the network on which the tokens existed wasn’t inherently American.  The SEC declined to provide comment for this story.

DeFi heavyweights Curve and Aave are reportedly working on their own stablecoin projects.  Stablecoins are a subset of cryptocurrencies that maintain their price stable to another asset, usually pegged to the U.S. dollar. They serve as an important bridge between government-issued (fiat) currencies and crypto assets, and have seen tremendous growth in the last few years, now making up $152 billion of the $1 trillion crypto asset class.  Coin98 dollar, also called CUSD, started trading Monday on three blockchains, namely Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain and Solana. “In the long run, CUSD will gradually expand into other DeFi ecosystems in the multi-chain world,” according to a Coin98 post.  CUSD is a fully collateralized stablecoin that supports its value through Circle USDC and Binance USD held in a Coin98 reserve. Users can mint and redeem CUSD at a 1:1 ratio by depositing USDC or BUSD. At the initial phase, the CUSD’s supply will be capped at $50 million.

42416191,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubcER,1663708935,What Cardano’s Highly Anticipated Vasil Hard Fork Will Bring,"On Thursday, Sept. 22, the Cardano blockchain will carry out its much-anticipated Vasil hard fork, a backward-incompatible upgrade taking place on the main network that is intended to enrich smart contract capabilities, increase the chain’s throughput and reduce costs.  Plutus is Cardano’s native smart contract language. Vasil will deliver a second version of Cardano’s scripting language, Plutus version (v)2. As the foundational layer of Cardano, Plutus efficiently separates the code that drives smart contracts, which remains off-chain and runs on a user’s machine, from the on-chain validation of transactions. The new Plutus v2 features will become available one epoch after Thursday’s hard fork, expected to occur on Sept. 27.  Read more: Blockchain Cardano’s Vasil Upgrade Confirmed for Sept. 22  Cardano is sometimes criticized because its smart contract capabilities are seen as lagging behind Ethereum and other layer one blockchains with their thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) communities. Unlike Ethereum, which uses an account-based model rather like a bank’s, Cardano is based on the “unspent transaction output” (UTXO) system associated with Bitcoin, a way of calculating what’s held in users’ wallets by keeping tabs on the change left over when coins are spent.  Vasil’s changes to the Cardano ledger will allow inputs and UTXOs to be used in scripting contracts without spending them. In other words, facilitating access to information stored on the blockchain without the need for spending and re-creating UTXOs, as was previously the case. A tweak to the way reference scripts are handled allows for a drastic reduction in the size of transactions that run them, where previously this caused processing delays.  Cardano extends Bitcoin’s accounting methodology to handle smart contracts – known as “extended unspent transaction outputs” (EUTXO) – designed to keep as much functionality off the blockchain as possible, a key feature both when it comes to scaling and in terms of reducing the scope for attacks and security breaches.  “Some see blockchains as fully programmable platforms, game engines, databases and whatnot. But they really aren’t. They’re ledgers, and they keep track of transactions,” said Cardano technical director Matthias Benkort. As such, keeping critical on-chain executions at a minimum is crucial for security and audit purposes, he added.  Other improvements post-Vasil (although, no hard fork is required for this) will include what’s known as “diffusion pipelining,” a way of increasing Cardano’s speed and scaling potential by compressing some of the idle time by propagating blocks ahead of their full validation, while still validating headers.  This scaling upgrade will streamline the process of sharing information about newly created blocks among network participants by ensuring that blocks can be propagated across the network well within five seconds after their creation, according to a blog post.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FORKS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/20/what-cardanos-highly-anticipated-vasil-hard-fork-will-bring,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dee4bc734b130883ac8b496b6f2c0aea49bbddc-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421453,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMgP,1663707599,What Are Solarpunk and Lunarpunk Anyway?,"Ethereum culture can be split into three categories: cypherpunk, solarpunk and lunarpunk. I say ""can"" because some argue the -punk distinctions could happily be folded into one. The problem is, depending on whom you ask, it’s not clear which prefix dominates. It’s the kind of conceptual catnip I love, so here goes.  Paul Dylan-Ennis, a CoinDesk columnist, is a lecturer/assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin.  Cypherpunk is a well-worn path in the history of crypto/Web3. It was a core influence on Satoshi Nakamoto, who chose a cypherpunk mailing list to announce Bitcoin. Cypherpunks have a punkish DIY attitude toward open-source development, usually oriented toward the creation of credibly neutral protocols. They highly value privacy. Ethereum’s cypherpunks are often the hacker-engineer developers who maintain the Ethereum protocol.  Solarpunk is a more recent movement in crypto/Web3, which seems to have formed in reaction to the individualist, libertarian-leaning streak running through Bitcoin. To solarpunks, Bitcoin has at worst morphed into an American-style populism – steaks, cowboy hats, boomer memes – and at best ossified into irrelevance.  Solarpunk is, then, a progressive label you wear to show you are not that type of crypto, not a bitcoiner, thereby deftly avoiding complete social suicide (at least until you bring up non-fungible tokens). But it’s an ambiguous term, which might as well be spelled as “hippy” to critics.  To critics, solarpunk is an empty concept with no meaningful content – little more than an aesthetic, which has roots in a sci-fi microgenre. Despite the term’s ubiquity in Web3 circles, solarpunk is not just another name for etherean, because they also reject the Ethereum-based market nihilism of DeFi degens (short for the degenerates of decentralized finance).  See also: Who Is Building Ethereum's Public Goods? | Opinion  I cannot blame people for their suspicions about solarpunk because, curiously, nobody has attempted to explain what solarpunk is in our context. So, having sat around hoping someone else would do it, I present to you what solarpunk means within the world of crypto.  Solarpunk pre-crypto  Prior to its Web3 debut, solarpunk had a few fuzzy senses:  Shorthand for a small literary genre with roots in South America between the 2000s-2010s. This first strand starts out quite cyberpunk, where solarpunk simply meant “set in a solar-powered setting,” whether this was positive or negative in outcome. The genre slowly developed its own characteristic themes and became more optimistic. A typical story would be about humanity repairing our relationship with the natural world, crucially, without regressing into Luddism. Notably, the stories are somewhat conscious their world-building might influence the real world, rather than simply existing for entertainment. You can find these short stories in translation in “Solarpunk: Ecological and Fantastical Stories in a Sustainable World” (2018).  The name for a smattering of short stories and art by Western authors and graphic designers who published in blogs and on social media originally, before creating their own collections and magazines beginning around 2010. This is the source of the stereotypical solarpunk “aesthetic.” It is steampunk Studio Ghibli meets early-level Zelda (and things can get a little flowery). Much of this art is Tumblr-quality, but it is also, to be a little basic, quite gentle and nice to look at, begging for some emerging artist to raise the standard, push the medium. The stories are of quite varying quality, but a decent representative collection is “Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Summers” (2018) and the recently launched Solarpunk Magazine continues on this tradition. This kind of imagery – futuristic architecture populated with trees – has made its way even into Vitalik Buterin’s blog, albeit wryly.  A post-hoc definition for a microgenre of science fiction by novelists who wrote, from the 1970s onwards, about the creation of sustainable societies and particularly how they can be achieved. Ursula K. Le Guin and Kim Stanley Robinson are the standard bearers. This microgenre portrays societies that are post-capitalist and ecologically utopic. For example, in Robinson’s “Pacific Edge” (1990) we see a description of a California in 2065 that has managed to transition into a “utopian” society, but one quite grounded and realistic. I say “utopian” because the term implies an unachievable state, but these novels usually present societies that for all intents and purposes feel like “real utopias,” to be a bit paradoxical.  A more active, prefigurative branch associated with anarchists such as Saint Andrew where there is a stronger emphasis on putting theory into action – like seed-bombing cities. This variation arguably also includes early solarpunk pioneers in crypto/Web3.  It is worth noting that the origins of the current crypto/Web3 concept of solarpunk remain unclear.  However, within the Web3 context, solarpunk refers to a political aesthetic that promotes positive externalities, positive-sum worlds and public goods in Web3 and beyond – what I call the “three Ps.” Crypto’s solarpunks are characterized by a commitment to collaboration, optimism and are green-pilled.  The three Ps  The three Ps of solarpunk Web3 (as I hope everyone will now call them) are closely related. The first, an emphasis on creating positive externalities, is based on a recognition of tech’s history of producing negative externalities, such as fake news spreading on Meta. Solarpunks are committed to conscious tech building, where you take into account the implications of your project beyond your immediate community.  The textbook definition for public goods, P number two, are goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means you can’t stop anyone from using them and using them does not diminish them for anyone else. In the solarpunk context, it originally meant a focus on unprofitable but necessary infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, but has since expanded to helping fund good causes beyond Web3 as well.  Finally, positive sum world-building is the guiding star for solarpunks – the effort to build a better world for tomorrow. If contemporary crypto culture is focused on financial immediacies (like rug-pulling or raising funds just to raise funds), solarpunks attempt to break the cycle by actually building public goods with positive externalities that last beyond us, at a civilizational level.  Dark side of the moon  The rise of solarpunk as an aesthetic within Web3 has been met with criticism. Surprisingly, this comes not from outside the industry but those adjacent, the lunarpunks. Lunarpunks do not see themselves as Web3, but they are definitely in dialogue with it, most likely strategically.  A bit of background: Lunarpunk also pre-exists its Web3 form, but in a much more obscure and niche sense as a mystical brand of solarpunk. It was also very nature-oriented, but a little more pagan and witchy. Think psy-trance festival in a small college town. I have not been able to uncover any substantive politics associated with pre-Web3 lunarpunk.  The lunarpunk critique of solarpunk first bubbled up in privacy advocate, DarkFi developer and CoinDesk alumna Rachel-Rose O’Leary’s quasi-manifesto “Lunarpunk and the Dark Side of the Cycle,” which put forward her radical, lunarpunk ideology.  O’Leary presents solarpunk as the naive sibling, who means well but lacks the rugged life experience of the lunarpunk adventurer, who has seen the enemy up close. Meanwhile, back at home, their hippie friend has spent his summer blissfully listening to techno on a terrace in some sun-kissed European city (possibly Barcelona). They have probably joined a decentralized autonomous organization. (You might notice that in O’Leary’s manifesto I’m the solarpunk encouraging people to join DAOs!) This is the lighter critique, the long-running criticism in politics is that the ally lacks discipline. And in politics the ally sometimes gets the harsher words, even more than the enemy.     The harsher criticism is that solarpunk is both naively optimistic and represses the emerging dystopian “dark cycle.” Solarpunks, O’Leary acknowledges, are concerned with building public goods that outcompete the old institutions when writing that “solarpunk hackers are creating transparent infrastructures for funding public goods.” But the introduction of the term “transparency” – not a word commonly used in solarpunk public goods communities (Gitcoin, DoinGud, etc.) – reframes their intent quite dramatically.  See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity) | Opinion  This is an overlay coming from the lunarpunk perspective, which also uses sci-fi-tinged naturalistic motifs, but which equates images of the sun not with optimism but surveillance. Ethereum itself, rather than simply solarpunk, is surveillance-prone, O’Leary argues.  The deeper critique is that solarpunk contains inherently statist tendencies and impulses that are dangerous. The idea here is that the solarpunk interest in building Web3 identity-based systems is intrinsically statist because it follows the Western rationalist logic of Gestell – slowly turning people into documented stock, controllable with bureaucracy.  O’Leary also contrasts solarpunk with the more solemn work lunarpunks are doing in preparation for an oncoming privacy war by building an anonymity-preserving blockchain called DarkFi. This war felt theoretical until recently, but has taken on a greater seriousness since the Tornado Cash sanction by the U.S. Treasury Department.  Lunarpunks see crypto’s clashes with the state as inevitable. O’Leary contrasts this with solarpunks’ denial about this conflict and desire to ignore the ultimate bearish scenario where retail and venture capitalists flee at first sight of the state’s ugly side.  Underlying all this is the idea that the solarpunks, with their taste for transparent systems-building, will have effectively built their own prison.  Political consciousness  Perhaps the most prescient part of O’Leary’s essay is the prediction that regulatory clampdowns, like Tornado Cash, will reignite crypto/Web3’s political consciousness. This has certainly proven true, but it has turned out that it is not the cypher- or solarpunks that are willing to flip, but the market nihilist DeFi degens, especially their front-ends, so to speak.  Ethereum’s cypherpunks have spent their time plotting countertactics to on-chain censorship and even raised the old school specter of a Bitcoin Civil War-style User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF).  And the solarpunks? I think any self-critical solarpunk will recognize they have been asleep at the wheel regarding privacy. This is not the same as being ignorant or unaware of privacy. And this is absolutely not the same as being pro-surveillance. Instead, it is simply that when the good times are good it’s easy to forget how vicious the enemy can be. But the enemy is still here.  As my online nym (polarpunklabs) suggests, I’m somewhere in between the sun and the moon. All my life the lunarpunk position has been obvious to me. I am deeply interested in realpolitik and how the world works really. Thinking like this is effectively a curse. You can see for miles and miles, but what use is sight if it’s just a vision of endless deception and brutality?  The image of solarpunk that O’Leary presents us is realpolitik: It equates the sun with transparency, identity and even the open desert. The problem with this, from a political (not realpolitik) perspective, is most people do not want to exist in a Hobbesian war of all against all mindset. You have to offer something better beyond this world and that is what solarpunk is, the world beyond this world. Without it you have no clear aim or teleology, which is the same as being trapped in the present.  The solarpunk aesthetic is fascinating because it is all future. You could ask anyone in the world, anywhere, whether they would be happy to be trapped in a solarpunk picture forever and they’d likely be OK with it.  Maybe, and this is the crucial part, they might be willing to fight for it too, even if it involved decades-long lunarpunk wars of attrition in the forests and the mountains. But if there is nothing beyond war, of a world beyond this world, then that’s what you’ll find, nothingness.  A recent interview by O’Leary indicates a lunarpunk interest in this positive future, built along the lines of Öcalans’ democratic confederalism, which, I would posit, is a little bit solarpunk in its ecological-consciousness.  Go dark  I would argue, then, the solarpunk vision should not be seen in terms of repression. It is a desirable thing to aim for, and shows us in the here and now how much this society lacks. It should be propagandized in increasingly beautiful images, texts, discussions, videos and movies.  O’Leary finishes her piece by saying solarpunk should integrate the lunarpunk unconscious, which is certainly assured now that the space has been privacy-pilled, but she adds the only hope for solarpunk is to “go dark.” Absolutely, in terms of strategy.  See also: The One Word That Defines Ethereum's Goals | Opinion  Yet, we should also demand the light, the transparent fullness of solarpunk optimism. This is how I imagine a perfect synthesis of solar- and lunarpunk. A transparent society of utopic quality (demand nothing less) protected by a vigilant darkness.  Without the light what is there to protect anyway? We should never give up the sun to the state.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | FORKS,Paul J.

42416207,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubdRv,1663707576,Market Wrap: Markets Wait for Fed to Officially Announce What It Has Signaled for Weeks,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether are down Tuesday ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision.  Bitcoin (BTC) declined 2.5% on moderate volume, when compared to its 20-day moving average for volume. BTC’s hourly chart shows a steady decline that began in overnight trading and was punctuated by high volume during the 13:00 UTC (9:00 a.m. ET) hour. The timing of the spike in volume during the downturn coincided with the opening of U.S. equity markets, and could signal a risk-off approach ahead of the Federal Reserve committee’s announcement at the end of its two-day meeting Wednesday.  Ether (ETH) fell 1.6%, the sixth day of declines in the last 10 days. For those keeping score, ether prices are down 18% since the Sept. 15 Ethereum Merge and down 63.5% for the year to date. The supply of ether has increased 3,700 post-Merge but the rise has not been deflationary. Absent the Merge, however, it is estimated that ETH’s supply would have increased by 66,000 ETH over the same period.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, declined 2.5%  Economic Calendar: Investors and other observers of the U.S. economy await the Federal Reserve’s rate decision Wednesday.  Market Wrap is using the CME Group FedWatch tool as a proxy for rate expectations. The tool uses CME Group Fed Funds Futures contracts to determine probabilities for rate hikes. Currently, the CME tool is predicting an 84% probability of a 75 basis point (BPS) hike, and a 16% probability of a 100 BPS move. A 100 BPS, or 1%, increase would be the highest in four decades.  Any hike will mark the fifth consecutive rate increase by the Fed’s rate-setting committee, the FOMC. Prior rate hikes occurred on:  July 28 – 75 basis points  June 16 – 75 basis points  May 5 – 50 basis points  March 17 – 25 basis points  BTC returns for the 30 days following each rate hike were: -3%, -18%, 3.9% and -18%, respectively.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities declined, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 falling by 1%, 0.95% and 1.1%, respectively.

Technical Take  BTC Prices Appear Poised to Trade Around ‘Point of Control’  Bitcoin is trading in a tight range and appears positioned to continue that way. As mentioned in Monday’s Market Wrap, bitcoin is suffering from a lack of strong catalysts. What few there are include what the market expects from the Fed on interest rate policy and the extent to which the central bank surprises markets.  The Fed is unlikely to announce anything surprising on the interest rate front. Investors will likely be paying more attention to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments once the FOMC meeting ends because the rate decision has largely been telegraphed for weeks.  If Powell expresses optimism about the state of U.S. inflation, bitcoin’s price will likely move higher. Absent that, all signs point to a situation where the price takes a step back for every step forward.  Technically, BTC is trading below its “point of control” in relation to the Volume Profile Visible Range tool (VPVR). VPVR illustrates trading volume by price level. The point of control, denoted by the red line in today’s chart, signals where the largest amount of activity occurred, and represents an area of high agreement in price.  When an asset trades above its point of control, it implies an area of support because investors are typically willing to step in and buy at this price level. When an asset trades below its point of control, it represents an area of resistance, or the point where investors have historically been willing to sell.  It can also represent opportunity if the current price falls far enough below the POC. BTC’s current price is 7% below its POC, which may not present a compelling enough opportunity to lure significant buying pressure.  Bitcoin’s Average True Range (ATR), which measures the average trading range of an asset over a period, is now 5% of BTC’s current value, less than the 7% spread between price and the POC. Price momentum also appears to signal mild price action because BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 38 implies the crypto is fairly valued at the moment.  The RSI indicator measures price momentum and signals whether an asset is potentially overbought (readings over 70) or oversold (readings below 30). Its current reading is likely to approach an oversold area on further downturns but has not reached that mark yet.  All told, a compressed price range, high price agreement and tepid momentum don’t foreshadow sharp price moves up or down for bitcoin any time soon.

42416194,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubcJT,1663706632,Hacked Crypto Market Maker Wintermute Has $200M in Outstanding DeFi Debt,"Cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute, the victim of Tuesday's $160 million hack, has over $200 million in outstanding DeFi debt to several counterparties, according to on-chain data.  The largest debt involves a $92 million tether (USDT) loan issued by TrueFi, which is due to mature on Oct. 15.  Wintermute's loan book also includes a $75 million debt, comprised of USDC and wrapped ether (WETH), owed to Maple Finance and a $22.4 million debt owed to Clearpool. CoinDesk tracked Wintermute's holdings using an address attributed to the market maker by the data site Nansen.  London-based Wintermute, which trades billions of dollars everyday across multiple crypto venues, became the latest company to get hit by a wave of hacks across the decentralized finance ecosystem on Tuesday. In August, cross-chain bridge Nomad had $190 million drained after hackers exploited a vulnerability, with $1.9 billion being stolen in hacks in the first half of this year, according to analytics firm Chainalysis.  In a tweet thread following the hack, Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy insisted that the company remains solvent and that it has ""twice over"" the amount of equity that was stolen.  ""If you are a lender to Wintermute, again, we are solvent, but if you feel safer to recall the loan, we can absolutely do that,"" Gaevoy said in a tweet.  As much of the issued debt is in stablecoins, it is unclear whether Wintermute's description of ""equity"" covers digital assets.  The hacker sent $111 million to Curve Finance's 3pool with some suggesting that this was done to avoid stablecoins being frozen by issuers Tether and Circle.  It's not uncommon for crypto market makers and trading firms to carry debt owed to projects in the course of billions of dollars of daily trades. For example, Alameda currently owes TrueFi $18 million; the trading giant has previously repaid $484 million to the DeFi credit protocol.

OpenSea said it’s planning to support several collections already minting on Arbitrum, including Smolverse, GMX Blueberry Club and Diamond Pepes.  OpenSea currently offers NFTs minted on Ethereum, Polygon, Klaytn and Solana. According to data from NFT Scan, NFTs on Arbitrum have a lifetime volume of 9,722 ETH, which pales in comparison to the lifetime NFT volume of roughly 23.5 million ETH on Ethereum. With the network’s Merge completed last Thursday, Ethereum's improvement may reduce the need for roll-ups such as Arbitrum to increase speed and reduce costs.  OpenSea said it is optimistic about its ability to offer another platform on which creators can mint and sell digital assets. “This is a first step in building our goal of a Web3 future where people have access to the NFTs they want on the chains they prefer,” the marketplace said in a tweet.

Jamil Nazarali, CEO of crypto exchange EDX Markets, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday that his exchange is bringing “the best practices from traditional finance” into the world of crypto, claiming it will make digital asset trading “safer, faster [and] more efficient” while driving down costs.  The exchange, which will serve institutional accounts, is backed by a handful of financial titans including Charles Schwab (SCHW), Fidelity Digital Assets and Citadel Securities, where Nazarali previously served as former senior executive.

Though blockchains and their cryptocurrencies were created, in part, as a way to eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, Nazarali says intermediaries are not going away.  “The reality is, you’re going to have an intermediary either way,” he said. He added his firm’s key objective is to get the best market price for crypto investors.  Read more: Wall Street Titans' New Crypto Exchange Aims to Seriously Cut Costs for Investors  “We’re going to take the best price in the market from market makers and we’re going to match it against customers' orders that come in,” Nazarali added.  Nazarali previously told CoinDesk the firm will offer only “a handful of tokens,” including bitcoin (BTC), in a bid to avoid regulatory oversight.  Other traditional Wall Street players are jumping into crypto, but Nazarali welcomes the competition. The Nasdaq market's latest push into crypto will not mean direct competition for his exchange, Nazarali said, but it does suggest “a great development in the market.”  It will “bring more institutional players in, and we welcome it,” he said.

The company added in a tweet the offering will also be available on Wednesday for transfer on Polygon and Ethereum networks.  “The inclusion of USDC on Robinhood is a clear signal that the platform is setting its sights abroad where the usage of stablecoins is more popular and useful for investors,” Bryan Hernandez, president and co-founder of decentralized-finance (DeFi) app Structure, told CoinDesk.  “Theoretically, the addition of USDC could allow Robinhood users to send payments for a wide variety of purposes, just as you’d imagine Venmo or PayPal doing so for their users,” he said.  Hernandez added that he sees more utility for global users because the domestic market already contains money transmitters.  “Because the U.S. market is saturated with well-established money transmitters, stablecoins are less necessary for the peer-to-peer transaction benefits international users would experience,” he said.  The move comes as other global crypto exchanges including Binance and WazirX have said they will delist USDC in support of other stablecoins.  Robinhood added Uniswap’s UNI token to its offerings in July.  On Tuesday, Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood's chief technology officer, said on Twitter that he will be elaborating on the addition of USDC and what may come next during the Converge22 conference in San Francisco next week.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflow CDD Has Recently Observed A Sharp Increase As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there has been some possible selling pressure coming from the long-term holders recently. The relevant indicator here is the Bitcoin &apos;Coin Days Destroyed&apos; (CDD). A coin day is defined as the amount accumulated by exactly 1 BTC when sitting idle for 1 full day. The total number of coin days in the market, therefore, represent the sum of time each coin in the supply has been dormant for. When these coins that had previously been sitting still show some movement, the coin days gained by them are said to be &apos;destroyed&apos; as they reset back to zero. The total number of these is precisely what the CDD metric measures. Related Reading: These Two On-Chain Signals Precede Bitcoin Falls, Suggests Analyst Now, since long-term holders keep their coins for long periods, they naturally accumulate significantly higher coin days than the rest of the market. As such, spikes in the CDD can be a sign of activity from this cohort.

42376265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX69px5,1663694654,Neudata and CoinDesk Indices Discuss Crypto Data and Digital Assets,"Though a relatively new asset class, interest in crypto data has ramped up significantly over the past few years, with many new crypto data vendors entering the alternative data space. Neudata sat down with Jodie Gunzberg (JG), managing director of CoinDesk Indices, and Nicholas Neary (NN), research analyst at Neudata, to discuss the past and future of the emerging sector.  When did you begin to see more interest from institutional investors in crypto data?  JG: We began to see interest in as early as 2014 for bitcoin price data, then we saw growing interest in data on ether and for a few other of the largest tokens at the time. However, the significant institutional growth in interest and demand for crypto data happened in 2020 during the [coronavirus] pandemic crash when most assets were falling together with a global, massive economic stimulus in response. This is when many of the characteristics like volatility, liquidity, volume, valuation techniques, use cases, and increased regulatory interest indicated the emergence of digital assets as a new asset class.  NN: Neudata began to see an influx in interest for crypto data among its institutional investor clients in late 2020 and early 2021. Drawing parallels, this spike in attention coincided with bitcoin attempting/breaching its all-time high of 2017 (roughly $20K).  How have investor preferences for crypto data changed over time?  JG: In the beginning, bitcoin price data was most highly demanded. Then, as investors were looking to explore deeper, other data related to transactions (value, count, size, speed), blocks (size and fees), mining difficulty and hash rates became more interesting. As the technology evolved beyond bitcoin and its use case, investors demanded more information about the digital assets available including price but also more information about liquidity and size generally represented by volume and market capitalization.  NN: On-chain data (from the blockchain networks themselves, including details of the blocks and details of transactions) is in the spotlight a little more now. In comparison, market/exchange data (tick-by-tick trade data, order book data, liquidity measures, exchange rate, etc.) and other approaches based on technical analysis or sentiment were previously more popular.  Which types of crypto data have become more popular in recent months?  JG: As the use cases of digital assets have grown so that various industries, industry groups and sectors can be defined, data pertaining to the categorizations have been popular. The index-level data, constituents and weights are increasingly requested. Single-asset price index data is valuable for its history and algorithm to reduce the impact of outliers. As the market matures there has been less concern about large outliers so single-asset pricing requirements are diminishing.  NN: We have seen continued interest in all areas of crypto. However, in recent months we have identified an increase in the number of on-chain analytics providers. We believe we are seeing this trend due to the crypto winter, where indicators of network growth among crypto projects are important to track.  What does the future of crypto data look like?  JG: In the future, I expect more demand for on-chain data as analyzing, finding and constructing index strategies with fundamental factors become more popular. With that, a greater discovery may take place in identifying specific factors for certain digital asset sectors, industry group and industries. Though the demand for technical data will likely remain strong, the fundamental, on-chain data should grow in popularity.  NN: It's a hard question to answer. We think the right approach is to consider what the future of crypto itself will look like:  Increased regulations for stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies  Broader adoption of crypto as payment method (following in the footsteps of companies like PayPal, Square, Tesla and Starbucks, which already have begun adopting the technology)  Legal and regulatory-risk data could become more prominent as regulators take a closer look at stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. We may also see new datasets that track payment flows from users’ wallets to corporations’ wallets to shine a light on consumer spending.

42421440,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMQv,1663694554,Lessons From a DeFi DAO Divorce,"It’s a bit of deja vu for victims of the $80 million Rari/Fei attack last April who today voted to disburse funds “making them whole.” The marriage between the two decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Rari Capital and Fei Protocol, will also be dissolved, marking the beginning of the end to what was once one of DeFi’s most celebrated unions.  Last year, TribeDAO, the parent organization of the algorithmic stablecoin issuer Fei, merged with decentralized lending protocol Rari Capital. It was a massive moment for DeFi, involving two rising star developer teams, billions of dollars in capital and a proof-of-concept for on-chain M&A through protocol politicking.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Rari gained a fast-growing stablecoin, FEI, while the Fei Protocol gained access to Rari’s borrowing and lending pools. And neither project had to dissolve their distinct dev teams. (It’s worth stating that FEI suffered stability issues at launch and, as one of the few fully crypto-backed (or algorithmic) stablecoins, was always on the more “experimental” end of the spectrum.)  See also: DAOs and the Coming InDAOstrial Revolution | Opinion  A16z’s Jeff Amico at the time called the merger “a new primitive to align incentives between Web3 communities going forward.” RARI token holders were given the opportunity to swap their holdings for TRIBE, earning staking in the powerhouse project – and allowing both protocols to operate under a shared vision and shared economic interest.  Divided tribes  All was going according to plan until Rari’s core product, an “open money market” called Fuse, was attacked. Fuse enabled anyone to create liquidity pools to trade any number of Ethereum-based tokens, often against the FEI stablecoin. On April 30, it was hit with an $80 million re-entrancy attack, all but draining the project’s liquidity.  A vote was called to reimburse victims of the attack using Tribe’s treasury. It passed with high participation and about 75% of voters in favor. But details of the payout scheme were scant in the initial vote, and once there was a better sense of who would be paying for whom, Fei’s leadership reneged on the vote.  Fei leadership called for another vote a few days later, after declaring the initial “snapshot” process non-binding because it wasn’t “on-chain.” Rari’s victims would still be reimbursed under a new plan, but only partially. This, of course, led to months of bickering, personnel changes and calls to dissolve the Fei-Rari union.  Sam Kazemian, the founder of Frax Finance (which lost about $12 million in the Fuse attack), called it “a new low for DeFi.” Fei, which had earlier raised $1.3 billion in ETH, had the reserves to make all of the attack’s victims square, but began to question whether it’d be the right move considering a worsening “macro-economic” environment and industry-wide market rout.  Today, the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are more or less back where they started, after a series of four governance votes over the past months. It’s a story of partisan politics, self-interested voting and the challenges of community governance in an age where decisions are supposed to follow pre-programmed code.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  The final vote passed with 99% in favor of the plan, with no ability to veto the decision. FEI holders will be given an escape hatch to cash out for another stablecoin, DAI, while TRIBE holders will receive pro-rata shares of the DAO's assets. Shared governance is being dissolved.  If there is a wider lesson to the Rari-Fei breakup, it’s one of disaster preparedness. Governance will always be a messy issue, especially in times of crisis. DAO mergers are not impossible going forward, but it’s becoming clearer that supposedly unified communities can fracture whenever there are multiple economically incentivized groups. There’s no shared understanding of what’s fair when money is on the line. So maybe there’s a market for DAO prenups.",NEGATIVE,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | DAI,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/20/lessons-from-a-defi-dao-divorce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80f81526ba1989a2a93186fd237246fad8b8fa76-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373783,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVBuL,1663688361,Bitcoin's Pre-Fed Weakness Has Chart Analysts Focused on Support at $18.3K,"Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive ahead of a pivotal Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday on interest rates and appears to be on track to test support at $18,300, which, if breached, could make the bear market worse, according to technical analysis by Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at $18,850 at press time, a 3.5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk data.  A week ago, bitcoin failed to break the confluence of a 10-month-long descending trendline and resistance outlined by a Japanese charting tool called the Ichimoku cloud, which was just above $22,000. That put the bears back into the driver's seat.  ""Bitcoin saw a negative reaction to last week's CPI data, yielding an unsuccessful test of initial resistance at the daily cloud model ($22,000),"" Stockton wrote in a note to clients Monday, referring to the consumer price index.  On the daily chart, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend strength, has dropped below zero, confirming a renewed bearish crossover.  ""Short-term momentum has shifted negative per a new daily MACD ’sell’ signal, increasing risk as long-term support ($18,300) is tested,"" Stockton said.  The so-called sell signal comes after bull failure at the descending trendline, Ichimoku cloud resistance and the 50- and 100-day moving averages.  The Ichimoku cloud, which was created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, comprises two lines – the leading span A and the leading span B. Both lines are plotted 26 days ahead of the last candle to indicate future support or resistance.  Crossovers above or below the cloud are widely taken to represent early signs of a bullish or bearish trend change, while failure to top the cloud resistance, as in BTC's case, is said to reinforce bearish trends.  The focus now is on the Fibonacci retracement level of $18,300, as seen in the weekly chart below.  ""Two consecutive weekly closes below $18,300 would mark a breakdown in a bearish development, increasing downside risk to secondary support near $13,900,"" Stockton noted, adding that negative long-term momentum is growing, according to the monthly chart MACD histogram. A weekly close means the price traded on Sunday at 23:59 coordinated universal time (UTC).  A break below $18,300 can bring more substantial selling pressure, as Delphi Digital's volume profile analysis shows that most trading transactions of the past three months have occurred above bitcoin's current market price.

42373782,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVBmn,1663687615,DeFi Platform Maple Finance Aims to Help Struggling Bitcoin Miners With $300M Lending Pool,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) firm Maple Finance is starting a lending pool with $300 million capacity for mid-size bitcoin (BTC) miners across North America and Australia as crypto winter continues to weigh on the mining industry.  Raising capital has become difficult for bitcoin miners this year as the price of bitcoin has slumped and energy prices have skyrocketed. As traditional sources of capital have dried up, new financiers, like Maple, are looking to fill the void. In July, Antalpha, a partner of Bitmain, the largest mining rig manufacturer, announced novel debt instruments for bitcoin miners. Meanwhile, debt restructurings and acquisitions have also started among miners who are trying to survive the bear market.  ""Recent market headwinds have caused lenders to pull back, while traditional financing vehicles have been slower to engage this sector,"" said Sidney Powell, CEO and co-founder of Maple, in a press release on Tuesday. ""Miners play an essential role in growing the crypto ecosystem and local economies, and we are proud to extend a new financing vehicle to direct capital where it is needed the most,"" he added.  Sophisticated investors find the case for investing in bitcoin miners right now ""quite compelling,"" as borrowers still need capital and are ""willing to agree to different terms than they would have agreed nine months ago, because they don't have many choices,"" Glyn Jones, CEO and Founder of Icebreaker Finance, told CoinDesk.  The loans will have a 12- to 18-month tenor and will have interest rates around 15%-20%, which is on the high end for the mining industry but not unheard of. The pool will be managed by Australian-based Icebreaker Finance and will aim to deliver low-teens ""risk-adjusted returns"" to accredited investors and capital allocators, according to the press release. The pool is aimed at lending to blue chip private and public firms across the U.S. with ""effective treasury management and prudent power strategies,"" the press release said.  Other than digital assets and equipment, which are often used as collateral, the pool will also accept other physical assets such power transformers to secure the loans, Jones said. This ""diverse security package"" means that not all collateral will be adversely affected if the price of bitcoin drops significantly, Jones said.  The loans will be transparent through the Maple Finance platform, and publicly traded companies that accept funds will also be disclosing loan terms as part of their obligations to investors. Privately held miners that decide to borrow from the Icebreaker pool will be agreeing to ""greater transparency than they may have had before,"" Jones said, adding that he hopes that this transparency can be ""transformational"" and bring more capital into the sector.  This is the first fully collateralized loan product for a specific industry sector as Maple's bread and butter are uncollateralized loans to market makers and other crypto firms, said a Maple spokesperson.  Maple holds 50% of the DeFi lending market, measured by total loans outstanding across institutional DeFi lending platforms. Since the launch of the first pool in May 2021 the liquidity pools on Maple platform have issued close to $1.8 billion in loans, according to the statement. Maple plans to open more lending pools for the growing mining sector and expects to expand its lending services to financial technology companies.

Under the deal, Nova Labs also will be able to offer mobile products and services that use both networks, according to a press release. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed.  “The announcement comes as Nova Labs plans to launch Helium Mobile, which will enable subscribers to earn crypto rewards for using the network,” said the press release.  Under the agreement, Nova Labs will be able to use T-Mobile’s nationwide network to provide coverage for Helium mobile customers in places where the Helium 5G network doesn't exist, said Boris Renski, general manager of wireless at Nova Labs, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Renski said that Helium will be paying T-Mobile for its Helium mobile subscribers in the areas where it does not have coverage. There's a map showing where there are currently 5G radios offering coverage.  “It's not perfect coverage and there's a lot of dead spots,” said Renski.  “But with the model that we are pursuing, it's important to understand we are not looking to replace large mobile operators with our network, we are building a network that could be a complement to the existing macro network of the operators,” he said.  A beta version of the service is expected to launch in the first quarter of 2023, according to Nova Labs.  The Helium Network is a decentralized grid of wireless hotspots that aims to provide an alternative to hard-wired internet or mobile data service. There are currently 900,000 hotspots worldwide.  “T-Mobile is excited to support Nova Labs’ innovation in this new crypto-powered space by enabling their mobility on the nation’s largest, fastest and most reliable nationwide 5G network,” Dan Thygesen, senior vice president of T-Mobile Wholesale, said in the press release.  Press officials for T-Mobile described the deal in an email as a ""standard wholesale/MVNO agreement"" that's available to paying wholesale customers.

Market Moves: Cosmos' ATOM token gains on the hope of more uses for the Cosmos blockchain – bucking the overall bearish mood that appears to have taken hold in crypto markets following last week's Merge on the Ethereum blockchain. Omkar Godbole reports.  Chart of the Day: Ether's supply growth has slowed dramatically since the Ethereum blockchain's Merge last week.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was lower at around $19,200, as traders in traditional markets prepared for a big interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve.  The U.S. central bank’s two-day, closed-door meeting is set to start Tuesday and culminate Wednesday with a statement at 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC). For much of this year, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has traded in sync with U.S. stocks, which have come under pressure from the Fed’s efforts to tighten monetary policy in the face of soaring consumer prices.  In traditional markets, European equity indexes fell and U.S. stock futures pointed to a drop when New York exchanges open.  ""Given the aggressive stance that the Fed has taken in terms of raising interest rates, I think that we are probably in the middle innings of a recession,” Adam Sze, head of digital assets at Global X ETFs, told CoinDesk TV on Monday.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was changing hands at about $1,350, still well off last month’s high above $2,000, despite all indications that last week’s historic Merge on the Ethereum blockchain went smoothly. Citigroup analysts estimate that the change will reduce ETH issuance by 90%.  In the news, the cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute was hacked for $160 million, and the failed crypto lender Voyager Digital asked a bankruptcy court in New York for an order to unwind a loan it made to trading firm Alameda Research.

Market Moves  Cosmos' ATOM Gains, Bucks Post-Merge Lull on Outlook for New Uses, Better Security  By Omkar Godbole  Investors starved for bullish catalysts seem to be parking their money in ATOM, the native coin of Cosmos Hub, the blockchain acting as an intermediary between all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network.  Observers say they are doing so in expectation that a conference next Monday will bring an announcement of additional uses for the token and better security for the network.  ATOM has risen 10% to about $15.30 since Thursday, bucking the broader market weakness caused by the ""sell-the-fact"" response to the successful implementation of Ethereum's software upgrade called the Merge, according to CoinDesk data. The token's ether- and bitcoin-denominated prices have increased by 32% and 14%, respectively.  ""The market is looking for assets with a catalyst right now and ATOM happens to have one, which is why it is outperforming,"" said Katie Talati, director of research at Arca, a digital-asset management firm. ""Cosmos is holding its annual conference next week, where it is expected to release a tokenomics white paper detailing more use cases for ATOM.  ""Some potential announcements could relate to the release of interchain security, a feature that allows projects to rely on the Cosmos base chain for their security, which might increase the usage and staking of ATOM,"" Talati said.  Read the full story here.  Chart of The Day  Ether's Supply Growth Has Slowed Drastically Since Merge  By Omkar Godbole  Ether's supply has increased by 3,688 ETH since the Merge, which took effect on Thursday, according to data source Ultra Sound Money.  The transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism of verifying transactions has reduced the issuance by 95%.  Had Ethereum continued to use a proof-of-work consensus mechanism of verifying transactions, the supply would have increased by more than 65,000 ETH.  The reduced supply might help ether absorb macroeconomic shocks better than bitcoin.  Latest Headlines  Cosmos' ATOM Gains, Bucks Post-Merge Lull on Outlook for New Uses, Better Security: Cosmos is likely to announce the interchain security feature next week, opening doors for the token to capture value from the entire network.  Citi Says Ether Remains Relatively Stable Despite Significance of the Merge: ETH token issuance is estimated to drop 90% to around 600,000 a year, the bank said.

What all creators have are their own superfans that create content. Yes, that&apos;s right - The flip side of being a creator is what makes a creator in the first place: Their fans. Today, fan content already outnumbers original content.

However, most generated content is trapped in dead ends. This content is &apos;forgotten&apos;, remains unmonetized, and is not used as a distribution driver. That is a massive missed opportunity. This is true for video, where even though video accounts for over 85% of internet traffic, video is still constrained to linear passive broadcasts and distribution models that lock out many creators and their fans.

The altcoin failed thrice to surpass the $0.37 resistance, which acts as a bullish limiter for potential recovery. The Algorand coin plunged back to the bottom support of $0.28.

The rise in XRP came as token issuer Ripple Labs said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that XRP wasn’t a security subject to the regulator’s authority. Ripple sought dismissal of the SEC lawsuit before trial in federal court in Manhattan, arguing that XRP could not be considered a security because there was no “investment contract” that granted investors the rights to or require the issuer to act in their interests.  In a 2020 suit, the SEC accused Ripple of misleading XRP investors by failing to register the token as a security and not providing adequate disclosure – a claim that Ripple continues to defend.  Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano’s ADA, and ether (ETH) rose over 4%, while meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) increased a nominal 2%. Ethereum classic (ETC) slid 15% as the hype around its revival tapered off, while overall crypto market capitalization added 3.4% after falling Monday to $930 billion for the first time since July.  On Tuesday, the pan-European stock index Stoxx 600 fell 0.59% – reaching levels previously seen in the first week of July. U.S. tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose 0.76% in pre-market trading, pointing to gains when the New York session opens. Asian markets rose, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng closing 1.16% higher amid hopes for reopening its international borders sooner than expected.  That recovery came on the back of a decline in equity markets Monday amid fears among traders expecting outsized higher rate hikes, with the U.S. Federal Reserve expected to again hike rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday, as per Bloomberg economists.  The hike comes as policymakers escalate their effort to contain inflation – which investors fear would trigger a recession as higher rate hikes eventually lead to higher commodity prices and muted spending power.  Meanwhile, some market observers said the possibility of the Fed hiking rates by an entire percentage point was still in the cards.  “With August inflation figures of 8.3%, the Fed will be even more determined to raise interest rates by up to 100 basis points,” opined Chris Esparza, CEO and founder of Vault Finance, in an email.  “Bitcoin has the highest correlation with the broader stock market, which has been under seller pressure since the inflation data was released,” Esparza added.

42373785,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVDh3,1663672745,"Terra Co-Founder Do Kwon’s Legal Troubles Unlikely to Affect Broader Crypto Markets, Analysts Say","A name on the Interpol's wanted list and a South Korean police alert for Terra co-founder Do Kwon’s whereabouts are unlikely to cause havoc to the broader crypto markets, two markets observers told CoinDesk on Tuesday.  Kwon's arrest warrant puts pressure on an already intensive regulatory debate about market conduct, consumer protection and financial stability risks associated with crypto markets. Kwon’s current location is unknown and the Singapore Police Force confirmed to the press that Kwon was no longer in the city-state, where he resided until at least May.  In the weeks following Terra’s implosion in May, prices of its LUNA and UST tokens dropped over 99.7%. At the same time, decentralized finance applications built on the network lost some $28 billion in market value – making the entire ordeal one of the single-largest capital destructive event in the history of cryptocurrencies.  Some are, however, playing down the impact of Kwon’s legal troubles on broader crypto markets.  “In my opinion, Terra doesn’t present systemic risks to the broader crypto markets, especially with regard to investments in the sector,” Victor Young, software architect at blockchain network Analog, told CoinDesk, pointing to the overall perception of cryptocurrencies remaining positive among investors.  However, Young added that regulators and policymakers were increasingly seeing the scale of the losses in the industry as “a major warning sign” of possible future worst-case scenarios.  Young added that the quick formation of Terra 2.0 – a separate blockchain built to regain investors’ trust – showed how fast developments in the crypto markets take place. “It (Terra 2.0) already attracted a syndicate of investors and users who are likely to suffer because of such a move, which demonstrated that regulators and policymakers are failing to keep pace with the speed of innovation,” he said.  Ajay Dhingra, head of research and analytics at crypto exchange Unizen, likened Terra’s fall to a major bank affected during the 2008 recession.  ""The Terra collapse is somewhat similar to the Lehman Brothers meltdown in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008,” Dhingra told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “The arrest warrant will cause an extreme spike in the LUNA's volatility, as investigators piece together the most significant event of 2022.""  LUNA (the revamped token associated with the new Terra blockchain) and luna classic (the original blockchain's renamed token), have been two of the most-volatile tokens in the past few months. LUNC fell from an April high of $119 to $0.00000099 in mid-May, and has since risen a staggering 29,000%. Its value has doubled in the past month – even as the broader market did not show similar growth.  LUNA, on the other hand, gained 200% in a speculative rally over a few days last week following the release of a fundamental catalyst.

42373794,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVDsN,1663671015,"Cosmos' ATOM Gains, Bucks Post-Merge Lull  on Outlook for New Uses, Better Security","Investors starved for bullish catalysts seem to be parking their money in ATOM, the native coin of Cosmos Hub, the blockchain acting as an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network.  Observers say they are doing so in expectation that a Sept. 26 conference will see the announcement of additional uses for the token and better security for the network.  ATOM has risen 10% to $15.30 since Thursday, bucking the broader market weakness caused by the ""sell-the-fact"" response to the successful implementation of Ethereum's technological upgrade, the Merge, according to CoinDesk data. The token's ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC)-denominated prices have increased by 32% and 14%, respectively.  ""The market is looking for assets with a catalyst right now and ATOM happens to have one, which is why it is outperforming,"" said Katie Talati, director of research at Arca. ""Cosmos is holding its annual conference next week, where it is expected to release a tokenomics white paper detailing more use cases for ATOM.""  ""Some potential announcements could relate to the release of interchain security, a feature that allows projects to rely on the Cosmos base chain for their security, which might increase the usage and staking of ATOM,"" Talati said.  Cosmos is expected to announce the most anticipated feature, interchain security, at the annual Cosmoverse conference in Medellin, Colombia.  ATOM-powered, network-wide security  The interchain security feature will make Comos Hub responsible for network-wide security and enable ATOM to be used to secure all blockchains in the network.  Under that plan, the proof-of-stake Cosmos Hub blockchain would lease its ATOM-token backed validators to budding chains. That would allow every blockchain, or zone, in the Cosmos network to share security using ATOM instead of their respective native tokens. Currently, chains are forced to either pay high inflationary token rewards to validators or face the risk of hacker attacks on their chains.  The move would allow ATOM to derive value from the entire ecosystem and add a new use for the token. As of now, it can be used for staking, holding and spending. ATOM stakers get the right to vote on network upgrades and receive rewards proportional to the number of coins staked.  According to Emperor Osmo, a writer from Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, interchain security could lead to reduced supply of ATOM because stakers will receive multiple staking rewards from every chain using the share security feature. That, in turn, could boost staking, sucking out coins from the market.  ""As more chains enable interchain security [by using ATOM], more rewards are given to stakers,"" Osmo tweeted. ""The more ATOM is staked, the less ATOM there is in the market.""  Sticks in a bundle can't be broken  An old saying says, ""Sticks in a bundle can't be broken, but sticks taken singly can be easily broken.""  The interchain security feature will essentially bundle all Cosmos blockchains from a security point of view, making it harder for malicious entities to launch an attack.  ""The Cosmos Hub has 175 validators who collectively have 193 million ATOM tokens staked, worth just north of $2 billion,"" VanEck's research team, headed by Matthew Sigel, wrote in a market insights post last month. ""An attacker who wants to attack the Cosmos Hub economically will need to spend much more than this figure to hack the Cosmos Hub and its hosted blockchains.""  VanEck is bullish on ATOM. ""Based on our discounted cash flow analysis of potential Cosmos ecosystem value in 2030, we arrived at a $140 price target for the ATOM token with downside to $1,"" VanECK's research team noted.  Cosmoverse to address inflation concerns  Still, ATOM is an inflationary cryptocurrency with an appreciating supply, which may hinder potential price appreciation.  According to data source Messari, ATOM's current annual inflation is 5.74%. According to VanEck, inflation under the current economic model is targeted roughly at 13%, which may be ""too high to sustain strong token price appreciation over the long term.""  The conference is likely to address the issue.  ""It is widely expected that the team will soon announce new tokenomics for ATOM that will reduce inflation,"" Kaiko's weekly newsletter published Monday said.  The newsletter added that Cosmos and ATOM have benefited from several protocols leaving Terra after its implosion and relaunching on Cosmos.",POSITIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/20/cosmos-atom-gains-bucks-post-merge-lull-on-outlook-for-new-uses-better-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0ca228a3628239052f379b819d47e76928f3a5c-2708x1454.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here is the new fee schedule: In contrast to Coinbase&apos;s current exchange fee structure, depicted below, the revised fees provide a financial incentive for higher-volume dealers while keeping the tiers below $100,000 to $1 million unchanged. The institutional clients that Coinbase anticipated would also utilize the platform for additional services, including custody and staking, have historically paid far greater costs than smaller-volume retail users. These higher-volume clients continue to pay significantly lower fees than retail investors, even with the revised schedule. According to Coinbase, it will keep focusing on volume tier estimates on trailing 30-day volume.

42373801,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVE2R,1663662982,Citi Says Ether Remains Relatively Stable Despite Significance of the Merge,"The Ethereum Merge has been completed and despite “high anticipation” around the transition, volatility remained subdued, Citi (C) said in a research report Friday.  The Merge was the first of five upgrades planned for the blockchain, and involved the switch to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum is now 99.95% more energy efficient than when it used a proof-of-work (PoW) process, the report said.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Following the transition, miners are no longer being issued rewards, the bank said, noting that these rewards equated to a supply of 4.9 million ether (ETH) a year. ETH issuance is estimated to drop 90% to around 600,000, and total supply on the first day of the Merge fell as the fees burnt were larger than rewards issued to validators, it added.  Citi says ether has become a yield-bearing asset following the removal of mining, with current staking yield about 4.5%. This yield is higher than some traditional financial instruments, it said.  In absolute terms, ETH did not rally into the Merge as it had before other upgrades, the report said, noting that for almost all other major upgrades ether gained going into the event and rallied further afterward.  The Merge “sets the stage for large scalability improvements,” but gas fees are driven by network activity, the note said. Meaningful scaling will likely come as a result of the Surge, the next planned upgrade, which could be introduced next year.  Network activity has increased slightly as ETH now produces a yield for validators. However, fees have remained relatively low as activity is still modest versus historical levels, the note added.

The firm's lending and over-the-counter (OTC) services have not been affected. Decentralized finance refers to financial activities carried out on the blockchain without the use of third parties.  Gaevoy said the company remains solvent, with ""twice over"" $160 million remaining in equity.  Wintermute is the latest in a long list of crypto companies to be stung by hacks over the past few months. Crypto bridge Nomad had nearly $200 million drained in August shortly before DeFi protocol Curve Finance had $570,000 stolen. Blockchain security firm Certik estimated that more than $1.3 billion had been lost to DeFi hacks last year.  Founded in 2017, Wintermute trades billions of dollars across crypto market daily as it provides liquidity across multiple venues. Last week it was named as the official DeFi market maker for the Tron network.  Gaevoy added that the company is still treating the hack as a ""white hat"" event and asked the hacker to get in touch. The hacker's wallet has been tracked down by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT; it currently holds around $9 million in ether (ETH) and $38 million in other ERC-20 tokens.  The firm suffered a mishap earlier this year when it sent $15 million of optimism (OP) tokens to a wrong address. The tokens were eventually returned by the recipient.  Wintermute did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

It can be recalled that the SEC and Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, agreed to expedite the lawsuit that aimed to determine whether or not the cryptocurrency could be considered a security. Both parties now want a federal judge to make a ruling on whether or not Ripple Labs violated federal securities laws or otherwise dismiss the lawsuit, ending the legal battle. With this, New York Southern District Judge Analisa Torres has been asked to make a summary judgment based on the arguments and accompanying documents submitted by SEC and Ripple Labs which were posted on a federal court database on Friday. Entrepreneur and crypto enthusiast Jeff Sekinger shared some insights about the matter on Twitter, saying that the case was going in favor of Ripple Labs.

The SEC lawsuit was filed on September 19 against crypto scientist and YouTuber Ian Balina, which claimed, among other issues, that Balina offered Sparkster (SPRK) tokens without registering them when he established an investment group on Telegram in 2018. The Ethereum contributions were verified when U.S.-based investors joined Balina&apos;s investment pool through a system of Ethereum blockchain nodes, according to the SEC, which is packed more densely in the United States than in any other nation.

In exchange for repaying the loan, Alameda would receive $160 million back in its pledged collateral. The loan, which was made in September of last year, is denominated largely in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC).  Alameda was founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire crypto entrepreneur who also founded FTX, a crypto exchange. FTX has its own link to Voyager. Last week, CoinDesk reported that it's in the lead to purchase Voyager's assets through an auction taking place in its bankruptcy case.  In July, Alameda tweeted that it's ""happy to return the Voyager loan and get our collateral back whenever works for Voyager.""  Alameda Ventures, a firm that is separate from Alameda Research but that is also controlled by Bankman-Fried, has also loaned $200 million in cash and USDC as well as 15,000 BTC to Voyager in order to “mitigate current market conditions.” Alameda Ventures is a Voyager shareholder.  Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has previously tweeted that the complex relationship between all of the firms is ""hard to follow."" Binance has also tried to buy Voyager, CoinDesk has reported.  The court filing also requests that both parties' cryptocurrency wallet addresses remain confidential.  Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July after it faced a swarm of requests by customers to withdraw their funds as cryptocurrency prices spiraled down in the aftermath of the collapse of Terra network's UST stablecoin and related LUNA token.

Cryptos Dip Early and Then Rise  By James Rubin  Cryptos seesawed in Monday trading, ultimately regaining ground after dipping sharply earlier in the day.  Bitcoin was recently trading above $19,500, slightly above where it stood 24 hours earlier, although more than 6% higher than its low toward the close of Asian equity markets. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had sunk to a three-month low under $18,400 as investors during Asia and Europe trading hours sent most risk assets lower amid heightened recessionary fears.  ""Not only just cryptocurrencies but also all risk assets in general are being sold off in anticipation for the pending ... worldwide recession,"" Adam See, senior vice president and head of digital assets at Global X ETFs, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  Ether was recently changing hands just under $1,400, a more than 3% gain from the previous day and up more than 8% from its perch under $1,300 early Monday. The second-largest crypto in market value had dropped to its lowest level since July.  Most other major cryptos were in the green after climbing over the course of the day with XRP and SOL each recently up more than 4% and ALGO rising over 7%. Among the biggest losers, TRX and UNI were both off approximately a percentage point.  Stocks  Crypto prices tracked equity indexes, continuing a trend they have largely followed this year, with the tech heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each climbing the better part of a percentage point. The gains followed the Nasdaq and S&P's worst weeks since June and came as the yields on 10-year and more interest-rate responsive two-year yields reached heights not seen for well over a decade. Crypto prices typically move in the opposite direction of yields.  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index declined three points to 46, a ninth consecutive monthly drop that offered the latest evidence of the once hot housing market's cooling. The index measures building activity. Investors will be scrutinizing the release of housing starts on Tuesday and the U.S. central bank's decision on its next interest rate hike later in the week. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue its monetary hawkishness by boosting the rate by 75 basis points for a third straight time.  ""I think 75 is probably the right number in terms of the Fed interest rate hike, Global X ETF's See said, although he added that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments about how he views the market place's ""would be really telling.""  See said the Fed's aggressiveness suggested that ""we are probably in the middle innings of a recession, hopefully toward the later end."" But he also noted optimistically that the ""crypto winter feels different,"" highlighting ""strong venture capital funding flowing into crypto and Web3 companies"" and TradFi companies' soaring interest in the digital asset space.""  ""There's a lot of compelling development within this crypto winter,"" he said.  Meanwhile, as CoinDesk reported, despite Merge hype, investors remained cautious on the blockchain’s native token ETH. Investment products tied to ETH saw a fourth straight week of outflows in the period ended Sept. 16, with the amount removed exceeding new money added by $15.4 million, according to CoinShares.  In a Monday newsletter, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for asset manager Arca, called ether's recent, steep price decline ""surprising, but not entirely unexpected.""  ""Ultimately, it appears the Merge itself did not immediately attract new buy interest, or new buyers are about to get a nice discount courtesy of momentum traders with itchy trigger fingers,"" Dorman wrote but added: ""Long ETH for the next six to 12 months as ETH benefits from being the most pure play blockchain investment and because it's just simple math.""

Now one might think, if a country is excluded from Interpol, it might be a nice place to hide out if you have an Interpol ""red notice"" attached to your name, as Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs may have after South Korean prosecutors asked the international police organization to apply the tag to Kwon.  South Korea has extradition treaties with 31 countries worldwide, but there are 195 members of Interpol. Even if Kwon is in a country that doesn’t have a formal extradition treaty with South Korea, “extradition is possible based on a guarantee of reciprocity from the requesting state that it will accept extradition requests from Korea for identical or similar offenses,” according to a briefing note prepared on the topic by Korean lawyers published by consultancy GIR Insight.  The latest episode in the Terra saga highlights not only the options Korean authorities may have to take Kwon into custody but also the challenges of extradition. Since launching its International Fugitive Round-Up and Arrest (INFRA) program in 2009, Interpol operations have led to the location or arrest of about 1,000 fugitives, according to the law enforcement agency’s website, but international relationships with law enforcement issues can be complicated.  In a tweet, Kwon insisted that he was not ""on the run.""  Taiwan is cooperative  Despite Taiwan’s exclusion from Interpol, authorities there have shown great interest in international cooperation on judicial matters and mutual legal assistance by signing agreements with many countries worldwide. South Korea isn’t on the list, but it has an agreement on the “exchange of judicial materials” with Taiwan.  Locally, the government has updated its extradition laws to align with international practices. The law says that Taiwan can refuse extradition requests on limited grounds including: “risks to Taiwan's sovereignty, national security, public order, or international reputation.”  A previous case  Perhaps the most famous case of Taiwanese authorities working with international counterparts involves another tech scofflaw: Cody Wilson, the first person to create a 3D-printed gun.  Wilson’s claim to fame involved selling the files – not the gun itself – to print these weapons, and has had moderate success defending himself under the principle of code-is-speech before eventually reaching a settlement in 2018 that allowed the continued sale of these files.  But shortly after the settlement, Wilson was a wanted man on charges of soliciting a prostitute who was underage. Wilson’s passport was quickly canceled, and authorities in Taiwan arrested him on grounds of unlawful immigration status and delivered him to U.S. Marshals waiting at the Taipei airport. Back in the U.S., Wilson later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.  Since then there have been many other lower-profile cases of extradition, but they have not been tied up in court or disregarded because of a lack of a treaty.  Aside from Taiwan, another place Kwon might be lying low is Palau, which is also not a member of Interpol.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is said to be a frequent visitor to the island country, as Binance helped set up its Digital ID initiative. Zhao is no fan of Kwon or Terra, but it would certainly be amusing if they were neighbors.
