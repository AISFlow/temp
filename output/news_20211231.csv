The crypto and porn industry together represents a very profitable merge that has just started to happen. The world of payment methods has a history of hypocrisy, control, and morals, and it tends to not support anything related to sex work. Reportedly, earlier in the year OnlyFans had decided to shut down all sexually explicit content because of pressure from banks and payment processors. There was a huge backlash and the ban stopped days after its announcement, alleging that the platform had &apos;secured assurances necessary&apos; from the banks. The platform&apos;s founder and chief executive told Time that banks were refusing to process adult content-related payments. &apos;OnlyFans stands for inclusion&apos;, they said, but they had been trying to distance themselves from the porn industry, interested in launching a streaming service -which doesn&apos;t allow adult content. Payment methods have been a burden for porn creators worldwide for years. Their gains are often subject to frozen funds, huge losses, and since there&apos;s not much protection and support offered for sex workers, they need to be extra careful to not become subject to scams and other dangers. So anonymity and safe digital wallets go really well with this industry.
