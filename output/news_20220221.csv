With concerns over Russia and Ukraine and rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the U.S, cryptocurrencies are tumbling. Many investors fear a crypto winter, but whether it is here or not, diversification is still vital. James Wang, Head of Tokens at Amun, explained to NewsBTC how index tokens allow to gain instant exposure to the best-performing and most liquidity assets, diversify portfolios, and help spread the risk.

While crypto index funds are not popular yet compared to traditional index trading, James Wang explained that index tokens are a very useful tool because users gain instant access to a diversified portfolio of assets without having to manage multiple purchases manually. This massively simplifies the buying process and cuts out all of the transaction fees that come with buying multiple coins individually and provides an easier on-ramp for newcomers to cryptocurrency investing, he noted.

42421196,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIfd,1645484667,Sipher’s Alain Dinh on What’s Next for NFT Gaming in Asia,"Barely a year ago, the term play-to-earn was basically unheard of. By the end of 2021, this new category in gaming had turned heads worldwide, with over $4 billion in investment poured into the space and more than 1.4 million unique active wallets interacting with game dapps daily, representing nearly half of the entire industry’s total usage, according to DappRadar.  Crypto State by CoinDesk, our virtual community event tour, stops in Southeast Asia on Feb. 24. The discussion will explore the metaverse and its implications. The tour is in partnership with Luno, like CoinDesk owned by Digital Currency Group. Register for ""Metaverse: Gimmick or Distributed Innovation?"" here.  The success of play-to-earn can be almost exclusively attributed to widespread adoption throughout Southeast Asia, where countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are known for their large mobile-first youth populations and insatiable appetite for video games. With these digitally-savvy young gamers eagerly looking to transcend the economic limitations of the country where they were born, it’s no surprise that play-to-earn was adopted so rapidly, with the metaverse quickly becoming a career destination of choice.  What happened in Southeast Asia could be a harbinger for what to expect in other emerging markets around the world, says Alain Dinh, head of partnerships at Sipher, adding that the job opportunities inside these games and virtual worlds will expand and diversify too.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Sipher is a casual-fighting and exploration game set in a stunning sci-fi virtual world, Sipheria, where players can meet up and socialize via their NFT characters, compete in games, and collect tradable cryptocurrency-based rewards for their achievements. They can also fulfill professional roles within the game. For example, players can become an architect, modeling buildings within the Sipher Metaverse, or they can design and build furniture or weapons and equipment, to be used, traded or sold.  Here, Dinh talks about Sipher’s plans to drive further adoption across Southeast Asia and other regions, to create online communities that thrive beyond traditional geographic borders.  What opportunities can NFT games and/or the metaverse offer to people in Southeast Asia, that they may not have otherwise had access to?  NFT games can be the bridge between the East and the West. In the east, statistically we see the younger generations having more free time to play NFT games and earn rewards, which can be seen as a job. While in the West, there are more jobs available, so people have better financial conditions and can fairly easily acquire NFTs needed to play, but they have less time to spend playing with them. If people in the West can lend those NFTs to people in the East, and share the rewards, this is an experience that benefits all.  Read more: Leah Callon-Butler - Into the Metaverse With CyBall’s Tin Tran  As a team based in Southeast Asia, what challenges have you faced in terms of attracting talent, securing funding and so on?  As for funding, the initial challenges were to get away from the prejudice that a lot of scams and ponzi schemes in the crypto space are coming out of this region. But unlike a lot of projects, we don’t hide who we are, and we keep good communication and relationships with our investors, so we have been able to build trust and credibility.  As for talent, Vietnam is one of the top countries in the world in terms of both crypto adoption and online gaming. With a very young population, the current generation is very eager to explore the space and even choose a career path in blockchain gaming. The formula of experienced and talented hires having all the tech know-how combined with leaders having the creativity and international background is what gives Vietnam a competitive advantage. But with the recent boom, the people we need are highly desired on the job market and therefore benchmark salaries have jumped up by a substantial amount compared to 2020.  We have a team of over 60 artists in-house in Vietnam, creating our very own 3D in-game assets for our game modes and our metaverse as well. Most other projects have a much smaller team, so they have to outsource and buy 3D assets from databases, meaning they don’t have the same control over the quality and most likely will encounter delays. We are lucky to not only have a very talented but also a loyal team that shares our long-term vision for Sipher.  Read more: CoinGecko's Bobby Ong on the Metaverse  What does your growth and expansion strategy look like? What adoption challenges do you anticipate?  While we aim to create a game in many different languages to welcome players all over the world, we still believe that our majority of players will be from Southeast Asia. Here, we understand that the mobile gaming market is big, and the number of smartphone users is huge, therefore a strong focus will be on our optimized mobile version for iOS/Android after the release of the PC version.  We do also have a launch strategy to help us grow in other high-potential markets like South America, Africa and India. Despite the more problematic communication in these regions, the main difference would be solving the on-ramp and off-ramp. While we know how players can turn their local currency to crypto and then back to fiat in Southeast Asia, we don’t know how that process works elsewhere. So partnering up with local institutions that know their market is key.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/21/siphers-alain-dinh-on-whats-next-for-nft-gaming-in-asia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5774a0e44d697a5694c7af43a2c4bd801d37ca83-1400x787.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

How The Bitcoin NUPL Metric May Predict The Start Of Bull Run As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the various phases of the NUPL indicator may shed some light relating to the bull run status for BTC. The net unrealized profit and loss (or NUPL in short) is a metric that&apos;s defined as the difference between the market cap and the realized cap, divided by the market cap. NUPL = (Market Cap - Realized Cap) ÷ Market Cap In simpler terms, what this indicator tells us about is the degree of profit or loss Bitcoin investors as a whole currently observe. When NUPL values are above zero, it means holders are, on average, in profit. On the other hand, the market as a whole is in a state of profit if the indicator&apos;s value is more than zero.

Users Can Use a Cross-Chain Bridge To: Quickly and easily implement digital asset transactions. Take advantage of low operational difficulty. Take advantage of lower transfer fees on non-scalable blockchains. Here&apos;s an example of how a bridge is used to transfer cross-chain assets: When a user wants to convert an ERC20 A token on Ethereum to a BEP20 A token on the BSC chain via AnySwap, the ERC20 A is locked on the source chain, and the bridge is notified to generate the BEP20 A on the BSC chain before transferring it to the user. Issues addressed by Cross-Chain Bridges Cross-chain bridges foster growth across chains (as evidenced by Fantom and Avalanche prices, which rose more than 12 percent and 18 percent in the first week of November) by providing multiple asset interoperability and increased security. Investors have to go through a lot of trouble if there isn&apos;t a bridge. Cross-chain bridges also address the following issues: Reduced gas expenses and faster transaction speeds.

You’re making money like a degen.  Then one day you realize that crypto, while considered “alternative finance,” isn’t immune to tax. The Internal Revenue Service and other authorities want their share of your sicc gainz. Suddenly you know that all those transactions you’ve been making are taxable. You owe money on your gains and now, holy moly, the price of BTC is falling, and with it the rest of the market. You realize you need to sell half your stash just to cover your bill.  See more from Tax Week.  This scenario, in fact, has befallen many newbies to crypto, as Jeff Wilser details in this week’s “Crypto Tax Nightmares” story. Many people have flown into crypto with alacrity only to get a nasty fright when they realize they haven’t held back what they owe.  CoinDesk’s Tax Week, dropping Feb. 21-25, is all about the crypto community’s struggles and confusions with taxes. We feel your pain! And we do our best to help, calling upon the experts in the crypto tax business to explain everything as clearly as possible.  But in some cases not even the experts are sure what the proper guidance is; the authorities have yet to say definitively, leaving consequential issues open to interpretation.  Non-fungible tokens (NFT), which opened up crypto to many last year, are one still-ambiguous area. Staking, airdrops and various aspects of decentralized finance (DeFi) are others.  Check out our continuing coverage this tax season, including advice posts and explainers, features (see our report on crypto tax “exiles”), research, TV, podcasts and more. We’ll publish it all here.  We hope to reduce the confusion and help you save money by only paying what you really owe.

Analysts aren’t convinced the rebound will last. The Kremlin has ruled out the prospect of a dialogue soon between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart, President Joe Biden, an idea proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday. Ukraine, meantime, has reported shelling from Russia-backed separatists.  “It seems like a full ‘de-risk’ across the board, presumably a flight to cash as it's hard to find an asset that is actually performing against the current uncertainty,” said Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics. “Markets could be very messy if military action actually does transpire.”  Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has lost 6.8% over the last seven days, struggling to stay above $2,700.  In contrast, metaverse and gaming-related tokens are mostly higher on the day. Axie infinity (AXS), the leader in crypto’s still-nascent “play-to-earn” sector, is trading up 5% in the last 24 hours.  The advance comes as the game surpassed $4 billion in lifetime sales of non-fungible tokens (NFT), according to data from DappRadar.

42417118,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6fWf,1645454611,Avoid Crypto Tax Headaches: What You Need to Know if You Bought or Sold Crypto in 2021,"Despite recent federal hearings on crypto regulations, the U.S. government has yet to decide on a blanket ruling on every kind of digital asset – let alone future ones to come. But now that there are over 17,000 different cryptocurrencies, financial experts advise taking a conservative approach when it comes to claiming crypto on your taxes.  Things could always change, even though there’s now more than 10 years of precedent that regulators, tax professionals and consumers have to guide themselves in their tax reporting decisions. The legal classification of crypto assets is still under constant discussion among federal regulators, but the IRS is, in the meantime, well aware of the profits people made in 2021 during a historic bull market in the digital asset space.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  Here are a few tips to help you avoid nightmares this tax season and accurately record your crypto gains and/or losses.  Assume all crypto is intangible property  Bitcoin was the first and only cryptocurrency mentioned specifically by the IRS in its original 2014 notice deeming crypto as intangible “property” for U.S. tax purposes.  “The conservative approach from a tax perspective is to assume that all other crypto tokens and altcoins will follow the same classification,” said Kate Waltman, a New York-based certified public accountant (CPA) who specializes in cryptocurrency. “But in actuality, bitcoin and ethereum are the only two that have been specifically classified individually.”  At first, it looked like the most popular altcoin, ethereum, would be called a security by regulators, said Lisa Bragança, a former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) branch chief and Illinois-based lawyer. However, now ethereum is classified as an asset like bitcoin, not a security, though government agencies are still working out the details. Stay up to date on crypto news, always do your diligence and maintain excellent record keeping of your crypto transactions to make sure you’re prepared.  Expect to pay capital gains  Investors have to pay capital gains on any profits resulting from the sales or trades of stocks or assets. Each and every time an investor trades bitcoin for ethereum, or exchanges crypto back to U.S. dollars, those transactions – no matter the size – technically involve the exchanging of assets.  “Unfortunately, with capital gains, you have to report all of them even if you have a $1 capital gain,” said Waltman. “If anyone has invested in the stock market in the past, they’ll know you get a statement from your brokerage account. Even if you have $5 of capital gains they'll be included in your statement.”  It works similarly for crypto, though it’s highly unlikely you’ll receive a statement unless you traded through a regulated platform that provides tax documentation.  Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  If you do your taxes via Turbo Tax or another major online software, there will be a box to check to indicate you sold crypto in 2021. Checking this box should guide you to the appropriate forms to complete. If you work with an accountant or file your taxes by yourself, you’ll have to fill out a Schedule D Form 1040.  Use a portfolio tracker  A growing number of third-party portfolio-tracking apps are being developed to help crypto investors keep track of their digital wallets and report their crypto assets accurately to the IRS.  Instead of writing down every transaction you make on Coinbase, Binance or another crypto exchange, you can simply link your digital wallets to an app that periodically pulls your data to compute total gains or losses for the year.  Popular options include Cointracker, ZenLedger and Koinly, according to Waltman. Every app works differently and comes with varying fees, but most tools include features to monitor price changes, display the total value of your portfolio and flag prices at the time of every transaction. Look for apps with integrations for each of the blockchains on which you transact and the capability to sync with your preferred wallets and exchanges.  The process of signing up and linking your wallets should only take about 15 minutes for a beginner crypto trader, according to David Kemmerer, co-founder and CEO of the crypto tracking app CoinLedger, which is rebranding from CryptoTrader.Tax.  “If you're more complex, such as in all these decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and you have thousands of transactions, it's going to take longer because you have to reconcile a little bit more,” Kemmerer said.  The CoinLedger app also includes a dashboard for CPAs to access their clients’ information securely, according to Kemmerer. However, because crypto wallets can only be accessed by secret security keys, it’s more common for consumers to sync their own information, let the app fill out the appropriate IRS forms, and send the forms digitally to their accountants.  CoinLedger also has a partnership with TurboTax, said Kemmerer. This could be a perk for those who do their taxes online, either by themselves or with a virtual TurboTax professional.  Show a ‘good faith effort’  Just because crypto is an emerging asset class with new and constantly updated regulatory guidelines, it doesn’t mean taxpayers will be off the hook when reporting their earnings to the IRS.  If you are not sure how exactly to report the profits from non-fungible tokens (NFTs), altcoins, or any number of DeFi transactions, use the best data you have available to show proof of the value of your assets and total profits, advises Waltman.  Read More: The 7 Types of Crypto Tax Nightmares  “As a taxpayer, your responsibility is to make a good faith effort,” she said. “As long as you can tell the IRS that you made a good-faith effort, and you and your accountant agree the valuation you’ve determined is as accurate as possible given the data that was available the day you received it, then you did your job.”  And if when completing your 2021 taxes you learn new information that reveals an error in how you reported crypto in previous years’ taxes, there might be time to fix them.  “You have a three-year window to amend prior year returns without any negative consequences,” Waltman said. “If you didn't report two years ago – maybe just because you genuinely didn't know how or you didn't have the help – you do have three years to amend.”  Further Reading from CoinDesk's Tax Week  The Automatic Tax Man Cometh  Crypto won’t save you from taxes, but it may eventually make them easier to pay, says futurist Dan Jeffries.  How to Avoid Getting Rekt by Crypto Taxes  Tax guidance lags innovation. So does tax software. Meanwhile, misconceptions abound. If not careful, investors can end up owing more tax than expected and having to unload crypto to pay the bill  Taxes Are a Wild Card for Public Companies Holding Crypto  Investors in MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block and Coinbase need to consider how wild price swings will affect results, not only directly but indirectly due to complex tax accounting rules.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/avoid-crypto-tax-headaches-what-you-need-to-know-if-you-bought-or-sold-crypto-in-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/839866c16dac0c7f4db7fcc08eec430ed4cc059e-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The in-game currency of the P2E pet training universe, AXS, has appreciated by 2,544% against the US dollar during the last 12 months.

42395978,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0NRB,1645452000,African Web 3 Super App Jambo Raises $7.5M in Seed Round,"Jambo, a three-month-old company building a Web 3 super app for Africa, has raised $7.5 million in seed funding from an array of prominent backers in the crypto industry, including Delphi Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and Three Arrows Capital.  A super app is a one-stop mobile application for multiple services such as ride-hailing, banking, communication and food delivery. Examples include China’s WeChat, India’s Paytm, and southeast Asia’s Grab, which was valued at $40 billion ahead of its U.S. share-listing last year.  Jambo wants to introduce young Africans to Web 3 financial ecosystems through play-to-earn gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) services including currency exchanges and remittances.  “Honestly, anything that helps in Africa – send money, save money, make money – is what we're testing off of the super app,” co-founder and CEO James Zhang said in an interview, adding that the core of Jambo is a digital wallet.  Africa has been a fast adopter of crypto: The continent’s crypto market grew by over $100 billion between July 2020 and June 2021, according to the World Economic Forum, which translates into value growth of about 1,200%.  Zhang grew up in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and said his family had been in Africa for three generations. After graduating from New York University in 2017 with a degree in computer science, he ran a crypto fund for four years before starting work on Jambo.  According to a press statement shared with CoinDesk, other backers include Alameda Research and AllianceDAO. Jambo has also garnered the support of angel investors including Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder and CEO of Polygon, and Web 3 investor Santiago R. Santos.  “What WeChat did in China, Jambo will do in Africa,” Santos said in the statement.  Zhang told CoinDesk that Jambo’s first goal is to educate young people in Africa about Web 3 and introduce them to the financial opportunities it offers. One target user-base for Jambo is university students: In 2019, around 50% of university graduates in Africa were unemployed, according to the African Center for Economic Transformation.  Since January, Jambo has signed up over 12,000 students across 15 African nations including Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria and Ethiopia to complete a Web 3 curriculum, designed to allow students to explore opportunities in play-to-earn and DeFi, the statement said.  “We're literally going campus by campus. We're, I think, signing on one to two per week, started about a month ago. We’re at around more than six college campuses already. Hoping to enter 10 or 15 by the end of [March],” Zhang said.  The startup is setting up local teams and offices in 15 countries to test and provide services that cater to the diversity of communities and nations across the continent, according to Zhang.  “We have the long-term vision of realizing financial prosperity for billions across the continent and are committed to fostering the next generation of Web 3 innovators, builders, and creators,” he said.

According to a press release published on Monday, the bill was presented Feb. 18. and is based on the previously approved roadmap drafted by several government bodies, including key law-enforcement agencies.  The announcement highlights the policy split with the Bank of Russia, which opposes regulation and would rather see cryptocurrency trading and mining banned. The central bank, which has been pushing forward the pilot of its central bank digital currency, the digital ruble, has suggested punishing crypto trading and issuance with fines up to 500,000 rubles (US$6,360) for individuals and 1 million rubles for companies, the Tass news agency reported.  In the press release, the Ministry of Finance said the objections of the Bank of Russia ""will be considered in the further work on this bill where they don't contradict the Ministry of Finance approach.""  The official text of the bill is not yet available in the online database for legislative documents.  The bill treats crypto as an investment tool, not a legal tender, and says cryptocurrencies may not be used to pay for goods and services. It also specifies requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter desks, which must satisfy certain criteria to obtain a license and be included in a dedicated government register. Foreign crypto exchanges must register legal entities in Russia to provide services in the country.  All cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions must be conducted through bank accounts, and users must go through know-your-customer (KYC) checks with both banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, the press release said.  Exchanges also will have to inform users about the risks of investing in crypto. Investors will have to pass online tests to ensure they have sufficient knowledge about cryptocurrencies and related risks. Those who pass the test can invest up to 600,000 rubles a year in crypto; those who don't are limited to 50,000 rubles. Qualified investor won't have any limits.  Cryptocurrency exchanges must keep their own crypto and their users' funds in separate accounts and maintain a record of all their users' crypto addresses. Users must not be held liable for any debt of their exchanges.  Cryptocurrency mining will also be regulated under proposed bill.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin reverses early gains as Kremlin dashes hopes for Ukraine peace summit.  Featured stories: U.S. inflation breakevens suggest Fed's tightening cycle may be shallow, support bitcoin's long-term bull prospects.  CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" is on a break due to President's Day holiday in the U.S. and will return on Tuesday  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin is back on the defensive, with the Kremlin calling the idea of a dialogue between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden premature and dashing hopes of a potential Ukraine peace summit.  The cryptocurrency was last seen trading near $37,600, representing a 2% drop on the day. Prices hit a high of $39,500 during the European hours after France championed the idea of a Biden-Putin dialogue over Ukraine. Rest of the cryptocurrencies have come off daily highs, tracking bitcoin with ether funds seeing renewed outflows, according to ByteTree data.  With the U.S. markets closed on account of the Presidents' Day holiday, bitcoin appears to be the only macro asset available for trading in the spot and derivatives market. As such, escalation of tensions between Russia-Ukraine may lead to sharp losses in the cryptocurrency.  The daily chart paints a bearish picture, with a rising trend line convincingly violated alongside a below-50 or bearish reading on the relative strength index and a negative MACD indicator.  The double whammy of Federal Reserve rate hike fears and lingering geopolitical tensions are likely to keep bitcoin under pressure in the short term. Calls for a 50-basis-point rate hike in March have grown in the wake of the hotter-than-expected January inflation data released early this month.

Data on U.S. inflation breakevens, which signal the expected path of price pressures over different timeframes, suggests they may be right.  The spread between the 10- and two-year breakeven inflation rates fell to a record low of -1.2% last week. That's perhaps a sign of market players expecting inflation to drop back in the long term, weakening the case for aggressive and prolonged stimulus withdrawal by the Fed.  ""It's another way of telling us that inflation will drop back in the longer term, thereby possibly cutting the life of any Fed tightening campaign. An inflation level that is high enough to eliminate deflation fears, but low enough to keep Fed hawks at bay,"" Ashraf Laidi, strategist and trader, founder of Intermarket Strategy and author of Currency Trading & Intermarket Analysis, said in a blogpost.  Inflation breakevens are calculated by subtracting the yield of an inflation-protected bond from the yield of a nominal bond during the same period.  The record low spread between the 10- and two-year breakeven rates suggest the Fed tightening fears may be overdone and bitcoin could survive the impending liquidity withdrawal.  According to Laidi, the narrowing spread probably helped gold chalk out gains in recent weeks.

Axie Sales Surpass $4 Billion  By Omkar Godbole  Axie Infinity,a play-to-earn (P2E) game launched in 2018, has surpassed $4 billion in lifetime non-fungible tokens sales, according to data tracked by DappRadar.  ""Nearly two million individual traders participated in the market palace, with the average Axie price at just under $200,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the TagusCapital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email. "" Axie is now the third-largest in the space.""  The supposedly recession-proof game has been a big hit in Philipines and other emerging economies, including India.  ""I tried out Axie by sheer intrigue. I was curious to know how a relatively new game could amass 300K daily active users, which was in October 2021, post which I have played and studied a few other P2E models, namely - Skyweaver and Neon District,"" Adwait Rangnekar, a Mumbai-based developer and former Axie player told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  ""Online player communities thrive on an active and contributing user base. The Axie Comunity has a very strong online presence and averages more than 2 million daily active users, which attracts players. These numbers are similar to DOTA2, League of Legends (LoL), and MMORPG.

The phishing attack was targeting smart contracts on OpenSea's platform.  ""Our original count included anyone who had interacted with the attacker, rather than those who were victims of the phishing attack,"" the marketplace tweeted on Monday.  The attack also no longer appears to be active, as there has been no activity on the malicious contract for over 15 hours, the company said.  OpenSea is still yet to determine the exact source of the phishing attack first detected in the early hours of Sunday morning, following rumours circulating of an exploit of smart contracts on the platform.  CEO Devin Finzer subsequently tweeted that 32 users had ""signed a malicious payload from an attacker, and some of their NFTs were stolen.""  Blockchain security company PeckShield said that the exploit was ""most likely phishing"", whereby users authorized the migration of their NFTs to a new smart contract allowing them to be stolen. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items.  OpenSea is among the most prominent platforms in the NFT world, with a recent $300 million investment round valuing it at $13.3 billion.

In a report entitled “Views From the Floor – Is Crypto Just a Rate-Sensitive Risk Asset?” the analysts noted that rising inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates have “eroded the theoretical value of long-dated cashflows,” resulting in underperformance for both the Nasdaq and the ARK Innovation ETF.  Bitcoin has now joined them, the money manager said, with a correlation of 0.44 to the Nasdaq index and 0.43 to the ARK ETF.  This growing correlation may be evidence of a change in the nature of bitcoin as an asset class, Man Group said, noting that before 2019 the digital asset went through periods of negative correlation with both measures. Since then, correlations to “risky tech” have turned positive, it added.  “This mirror’s bitcoin’s own journey along the Gartner hype cycle: From being an underground tech phenomenon, the flagship cryptocurrency is now a mainstream way for both institutional and real investors to speculate,” the report said.  It’s not surprising that bitcoin is becoming more correlated with risky assets such as equities, whose value is tied to distant future cashflows, the hedge fund said, adding that the higher the correlations get “the more bitcoin seems to be another manifestation of a crucial facet of investing over the past decade: there is too much capital chasing too little genuine economic growth.”  Bitcoin was trading around $37,500 as of publication time.

42395993,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Ngv,1645431029,Bitcoin Renaissance Likely in H2: Babel Finance,"Battered bitcoin (BTC) may take cues from growth stocks and chalk up a new bull run in the second half of the year.  ""After the market adjusts to the pace of the [Federal Reserve's] rate hike, growth stocks and bitcoin will resume their upward trend, that is we will see a strong performance of both in the second half of 2022,"" Robbie Liu, researcher at crypto financial services provider Babel Finance, told CoinDesk in an email.  ""Historically, per Goldman Sachs, growth stocks have been the worst-performing sector in the three months before and after the first rate hike,"" Liu added while noting the cryptocurrency's tight correlation with the growth-sensitive legacy risk assets. Bitcoin's correlation with the U.S. stocks recently hit a record high of over 0.75, according to data analytics firm IntoTheBlock.  Liu's data-backed view contradicts the budding narrative in the crypto community that bitcoin may begin rallying right after the expected March rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  The market expectation likely stems from two things: The cryptocurrency has tanked 40% in three months, predominantly due to Fed rate hike fears. Secondly, as Friday's First Mover Americas noted, the U.S. dollar tends to top out with the first rate hike. A weak dollar is generally considered bullish for bitcoin.  However, growth stocks suggest otherwise. ""Given the current strong correlation between bitcoin and growth stocks, especially the synchronized downward trend of the two assets since December, we believe it may be difficult for bitcoin to move upward direction in the three months following the first rate hike,"" Liu noted.  The table shows value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks three months before and after the Fed kicks off rate hike cycle. Value stocks are companies that are currently trading below their intrinsic value and are typically established companies. Growth stocks newer industries with high growth projections and trade at relatively expensive prices.  While bitcoin may be viewed as digital gold by some in the crypto community, it is also an emerging technology sensitive to centralized liquidity flow.  Per Reuters, several Wall Street banks expect the Fed to kick off the tightening cycle with at least a 25 basis point rate rise in March followed by six quarter percentage point hikes by the year end.  Bitcoin was last seen trading near $39,100, representing a nearly 2% gain on the day.

The government of Dubai, one of the seven constituent emirates, said in December it will create a favorable regulated zone for crypto service providers in the Dubai World Trade Center, a skyscraper in the city.

ESPN estimates the team would sell for $4 billion, which is what the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is aiming to raise.  The effort is being led by Sean O’Brien, a 10-year veteran of Cisco Systems’ legal department. O’Brien said the DAO will go live this week.  A decentralized autonomous organization is an organizatrion represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.  According to O’Brien, the DAO would also incorporate as a cooperative, and participants in the DAO would have a parallel ownership share of the cooperative.  The team has been run by a trust since its owner, Pat Bowlen, died in 2017. The NFL has signaled that it would like a deal closed by the start of the 2022 season.  Wisconsin’s Green Bay Packers team is owned by a community cooperative, first incorporated in 1923 in a structure similar to what the DAO would use to purchase the Denver Broncos.  In 1980, the NFL put in new rules that banned a “decentralized,” community-driven ownership that the Green Bay Packers use (though the team has an exception via a grandfathering clause).  Rules state that ownership must be led by a single person that has at least 30% equity in the team, with minor exceptions for a family ownership structure. There is also a limit of 32 owners for one team, and sales need to be approved by the NFL.

Fintech (financial technology) has changed the face of the financial industry. From mobile payments to lending and personal finance management, fintech has completely changed how we interact with our money. Importantly, fintech is not just limited to banking and credit.

According to many proponents, DeFi or decentralized finance is an evolution of fintech set to take financial markets by storm. With a steadily growing market cap that is currently estimated to be USD 115 billion, DeFi applications are already demonstrating that they can accomplish the objectives of legacy financial systems but in a manner that is faster, cheaper, and better by leveraging blockchain.

42417116,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6fTZ,1645421698,Making Sense of India's New Crypto Rules,"On Feb. 1, 2022, the Indian crypto industry reacted like cheerleaders unsure if their team had scored a goal. Excited celebration, then skepticism; an expression that said, “What just happened?”  India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made two major crypto-related announcements while introducing the nation’s budget for the upcoming year.  This post is part of Tax Week.  First, the government intends to levy a 30% tax on any income generated from crypto transactions and a second tax of 1% at source on all transactions (TDS).  Second, India intends to introduce a digital rupee (a central bank digital currency, or CBDC) within the financial year, the first reference to a time frame.  The single biggest point of confusion for users as a result of the announcements is how crypto could be taxed and yet not be legal. The government has refrained from suggesting crypto was legal.  After presenting the budget, the finance minister held a media briefing where she said her agency is ""collecting inputs on regulation for crypto assets....I don't wait till regulation comes in for taxing people who are making profits.”  In other words, the bill that gives crypto the ultimate legitimacy or makes it legal will take time to come but the government is not waiting for that to happen before taxing people.India is awaiting crypto-specific legislation to be introduced in the parliament, deliberated upon and then passed by both houses to establish whether crypto is legal, meaning it can be accepted as an everyday speculative asset or as anything but a legal tender or form of money to buy and sell anything.  Whether crypto is legal, how much citizens have to pay in taxes, whether crypto could still be banned and how non-fungible tokens (NFT) fit into India’s regulatory framework are just some of the questions the crypto-curious citizen wants answered.  CoinDesk spoke to more than 20 experts, including government officials, lawyers, policy experts, executives at exchanges and tax professionals, to find the most simple and accurate answers.  ‘No longer go to jail’  The biggest takeaway is that “now as an investor I will no longer go to jail as a holder of crypto,” said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, a crypto asset management platform.  A Reuters report from December 2021 said the draft legislation regulating cryptocurrency includes a provision that those who “infringe the law could be subject to arrest without a warrant and being held without bail.”  An NDTV report added that “individuals and corporations violating government rules on crypto finance will face fines of up to Rs. 20 crore (US$2.7 million) and a jail term of 18 months.  India’s yet-to-be-introduced legislation could still impose jail terms or fines, but not for simply trading in crypto – they would only apply if one violates new tax rules that determine how much tax to pay: 30% tax on income from transfer, a tax of 1% at source on all transactions (or TDS, for Tax Deducted at Source). Two other conditions are that one cannot offset losses from a transfer of digital assets against any other income and that gifts will be taxed when it is in the hands of the recipient.  Why is it called a ‘virtual digital asset’?  The finance minister's use of the phrase “virtual digital asset” in her speech earlier this month points to why many in the industry, and the media that cover it, are not saying crypto is legal.  The budget proposal defines virtual digital assets as “any information or code or number or token (not being Indian currency or foreign currency) generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, by whatever name called, providing a digital representation of value exchanged.”  In plain English, that means “virtual digital asset” is the terminology the government is using for all cryptocurrencies and NFTs.  The word “digital” is used because cryptocurrencies or NFTs are a digital representation and not legal tender you can hold in your hand like a 100 rupee note.  The government had earlier mulled using the phrase “crypto-assets” to signify that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and you cannot buy or sell things with them but instead they are held as an asset for investment purposes.  But the government appears to have settled for “virtual digital assets” in order to distance itself from the word “crypto.”  “This forces the interpreter to try to understand why the government used a different word, creating doubt and encouraging investor caution,” explained Shehnaz Ahmed, senior resident fellow and lead (fintech) at the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.  This terminology by the government is broad and covers all sorts of digital or crypto assets for the purpose of taxation. “Another point is that the term ‘virtual assets’ is also being used by the global body, [the] Financial Action Task Force, [and] because the government wants to be aligned with the global terminology,” said Ahmed.  Is crypto legal?  When India announced its new proposed rules Binance tweeted that “crypto just became legal in India.”  In media interactions after the announcement, several government officials said the new proposals do not mean crypto is legal.  Finance Secretary T. V. Somanathan told Bloomberg that it is not illegal to buy or sell crypto in India.  News agency ANI quoted Somanathan as saying, ""Bitcoin, ethereum or NFT will never become legal tender. Crypto-assets are assets whose value will be determined between two people. You can buy gold, diamonds, crypto, but that will not have the value authorized by the government.""  Similarly, Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj explained it best in an interview by saying that the gains from cryptocurrencies were always taxable but the new rule will “bring certainty in taxation of cryptocurrencies.” Still, this new rule “does not convey anything on its legality which would come out once the bill (on regulating such assets) is introduced in Parliament.”“Just because it is taxed does not make it legal,” said Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman JB Mohapatra.  Mohapatra also said the act of levying a tax should not be equated with conferring legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, according to Business Today. A senior lawyer, requesting anonymity because he has worked with the government on crypto regulations, said the government has taken a view that everything is taxable but not everything is permissible. Illegal products smuggled in are also taxed.  “If you smuggle and are caught, you are not only liable to pay the forfeiture of goods and the benefits but also penalty. They also charge tax on it,” the lawyer said.  When CoinDesk asked Binance about these explanations by government officials, a spokesperson referred CoinDesk to statements from the Reserve Bank of India and the budget speech.  “We look forward to supporting the government of India as their approach to digital assets continues to evolve,"" the spokesperson said.  How much tax?  Investors in crypto will owe a 30% tax on all transactions. Further, some investors might owe an additional 1% tax in certain circumstances. The 30% tax will apply every time any investor makes any capital gain. In contrast, the 1% tax will only apply in certain situations.  However, international transactions may be exempt because the government has not yet defined how taxes might work if the recipient is overseas.  If a crypto investor sends 100 rupees to an exchange and buys bitcoin with it and it doubles in value, the investor makes a 100 rupee gain. According to the now-announced tax rule, the investor will be charged 30% on the gain of 100 rupees. So, the investor will be left with 170 rupees.  The 1% tax TDS will be imposed on the sale value (in this case 200 rupees) at the time of the sale.  But whether tax deducted at the source will be charged or not depends on the amount investors trade on exchanges and who they are.  Individuals or entities with a net worth of under 50 lakh (roughly US$66,500) are taxed with the 1% TDS if they invest more than 10,000 rupees. Investors with less than 10,000 do not face this tax.Individuals face the 1% TDS above 50,000 rupees. Investors will be charged a 30% tax if they do anything with their crypto investment besides convert the crypto back to rupees in their bank account.  Exchanges are responsible for submitting TDS taxes to the government on a monthly basis, while the 30% tax is the responsibility of individuals and their chartered accountants.  The government has not yet determined how to implement the 1% tax when the buyer or recipient of a crypto transaction is located in another nation. This has left exchanges confused.  All crypto (or virtual digital asset) gains will be taxed effective April 1, 2023, and the 1% TDS will come into effect as of July 1.  However, on Feb. 3, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) announced crypto transactions conducted between 2021 and April 2022 will also be subject to this new tax.  The old income tax law would still apply on crypto gains over the past decade.  “The flat 30% tax is unfair, especially to the investors who fall under lower income brackets.” said Anoush Bhasin, a crypto tax adviser and a founder of Quagmire Consulting.  Bhasin said implementing the 1% TDS would be difficult for retail transactions.  “The government should further clarify how on-chain transactions would be considered for this purpose,” Bhasin said.The government is treating crypto like all other forms of speculative income in India, which explains why it would face a 30% tax rate, the highest rate in India.  ""If I take horse racing, that also attracts 30% tax. There is already 30% tax on any speculative transaction. So we have decided to tax crypto at the same rate. Crypto is a speculative transaction, so we are taxing it at a 30% rate,"" Finance Secretary Somanathan told ANI.  “The first principle (of the government) at play is ensuring that no earnings from virtual digital assets escape the tax net,” wrote Meghna Bal, a fellow at the Esya Centre and a consultant for Koan Advisory, a technology policy consulting firm, for the ThePrint.  Bal thinks a high tax rate has been used “as a disincentive” for low-income individuals and that the “tax deductible at source (TDS) mechanism has been used to understand the extent of activity” in the crypto market.  What still concerns exchanges  Across all exchanges, the 1% TDS is the biggest issue. They don’t know if the 1% TDS will be on every single transaction.  Their concern is if that is the case, then high-net-worth individuals will discontinue crypto trading in India.  “We need more clarity on the 1% TDS and the definition of transfers. Is this transfer from wallet to wallet or bank to wallet?” said a senior executive at a major exchange, wishing not to be named.  The executive said a “30% slab is fixed for virtual digital assets but the definition of virtual digital assets needs to be made clearer, and ideally it should be different for different use case scenarios.”  NFTs, decentralized finance and metaverse tokens should have different tax brackets because they might see different uses than just speculative trading, the executive said.  On Feb. 10, representatives of India’s exchanges met with senior policymakers at the Finance Ministry, seeking a review of both the 1% TDS and the 30% tax rate. The industry is preparing a formal proposal and is hoping the government accommodates the industry’s reconsideration request before the bill is passed in parliament.  The other concern some of the exchanges have is whether crypto will be banned after bringing everyone under the tax net. The concern is that if all crypto-related activities are brought under a tax regime, it may make it easier to ban these activities outright.  Will crypto be legal?  If or when the government introduces a crypto-specific bill in parliament and it is passed and becomes law, crypto will be seen as being legal.  Even after a crypto law is enacted, the fine print will determine whether all aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem will be legal or not.  The bill has already reportedly evolved from prohibiting all private cryptocurrencies to allowing cryptocurrencies to be used as an asset.Therefore, uncertainty around several aspects of the crypto ecosystem remains and will be determined by the law.  It is not clear when the government will introduce the bill. The finance minister, responsible for introducing the bill in parliament, has refused to announce a time frame, saying consultations are ongoing. Only the cryptocurrency issued by the Reserve Bank of India (India’s central bank) – i.e., the digital rupee – will be a legal currency or legal tender. In other words, you could buy groceries only with the digital rupee and not ether, bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.  In an interview with CNBC TV 18, the finance minister explained how she is trying to draw a “distinction between privately generated crypto-assets and what can be digital currency,” while also maintaining that “we can’t define” what a crypto-asset is until consultations are done. That is when she would bring the bill to parliament.  Shehnaz Ahmed of the policy think tank Vidhi Legal fears that “not making a call on the regulatory aspect is not great for the crypto industry. If they don’t, they are allowing for the growth of a reckless market. Tax treatment is great but you seriously need to have regulation.”  Could cryptocurrencies be declared illegal tomorrow  Technically, yes.  “But it may be foolish to do that since the implementation of the ban would be impossible,” said Sidharth Sogani, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency research organization Crebaco.  “A ban would only instigate black market and peer-to-peer transfers that are impossible to track and trace, resulting in a major tax revenue loss, too,” he said. Most indications suggest India’s crypto market is too big to ban. That’s partly why India has decided to tax it now.  CBDT Chairman Mohapatra has underlined that even if crypto trading is made illegal through legislation, the profits on trade will continue to be taxed.  According to experts, what is more likely is that every cryptocurrency other than the digital rupee (and maybe some of the most well-known currencies such as bitcoin and ether) will be banned from being used as legal tender. Investors could trade cryptocurrencies as assets or purchase NFTs, but not food or other goods.“I don’t think that the legal tender status will be conferred on something that is not backed by the central bank and RBI. So even bitcoin or any other popular currency will not be given the legal tender status,” said Shehnaz Ahmed from Vidhi.  On Feb. 14, T Rabi Shankar, the deputy governor of India’s central bank, reiterated the bank’s stance, saying that “banning cryptocurrency is perhaps the most advisable choice open to India.”  What of NFTs?  The likely interpretation of the new rule is that NFTs will be taxed almost like virtual digital assets.  CoinDesk has reported that the government may be seeking “to define just what is or is not a non-fungible token” and that in this new law it has “retained the power to say this is not an NFT.” In other words, the government has retained the power to exclude any NFT it chooses through a notification.  “This entire taxation structure is brutal and it will not last. They will have to ease it in the next two years, is my prediction, maybe even when they introduce the crypto bill,” said Crebaco’s Sogani.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/21/making-sense-of-indias-new-crypto-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d0245488d64598ccb6678e64c05d89e4e27438b-3000x1998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Why does this problem arise and how this can be solved? This article will explain the Byzantine Generals Problem and how does Bitcoin helps solve it. The Byzantine Generals Problem Assume you&apos;re a general in the Byzantine Empire&apos;s army. Around an enemy city, there are several other armies camped and you&apos;re all trying to figure out when to strike. Attack at the same time will benefit both parties. You will be successful in your retreat if both parties retreat together. If only one of you attack while others retreat, you&apos;ll fail and lose a lot of people on your side. The issue is with the generals&apos; communication because to communicate with one another, each army utilizes the same messenger. The courier can only move between armies by sneaking past the enemy city, which renders the messenger untrustworthy because there is no way of knowing whether or not the message you are receiving is accurate. The messenger might be kidnapped, a general might be a traitor, or you might not get a piece of news at all.

Additionally, Mimicry Protocol and Bunker.finance focused on lending and derivatives for non-fungible tokens (NFT), respectively.  Likewise, DAO-focused submissions centered on addressing popular pain points for the emergent organizations. Background Network pitched a decentralized autonomous organization that would outsource help desk and community management duties, while AcademyONE centered on providing rewards for creating and consuming educational content.  A pair of surprisingly visually appealing games stood out in the Metaverse and Gaming category: INDAO, a yield-producing Sci-Fi title, and MoonScape, a fantasy role-playing game utilizing NFTs for in-game items.
