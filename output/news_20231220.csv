21632162,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566219,1703115046,"Ledger Commits To Full Restitution For Victims Of $600,000 ConnectKit Attack","Hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger has responded to a recent security breach resulting in the theft of $600,000 worth of user assets. The company has pledged to enhance its security protocols by eliminating Blind Signing, a process where transactions are displayed in code rather than plain language, by June 2024. Ledger Takes Responsibility For ConnectKit Attack In a statement, Ledger emphasized its focus on addressing the recent security incident and preventing similar occurrences in the future. The company acknowledged the approximately $600,000 in assets that were impacted by the ConnectKit attack, particularly affecting users blind signing on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) decentralized applications (dApps). Furthermore, Ledger pledged to make sure affected victims are fully compensated, including non-Ledger customers, with CEO & Chairman Pascal Gauthier personally overseeing the restitution process. Related Reading: Solana Q4 Triumph: Soaring Activity Leaves Ethereum In The Dust – Report According to the statement, Ledger has already initiated contact with affected users and is actively working with them to resolve their specific cases. In addition, by June 2024, blind signing will no longer be supported on Ledger devices, contributing to a “new standard of user protection” and advocating for “Clear Signing,” which refers to a process that allows users to verify transactions on their Ledger devices before signing them across dApps. On this matter, Ledger’s CEO Pascal Gauthier stated: My personal commitment: Ledger will dedicate as much internal and external resources as possible to help the affected individuals recover their assets. Heightened dApp Security Measures According to an incident report released by the hardware wallet manufacturer, the attack exploited the Ledger Connect Kit, injecting malicious code into dApps utilizing the kit. This malicious code redirected assets to the attacker’s wallets, tricking EVM dApp users into “unknowingly signing transactions” that drained their wallets. Ledger addressed the attack by deploying a genuine fix for the Connect Kit within 40 minutes of detection. The compromised code remained accessible for a limited time due to the nature of content delivery networks (CDNs) and caching mechanisms. Ledger acknowledged the risks faced by the entire industry in safeguarding users and emphasized the need to continually raise the bar for security in dApps. The company plans to strengthen its access controls, conduct audits of internal and external tools, reinforce code signing, and improve infrastructure monitoring and alerting systems. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price In Trouble: Whale Transfers 85 Million DOGE To Robinhood Additionally, Ledger will educate users on the importance of Clear Signing and the potential risks associated with blind signing transactions without a secure display. Notably, with Clear Signing, users are presented with a clear and readable representation of the transaction details, enabling them to review and validate the transaction before providing their signature.

New data from Santiment has revealed the current sentiment among Ethereum whale addresses, as the total supply on exchanges recently hit a new low. According to the on-chain analytics platform, more than 240,000 ETH have left 10 of the biggest ETH exchange wallets in the past 24 hours. As a result, the cumulative number of ETH deposited across crypto exchanges dropped from 8.03 million ETH to 7.79 million ETH in a single day, one of the largest it has ever seen. With the current price of ETH hovering around $2,200, this represents a drop of over $528 million worth of ETH in exchange balances. Ethereum Exchange Supply Plummets Ethereum is currently down by 1.74% in the past 24 hours and is currently retesting its breakout level of around $2,200 which seems to have turned into a support. However, the drastic drop in Ethereum balances on exchanges is a very bullish sign for ETH. With less ETH available on exchanges, supply is reduced.

According to Santiment, only 8.07% of Ethereum’s total supply currently sits on exchanges, the lowest it has ever been. 👍 As #Ethereum‘s market value hangs just above $2,170, the largest exchange wallets continue to move coins into smaller wallets or off exchanges entirely. 240K $ETH has been collectively moved from these wallets in 24 hours, a 2.99% drop in coins held. https://t.co/Fw7lKcVZan pic.twitter.com/AMFPDL4BXp — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 19, 2023 ETH has failed to clear the $2,250 price level, falling to $2,120 in the late hours of December 19.

21630575,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566197,1703106037,Is Chainlink and Polygon About to Rip Higher? Whales Accumulating,"According to Lookonchain data on December 20, whales are actively accumulating Chainlink (LINK) and Polygon (MATIC) and moving them from Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume. Citing on-chain transfers, Lookonchain notes that LINK is specifically seeing significant accumulation from a fresh wallet labeled “0x8eAD,” which has withdrawn 247,860 LINK worth approximately $3.5 million from Binance in the past two days. Meanwhile, two new wallets, “0xa813” and “0x38b3”, have been actively accumulating MATIC, withdrawing 5 million MATIC worth around $3.13 million from Binance earlier today. Whales Accumulating, Will MATIC And LINK Rally? The fact that whales, individuals, or entities controlling large amounts of a particular token or coin are circling MATIC and LINK is net bullish and might support prices in the coming sessions. Notably, the transfer is considered bullish when whales move coins from exchanges to non-custodial wallets like hardware wallets or even hot wallets to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi), degen trading, or NFT trading. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price In Trouble: Whale Transfers 85 Million DOGE To Robinhood This shift is because, unlike in centralized exchanges like Binance, where their intention is usually trading for other coins or USDT, in on-chain apps, they can use the same stash to earn rewards, for instance, by providing liquidity or staking. Therefore, considering the recent transfer, LINK and MATIC prices might recover, increasing in the coming few trading sessions. Thus far, looking at candlestick formations in the daily chart, LINK is stable and remains within an uptrend. Notably, prices are trading above the 20-day moving average, suggesting that the coin found support. LINK is currently up 155% from September lows but down 15% from November peaks. On the other hand, MATIC is also stable and rejects attempts for lower lows. After days of consolidation, the coin has support at around $0.70, matching a critical level recorded in November. Still, whether the uptrend will resume depends on whether prices will float higher, breaking above $0.93 or November 2023 highs in the coming session. Technically, $0.95 marks a critical reaction level for MATIC that, if comprehensively broken, could open the doors for $1.20 and $1.60 in the coming sessions. Polygon And Chainlink Roll-Out Critical Features Beyond current technical formations, fundamental events prop up Polygon and Chainlink bulls, especially around decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-2 scaling. Chainlink’s new staking upgrade aims to mop more LINK from circulation, possibly increasing prices on rising demand for Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Related Reading: MATIC Enters Correction Phase, Bleeds 10% In The Past Week Meanwhile, as other blockchains repurpose to become Ethereum layer-2, Polygon CDK is becoming a critical cog in fast-tracking the process, directly supporting MATIC prices.

21629628,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566199,1703100624,BNB Price Faces Critical Juncture: Head-And-Shoulders Breakout Or Bearish Dip Below $200?,"The Binance Coin (BNB) price is crucial as market analysts offer differing viewpoints on the cryptocurrency’s potential direction. While one analyst presents a bullish case, anticipating a breakout and surge beyond $300, another raises concerns about a dip below $200. BNB Price Analysis Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that BNB price could be on the verge of breaking out of a head-and-shoulders pattern. Related Reading: Nansen’s Crypto Crystal Ball: AI Integration And A Potential Plot Twist In 2024? Martinez emphasizes the significance of a sustained close above $261, which could catalyze BNB’s upward trajectory toward $310. With a 2.9% gain over the past 24 hours and a 12% uptrend in the last fourteen days, the recent price action aligns with Martinez’s breakout thesis. Martinez analyzes the 1-day chart and identifies the $257 level as a crucial breakout point, signaling a potential shift in trend. If the sustained uptrend continues, BNB’s price could see a substantial 19.8% gain shortly, pushing the price toward $310. This projection remains just below BNB’s yearly high of $350 in April. However, contrasting this bullish outlook, Daan de Rover, a crypto analyst, and YouTuber, highlights BNB’s downtrend structure in the 1-week chart. Bearish Outlook For Binance Coin According to de Rover, the current BNB price action “looks weak,” raising concerns about the currency’s possible continuation of its downward trajectory, which began earlier this year. The analyst points to the “green box” on the 1-week chart, as seen in the graphic below, as a critical support level. If breached, it could lead to a deeper decline for BNB, falling below the $200 mark. De Rover’s cautious view is further emphasized by the fact that dropping below $200 would mark a level not breached since the bear market and crypto winter. BNB Chain Records Positive Growth According to Token Terminal data, the circulating market cap of BNB stands at $39.83 billion, with a slight decrease of 1.56% observed. However, it is important to note that the fully diluted market cap remains the same at $39.83 billion, indicating a stable valuation for the cryptocurrency. BNB has witnessed a positive revenue trend, with a 30.37% increase in annualized revenue, reaching $16.46 million. The 30-day revenue figure also shows growth at $1.35 million, representing a 21.33% increase. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price In Trouble: Whale Transfers 85 Million DOGE To Robinhood When assessing profitability ratios, the price-to-fully-diluted ratio (P/F) currently stands at 281.75x, indicating the market’s confidence in BNB’s potential. While there has been a slight decline of 18.2% in this ratio, it remains relatively high. The price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is also noteworthy, reaching 2,962.98x, although it has experienced a decline of 18.5%. BNB Chain has seen a positive trend regarding fees generated, with a 30-day increase of 20.92% to $14.22 million. The annualized fees have grown substantially, reaching $173.07 million, a significant 30.15% increase. The future trajectory of the BNB price and its underlying blockchain remains uncertain.

42409143,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEDGR,1703099952,"If You're in Crypto, You're a Criminal","If you work in crypto, you are going to hell. I stand with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as part of her anti-crypto army, in condemning this villainous industry chock full of crooks, bastards and fools waiting to be separated from their money. The grift and crime rampant throughout crypto is comical and villainous. It is comically villainous.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Together with the likes of newsletter writer Matt Stoller, we of the anti-crypto army are banding together to strengthen regulatory attention on crypto. No way should there be a means for consenting peers to transact directly without a bank or other financial institution to act as an intermediary.  See also: Matt Stoller: Cryptocurrencies: A Necessary Scam?  We must keep people and the public safe. If cash were created today, I’d oppose it for the same reasons as crypto. Cash and crypto both fall afoul of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The BSA is a much needed and highly effective regulation. Without it, U.S. financial activity would falter.  In no way is the BSA simply a means for banks to absolve themselves of the responsibility of proactively preventing fraud or making good when it happens, by allowing them to file wanton Suspicious Activity Reports to regulators who definitely have the means of assessing the risks. And in no way does the BSA violate the civil liberties enshrined in the U.S. Constitution — that is simply not a conversation worth having.  Indeed, because no crypto exchange performs standard know-your-customer (KYC) checks or works with on-chain analytics companies to monitor for illicit activity or terrorist financing, the entire blockchain sector is simply a big black box presumably filled with fraud. I know this because Senator Warren wrote a letter to Congress saying so.  Nevermind that companies like Chainalysis or Elliptic routinely find that the vast majority of crypto use is legitimate or at least not explicitly illicit. I mean, what else would publicly verifiable and immutable ledgers be used for?  Indeed, Senator Warren also sent out a number of letters to crypto lobbyists including Coin Center, the Blockchain Association and crypto exchange Coinbase, which has recently reinvested in its own Washington D.C. pressure campaign, calling out the revolving door that exists between crypto and the Capitol. Shameful activity.  Banks and other stolid financial institutions would never hire former politicians or those with political connections to advance their interests. It would be unseemly — as unseemly, say, as a legislator who actively trades stocks.  Warren, mind you, is the Senator who got the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau through political gridlock, so she knows a few things about financial safety.  See also: Elizabeth Warren's Crypto Bill Is Likely Unconstitutional and Also Unlikely to Pass | Opinion  Because of all of this and more, I must join the ranks of the anti-crypto army and combat the adoption of crypto. Even if you want to grant that crypto has been used to fund dissident political actors and freedom fighters alongside terrorists, the contributions blockchain developers have made to cryptography and self-custody solutions or the political flowering that can follow when people begin to take ideas of sovereignty and community seriously, crypto cannot be worth it.  And what exactly are the costs of crypto? Meme coins, ransomware and grift. The internet is a place of learning, which flattens access to knowledge, not a place for fun and games and gambling. Further, in no way would the continued rapid growth of the internet explain at all the concomitant rise in online crime — only crypto explains the rise of hackers and scammers in U.S. society.  So, as my fellow anti-crypto soldier Matt Stoller has said, if you are in crypto or into blockchain at all today, you are likely an enemy of the state.

42409148,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEDQM,1703098276,"The Protocol: Blockchain Tech Predictions for 2024, Er… Best Guesses","This year's crypto-market doldrums brought little respite from the announcements, product rollouts, integrations, partnerships, collaborations, fundraisings, launches, deployments, migrations, transitions. There's a lot of information, all quite technical and complex; as hard as it can be to catch up, keeping up is equally daunting. Imagine piloting a spaceship through a dense asteroid field while playing a game of Concentration with the individual asteroids; pattern recognition might be your only hope. A few key 2023 trends were broadly foreseen by the experts. Many weren't. Truth be told, nobody really knows where all of this is going.  BUT why not try? At least? Check out The Protocol's FIRST ANNUAL list of blockchain tech predictions for the coming year.  ALSO: Ledger lamentations and Bitcoin's Ordinals ordeal.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  THE PROTOCOL'S FIRST ANNUAL LIST OF BLOCKCHAIN TECH PREDICTIONS: Out of all the roadmaps, tea leaves and best guesses inundating our inbox over the past couple weeks, we curated 10 prognostications from blockchain tech gurus for the coming year. Yes, it's brain-hurting stuff, and maybe some of it will happen. We've got decent sources at least. Ripple Labs' David Schwartz sees ""interoperability"" as a dominant theme; Abdelhamid Bakhta, lead and core Ethereum developer, Starknet ecosystem, likes ""modularity."" Go here for the full list.  LEDGER HACK LEDGER:  Exploit at Ledger, the hardware wallet maker, upends DeFi, by Oliver Knight. (Link)  What we know about the Ledger hack, by Daniel Kuhn. (Link)  Galaxy Research's Lucas Tcheyan: ""The fact that an exploiter was able to hack Ledger through a former employee demonstrates a lack of proper credentials management and could lead to more scrutiny into the rest of their security practices.""  Bankless newsletter: ""According to Ledger, no users’ private keys were at risk, but this event serves as a reminder for the need to prioritize security around one’s crypto holdings. As a basic rule, it is seen as wise to utilize one wallet for strictly holding assets and another for interacting with decentralized applications.""  P.S.: On Wednesday the official Ledger account on X posted that ""we are aware of approximately $600K in ""assets impacted, stolen from users blind-signing on EVM DApps."" The company added: ""Ledger will make sure victims affected will be made whole, and are committing to work with the DApp ecosystem to allow Clear Signing, and no longer allow Blind Signing with Ledger devices by June 2024.""  ALSO:  Once-struggling Solana Saga phones started flying off the shelves at a retail price of $599 after crypto traders realized they could qualify for BONK token airdrops worth nearly $700. Sellers of the phones on the online marketplace eBay quickly jacked up prices for the phones, with some of them going for upwards of $2,000 apiece. Other Solana-based projects soon piggybacked on the sensation.  The core developer group behind Ethereum PoW, the proof-of-work blockchain created in September 2022 via a fork when Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake network, agreed to dissolve, according to a blog post by one member of the team. The blockchain had been plagued by operational and security issues from the very start.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, whoargued three years ago for pushing more of the blockchain's computational load onto affiliated networks known as ""layer-2 networks"" or ""rollups,"" outlined a plan to take some of the functions back onto the main chain.  Polygon stops work on 'Edge,' used to build Dogechain, as focus turns to ZK.  Bitcoin ETF ad war officially underway with Bitwise campaign.  Shiba Inu developers could soon offer SHIB holders a '.shib' internet domain.  Helium Mobile cracks down on MOBILE token farmers.  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.  1. Avail, a rival to Celestia in the race to offer data solutions in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, reached agreement with top developer Starkware to play a key role in new networks starting next year. Under the agreement disclosed Wednesday, Avail will provide its ""data availability"" solution to new application-chains built using Starkware’s Madara, a so-calleddecentralized sequencer. Starkware is the main developer behind StarkNet, aleading layer-2 blockchain in the Ethereum ecosystem.  2. Lyra V2 has built its own custom chain on the Optimism stack,according to the team: ""Lyra now offers ultra fast trading and execution and continues to be fully custodial and keeping all funds and financial logic on-chain. Lyra V1 accounted for 60% of the decentralized options volume, trading over $1.5bn in notional volume. Lyra V2 has upgraded to a professional-grade UX and is beginning to target centralized exchange users with its new protocol. Key features: portfolio margin, cross-asset collateral, gasless transactions.  3. Stellar, the layer-1 blockchain, announced that its planned upgrade to introduce smart contract functionality will occur in a phased rollout over the first half of 2024, with the network’s validator vote on the upgrade taking place on Jan. 30, according to the team: ""To ensure the launch provides a high-quality experience for builders, Stellar will evaluate trial contract deployment and communicate to developers when the smart contract platform (known as Soroban) reaches a user-ready level of transactions per second facilitation.""  4. Pontem will launch its layer-2 network,Lumio, ""to solve Ethereum’s scalability challenges and usher in a Web2-like experience on Web3 for millions of users,"" according to the team. ""Pontem’s L2 can effectively increase transaction bandwidth, uniting the advantages of high TPS chains like Aptos with the security and liquidity of Ethereum with the purpose of scaling Ethereum horizontally to meet the needs of millions and eventually billions of users concurrently."" According to a press release seen by CoinDesk, Lumio is based on Optimism's OP Stack framework, and features a ""Move and EVM compatible runtime that allows developers to leverage the benefits of the Move language on Ethereum while still supporting the Solidity ecosystem.""  5. Intersect, a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem, has announced the planned migration of the core Cardano codebase to its stewardship, according to the team.  See the entire Protocol Village list from this past week here.  Money Center  Funraisings  Tap Protocol, an ""OrdFi-enabling protocol"" for Bitcoin Ordinals created by Trac, announced the successful closure of a $4.2 million investment round led by Sora Ventures, according to the team.  PROTOCOL VILLAGE EXCLUSIVE: Metagood, ""the blockchain technology and digital assets company that launched the innovativeOnChainMonkey NFTs and Osura marketplace, announced today the completion of a $5 million series seed funding round. The round was led by Sora Ventures, with participation from ACTAI Ventures, Bitcoin Frontier Fund, Bitcoin Magazine Fund, London Real Ventures andPeach.xyz.  Deals and grants  The MetisDAO Foundation, the organization behind layer 2 rollup Metis, said Monday that it has created a roughly $100 million fund to accelerate the growth of its ecosystem.

A big hit earlier in the year, they've now fully caught a ""second wind,"" as Reflexivity Research put it, helping to drive up Bitcoin transaction fees to an all-time high. They've also gone mainstream: Last week, a trio of Ordinals inscriptions from the ""BitcoinShrooms"" collection – two Super-Mario-Style mushroom characters and a pixelated avocado – sold at the famed Sotheby's auction house for about $450,000, or five times the highest estimates; needless to say, there are plans for more sales soon. The inscriptions fad has even spread to other blockchains, with similar technology clogging up networks including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Cronos, zkSync, The Open Network and Celestia, according to the analysis firm FundStrat. Greg Cipolaro, head of research at Nydig, noted in a report just how backed up Bitcoin's ""mempool"" – the backlog of transactions waiting to get processed – has become. ""The transaction queue stretches across an astonishing 372 blocks, equating to nearly 2.6 days based on an assumption of 144 blocks per day,"" Cipolaro wrote. The takeaway? Users will have to pay up to get those transactions cleared faster. ""Fees are now playing a much more substantial role in miner revenue,"" according to Cipolaro. The extra revenue could help to offset the expected impact of next year's ""halving,"" when block rewards are set to automatically adjust lower by 50%. But the scenario could also force a deep rethink (or revolt) on the part of users or businesses who may have predicated plans on the expectation of cheap transactions.  Bitcoin's transaction backlog known as the ""mempool"" has swelled, partly due to the impact of congestion from Ordinals inscriptions.

21628652,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566152,1703095223,Finance Expert Says Explains Why XRP Is A Scam,"A finance expert and Bitcoin maximalist has taken a major dig at XRP as he labeled the crypto token a “scam.” The expert outlined several reasons why he holds this opinion, although he seemed misguided in some. Why XRP Is A “Scam” In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, finance expert Rajat Soni mentioned XRP not being decentralized as one of the reasons he believes the crypto token is a scam. He seemed to suggest that Ripple Labs solely controlled the XRP Ledger as he noted that they developed the token. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Falling Wedge Pattern Appears, How Low Can Price Go? However, this belief is false, considering that it has always been emphasized that Ripple does not control the XRP Ledger or even the XRP token. In fact, this was obvious when certain amendments were to be made to the network, and Ripple’s CTO noted that they could not be passed without the approval of the validators. Another reason Soni mentioned was that Ripple controls a large portion of the tokens in circulation. He also went further to assert that the crypto firm could alter the token’s code and issue more XRP if it wanted. However, there is no basis for this assumption, as XRP has a maximum token supply of 100 billion. That hasn’t changed since the token was pre-mined. The finance expert also went as far as suggesting that XRP is a scam because it has no utility outside the US. He stated that people around the world don’t care about the token and that they would use the crypto token if the US cracks down on it. It is worth mentioning that the majority of XRP transactions come from outside the US. Token price recovers to $0.61 | Source: XRPUSD On Tradingview.com Possible Reason For The Attack On The Token As a Bitcoin maximalist, Soni seemed to be using his post to put XRP down and show why Bitcoin was superior. After he had had a go at the altcoins, he went on to compare the crypto token with Bitcoin, highlighting why the flagship crypto token is superior, in his opinion. He alluded to how Bitcoin’s supply isn’t concentrated and that the network was totally decentralized with a vast pool of miners. Related Reading: Matrixport Says 95% Chance Of Bitcoin Spot ETF In January, Sets BTC Price Target Furthermore, he mentioned how people are using Bitcoin to trade regularly in “other countries because they have no other way to transact.” Bitcoin’s value is so immense that Soni believes that holders won’t part ways with their tokens even if Bitcoin is banned. Interestingly, pro-XRP YouTuber Zach Rector recently made a case for XRP against Bitcoin. He believes that the former is the future of finance and not the flagship crypto token. One thing he alluded to was the increasing transaction fees on the Bitcoin network and how that was going to affect its utility. This is unlike XRP, which has a relatively cheaper average transaction fee.

42409130,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcECg4,1703094749,The Rise of Chain Abstraction and End of Blockchain Factionalism,"We saw a lot of growth in what I like to call the open web in 2023, despite the slow market for much the year. Zero-knowledge (ZK) tech made major strides, the layer 2 and rollup-driven stack took hold and new primitives launched capturing plenty of attention.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Illia Polosukhin is the CEO of the NEAR Foundation.  These trends all laid the groundwork for what will be the major evolution for Web3 in 2024: chain abstraction.  The crypto industry is moving into an era of chain abstraction, where blockchains and other infrastructure will become increasingly invisible to users and to an extent developers.  See also: The Barrier to Mainstream Crypto Adoption Isn't UX | Opinion  Developers care about distribution, access to users and liquidity and speed to launch –– as well as the security and reliability of the infra they’re using. Ultimately, most end-users — at least those using applications with mainstream potential — don’t care about the infrastructure an app is built on.  Users just want to get value and great experiences, quickly, easily and ideally for free. Hardly anyone thinks about or cares whether a webpage is running on Google, Amazon or something else, we just want it to work.  Zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) introduces a principally new approach to ledger security. Instead of needing to trust a decentralized set of validators, now through developments in ZK cryptography even a single computer can prove that rules were followed with a simple proof.  This means the difference between building on a shared chain with billions of dollars securing it (or spending immense resources to launch a new one), and spinning up a single server. In other words, security doesn’t need to be the deciding factor for developers when they are choosing infra — through recent advancements, transactions and value from one chain can settle on another (with some technical caveats).  People care about experiences and products, not infrastructure  This increasingly unified security across networks has major implications for app builders because it changes the set of decisions they’re making when they decide where to build. If you can prove what you’ve done with a ZK proof, it matters less where you’ve built it. Unifying security also means the ability to tap into liquidity from any network, at any layer.  For users and developers alike, the defragmenting of liquidity and security will lead to more flexibility. Similarly, removing the burden of these choices from users lets the open web start to feel more like today’s internet, a single platform experience where you can easily move from app to app without managing dozens of wallets and accounts.  The other major key to smoothing out user experience is account aggregation, or removing the need to manage accounts for every L1 and L2, which are increasingly becoming silos for apps and communities. NEAR, for instance, is working on multichain, non-custodial accounts that will enable cross-chain transactions.  Developers in general need to keep the idea of account. abstraction in mind, in order to deliver a unified experience across all Web3 apps.  See also: Ethereum Upgrade Could Make It Harder to Lose All Your Crypto  Combined with decentralized frontends, which give developers a new programmable environment for building apps that span across blockchains and keep the blockchain details hidden away from users, this is a powerful new paradigm to unlock a new era of smoother user experiences better than what's available on Web2.  NEAR is not alone in believing that a unified, cross-chain ecosystem is possible. We're also partnering with Eigen Labs on a fast finality layer for Ethereum rollups, collaborating with Polygon on a zkWASM prover and other initiatives. We see clearly that adoption of the ""open web"" begins with users' entry points to Web3.  Chain abstraction means the end of maximalism. Of course technology matters and many of us in Web3 care about the many innovations and choices that distinguish our different approaches. But most people care about experiences and products, not infrastructure.  As crypto marches towards the mainstream, there will be lots of blockchains, rollups and different infrastructure providers running any number and type of applications — but, hopefully, users won't have to manage or even know about the technical layers.  The open web will be a better web, so let's focus on delivering better experiences to users rather than cult thinking around a specific blockchain.",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | NEAR | ZK,Illia Polosukhin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/20/the-rise-of-chain-abstraction-and-end-of-blockchain-factionalism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0c084967bd23aa189da27b8955e452f62879e69-2048x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Attorneys for Bankman-Fried filed a letter Wednesday requesting the extension, saying he faces a possible second trial on additional charges set for March 11. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for March 28. They also asked that a presentence interview scheduled for Thursday be delayed, alongside other deadlines.  ""We submit that Mr. Bankman-Fried should not begin the sentencing process on the counts of conviction, including the presentence interview, until the severed counts are resolved,"" the letter said. ""Doing so could potentially result in a separate PSR and a separate sentencing hearing on conduct that was already part of the Government’s proof at trial.""  Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven charges of fraud and conspiracy last month, after prosecutors alleged he misappropriated FTX customer and investor funds, as well as Alameda Research's lenders' funds.  District Judge Lewis Kaplan, the Southern District of New York judge overseeing the case, denied the motion, saying that the defense did not object when the March 28 date was originally set.  If the Department of Justice does choose to proceed to a second trial on bank fraud and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act conspiracy charges, sentencing could be delayed, the judge said.

As global tensions rise and regional banks falter, bitcoin reclaims its status as a reliable store of value.  Meanwhile, TradFi giants filing for Bitcoin spot ETFs and tokenizing real world assets (RWAs) signify the convergence of the two worlds. With crypto now 15 years old, the year 2024 holds the promise of being a defining moment in its evolution.  The recent surge in Bitcoin prices serves as a prelude to an anticipated bull market of 2024. And several other factors align to set the stage for a crypto resurgence.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Macro Factors: Global liquidity conditions have been on the upswing since October 2023. The Fed’s change in tone during the December FOMC confirmed market expectation of potential rate cuts in early 2024, creating more favorable conditions for risky assets.  Mainstream Adoption: The advent of spot ETFs (expected to be approved as early as January) and tokenization represents a pivotal moment in crypto's integration into the broader financial landscape. Allocating a small percentage of US wealth management assets to Bitcoin ETFs could yield significant ETF sizes. Simultaneously, DeFi protocols are diversifying their yield sources into RWAs like U.S. Treasuries, attracting more crypto-native capital.  Technological Advancements: Major upgrades in blockchain scalability and UI/UX development are breaking barriers in the transition from Web2 to Web3. If Web3-based apps offer the ease of use found in Web2, coupled with the advantages of self-sovereignty, user migration is inevitable.  Is crypto heading towards mass adoption, or experiencing irrational exuberance? Three plausible scenarios for 2024 emerge:  Cambrian Explosion: BTC could surpass its all-time high (above $69,000) in January 2024, with selected sectors witnessing price actions reminiscent of the DeFi summer of 2021.  Steady Growth: BTC might follow similar pattern as 2023, with 20-50% rallies driven by positive news and intermittent sideways movement, culminating a 50-100% return.  Reset and Rebuild: Major market corrections could occur, pushing BTC prices below $30,000.  The first two scenarios appear more likely, supported by macro tailwinds, mainstream adoption and technology advancements. Moreover, long-term BTC holders continue to accumulate, and stablecoin supply has rebounded, indicating potential external capital to flow into crypto.  Looking forward, past cycle winners might not lead the charge this time. Successful projects often boast a robust community of developers and users, such as the exciting themes below:  Solana Renaissance: Solana, riding high behind the FTX shadow, has established a flying wheel effect, attracting developers and users with its high-performance blockchain. A mini-DeFi summer in Solana is evident as its Dex monthly trading volume surges almost 10-fold this year.  DeFi 2.0: Despite being a mature sector in crypto, DeFi remains ripe for innovation. Derivative DEXs, with enhanced settlement times and lower costs, could challenge CEX dominance in that field. Tokenized assets and re-staking could make DeFi yield attractive again compared to US Treasuries.  Web3 Gaming: Past VC investments in Web3 gaming are poised to bear fruit. Platforms like IMX are gaining a network effect, providing the technology and resources for a thriving Web3 gaming community.  2024 is destined to be an exciting time for crypto investors and builders!",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Kelly Ye,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/20/tis-the-season-to-be-jolly-about-the-crypto-market-in-2024,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dea1af6f902c771ffb1e23144f07f154ad9b068-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42409147,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEDWy,1703090700,TaxWraps: Unwrap the Financial Gift of Tokenization This Christmas,"Asset tokenization is one of the more compelling concepts in the current blockchain development cycle. Dacoinmister’s Second Bitcoin Whitepaper (proposing to build MasterCoin on top of the Bitcoin network) first described it in 2012. In 2014, Tether launched as the first tokenized fiat “stablecoin.”  The overall market capitalization of tokenized assets has now surpassed $200B, with $128 billion in stablecoins and $1.3 billion in other real world assets (RWAs) including U.S. Treasuries, real estate and debt.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Source: https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries  With increased institutional interest in crypto on the horizon, we expect tokenization to continue growing exponentially in 2024. With that in mind, this article introduces a new concept that could amplify tokenization’s growth: TaxWraps.  To understand TaxWraps, let’s explore dividend taxation. When companies pay out profits as non-qualified dividends, recipients face immediate tax liabilities. ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are one tool to defer tax obligations. ETFs often reinvest dividends back into the fund, allowing value to grow tax-deferred until investors sell their ETF shares. This allows investors to defer tax obligations while compounding their wealth. With TaxWraps, our goal is to broaden the ETF-style deferral mechanism via tokenization.  Consider a tokenized asset fund or trust (TAFs). A family office wishing to minimize their tax burden can perform in-kind transfers of income-generating stocks/assets to TAFs and, in return, receive tokens representing their ownership in the trust. Like ETFs, these tokens derive their value from the pool of assets in the fund.  When the stocks/assets generate income, the fund will acquire more of the underlying asset (e.g. reinvesting the dividends) and the existing token pool’s value will increase. When the family office is ready to liquidate its holdings, tokens can either be sold or burned, at which point only the overall gains or losses are considered for tax purposes.  Without getting into the complexities of tax codes and appropriate structuring of the TAFs, this simplified model could act as a beacon of tax efficiency achieved via tokenization. TAFs can delay tax liabilities connected with investing in digital assets and align with long-term wealth preservation strategies that were previously available via ETFs/ETNs and other structured products. Tokenization can even be considered as a way to democratize ETF-like products.  Our team at Lindy Labs is behind the wealth management platform Sandclock. We have been exploring TaxWraps along with instruments like total return swaps, dividend swaps and ETNs to develop a derivative portfolio that would maximize tax efficiencies for family offices and high net worth individuals via tokenization.  TaxWraps offer an intriguing blend of modern technology and existing tax law through ETF-style wrappers to empower the next massive surge in adoption and growth of tokenization.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Q Rasi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/20/taxwraps-unwrap-the-financial-gift-of-tokenization-this-christmas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d9214d3e69c5c89600c132a2c96358e87c311be-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409144,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEDN3,1703090141,"Blockchain Tech Predictions for 2024, From Experts at Ripple, Coinbase, a16z, Starknet","A lot of blockchain developers probably feel like they're working on the cutting edge of the cutting edge, building the financial and business infrastructure of the future. It’s nothing short of a revolution. Based on what we've seen, and reported, they're not wrong. Or, at least, it seems safe to say, the pace of innovation and speed of new developments in the blockchain space rarely ceases to stun; except for those moments when it all seems to look alike.  This year's crypto-market doldrums brought little respite from the announcements, product rollouts, integrations, partnerships, collaborations, fundraisings, launches, deployments, migrations, transitions. There's a lot of transformation, and information, all quite technical, complex; as hard as it can be to catch up, keeping up is equally daunting. Imagine piloting a spaceship through a dense asteroid field while playing a game of Concentration with the individual asteroids; pattern recognition might be your only hope.  A few key 2023 trends were broadly foreseen by the experts. Many weren't. Truth be told, nobody really knows where all of this is going. We curated 10 predictions from blockchain tech experts for 2024; their prognostications are as good as any, and quite technical. Bonne chance.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. AND: this article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast. And our can't-miss column of blockchain tech updates, Protocol Village.  Interoperability  ""By 2024 and beyond, the advancement of blockchain interoperability protocols will mark a major shift by breaking down the existing silos between different blockchains. This shift will enable diverse blockchain platforms to seamlessly interact by sharing data and value transfer, creating a unified and more efficient blockchain ecosystem. The role of interoperability protocols will be crucial in this transformation, as they will increase innovation, as well as foster new applications and use cases, specifically in DeFi."" - David Schwartz, CTO, Ripple Labs.  Bitcoin fees  ""In light of decreasing fixed block rewards for miners, our view is that catalysts for raising the variable block rewards from transaction fees will be increasingly important. The core Bitcoin protocol is in a largely stable state, with the Taproot upgrade in November 2021 being the only major protocol upgrade in the past five years – at least with regards to changes that have required a soft fork. Thus, we believe usage catalysts will originate from technological innovation, mostly within the confines of the existing network protocol such as increased usage of blob data like Ordinals and Atomicals, elevated activity on secondary layer 2s like the Lightning Network (LN), or general smart-contract environments built on top of the Bitcoin network like Rootstock, Stacks, RGB or future implementations of BitVM."" - David Duong, head of institutional research, Coinbase.  Modularity  “We’ve also seen a consolidation on the modular thesis and exciting developments in this space as more and more hybrid solutions come to market such as Ethereum roll ups using Celestia as the data availability layer. Meanwhile we also have blockchains like Solana continuing in its monolithic direction and saying no to layer 2s because they view them as bad for liquidity and the user experience. It will be interesting to watch these two narratives play out in 2024, especially as some Ethereum rollups explore using the Solana virtual machine.” - Abdelhamid Bakhta, lead and core Ethereum developer, Starknet ecosystem.  Zero-Knowledge Proofs  ""SNARKs allow the computation of a 'cryptographic receipt' of some compute workload by an untrusted “prover” impossible to forge: In the past computing such a receipt cost 10^9 work overhead over the original compute; recent advances are bringing this number closer to 10^6. SNARKs therefore become viable in situations where the initial compute provider can bear a 10^6 overhead and the clients cannot re-execute or store initial data. The use cases that result are many: Edge devices in the Internet of Things can verify upgrades. Media editing software can embed content authenticity and transformation data; while remixed memes could pay homage to initial sources. LLM inferences could include authenticity information. We could have self-verifying IRS forms, unforgeable bank audits, and many more uses that benefit consumers ahead."" - Sam Ragsdale, investment engineer, a16z.  Key management/user interfaces  “The emergence of account abstraction means that we can soon overcome the technical challenges of self-custody. 2024 will be the year that seed phrases can finally become a historical practice for most. The idea that the safety of assets meant having 12 words that you can never lose, but no one else can ever access, is outdated and to a large extent has been holding back progress for actual user adoption. As such, blockchain is in a position to deliver on the promise of inclusive finance that’s been so central to our values since the beginning.” - Friederike Ernst, co-founder, Gnosis and Gnosis Pay.  Censorship  ""Centralization concerns essentially boil down to two core issues: (1) Does a certain vector of centralization lead to network performance issues that put applications at risk of outages? And (2) will centralization create censorship challenges? One of the interesting things about the disentanglement of block building, relaying and validation in Ethereum is that it cleanly separates censorship challenges between three different layers of the Ethereum transaction processing stack. After the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash addresses last summer, major Ethereum relays began to censor transactions. The problem only abated once Flashbots open-sourced its market-dominant relay, and allowed permissionless relays like Ultra Sound, Agnostic and bloXroute to become more competitive. Today, it's block builders who have increasingly begun to censor transactions. I'd expect some of the biggest development breakthroughs in 2024 to come in areas like mempool encryption that shield transactions from potentially censorious parties before they are included in a block."" - Ryan Selkis, founder and CEO, Messari.  Security/privacy  ""In 2023 there have been tons of hacks and fraud within the crypto space including Euler Finance and Angle Protocol. We will see blockchain protocols creating more security solutions and taking privacy more seriously."" - Ramani Ramachandran, CEO, Router Protocol.  Corporate crypto  ""Networks and developer platforms should be prepared for onboarding corporate and startup builders, as well as independent developers. Network protocol teams should be prepared with user experiences that can reach millions of end users in their native digital experiences.

Having fended off a wave of selling pressure from holdings in the FTX bankruptcy estate, the token's recent growth has been outlined by a burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem coupled with hype-fueled meme coin mania.  This week, total value locked (TVL) on Solana topped $1 billion for the first since FTX's collapse in November last year, spurred by rising asset prices and consistent inflows to DeFi protocols.  Decentralized exchanges on Solana have experienced a boost in trading volume. On Dec. 15, Orca facilitated $746 million in volume, it has previously surpassed $100 million only once before November. Much of the increased activity can be attributed to meme coins like Bonk, a dog-themed token that now has a market cap of more than $1.2 billion.  As speculators race to find the next meme coin that turns hundreds of dollars into hundreds of thousands of dollars, traders typically purchase Solana as the underlying asset before converting that into their meme coin of choice. And every time they sell the meme coin back into Solana they effectively prompt a wave of buying pressure.  But much of the recent focus has been on Solana itself. The blockchain appears to improved network stability following a series of outages last year. It has also distanced itself from FTX following the collapse of the exchange, which purchased $1 billion worth of Solana-based tokens before it filed for bankruptcy.  SOL is currently trading at $81.04 having risen by 9.14% over the past 24 hours.

Ethereum Is Retesting The Breakout Line Of An Ascending Triangle As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, Ethereum may be preparing for a further climb right now as it’s retesting the breakout zone of an ascending triangle. An “ascending triangle” is a pattern in technical analysis that, as its name implies, resembles a triangle. The pattern involves a horizontal line made by connecting highs and a slant line that strings together higher lows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Are On The Move: A Worrying Sign? When the price retests the upper, horizontal level, it could be probable to feel some resistance. On the other hand, a touch of the lower level could lead to the price rebounding back up. A break out of either of these lines suggests a potential sustained continuation of the trend. Naturally, an escape out of the triangle towards the upside implies bullish momentum, while a fall under means bearish momentum. Like the ascending triangle, there is also the “descending triangle,” which is a similar pattern except for the fact that the two levels are switched around (as the prevailing trend is towards the downside). Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that displays how the price is interacting with an ascending triangle right now: Looks like the asset's value has plunged back towards the triangle in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible in the graph, Ethereum found a bottom at the lower line of this ascending triangle pattern back in October. Following this low, the asset turned itself around with a sharp rally and went on to challenge the upper line. The cryptocurrency succeeded in finding a break above the triangle and observed a continuation of the bullish momentum, exploring new highs for the year. Recently, though, the asset has slumped back again and has now fallen towards the triangle’s breakout line. So far, the line has provided support to the asset, as its price has been able to remain above it. The analyst believes that this retest could be a sign that the coin is preparing for a further rally. “The price range between $2,150 and $1,900 could be the ideal zone for accumulation before ETH sets its sights on a higher target of $3,500,” explains Ali. From the current price, such a target would mean a rally of almost 60% for the asset.

42409132,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcECpz,1703088000,Celestia Rival Avail Inks Agreement With Starkware as Blockchain Data Race Heats Up,"Avail, a rival to Celestia in the race to offer data solutions in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, reached an agreement with top developer Starkware to play a key role in new networks starting next year.  Under the agreement disclosed Wednesday, Avail will provide its ""data availability"" solution to new application-chains built using Starkware’s Madara, a so-called decentralized sequencer. Starkware is the main developer behind StarkNet, a leading layer-2 blockchain in the Ethereum ecosystem.  A sequencer is a key component of a layer-2 network that bundles up transactions from users and passes them along to the main Ethereum blockchain.  Avail, still in testnet, is projected to go live in the first quarter of next year, and Madara is expected in the second quarter.  The news comes as data availability (DA) solutions are gaining wider credence in the Ethereum ecosystem, since they are designed to drastically reduce costs for new layer-2 networks that generate reams of transaction data. Such systems are at the heart of the industry tilt toward ""modular"" blockchains, where developers are moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to more of an à la carte model where separate components can be plugged in to fulfill different functions.  According to Starkware, the Madara sequencer allows for the creation of customizable application-chains or ""appchains"" and even ""layer-3"" blockchains. An appchain is where builders of new, smaller networks can pick and choose their own components or features, rather than relying on an existing network with already-configured properties.  In a blog post in July, the developer wrote that ""Madara will offer developers a range of data availability (DA) schemes to choose from.""  Avail’s main competitor, Celestia, went live in October, and since then has struck a deal to make its DA solution available to the layer-2 developers Polygon and Arbitrum. Avail used to be a part of Polygon Labs, but spun out on its own in March.  Besides reducing costs, the teams say additional benefits could come from speed. According to a press release seen by CoinDesk, Madara rollups will be able to achieve finality in roughly one minute when using Avail’s DA layer.  “We worked very closely with the Starkware and Madara teams developing the DA interface due to common interest in enabling scalable, decentralized and affordable DA,” said Anurag Arjun, the founder of Avail, in an email to CoinDesk.  In July, Avail released its data attestation bridge on testnet, aimed to help secure data off-chain.  Read more: What Is Ethereum’s ‘Data Availability' Problem, and Why Does It Matter?

42409137,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcECtI,1703086357,6 Predictions for Crypto in 2024: Pantera’s Paul Veradittakit,"This past year has been a testament to the blockchain space’s ability to recover from even the harshest external conditions. From the depths of the “crypto winter” at the beginning of the year, the overall market cap of the crypto space has grown by 90% to $1.69 trillion, with bitcoin more than doubling from its yearly low of $16k in Jan 2023 to over $40k in December.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  In 2023, we’ve continued to feel some of the aftershocks of the wave of major collapses in 2022, most notably the FTX trial and verdict and the Binance plea deal in November, as well as the momentary depegging of the USDC stablecoin in March amid the banking crisis. At the same time, we’ve continued to see breakthroughs in the space, including the Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade to a full Proof-of-Stake network, also in March, the ruling that XRP was (mostly) not a security in July, the launch of PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin and Grayscale’s win over the SEC for the Bitcoin spot ETF in August, and the pioneering of novel tokenized social experiences such as the rise of Friend.tech.  We thus enter 2024 with a great optimism on the road ahead. Here are my top predictions for crypto industry in 2024:  1. The resurgence of Bitcoin and “DeFi Summer 2.0”  In 2023, Bitcoin has staged a comeback, with bitcoin dominance (Bitcoin’s proportion of crypto market cap) rising from 38% in January to around 50% in December, making it one of the top ecosystems to look out for in 2024. There are at least three major catalysts driving its renaissance in the next year: (1) the fourth Bitcoin halving due for April 2024, (2) the expected approval of several Bitcoin spot ETFs from institutional investors, and (3) a rise in programmability features, both on the base protocol (such as Ordinals), as well as Layer 2s and other scalability layers such as Stacks and Rootstock.  On the infrastructure level, we believe we will see a proliferation of Bitcoin L2s and other scalability layer to support smart contracts. The Bitcoin ecosystem should coalesce around one or two Turing-complete smart contract languages, with top contenders including Rust, Solidity, or the extension of a Bitcoin-native language such as Clarity. This language will become the “standard” for Bitcoin development, similar to how Solidity is considered to be the “standard” for Ethereum development.  We also see the fundamentals for a possible “DeFi summer 2.0” on Bitcoin. With Wrapped BTC (WBTC) today having a market cap and Total Value Locked (TVL) of around $6 billion, there is clearly an enormous demand for Bitcoin in DeFi. Today, Ethereum has about 10% of its $273 billion market cap in TVL ($28 billion). As Bitcoin DeFi infrastructure matures, we could potentially see Bitcoin DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) rise from the current $300M (<0.05% of market cap) to ~1-2% of Bitcoin market cap (~$10-15 billion at current prices). In this process, many Ethereum DeFi practices are likely to be transferred and “naturalized” on Bitcoin, such as the recent rise of BRC-20 inscriptions and ideas such as staking such as in Babylon’s L2.  Bitcoin NFTs, such as those inscribed on Ordinals, may also see increased popularity in 2024. As Bitcoin has much higher cultural recognition and memetic value, it is possible that web2 brands (such as luxury retailers) will choose to release NFTs on Bitcoin, similar to how Tiffanys partnered with Cryptopunks to release the “NFTiff” pendants collection in 2022.  2. Tokenized social experiences for new consumer use cases  Whereas Web2 has moved from social to finance, Web3 is moving from finance to social. In August 2023, friend.tech pioneered a new form of tokenized social experiences on the Base L2, with users able to buy and sell fractionalized “shares” of others’ X (fka. Twitter) accounts, reaching a peak of 30k ETH TVL (~$50 million USD at the time) in October, and inspiring several “copycat projects” such as post.tech on Arbitrum. It seems that friend.tech, through financializing Twitter profiles, has successfully pioneered a new tokenomics model for the SocialFi space.  Read more: Amanda Cassatt - How Asia Drives the Next Crypto Bull Market  In the upcoming year, we expect more experiments in the social space, with tokenization (both as fungible and non-fungible tokens) playing a key role in reinventing the social experience. Fungible tokens are more likely to be novel forms of points and loyalty systems, whereas non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are more likely to serve as profiles and social resources (such as trading cards). Both would be able to be traded on-chain and participate in DeFi ecosystems.  Lens and Farcaster are two of the leading web3-native applications integrating DeFi with social networks. Projects like Blackbird will also popularize tokenized points systems for loyalty programs in specific verticals (such as restaurants), using a combination of stablecoin payments and tokenized rebates to reinvent the consumer experience, functionally providing an on-chain alternative to credit cards.  3. An increase in TradFi-DeFi “bridges” such as stablecoins and mirrored assets  2023 has seen a lot of legal action in crypto, including several high profile wins for the industry such as the XRP ruling and the Grayscale ETF litigation win, and justice being served for financial fraud in Binance and FTX. Alongside this is a large increase in institutional interest and potential ETF approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum.  In 2024, we expect to see a dramatic increase in institutional adoption, who not only seek for ETFs, but also tokenized real-world assets (RWA) and TradFi financial products. In other words, TradFi assets will be “mirrored” in DeFi, while crypto assets will have increased exposure in TradFi markets, thus creating TradFi-DeFi “bridges” that bring these two worlds closer together for increased liquidity and diversification for investors.  Stablecoins will serve as one of the most important links between the TradFi and DeFi worlds, with stablecoins such as USDC and PYUSD being more widely accepted as both portfolio options and payment tools. With Circle said to consider a 2024 IPO, we also may see an increase in the issuance and usage of non-USD stablecoins, most notably Euro-backed stablecoins such as Circle’s EURC, as well as British Pound, Singaporean Dollar, and Japanese Yen stablecoins. Some of these stablecoins may be launched by state-backed actors. This may also lead to the growth of an on-chain fiat foreign exchange market. Tokenized treasuries have already gained traction with $800m tokenized through platforms like Ondo.  4. The cross-pollination of modular blockchains and Zero Knowledge Proofs  Both the idea of modular blockchains and ZKPs have greatly matured over this past year, such as the recent Celestia mainnet launch, Espresso’s Arbitrum integration, RiscZero’s open-source Zeth prover, and Succinct’s launch of a ZK marketplace. One interesting trend is how these two narratives have merged together, with companies in the ZK space “modularizing” by focusing on specific verticals, such as co-processors, privacy layers, proof marketplaces, and zkDevOps.  In the upcoming year, I expect this trend to continue, with Zero Knowledge Proofs emerging as an interface between different components of the modular blockchain stack. For example, Axiom’s ZK co-processor leverages ZKPs to provide historical state proofs, which can then be used by developers to perform computations in DApps. With ZKPs being the common interface between these different providers, we will see a new era of smart contract composability. This provides developers building DApps with a far greater flexibility for providers and reduces the barrier to entry for the blockchain stack. On the consumer side, ZKPs may see increased use cases as a way to preserve identity and privacy, such as in the form of ZK-based decentralized IDs.  5. More computationally intensive applications moving on-chain, such as AI and DePIN  There has been a lot of time, energy, and capital poured into the scalability problem for decentralized applications. Today, much of the scalability problem has been solved – gas fees on Ethereum L2s are less than 0.02 USD (compared to 11.5 USD for Ethereum mainnet), and on Solana the fees are 3-4 orders of magnitude even lower.  Read more: Marc Hochstein - What Prediction Markets Are Forecasting for Crypto in 2024  As this trend continues in the next year, we believe computationally expensive applications (applications can use up gigabytes of RAM) will become much more economically feasible on-chain in the near future. This includes vertical applications such as on-chain AI systems, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), on-chain knowledge graphs, and fully on-chain games and social networks. All this may radically reshape the on-chain data economy, greatly improve both user and developer experience, as they are freed from onerous gas fees and stringent constraints on compute power.  Examples of computationally expensive projects that can take advantage of this much cheaper on-chain “compute” include Hivemapper’s efforts to create a decentralized Google Maps on Solana, Bittensor’s creation of a decentralized machine learning platform, Modulus Labs’ efforts in ZKML and AI-generated NFT art, The Graph’s plans for on-chain knowledge graphs, and the Realmsverse creating an on-chain game world and lore on Starknet.  6. Consolidation of public blockchain ecosystems and a “Hub-and-Spoke” model for appchains  There has been a proliferation in infrastructure projects over the past few years. Despite the commonplace technical categorization of Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2), from a user experience perspective there is not much of a difference. This is especially true for a general-purpose public blockchains; today an L1 such as Solana or Avalanche is a direct competitor to an L2 such as Arbitrum or zkSync for users, projects, and volume.  With this homogeneity in place, liquidity serves as a concentrating force for general-purpose public blockchains, benefiting larger incumbent players such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Solana, with the top four ecosystems today accounting for ~90% of Total Value Locked (TVL). Smaller ecosystems must concentrate their efforts on specific verticals (such as social, gaming, DeFi) to retain an edge, effectively becoming “appchains” or “sector-chains.” Already, three of the Top 10 L2s by TVL (dydx, Loopring, Ronin) are effectively appchains that specialize in a single vertical. The TVL “break-in” of smaller, newer L2 chains such as Base and Blast also rely heavily on single “killer-apps” (eg. friend.tech and Blur respectively) to establish beachheads in volume.  Moreover, most leading general-purpose public blockchains have released appchain toolkits (OP Stack, Arbitrum Nitro, StarkEx, etc.) to allow appchains to tap into the liquidity on these public networks and place them within their ecosystem orbits. Thus, we’re beginning to see a “hub and spoke” model where there a few general-purpose public blockchains acting as central “hubs,” around which there are numerous “spokes” of specific appchains. In 2024, it may be worth paying attention to major rollup-as-a-service vendors such as Caldera, Conduit, and Eclipse that take advantage of this “hub-and-spoke” move.  Conclusion  As we reach the end of 2023, we have perhaps made it through the worst of the bear market, turning over the page on the series of brutal collapses that we have seen over the past year and a half, and ready to begin exploring novel use cases. Today, we’re at an inflection point, where crypto is no longer solely about financialization, but rather a broader idea of how we redefine consumer, social, and developer experiences using blockchains. I’m very excited to see what 2024 holds for the future of our still nascent industry, as we use decentralized technologies to reimagine our digital culture.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | ARB,Paul Veradittakit,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/20/6-predictions-for-crypto-in-2024-panteras-paul-veradittakit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6ece1d4c73bc7bd1cce32651dc926f7e951168f-1080x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409131,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcECjN,1703086307,DeFi Has a Risk Problem and It’s Time to Solve It,"As 2023 comes to a close, the decentralized finance (DeFi) market is once again assessing the damage from hacks and exploits. According to a recent report from IntoTheBlock, it’s not nearly as bad this year as it has been, with losses down from a whopping $53.5 billion in 2022 to just $1 billion this year.  But is “just” $1 billion really an acceptable annual loss for a burgeoning industry struggling to break out into the mainstream?  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Jeff Owens is the co-founder of Haven1.  The answer, unequivocally, is no. Yearly losses of $1 billion would be a concern even for a traditional financial sector. For DeFi, which is only beginning to recover after an annus horribilis in 2022, this represents an unacceptable level of risk for all but the most thick-skinned investors.  See also: What We Know About the Massive Ledger Hack | Opinion  DeFi isn’t a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Its total value locked (TVL) has barely cleared the $50 billion mark — still more than 70% below the all-time high of $180 billion at the height of the bull market in November 2021. That year, IntoTheBlock reported total losses from DeFi exploits of around $4 billion.  DeFi appears to be turning into the problem child of the crypto industry when it comes to fraud risk.  In this context, a fall to $1 billion no longer seems quite so positive. As a percentage of TVL, the hacks that occurred this year represents a narrow drop from 2.2% in 2021 to around 2% in 2023.  If we look at data from other sources, the trend is even more concerning. Research from Immunefi found a 59.9% quarter-on-quarter increase in crypto losses in Q3 2023, with DeFi accounting for a staggering 96.7% of the $685.5 million total. This is up from 80.5% of total crypto losses that Immunefi attributed to DeFi in 2022.  So, far from becoming more secure, DeFi appears to be turning into the problem child of the crypto industry when it comes to fraud risk.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  Not only is the risk not diminishing, but the attacks are also becoming more sophisticated. Take the recent KyberSwap hack, for example, which resulted in losses of $54.7 million. At the time, the protocol called the exploit “one of the most sophisticated in the history of DeFi”, requiring a “precise sequence of on-chain actions”. Similarly, the recent Ledger hack, which saw $484,000 drained from wallets, was intricate and multi-layered, allowing the hackers to stealthily siphon assets from the wallets of unsuspecting users.  The reality is that most users lack the knowledge and experience to protect themselves from such risks. Even seasoned DeFi investors are regularly caught out by increasingly intricate cyberattacks. And this is precisely the reason DeFi is struggling to attract mainstream investors, most of whom consider the risks to be simply too great. A survey conducted recently by Haven1, the company I co-founded, found that more than 50% of DeFi users avoid active trading due to a lack of knowledge and fear of exploits.  And institutions? Forget about it. A pension fund or asset manager would never be able to invest client assets into an industry that loses the equivalent of 2% of its market cap every year to cyberattacks. The risk-to-reward ratio is simply unacceptable. Yet without institutional capital, the DeFi ecosystem will continue to languish as the crypto market’s nerdy sidekick.  See also: Poly Heist Shows DeFi Needs Hackers to Become Unhackable | Opinion  We must find a balance between decentralization and consumer protection to change the perception of DeFi as the lawless “Wild West”  If we truly want to bring trillions of dollars of retail and institutional money into the DeFi space, we need a shift in focus. Security and customer protection must become core areas for development to bring this year’s $1 billion in losses down to zero. Only then will the public see DeFi as a legitimate financial ecosystem that can compete with incumbent traditional players.  Encouragingly, we are already seeing a number of exciting innovations in this area, including NFTs for digital identity verification, features to pause smart contracts as a rapid response to exploits and the development of enhanced security infrastructure. But we need to see much more of this in 2024. Security guardrails must be integrated into DeFi protocols at a network level to provide users with much-needed peace of mind.  As the crypto market’s recovery gathers pace in 2024, we must find a balance between decentralization and consumer protection to change the perception of DeFi as the lawless “Wild West” When it comes to personal finances, trust is the most important factor, even in a trustless environment. If we want DeFi to go mainstream, those of us building in the decentralized ecosystem must work hard to gain that trust by shifting that risk-to-reward ratio toward acceptable levels. Once we solve the risk problem, the users will come.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET,Jeff Owens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/20/defi-has-a-risk-problem-and-its-time-to-solve-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8e0c7749afacc68b95131f116f3c7f4f4cbbf91-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The transaction which was flagged by a DOGE community member has raised eyebrows in the space and could possibly be putting sell pressure on the altcoin. Dogecoin Whale Transfers Full Balance To Robinhood On Tuesday, a single transaction carrying over $7 million worth of DOGE was noticed by a Dogecoin community member who posted the transaction on X (formerly Twitter). This transaction caught the attention of the community because it was carrying a little over 85 million DOGE. At the time of the transaction, this tranche of coins was worth approximately $7.57 million, making it a large whale transaction. The destination of the transaction was even more concerning given that the coins were being sent to the Robinhood platform. Now, the reason that this transaction is important is the fact that crypto holders will usually send their coins to centralized exchanges such as Robinhood to sell their coins. This is because they can take advantage of the cheap fees, as well as the deep liquidity provided by these platforms, to enable them to sell such large transactions with ease. Furthermore, the X user noted an interesting thing about the sender’s address after the transaction. The whale no longer holds any Dogecoin on their account balance, which means they have sent all their coins to the exchange. This could signal that the whale is looking to completely exit their position as Dogecoin fails to launch. DOGE price at $0.09 | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com What Happens To DOGE Price? The DOGE price could be seeing some negative headwinds ahead especially if this whale is really selling their coins. With sell pressure already pushing down the price, selling such a large amount of Dogecoin would no doubt trigger a further decline. This sell pressure is already evident in the meme coin’s price which has fallen drastically over the past week. In the last day alone, DOGE’s price is down 3.28%, deviating from the Bitcoin trend that has seen the pioneer cryptocurrency recover from yesterday’s lows. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP 1,500% Move Against Bitcoin, What Are The Terms? However, there could be a change in this sell pressure soon as bids for the meme coin start to ramp up. According to data from IntoTheBlock, bids are starting to overtake asks again, meaning that buyers are coming back to the market. If this continues, then Dogecoin could look to reclaim $0.1 once again. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.08994, with a 2.37% decline on the weekly chart.

However, some altcoins continued to trend downward with MATIC being one of them. According to Coingecko, the token is down almost 10% in the weekly timeframe.

MATIC market cap currently at $7.424 billion. Chart: TradingView.com This new addition will attract more developers to the platform. It can already be seen happening, with six projects testing the new Polygon CDK with the cdk-erigon integration. Polygon also iterated that the system will be available as an RPC node for the protocol’s zkEVM Mainnet Beta next year. Positive News Overall, But What Now? As of writing, MATIC bulls are trying to reverse the current downward trend that the token is on. However, they might need to settle for a lower, more stable price point around $0.7550. This will provide investors and traders with a stable jump-off point for higher gains before the year’s end. From MATIC To POL But MATIC bulls should consider the current phase of the network. Last September, the Polygon dev team announced the implementation of Polygon 2.0, an upgrade that would change the network’s token from MATIC to POL. According to MATIC’s Coingecko page, the upgrade from MATIC to POL has been initiated on the Ethereum mainnet. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Scoop Up $230 Million In ETH In One Week – Price Hike Next? Once the upgrade is in full swing, investors and traders will migrate their MATIC holdings to POL. This will inevitably harm the price as more and more investors will try to take value out of MATIC before it goes to the bin.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Representatives from BlackRock (BLK), Nasdaq and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) met for the second time in a month to discuss rule changes that are necessary to list the spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to a published memo. “The discussion concerned The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC’s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d),” the memo reads. The Nasdaq rule establishes specific criteria and regulatory guidelines for the listing and trading of Commodity-Based Trust Shares on the Nasdaq Exchange, and details the requirements for initial and continued listing, along with surveillance and compliance measures to ensure market integrity and protection against fraudulent activities.  A mix of catalysts and historical behavior could catapult bitcoin (BTC) to as high as $160,000 in a widely expected bull market analysts say could take off in 2024. Expected demand for bitcoin from several spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., the forthcoming reward halving and growth in broader stock markets on the back of lower interest rates could lift bitcoin prices to at least $50,000 in the short-term, on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant said in a Wednesday report shared with CoinDesk. “We argue that bitcoin and crypto markets could have a positive year in 2024 mostly amid the effects from: 1. The market valuation cycle, 2. Network activity, 3. The bitcoin halving, 4. The macroeconomic perspective, 5. Bitcoin spot ETF approval and 6. Growing stablecoin liquidity,” CryptoQuant analysts said.  Markets shouldn't underestimate the significance of the coming spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, said MicroStrategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor in a Bloomberg TV appearance on Tuesday. ""It's not unreasonable to suggest that this might be the biggest development on Wall Street in 30 years,"" said Saylor, suggesting the last comparable new product was the S&P 500 ETF, which allowed investors one-click exposure to that widely followed index. Mainstream investors – whether at the individual or institutional level – to date have not had a ""high bandwidth"" compliant channel for putting money into bitcoin, said Saylor, and that's all about to change with the spot ETF.  Chart of the Day  Weekly trading volume on Korean crypto exchanges hit a year-to-date high.  Korean exchanges Upbit, Coinone, Bithumb and Korbit hit a yearly high of $24 billion in early December.  This is an eight-fold surge from September.  “Korean markets are dominated by altcoins, which account for more than 80% of total volume and typically see a greater increase in trading activity in a risk-on market environment,” according to Kaiko.

42409139,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcECzu,1703077200,Lido Tests of 'Distributed Validator Technology' Portend 2024 Decentralization Push,"For years, Ethereum developers have been hard at work on one of the network's gravest security risks: thousands of validators operate the second most valuable blockchain, but just a few of them have almost all of the power.  Every 12 seconds, a new block of transactions is added to Ethereum. Those blocks are added by validators, which could be companies, individuals or collectives that lock up, or ""stake,"" at least 32 ETH (currently aboout $70,000 worth) in exchange for a steady yield.  Lido, the collective that is the biggest validator on Ethereum, controls 32% of all staked ETH. If this share grows by just a couple of percentage points – creeping past the 33% threshold required to block a 67% supermajority of validators – network outages or deliberate malfeasance at Lido could have massive ramifications for Ethereum as a whole.  This vulnerability stems from the ""centralized"" nature of most validators; virtually all validators are just individual computers (or servers) loaded with one of a few popular node-running softwares. If there are bugs in the software – or if a computer falls offline – or if the person operating a big validator decides to act dishonestly – then the entire network might suffer.  Distributed validator technology, or DVT, aims to put these risks into the past. Projects that use the tech like Obol, SSV and Diva help validators spread their operations between several parties, ostensibly as a way to make validators more resilient and less subject to single points of failure.  DVT solutions have been talked about for a while, but even as some long-awaited DVT platforms are finally going live, their overall adoption remains low. By Obol's estimate, less than a single percentage point's worth of staked ETH is controlled by DVT-based validators.  In 2024, that could all change. Leaders in the DVT space are finally putting the finishing touches on their platforms, and Lido could soon transition some of its operations into the hands of distributed infrastructure.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Lido at critical threshold  The big selling point of blockchain networks is that they are ""decentralized."" Ethereum's validator system – which spreads power between parties according to how much ETH they stake – is the main way it remains resilient to outages and stays ""credibly neutral,"" meaning it's theoretically immune to the whims of companies or governments.  But just a few validators, including those run by Lido, have gradually amassed a lion's share of the power over the network.  Lido's market presence grants it a huge amount of sway over how transactions are added to the chain because validators ultimately choose which transactions are written to Ethereum and in what order.  Even more troublingly, should Lido or any other validator ever amass 33% of all staked ETH, it will have the ability to meddle with how the chain reaches consensus. If Lido goes offline or decides to attack the network once it passes this critical threshold, it could, in theory, put the brakes on all network activity.  What is disributed validator technology (DVT)?  The prospect of network attacks and unfair distribution of power have always loomed larger over Ethereum. The ecosystem has historically prided itself on operating with a relatively high degree of decentralization, and it shifted from a Bitcoin-esque mining system to its present-day staking regime in part to help further democratize control over the network.  But as certain stakers – and Lido, in particular – have amassed more and more control over the Etheruem network, DVT has been looked to as a possible saving grace.  ""It all goes back to the ethos of Ethereum,"" said Alon Muroch, founder of DVT firm SSV, which offers a network that validator operators can use to split up control over their infrastructure. ""People don't want to be dependent on a single entity. I think that ethos is very strong.""  While no two DVT solutions are exactly alike, they generally work similarly, by splitting the ""keys"" to a given validator across several different nodes. A consensus of key holders needs to sign off on decisions over how DVT validators operate, and if one key holder goes offline, others can fill in to keep things running.  A benefit to this setup is the added resiliency.  ""Today validators are single-engine planes. If a validator goes down, it's offline,"" said Brett Li, head of growth at Obol Labs, which is also building a network to distribute validators. With DVT, ""It's redundancy. You can have two engines, and if one of the engines fails, you can still get where you need to go safely.""  DVT's big year  With product launches and testnets this year from Obol, Diva, SSV and others, long-simmering hopes for a more decentralized Ethereum validator network are finally nearing production.  In November, Lido took a first step toward transitioning to DVT with the introduction of its ""Simple DVT Module."" Lido takes deposits from users and distributes them across third-party validator operators. With the new DVT module, which is being tested in partnership with Obol and SSV, Lido's third-party validators can become decentralized – blunting the ability for Lido, which ultimately controls its validators today, to exert undue pressure on them.  The ambitions for DVT operators don't end with Lido.  ""If the milestone with Lido succeeds, then it's gonna be the standard for everyone, because Lido is the biggest,"" said Muroch."" If Lido makes the move, then others will make the move.""  It could take some time for Lido to transition its validators to DVT, or for wider infrastructure operators to feel comfortable adopting the technology. Validators run by big institutions might continue to run their validators fully in-house – comfortable with the software and maintenance required to keep a validator node afloat, and reticent to adopt new tech that could impinge their flexibility.  But hobbyist ""solo-stakers"" and community-run collectives like Lido, which continue to account for a large overall proportion of all staked ETH, might soon embrace DVT as a result of its easy setup and ideological underpinnings.  ""In two or three years you'll see hopefully between a third or half of validators running on DVT,"" Muroch estimated. Obol's Li offered a similar near-term prediction, and said that in the long-run he expects ""80%"" of validators to run on DVT-based infrastructure.

The research firm emphasized a particular indicator to drive home their point and provided further insight into what the future holds if these ETFs get approved. The Derivatives Market: An Indicator Of Institutional Interest In Bitcoin In the report written by K33’s Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde and Head of Research Anders Helseth, they noted that the derivatives market was important as it can be used to gauge institutional traders’ interest in Bitcoin. In line with this, they touched on how there has been a significant increase in open interest in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) derivatives market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP 1,500% Move Against Bitcoin, What Are The Terms? The K33 report specifically noted that the CME’s open interest has grown by over 3,4000 BTC over the past week. Meanwhile, CME’s open interest remains near all-time highs of 110,000 BTC. The increased activity on the CME has resulted from these traders’ desire to gain exposure to Bitcoin ahead of the “imminent ETF verdict.” With a potential approval on the horizon, it is believed that many traders are looking to make as much profit as they can from this bullish event. Meanwhile, others have genuinely become bullish on the flagship cryptocurrency and want to gain exposure to it in any way they can. The CME is arguably the most accessible means to gain exposure to Bitcoin for this class of investors. Notably, the K33 analysts highlighted how the open interest in the CME exchange had picked up the pace back in October. Coincidentally or not, this happened to be when Bitcoin and the broader crypto market picked up steam, as many believed that the Spot Bitcoin ETF rumors were the reason for the rally. BTC price at $42,851 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com CME To Lose Market Share Once ETFs Get Approved NewsBTC had in November reported how CME had overtaken Binance in Bitcoin futures. Data from Coinglass also shows that the CME is still well ahead in terms of Bitcoin futures open interest. However, that could change soon enough as the K33 report touched on the possibility of open interest in CME collapsing once these Spot Bitcoin ETFs get approved. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Falling Wedge Pattern Appears, How Low Can Price Go? An approval can cause selling pressure on CME as these institutional investors might look to take profit while others will be looking to transfer their capital to the Spot ETFs. K33 elaborated on the latter. The report noted that futures-based ETFs currently account for 46% of the CME’s open interest. Considering that futures and Spot ETFs will be in direct competition, they expect the latter to become the more favorable option. As such, these K33 analysts foresee a decline in the open interest, which these futures ETFs account for. They project that many institutional investors will look to rotate a substantial portion of their capital to the Spot ETFs. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $42,800, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

21622762,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566114,1703071836,Nansen’s Crypto Crystal Ball: AI Integration And A Potential Plot Twist In 2024?,"As 2024 approaches, crypto analytics firm Nansen offers insightful predictions for the crypto sector, anticipating significant developments and shifts. Despite cautious optimism, they acknowledge a 10-20% chance of inflation resurgence after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) pivot, potentially impacting crypto prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Close Below $2,120 Could Spark Larger Degree Decline As of this writing, the total crypto market capitalization is $1.5 trillion on the daily chart and seems poised for further upside in the long run. Crypto total market capitalization trends to the upside on the daily chart as the year ends. Source: TOTAL on Tradingview AI As Primary Use Case: The New Hot Thing In 2024? According to the firm, a key high-conviction bet for 2024 is the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents as primary blockchain users. Integrating AI and blockchain is expected to “advance rapidly, enhancing blockchain performance and broadening use cases.” This development signifies a crucial step in the blockchain world, potentially transforming how transactions and interactions are processed on the network. Another focus area is the intent-centric applications that address user experience (UX) challenges in the crypto space. These applications are designed to simplify user interactions with networks, removing complexities and making the technology more accessible to a broader audience. As seen in the chart below, the integration between AI and crypto is already paying off for early investors. Despite the persistent downside pressure recorded across the board, the AI tokens sector has been among the best-performing in the nascent industry. 2024 is also projected to be a pivotal year for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Nansen forecasts that DEXs will gain significant market share from centralized exchanges (CEXs), driven by monetary incentives and innovative features. This shift could mark a fundamental change in the crypto trading landscape, emphasizing the growing importance of decentralized financial systems. Since 2020 and 2021, DEX has been gaining ground over CEX, and the trend might favor the former in 2024. Finally, Nansen believes that the largest and most trusted cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is expected to secure a broader range of use cases beyond simple transactions. This expansion could open new avenues for Bitcoin and highlight its versatility and robustness as a digital asset. Use cases such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) already gained popularity in 2023, and this trend might continue. However, some Bitcoin community members are fighting the change, which could hinder its adoption and implementation. Nansen: Market Scenario Analysis For 2024 The potential scenarios for the crypto market in 2024 depend a lot on the macroeconomic situation. In a “soft landing” situation, where inflation slows without drastically increasing unemployment, crypto prices are expected to grow steadily. However, there’s also the possibility of a re-acceleration of inflation or a recession, which would pose challenges for crypto prices and change the bullish narrative. Nansen’s analysis also acknowledges structural drivers likely to influence the crypto market, such as the statistical boost around Bitcoin’s halving. These structural drivers also include the adoption of blockchain by major traditional players and regulatory clarity, particularly around a BTC spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US. However, unknowns like geopolitical events and macroeconomic shifts could significantly impact the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rejects $43.5K, Why BTC Could Tumble In Short-Term In conclusion, Nansen’s research presents a nuanced view of the crypto market in 2024, highlighting potential growth areas like AI integration and DEXs while remaining aware of the challenges ahead. The year promises to be crucial for the crypto sector, with significant developments expected in technology integration, market structures, and regulatory landscapes.

Significance Of Shiba Inu’s Partnership With D3 Global The team revealed its partnership with the internet domain name company in its latest version of the SHIB magazine. The latest magazine is now the seventh version that has been released since it was introduced. D3 Global is a domain company that focuses on bridging the gaps between the web2 and web3 ecosystem which is overseen by Fred Hsu and Shayan Rostam. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Unveils Enhanced SHIB And BONE Burns, What This Means Rostam asserted that partnering with Shiba Inu will allow the introduction of unique, memorable, and affordable domain names to users. Additionally, it will make use of Web3 utility on the internet’s base layer to streamline their digital identities. The latest partnership is a part of Shiba Inu’s broader endeavor toward a decentralized identification project. Shiba Inu is seeking to establish a decentralized internet top-level domain (TLD) name for its users. The collaboration aims to safeguard the “.shib” TLD name. A TLD is the last element of a web address that appears after the dot such as “.com,” “.org,” or “.net.” The TLD will enable SHIB users to register their .shib names which may be resolved through the global Domain Name System (DNS). It will also allow its users to have a digital identity compatible with Web2 and Web3 applications. The “.shib” domain seeks to offer seamless compatibility with both the traditional Web3 technologies and the modern internet’s Domain Name System (DNS). This is unlike the current web3 names which are incompatible natively with essential internet technologies like email and web browsers. With this initiative, SHIB users may have more functionality and be able to utilize their domain with regular web browsers. Additionally, it could also improve their blockchain transactions and digital identity. Process Of Acquiring A New TLD Being a major player in the internet domain industry, D3 is an expert in the administration and use of top-level domains. Their specialty is maneuvering through the difficult procedure of obtaining and configuring new TLDs. The procedure of getting a TLD is not that simple or quick. It needs to be approved by ICANN, which is the result of a difficult and extensive application procedure. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Faces Make Or A Point As Analyst Identifies Critical Trading Pattern In addition, the community must be involved and supportive of the initiative. This is because ICANN takes the public interest and possible effects of a new TLD into account. Despite the notable partnership, the SHIB token is still down by over 2% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.000010. Its market capitalization is down by over 2%, while its trading volume is down by over 30%, according to CoinMarketCap. So far, the lead developer of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama has expressed the team’s pleasure in the collaboration. “We are extremely proud to once again trailblaze decentralization in world history,” Kusama stated.

The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), whose members regulate over 95% of the world's securities markets, published its policy recommendations for decentralized finance (DeFi) on Tuesday, just a month after it published recommendations for regulating crypto markets.  Regulators have struggled to tackle DeFi, which, in theory, lacks a central body that could be subject to supervision. But IOSCO, in a September report, told governments to find out who's responsible for innovative financial applications and regulate them as they would traditional finance.  ""Given the similar economic functions and activities of DeFi and traditional financial markets, many existing international policies, standards, and jurisdictional regulatory frameworks are applicable to those DeFi activities and those mechanisms that govern them,"" the regulator said.  In cases where existing rules don't apply, they should be modified to do so, IOSCO said. The guidance on DeFI covers how to identify the people responsible, how to set clear disclosure requirements and how to enforce laws.  Responsible persons include anyone ""exercising control or sufficient influence over a financial product offered, financial service provided, or financial activity engaged in (or over products, services, and activities that behave like, or have been substituted by investors for, financial products, services, and activities) by the DeFi arrangement.""  Therefore, operating as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) rather than incorporating does not ""abdicate these persons and entities of their regulatory responsibilities,"" IOSCO said.

42409168,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEJsR,1703063938,"Bitcoin Could Reach $160K in 2024 on the Back of Halving, Spot ETF Hype: Analysts","A slurry of catalysts and historical behavior could catapult bitcoin [BTC] to as high as $160,000 in a widely expected bull market that analysts say could be underway in 2024.  Expected demand for bitcoin from several spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S., the upcoming halving and growth in broader stock markets on the back of rates cut could buoy bitcoin prices to at least $50,000 in the short-term, on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant said in a Wednesday report shared with CoinDesk.  “We argue that bitcoin and crypto markets could have a positive year in 2024 mostly amid the effects from: 1. The market valuation cycle, 2. Network activity, 3. The bitcoin halving, 4. The macroeconomic perspective, 5. Bitcoin spot ETF approval and 6. Growing stablecoin liquidity,” analysts at CryptoQuant said.  “On-chain valuation and network metrics signal bitcoin remains well inside a bull market and may be targeting $54,000 in the medium term and $160,000 as this cycle price top,” they said.  Bitcoin has historically rallied after its halving event – which automatically decreases the supply of new coins in the open market – and traders are likely pricing in the event that’s next scheduled for April 2024.  Meanwhile, over seven major traditional finance players, such as BlackRock (BLK) and VanEck, are in talks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot bitcoin ETFs – and a constant back-and-forth is likely signaling the talks are proceeding positively.  Prominent bitcoin holders say the development is likely one of the biggest developments in Wall Street in “30 years.”  “It’s not unreasonable to suggest that this might be the biggest development on Wall Street in 30 years,"" said Michael Saylor in a CNBC interview on Tuesday, suggesting the last comparable new product was the S&P 500 ETF, which allowed investors one-click exposure to that widely-followed index. Saylor’s business software company MicroStrategy is the largest public holder of bitcoin, with over $8 billion worth of the asset in its treasury.  Traders also expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in 2024 as inflation has continued to decline – and lower rates have historically been conducive to large bets on riskier assets such as technology stocks and cryptocurrencies.  However, prices could still slide in the short term as recent investors sit on large unrealized gains, CrytpoQuant warned in its report.  “There are some risks of a price correction given that short-term bitcoin holders are experiencing high unrealized profit margins, which historically have preceded price corrections,” the analysts said.  Bitcoin has rallied over 180% on a year-to-date basis – which could create a possible bearish scenario ahead of the New Year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/20/bitcoin-could-reach-160k-in-2024-on-the-back-of-halving-spot-etf-hype-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd3a722c6d6899caf203ce53f6d0a71d41a4dfcb-4107x2728.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409165,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEJlp,1703061056,Trader Turns $450 into $2M Betting on Avalanche Meme Coin Coq Inu,"Multifold gains on Solana-based meme coins have apparently led traders to hunt for small-cap plays on other networks – with some lucky enough to flip a tiny initial capital to a life-changing figure.  And while dog-themed tokens have usually created outsized gains for meme coin traders, Avalanche’s Coq Inu (COQ), a hen-themed token, is leading the narrative on the blockchain. Data shows the token was issued on Dec.8 and has since surged to a $230 million capitalization as of Wednesday, creating wild profits for early buyers.  The token is “for entertainment purposes only,” a fact the developers aren’t shying away from: “$COQ is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap,” the site reads.  “The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.”  A single trader apparently acquired just over $450 worth of COQ shortly after its issuance and the amount has since ballooned to over $2.5 million, on-chain data cited by Lookonchain shows. The wallet has seemingly sold over $1.5 million worth of COQ so far and sits on over $800,000 in unrealized gains.  Meme tokens derive their appeal from the virality of a popular existing meme or the attention their communities generate in online circles. Most of these tokens fail, but the ones that stick may turn into billion-dollar projects, after which their developers may introduce more fundamental utility to support further growth.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on a blockchain, such as Ethereum or others, for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  COQ has been Avalanche’s shining star in recent weeks. Data shows the tokens have over 30,000 unique holders as of Tuesday, and saw $30 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/20/trader-turns-450-into-2m-betting-on-avalanche-meme-coin-coq-inu,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d3133a47bce630a35e74fe1876541e5a83433ae-1280x846.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Given this, it is critical to pay strategic attention to tokens such as Woo Network (WOO), which present chances for short- and long-term trading in the dynamic crypto environment. The cryptocurrency market is in a positive mood as the new week begins, following a time of increased volatility in the first half of December. The two most popular cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin, have shown signs of stability during the last 48 hours. Woo Network Explodes 75% In The Last Week Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Scoop Up $230 Million In ETH In One Week – Price Hike Next? The WOO token, which is part of the Woo Network liquidity protocol, has been rising recently after fluctuating earlier. According to data from Coingecko, WOO was trading at $0.45 at the time of writing, up over 2% in the previous day and maintaining a strong 75.0% increase over the previous seven days. Source: Coingecko A contributing element to the cryptocurrency’s recent price increase was the WooFi exchange, which attracted attention from possible investors after announcing a partnership with Arbitrum. The cryptocurrency exchange WOO X, which runs on the WOO token, announced this week that it will be partnering with Wintermute to increase liquidity. With a combined trading volume of about $3.6 trillion, Wintermute is an algorithmic trading company and liquidity provider. Thanks to its partnership with WOO X, it now serves as the primary liquidity provider for the exchange. WOO market cap currently at $812 million. Chart: TradingView.com Another market maker, Selini Capital, joined WOO X in order to extend its designated market maker (DMM) program and gain access to over 135 perpetual markets. When WOO debuted on the open market in late 2020, its value was approximately $0.03. Woo Network surged ahead of the market in early 2021, breaking through the dollar in April and hitting a one-time high of $1.34 on May 9. The price of WOO token has recovered after suffering a significant drop over the weekend. Over the weekend, it dropped to a low of $0.35, but it rose to a high of $0.42 following that. WOO continues to be higher above the 50-period moving average. Woo Network Price Prediction Additionally, it appears to be creating a double-top pattern, with the upper side located at $0.4578. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is heading toward the 70 overbought level after making an upward trend. As a result, investors are aiming for the double-top point at $0.4578, which is around 15% above the current price, which indicates a bullish view for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: What’s Helium Mobile And Why Is It Exploding To Over 800%? The Woo Network short-term price projection for 2023 by CoinCodex shows that the token will fall to $0.411 by December 24 and rise to $0.4881 by January 18. The technical analysis on the website was bullish, with 24 indications indicating a bullish trend and only four indicating a bearish trend. According to DigitalCoinPrice, Woo Network will trade at $1.19 at some time in the upcoming year. PricePrediction.net and Bitnation, on the other hand, were more conservative and predicted that WOO would be worth $0.58 and $1.18 in 2024, respectively.

BTC failed and corrected lower to test the $41,800 support zone. Bitcoin is correcting gains from the $43,500 resistance zone. The price is trading above $42,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $42,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if there is a move below the $41,650 support. Bitcoin Price Drops Again Bitcoin price gained pace above the $42,000 resistance zone. BTC even climbed above the $43,000 level, but it faced a strong rejection near $43,500. It seems like the price failed again to clear the $43,500 zone. A high was formed near $43,464 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $42,800 and $42,500 support levels. The price even spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $40,514 swing low to the $43,464 high. Bitcoin found support near the $41,800 level. It is now trading above $42,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The price is also stable above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $40,514 swing low to the $43,464 high. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $42,600 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $42,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The first major resistance is forming near $43,000. The main resistance is still near the $43,500 zone. A close above the $43,500 resistance might start a steady increase. The next key resistance could be near $44,500, above which BTC could rise toward the $45,000 level. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $42,650 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $42,000 level. The next major support is near $41,650. If there is a move below $41,650, there is a risk of more losses. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $40,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now near the 50 level.

21610384,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566063,1703041203,SEI Token Rocks Altcoin Market With 50% Surge: What’s Driving The Momentum?,"Turning the tide in the altcoin race, Sei Network’s SEI token has experienced an extraordinary 50% surge in the last 24 hours, outperforming the top 100 cryptocurrencies. This surge has pushed the token’s current trading price to $0.3638. Attracting Global Attention? According to CoinGecko data, Sei Network’s blockchain, explicitly built for trading, has optimized every layer of its stack to provide infrastructure for trading apps of all types. Sei claims to outperform other Layer 1 blockchain, such as Solana and Aptos, by offering a native order-matching engine in Layer 1. This engine enables exchange apps built on top to scale more efficiently than ever. One of the standout features of the protocol is its speed, with a lower bound time to the finality of 300ms, making it the fastest chain in existence. This speed is achieved by implementing the Twin Turbo consensus, consisting of intelligent block propagation and optimistic block processing. According to CoinGecko, these innovations reduce the time required to achieve consensus securely and reliably. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP 1,500% Move Against Bitcoin, What Are The Terms? Moreover, Sei’s market-based parallelization sets it apart by offering a specialized kind of parallelization that differs from other leading blockchains. Additionally, Sei implements order batching to prevent frontrunning, enhancing the fairness and efficiency of its trading ecosystem. On the other hand, the Sei blockchain, launched on August 16, has amassed a market cap exceeding $380 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $1 billion. Notably, the blockchain has witnessed a surge in new user registrations, with over 40,000 new users joining in the past two days. This influx of new users has further propelled the token’s market cap and trading volume, underscoring the growing interest in the Sei blockchain. Sei v2 Proposes Seamless EVM Integration Sei Labs co-founder Jayendra Jog recently unveiled the first “parallelized” Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), combining the aspects of Solana and Ethereum. According to Jayendra, this “hyper-optimized” execution layer leverages the tooling and mindshare surrounding the EVM, addressing a major pain point for developers. As announced, Sei v2 introduces EVM support by integrating go-ethereum and enabling seamless deployment of contracts from other EVM chains. This compatibility allows developers to leverage existing Ethereum-based tooling and resources without additional effort. Furthermore, optimistic parallelization eliminates the need for developers to define dependencies explicitly, enabling the chain to handle parallelization autonomously. This enhancement reduces developer friction and guarantees maximum parallelization of transactions whenever possible. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Falling Wedge Pattern Appears, How Low Can Price Go? Sei Labs’ co-founder stated that Sei v2 boasts orders of magnitude greater throughput with Sei’s speed than Ethereum’s Layer 1 or Layer 2 solutions. The protocol’s upper bound of 12.5k transactions per second (TPS) is supported by early load tests, which have already observed over 5k TPS. Sei v2 will launch on a public testnet in the first quarter 2024. As Sei Network continues to garner attention from developers and traders alike, the future looks promising for this open-source Layer 1 blockchain.

The discount on Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust has narrowed to around 10%, making it less attractive for obtaining Bitcoin exposure compared to other options. Grayscale aims to convert the fund into an ETF, which is expected to eliminate the discount and result in an 11% upside, offset by an annual management fee of 2%. Grayscale Investments won a landmark court case ( see here ) with the result being the SEC must vacate its rejection of Grayscale's attempt to convert Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) into an ETF or exchange-traded fund. The process of ETF's being submitted to the SEC is one that's widely publicized. I've been anticipating this would ultimately happen since the end of 22' and this closed-end fund offered Bitcoin exposure at a 40% discount. Currently, the discount has narrowed to ~10%. Data by YCharts Even though I primarily bought the Grayscale fund, end of 22"", to capture the monster discount, I've also used it as a preferred way to obtain Bitcoin exposure. We're getting to a discount level where I've decided to get Bitcoin beta somewhere else (I wrote up one example here ) and use the Grayscale position only to capture the juicy arbitrage. I am bullish on Bitcoin and think the by-now much-publicized ETF tailwind and halving event are real tailwinds. A 10% discount isn't terrible, but I think there are better ways to get Bitcoin exposure because 1) there are other options where Bitcoin is still more heavily discounted and 2) the GBTC fund is fully margined, which is very inefficient if you can otherwise put that space to good use. I don't necessarily use a lot of net leverage but I do tend to use quite a bit of gross leverage. For example, when I go long a fixed-income closed-end fund and short a fixed-income ETF against that to capture a discount. Grayscale wants to convert this fund as soon as possible to get to market as one of the first spot ETFs. There is something of a race going on with various firms like Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale (among others) all trying to launch ETFs. When the fund converts, the discount should disappear and this will result in roughly 11% worth of upside. This is partly offset by the annualized management fee of around 2%. The SEC's hand is forced by the court verdict and the regulator seems, judging by the newsflow around meetings, to be working constructively to get an ETF over the line. It is expected this will happen in the first half of January of 2024. Given 1) the assets in the fund can be almost perfectly hedged and 2) the upcoming catalyst seems near-inevitable as well as imminent at this point, at a 10% discount this still seems like a steal. I expected the discount to have narrowed to 3-5% by now. I do think it is now very favorable to hedge out the underlying Bitcoin exposure. It allows me to pick up ~11% while effectively committing no net capital. I can go long GBTC and short between 100%-110% of the long position through BITO. This nets out to zero or close to it in Bitcoin market exposure. It depends on the exact hedging ratio you choose. By mid-January the position should have returned 10% vs the long position. In closed-end fund arbitrage, it is usually very hard to hedge the underlying in a very clean way. Sometimes the underlying consists of hundreds of positions, sometimes you don't know every holding, and usually, the portfolio you're working with is based on stale data. In this case, it is remarkably easy which makes this a surprisingly good opportunity. Meanwhile, if you hold on here unhedged, the underlying volatility may dwarf the 10% return we're targeting with the arbitrage. Perhaps the underlying moves 24% up or 22% down. It wouldn't really surprise me. With little time left on the clock, there is not a lot of time for mean reversion if there's an unusually big move. The 10% is an enormous tailwind even for Bitcoin, but at the end of the day, I prefer the hedged return from this vehicle. The Bitcoin beta I'll get another way.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4658760-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-switching-hedged-position?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21609916.jpeg

This phenomenon has caught the attention of industry experts and investors alike, leading to a deeper examination of the factors driving this trend. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has weighed in on this topic, addressing the liquidity aspects of XRP and XLM. However, despite the visible correlation, Schwartz argues that more liquidity is needed in the XRP/XLM market to cause a notable price correlation.

Here’s XRP versus XLM over the past year: pic.twitter.com/qNzfIu2TTB — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 18, 2023 Unraveling The Factors Behind XRP And XLM’s Correlated Price Movements David Schwartz has identified three key factors influencing the XRP-XLM price correlation. Firstly, he posits that the entire digital asset market is significantly interconnected. The market is still determining cryptocurrencies’ long-term viability, so industry news tends to affect all tokens, not just specific ones. This broader market sentiment could drive the correlation observed in XRP and XLM. Secondly, Schwartz suggests that the dominance of Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market could play a role. Given Bitcoin’s substantial market share and its influence on liquidity within the crypto space, movements in Bitcoin’s price often result in ripple effects across other crypto, including XRP and XLM. I think there are a variety of factors that might be at play and it’s hard to know which are real. One thing is that all digital assets track each other significantly. I think that’s because the market is still trying to figure out if they’re going to be a thing and so industry… — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 18, 2023 The third factor revolves around the crypto community’s perception that XRP and XLM require similar market conditions to thrive. However, Schwartz noted that he is “not sure if he believes this.” Developments within the broader crypto industry could prompt parallel reactions from users of both tokens, leading to correlated price patterns. Diverse Perspectives: From Short-Term Volatility To Long-Term Convictions On the other hand, Bill Morgan, a lawyer and digital asset enthusiast, brings a different viewpoint, mainly focusing on XRPL token. Addressing recent market volatility, Morgan emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective when analyzing XRP’s price action. Responding to crypto community concerns about XRP’s performance, especially during heightened market movements, Morgan argues that convictions about the token should go “beyond short-term price fluctuations.” Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $22, Here’s When Morgan’s stance is echoed by Matt, the Moon Lambo YouTube channel host, who points out that XRP’s price drop was not as severe as some in the crypto community perceived.

This is correct but placed in the context of XRP’s price action over the last month it is not great. XRP is down over 2% over the last month. Many but not all top 50 coins are up over the last month.

The regulatory situation in the crypto space has not deterred BTC's strong ascent. Technical analysis suggests that BTC could reach $100k or even $140k, with corrective pullbacks seen as buying opportunities. In a word, higher. Our tentative expectations for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for 2024 are quite bullish. That may surprise readers after BTC has gained 145% YTD (as of writing this article) and as much as up 189% from its 2022 low at the recent peak in early December. The current sentiment in the short run may be a bit overheated, which could provide 20-30% pullback, but our overall expectations are to see much higher prices in 2024–with a note of caution for the bullish case, on which I’ll elaborate in this article. Our bigger perspective has been bullish up from the 2022 low, and though last year’s drop took us off the immediate “Moonpath” from 2021, the impulsive bounce from $15.5k has re-affirmed the cautiously bullish tone that we’ve maintained. Though the crypto space continues to wade through an unfriendly regulatory situation with several “after-the-fact” actions from SEC on the heels of missing Terra/LUNA, Celsius, Voyager, and of course FTX, BTC has been undeterred this year in its strong ascent higher. The second half of 2023’s News items “du jour” regards the prospect of approval for a Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. As our approach is primarily technical, our analysis avoids making forecasts that are contingent upon regulatory approval. This is a fancy way of saying that for anything beyond the very short term, my outlook is unconcerned with the outcome of Blackrock’s bid to get their spot-Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC. Failing to get approval may shake out some newer buyers, but on the other hand, approval could be very bullish for providing a conduit for a bunch of new capital to flow into Bitcoin. In this sense, I suspect approval makes a nice narrative for Bitcoin going higher but the chart shows us this as the more likely outcome without needing to predict the SEC’s actions. Bitcoin is very “pure” in this sense for Elliott Wave analysis, as it does not have any clear consensus of fundamental valuations models like equities do and is much more clearly fluctuating on sentiment. Lyn Alden has written several articles–and a recent book called Broken Money–that make a strong fundamental argument for Bitcoin being structurally undervalued. This analysis, which as well is similarly uncensored with shorter term price fluctuations, dovetails with our perspective of seeing much higher prices in the coming years. Let’s take a look at the current technical stance to understand where we see potential advantageous opportunities to add exposure and what kind of price action may change our stance to be more bearish for the 2024 outlook. From the early August update we noted that “we tentatively considered the uptrend intact from the 2018 low, and while the November 2022 low briefly broke beneath ideal support, that its strong rebound and continuation higher in 2023 constitutes an overall successful test of support.” That idea, “a successful test of [longer term] support” seems even more true with Bitcoin’s resounding breakout above its May 2022 - July 2023 resistance region in the $31k-$32.5k zone. Though this rally up from the September completion to the flat correction has extended a bit past the ideal extension zone for a wave i of 3, this is both A) somewhat characteristic for Bitcoin’s movement within Elliott Wave counts, and B) favorable for providing confluence with larger degree targets for the wave (5). Typically within an impulsive pattern, like the one that Bitcoin has formed from the 2022 low, expectations are for price to reach the 2.0 extension of waves 1-2 and in this case, that occurs right around $100k which we’ve discussed as a minimal target for this rally from the 2018 low for years now. However, $140k is a more ideal target, and in order to reach that level, Bitcoin will need some extensions beyond the standard targets. As such, a bigger wave i of 3 is not something that in and of itself should be of any concern yet. What’s desirable from the current stance for the bullish case, is for price to maintain without any breaks below technical support. Based on the bullish count presented in black labels on the accompanying chart, Bitcoin is starting wave ii of 3 within this 1-2, i-ii setup. Without going into great detail about all of the different types of setups, I’ll say briefly that 1-2, i-ii setups offer the best expected value entries in that they have a higher likelihood of follow through in the direction of the trend and they offer very outsized risk-to-reward skew opportunities. Fibonacci support is in the $29.4k-$35.3k region. Bitcoin has had extraordinarily strong price action since the September 2023 low with short and shallow pullbacks. I have no guidance on whether the current pullback from the December high will be similarly “disappointing” to buyers who are “squeezing” for a deal. However, I will say that I see corrective pullbacks as favorable buying opportunities with perhaps the $31k-$33k region as the most favorable area as a retest of the breakout threshold. Within the current setup, a break below $29k would be the first area of concern of a prospective failure to follow through (to the upside) and a sustained break below $26.5k will favor a break below the September low. Should such price action occur in the coming weeks, it would be very concerning about a prospective retest of the 2022 lows with a possible breakdown to $10k. However, assuming support holds, the bigger test is the $50k-$59k region. Assuming BTC ascends to $50k+ in the coming months, in order to maintain a more confident bullish outlook about a rally to $100k+ it's necessary for price to keep from making any sustained breaks below $38k on any subsequent pullbacks. If Bitcoin were to fail from $50k and then break below $38k, it warrants concern about my alternative “bearish” thesis (shown in purple) which addresses the lower probability potential for a retest of 2022 (or lower) without reaching the upside targets: $100k+. All of the above two paragraph’s bearish conjecture aside, our expectations are for prospective tests of the noted $29.4k-$35.3k region to be successful and to send Bitcoin to much higher levels. Ideally, wave iii of 3 would target around the former all-time high at which point we would like to see a “floor” around the $50k region, which should support subsequent bounces to prices upwards of $100k.

While some have expressed concerns about network congestion, Hoskinson affirmed that Cardano is designed to handle such loads and has ample room for future scalability. Demand Increasing, Cardano Moving Away From “Ghost Chain” Status In a post garnering significant attention on X, the founder said he has been watching with ” glee as some people worry about Cardano’s blocks filling up.” The founder reminded the community that it was only a few months earlier that the network had been slammed for being a “ghost chain” with no utility. However, as the network “gets busy” and blocks fill up, Hoskinson assured the community that the platform is designed to handle rising demand with more room to grow in the future. While Cardano aims to compete with Ethereum as a smart contract platform of choice, its development is anchored on peer research, and progress has been systematic. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP 1,500% Move Against Bitcoin, What Are The Terms? Looking at block explorer data from Cexplorer, the average block saturation of Cardano stands at 56.98% as of December 18. This figure is higher than the monthly average of 44.5%. However, what’s clear is that block size has been gradually rising over the past two years. As of early 2021, the average block usage, measuring capacity, was 64kb. This figure now stands at 88kb, signaling growth and more adoption from app developers. However, it should be noted that the maximum capacity in Cardano is an adjustable parameter. Accordingly, it can be changed in light of transactional demand. Cardano Refinements: Will ADA Prices Boom Like Bitcoin? Cardano is in the Basho stage after graduating from Goguen when the network activated smart contracts. With more dapps launching, the platform is optimizing to enhance performance and boost scalability. Scalability is a big concern in blockchains since it can directly determine how fast transactions are processed, a factor that also plays a big role in determining fees. Even so, unlike Ethereum, fees are stable in Cardano, regardless of network load. Related Reading: Santiment Breaks Down “Most Trending” Altcoins Of Past Week Hoskinson also highlighted Cardano’s organic growth in the post on X, attributing its success to the community’s involvement and engagement. The founder emphasized that venture capitalists, the crypto media, or influencers are not driving the platform, just like how Bitcoin grows. This comparison could aim salvo at other smart contract competitors, including Solana. The FTX estate controlled a significant portion of SOL’s circulating supply. The defunct exchange will gradually sell SOL to repay creditors. Even so, whether ADA will follow the same trajectory as BTC in the long run remains to be seen.
