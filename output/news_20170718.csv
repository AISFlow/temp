42400171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrWA,1500410115,Will Miners Signal? Bitcoin's Next Segwit2x Lock-in Period Starts Today,"Should certain timelines be met, bitcoin could soon be upgraded to support Segregated Witness (SegWit).  A long-proposed upgrade that would increase the transaction capacity of the bitcoin network, SegWit would be triggered if miners decide to support the BIP 91 code proposal, itself a part of the larger Segwit2x scaling initiative.  Currently, BIP 91 is close to the necessary threshold (80% of mining power), with mining pools representing about 76% of bitcoin's computing power seemingly making good on a promise to support the proposal.  That percentage of mining pools, though, must signal in a type of unison, during a signaling period.  Due to how the BIP 91 code is written, the 80% threshold must be reached within a 336-block period. But it's not just any consecutive 336-block period.  Instead, there are set windows where miners can signal support, meaning 269 of the consecutive 336 blocks within the period must signal with ""bit 4"" in the block header.  The next signaling period starts tonight at block 476,448, and will end at block 476,784, about two-and-a-half days from now.  If 80% of mining pools don't activate SegWit in the period that starts tonight, they'll have other opportunities before August 1 when another scaling proposal BIP 148 will activate. Although, this could lead bitcoin down a few different paths, as CoinDesk's visual guide to the scaling debate demonstrates.

Chowdary said:  ""We are keen on integrating blockchain technology into governance and look forward to our collaboration with Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and provide market access to the community.""  The state of Andhra Pradesh, perhaps best known for its capital, Hyderabad, is only the second government to join the EEA, following the State of Illinois, which joined in May.  Other new members include Antibiotic Research UK, the Technical University of Munich and Ypse IT Solutions. Blockchain startup Bloq is also included on the list, but was previously reported by CoinDesk as having joined the initiative.  Still, today's announcement brings the EEA's total membership to 150 organizations, all of which have joined the consortium since its launch this February.

42400163,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrQG,1500394530,Korean Lawmaker Calls for Consumer Protection in Cryptocurrency Bill,"South Korea's national legislature was the site of a public hearing on Tuesday in which recently proposed cryptocurrency regulation saw new discussion.  According to local media reports, Korean lawmaker Park Yong-jin used the forum, over which he presided, to call for consumer protections to be added to the bill. Aimed at laying the groundwork for regulation in South Korea, the public hearing comes two weeks after Park first unveiled the plan, which would capture cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.  Panelists in the hearing includes lawyers, professors, an official from South Korea's top financial regulator (the Financial Services Commission), as well as a victim of a cryptocurrency-related Ponzi scam.  As such, much of the focus of the talk was on strengthening consumer protections for industry startups and technologists.  Park, in particular, voiced concerns that trader protection is a difficult task without a legal basis, stating:  ""Without a legal framework, we can neither regulate, nurture, nor support the cryptocurrency-related industries. Also, the legal vacuum prevents those who committed virtual currency-related crimes from being punished.""  Still, there were positive remarks as well. Jung Sun-seop, a professor of law at Seoul National University and director of its Center for Financial Law, argued that the law should legalize cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.  Lee Dae-ki, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Finance, argued that the trading and brokering of cryptocurrency should be regulated prior to the currency itself, due to their potential for criminal abuse.  Likewise, Chae Won-hee, a representative of a group of Ponzi scheme victims, said the punishment on cryptocurrency-related criminals should be toughened to prevent financial scams.  Kim Yeon-june, representing the FSC, said the government had yet to decide whether a cryptocurrency should be brought under financial regulations.

42400173,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrZ7,1500387354,What Could Happen to Bitcoin? A Visual Guide to Scaling Outcomes,"BIP 148, BIP 141, BIP 91 ...  A number of bitcoin improvement proposals (all aimed at boosting the cryptocurrency’s transaction capacity) are set to come to a head in the coming weeks, ending either in a smooth upgrade, a potentially difficult split, or maybe, simply status quo.  While it looks likely that at least one will go into effect, it's not clear which proposal (or proposals) will trigger, meaning, for now, we're left tracking how much support each proposal will actually get – and when.  In separate guides, we've covered the two main proposals, SegWit2x and BIP 148, as well as how BIP 91 looks to moderate between them.  Still, understanding how the proposals interact can be difficult.  Today, 76% of bitcoin's mining hashrate is signaling for BIP 91. So, it looks like it could go through. But, if it doesn’t reach the necessary threshold of 80% for a period of 336 blocks by August 1, then BIP 148 will kick in, setting off a slew of ifs and whens.  To help you navigate, we've put together the following timeline to show the many ways the summer's scaling drama could unravel:  SegWit2x (BTC1): Backed by miners and startups, this proposal seeks to enact SegWit via a soft fork, while committing to a block-size increase by hard fork three months later.  Segregated Witness (SegWit): Proposed by volunteers of Bitcoin Core in 2015, SegWit is aimed to increase network capacity and solve transaction malleability via a soft fork. BIP 141, its proposal, requires a super-majority (95%) of miners to signal for the upgrade over two weeks.  BIP 91: Created by BitmainWarranty engineer James Hilliard, BIP 91 looks to lock-in SegWit2x's SegWit update before August 1, making the proposal compatible with BIP 148. BIP 91 requires 80% of bitcoin’s miners to signal support for a lock-in and a shorter signaling period than BIP141.  BIP 148: Uses an older mechanism for making changes to bitcoin, called a user-activated soft fork (UASF). It requires about 50% of mining pools to support the change. Without that support, BIP 148 could activate and split the network into two competing blockchains.  Bitcoin ABC: A version of the bitcoin client that erases SegWit and enables a dynamic block size. It was first proposed in reaction to the idea of a UASF, which has some opposition in parts the industry. If bitcoin splits because of UASF BIP 148, the Bitcoin ABC client will launch on another chain.

42400177,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrc4,1500379214,Daimler's €100 Million Ethereum Bond Is Bigger Than Mercedes-Benz,"When the manufacturing company behind Mercedes-Benz issued its first blockchain bond last month, it did something that impacts much more than just a single automobile brand.  As revealed to CoinDesk, the €100m bond, issued on a private version of the ethereum blockchain signals the first step in a much larger plan by Daimler AG to explore the technology. But it's the type of bond – called a Schuldschein – that gives the project a truly global scale.  Since the financial crisis of 2008, this German version of a private placement has seen an explosion of use around the world, now totaling more than €20bn annually.  But while Daimler itself says large-scale use of an ethereum-based Schuldschein isn't likely anytime in the near future, its success is already encouraging the German firm to test even more use cases.  According to Daimler AG's senior manager of treasury process management, Eva-Marie Scholz, multiple business departments in the firm are now exploring use cases as a result.  Scholz told CoinDesk:  ""It was definitely not disappointing. [Reflecting on] the process, we are able to review the potential of blockchain to make real business model changes for overall capital markets and banking transactions.""  More specifically, the Schuldschein is a way for corporations to borrow money from a small group of private investors with only minimal disclosure and regulatory requirements, typically for between 3–10 years and in amounts as high as €500m.  For Daimler’s first blockchain-based bond, which was designed to simplify the lending process, the automaker partnered with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) to sell a relatively short-term one-year bond to savings banks Esslingen-Nürtingen, Ludwigsburg and Ostalb.  But for a firm that generated €153bn in revenue last year, the bond signals just a drop in the bucket of the total number of Schuldscheins sold in a typical year.  ""Daimler issues around 50 to 70 bonds annually,"" said Orhan Oezcelik from Daimler's capital markets division. ""While we don't expect blockchain to impact the total volume of issuances, the technology could allow a greater number of transactions which would then be smaller in size.""  Streamlined Schuldscheins  While Scholz said the single test wasn't enough to determine the efficiencies gained from ethereum-based bond issuance, there's plenty room for improvement on the standard process.  In March 2016, German bank NORD/LB co-published a fixed income research reporthttps://www.nordlb.com/fileadmin/redaktion_en/analysen_prognosen/public_issuers/specials/2016/20160318_SSDSpecialFinaleng.pdf along with Bloomberg-Kurzel laying out the legal framework and spreads for a Schuldschein bond.  In spite of being widely considered a streamlined version of borrowing, a typical Schuldschein transaction still requires 20 pages of documentation and takes as long as 14 weeks to close, not counting ongoing administrative services.  In spite of the already simplified regulatory requirements typically associated with the bond, using a shared, distributed ledger has the potential to even further streamline the process, while also decreasing what credit rating agency Moody's last year described as an ""increased risk for investors"" resulting from lack of transparency.  To give an idea of what's at stake should blockchain-based Schuldscheines become the norm, between 2014 and 2015, the issuance of the bonds increased by 67 percent to €20.2bn, according to a BNP Paribas report.  And Moody's has predicted a record level of issuances this year.  Beyond bonds  With the World Bank also getting into the issuance of bonds on a blockchain earlier this year, the asset class is ripe for disruption. But Daimler's work doesn't stop there.  Currently, there are several business departments looking at use cases, including in sales, engineering, securities trade, the cross-border shipment of goods and – perhaps most promising – the payment of transactions.  While the actual blockchain solutions that might eventually be employed have yet to be settled – several of Hyperledger's open-source solutions are still on the table – the next step forward is a bit more certain.  Scholz concluded:  ""For the payments streams, those are use cases we are currently looking at to go ahead with.""

Led by entrepreneur Li Xiaolai, Press.One bills itself as a decentralized content distribution platform based on the recently launched EOS blockchain. In total, the ICO collected 5,853 bitcoin, 106,757 ether and 30,430,519 EOS from 14,104 participants.  But while the figures may be impressive, the final numbers represented less than half the project's initial target of $200m – in part due to a decline in prices across the global cryptocurrency markets.  Since the the ICO began, the prices of bitcoin, ether and EOS have fallen 18 percent, 26 percent, and 46 percent, respectively, shrinking the total market value of the project by an estimated $52m.  ICO concerns  However, it may not be the decline in prices that was the only factor in the missed target. Skeptics of the ICO have publicly argued that the project is too ambiguous and ambitious, with some also claiming that the project lacks a white paper to explain its technical details and offers limited information on the development team.  Users of social platforms including 8BTC, Weibo, WeChat and Steemit further expressed concerns over the way the ICO was managed and its legality.  Based on the Press.One website, the purpose of the ICO is to build a public blockchain based on EOS. Other than traditional media, potential competitors to Press.One include content distribution site Steemit, which helps content creators receive rewards for their work and is based on similar technology to EOS.  Besides Li, who serves as CEO, the project lists Li Lu as chief technology officer. The two previously partnered to launch a website named Knewone, which became Less, a lifestyle community sharing application.  Another unusual characteristic of the Press.one project is the distribution of 10 billion tokens, dubbed PRS, which will only be dispersed to contributors six months after the ICO. Temporarily, though, the tokens are scheduled to be tradable on July 12, 2018.  Teacher turned tycoon  The other side of the story is Li's growing popularity as a successful and what some portray as inspiring investor.  Born in the 1970s, Li started a career as a salesman and became a well-known English teacher in China. Prior to the emergence of bitcoin, Li had already made a name for himself by publishing two bestselling books about time management and methods in mastering vocabularies for English tests.  Then, in 2011, he started mining and investing in bitcoin, and by 2014, he reportedly owned over 100,000 bitcoins, making him one of the largest investors in the cryptocurrency.  After founding the Bitfund venture capital firm in 2013, Li also established Yunbi, a cryptocurrency exchange based in China. According to Coinmarketcap, that exchange is now the 7th largest in the world by trading volume.  Currently, Yunbi trades ICO tokens and cryptocurrencies, including several backed by Li, such as EOS, Qtum, Siacoin, the latter of which has just received $400,000 from INBlockchain, another capital fund launched by Li.

42400167,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrSE,1500347242,CoinDesk Explainer: How BIP 91 Enacts SegWit While Avoiding a Bitcoin Split,"While many thought signaling for the controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x wouldn't begin until July 21, bitcoin miners are now doing just that by way of a piece of code called BIP 91.  At press time, nearly 60% of the last 144 blocks mined have signaled support for the measure. But, what are miners signaling for, and what does bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 91 mean for the network?  As the first part of the Segwit2x scaling plan, BIP 91 does two things:  It makes it significantly easier for the network to adopt Segregated Witness (SegWit), a backward compatible upgrade that fixes transaction malleability and clears the path for off-chain solutions like Lightning Network.  If activated by July 31, BIP 91 will supersede BIP 148, a proposal that poses a risk of causing the network to split.  The basics  Segwit2x was introduced during CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in May. Based on a fork of the Bitcoin Core software client called BTC1, Segwit2x seeks to both implement SegWit and raise the block size limit.  About a month later, in response to that, Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard introduced BIP 91 as a way to implement SegWit quickly and safely, without the risk of splitting the network.  He specifically developed the proposal with two other active proposals for scaling bitcoin in mind.  These include:  BIP 141: Introduced in November 2016, BIP 141 is the original plan for activating SegWit.  BIP 148: Released in March, BIP 148 was developed as a way to push through the stalled BIP 141 via a user-activated soft fork (UASF).  But, more importantly, BIP 91 was proposed as an alternative to having to completely redeploy BIP 141, a task that would have been technically infeasible, given that BIP 141 does not expire until mid-November.  To explain further, a bitcoin soft fork deployment requires that miners set a bit in the version field of blocks they mine to signal their readiness to enforce new rules. Segwit2x originally called for BIP 141 to require a ""bit 4"" signalling, but BIP 141 was already coded to respond to ""bit 1"" signalling.  So, to get around that, BIP 91 employs a clever trick. Rather than change the existing SegWit activation logic, it uses a secondary bit to signal mandatory enforcement of the original bit.  As such, BIP 91 uses the same BIP 9 soft fork deployment method as BIP 141, but with a few key differences:  Miners signal with ""bit 4,"" as opposed to ""bit 1""  Activation only requires 80% as opposed to 95% of hash power support  The activation window is 336 blocks, as opposed to 2,016.  So, once that 80% threshold is reached, BIP 91 locks in, and another 336 blocks later, it activates.  At that point, BIP 141 is enforced using the same technique as BIP 148:  Miners begin signaling with ""bit 1""  Any blocks that do not signal with ""bit 1"" will be blocked from the network.  As long as 51% of miners (by hash power) enforce the mandatory ""bit 1"" signalling, the chain will not split. And since a majority will have already supported BIP 91 activation via the ""bit 4"" signalling, maintaining that hash power is unlikely to be a problem.  Two weeks (2,016 blocks) after enforcement begins, BIP141 locks in, and another two weeks after that, SegWit activates.  Opposition and support  BIP 91 was also a recognition of the realities of the scaling debate.  Namely, the fact that, nearly a year down the road, BIP 141 still has not gained traction with miners. While BIP 141 requires a 95% miner support (by hash power), the figure has remained stuck at around 30%, though recently it increased to 45%.  But if BIP 91 is almost identical to BIP 141, why didn't miners signal support for the latter?  The reason is two-fold:  First was the high bar set to achieve activation. BIP 141 requires a super majority of miners to signal their readiness within a two-week (2,016 block) activation period.  Second, it is possible some miners were holding out for a block-size increase, a measure that has been embraced by the Segwit2x proposal.  A fast lane to SegWit  But, the proposal that has had the biggest impact on BIP 91's design is BIP 148, the so-called UASF discussed above.  In many ways, BIP 91 can be read as an effort to front-run the BIP 148 proposal, thus removing the potential of creating two rival bitcoin blockchains, each with competing assets.  To resolve that issue, Hilliard proposed that BIP 91 should activate before BIP 148's August 1 deadline. And of course, he made that possible by essentially shortening BIP 141's original two-week activation period to 56 hours.  Miners today are signaling their support for BIP 91 early because of the perceived need to avoid the split BIP 148 could create or, as others speculate, because some miners think that a successful UASF would reduce their control over network changes.  For now, your best bet is to watch the upcoming 336-block period. Beginning tonight at block 476,448, this is the next period during which miners can signal for BIP 91.  Should 269 blocks signal for BIP 91 within a 56-hour window, BIP 91 will lock-in, setting the stage for the next phase of Segwit2x this autumn, or possibly later.    And, with bitcoin's three largest mining pools throwing their computing power behind the effort, it is possible that the threshold will be reached before the end of the week.
