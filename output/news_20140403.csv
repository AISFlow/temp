42397452,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUC1,1396564726,New Texas Memorandum Outlines Initial Bitcoin Exchange Guidelines,"The Texas Department of Banking has released a supervisory memorandumhttp://www.dob.texas.gov/lg_manual/sm1037.pdf outlining its regulatory stance on digital currencies within the guidelines set by the Texas Money Services Act.  The document draws a line of distinction between bitcoins and other digital currencies and sovereign currencies like the dollar. According to the memorandum, digital currencies are not recognized as legal tender in Texas because they lack backing from an institution like a central bank, do not have intrinsic value and do not carry any guarantees of redemption.  Overall, the statements clarify the statutes which govern the establishment of third-party bitcoin exchanges that handle sovereign currencies, providing a clearer path for those who might seek licensure in Texas.  As a result, the exchange of digital currency and sovereign currency does not qualify as a money transmission:  ""Because cryptocurrency is not money under the Money Services Act, receiving it in exchange for a promise to make it available at a later time or different location is not money transmission. Consequently, absent the involvement of sovereign currency in a transaction, no money transmission can occur.""  The memorandum likens the purchase or sale of bitcoins or other digital currencies to a transaction involving a commodity or product, stating:  ""Exchange of cryptocurrency for sovereign currency between two parties is not money transmission. This is essentially a sale of goods between two parties. The seller gives units of cryptocurrency to the buyer, who pays the seller directly with sovereign currency. The seller does not receive the sovereign currency in exchange for a promise to make it available at a later time or different location.""  The memorandum notably follows the 11th March news that New York would accept applications for bitcoin exchanges, and suggests that more states may be following its lead.  Implications for exchanges  Daniel Wood, assistant general counsel for the Texas Department of Banking, explained in an interview with CoinDesk that the regulations focus primarily on businesses that operate exchanges and handle sovereign currencies.  ""Under the money transmission and currency exchange statutes, there is no direct regulation of cryptocurrencies. So for a company that wants to, say, start up an exchange site, the question for us will always be: what do you do with, and how do you handle sovereign currency?""  ""Our statutes define money and currency very narrowly,"" he added.  Community reaction  Steven Wilkinson  , co-founder and treasurer of the Texas Bitcoin Association, said in an interview he sees the clarification of money transmission rules as a way to better govern the behavior of third-party exchanges.  ""[Regulation] will keep third-party exchanges doing what should be proper and right, and we can avoid the Mt. Gox issue.""  He went on to state that he thinks of the rule clarification as one part of a broader regulatory evolution in regards to digital currencies, both in Texas and beyond.  ""I think it's more of a first step. Texas is a large player. It's really gonna be who else comes along with this particular way of thinking, which I think is the proper way of holding new technology. But, I definitely see this as a step in the right direction instead of as just another step into the fog.""  US regulation taking shape  The Department's release follows guidance from the Internal Revenue Service that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes. The decision has prompted some to criticize the way in which these rules will impact small transactions of bitcoins.  Exchanges based in China are also beginning to feel pressure from state regulators, though in a more negative way.  For example, Huobi announced on 3rd April that it would halt voucher deposits. On 2nd April, BTC38 announced the suspension of fiat-to-digital currency trading while FXBTC and OKCoin both detailed complications involving their payment processors.

42397465,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUMq,1396556758,"LA's First Dogecoin Party Promises DJs, Dogs, Much Fun and Such Charity","The popular meme-themed digital currency dogecoin is the focus of an upcoming event to be hosted by local advocacy group Spelunk.in at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles, California, on 4th April.  Dogecoin made headlines earlier this year after more than $30,000 in dogecoins was raised to support the Jamaican Olympic bobsled team, but since then the one-time joke currency has gained a steady stream of enthusiasts. To date, this has included Reddit CEO Yishan Wong as well as major VC investors.  Set to run from 7pm to 10pm PST, DogeParty West is a chance for digital currency enthusiasts and newbies alike to learn about everything dogecoin.  The party coincides with the announcement that local merchant Meltdown Comics will accept dogecoin. In February, Meltdown Comics became one of the first stores in the Los Angeles area to accept bitcoin.  Said general manager Francisco Dominguez:  ""We launched with bitcoin and that was a huge success, and now I get new customers, people who haven't been to the store, but have bitcoin and need a place to spend them.""  As opposed to Satoshi Square events, which emphasize bitcoin trading, organisers say the dogecoin parties happening around the US are more informal.  Admission is free, and both humans and shibas are encouraged to attend.  Fundraising details  The gathering is also set to highlight the more charitable side of the dogecoin currency with proceeds raised (in dogecoins) going to Southern California Shiba Inu Rescue and Two Dog Farms.  Among the main events are a DogeDog contest and a special gathering with doggy 'guests' from the above two canine residences.  Party-goers will also have the opportunity to 'adopt' a shiba inu of their own at the event using either their dogecoins or dollars.  Those who are unable to attend can also send donations online.  The Dogecoin Foundation most recently raised funds for NASCAR driver Josh Wise and for a charity:water initiative aimed at helping build two water wells in remote Kenya.  DogeParty West is not affiliated formally with any dogecoin organisations.  Additional attractions  Several demonstrations will also be held during the event, including ones for an indie video game funded by dogecoins, a doge-themed card game, and a how-to on mining the shiba-themed currency.  Furthermore, Neon Roots will display its live digital currency price ticker, while Meltdown Comics will be hosting a live reddit feed, as well as a live video stream of the event.  DJ Headshot and Carl Schwenk will be providing live music, and the Let's Be Frank food truck will be serving up refreshments.  Community spirit  In an interview with CoinDesk, Dominguez cited the costs of conducting credit card transactions as one reason that Meltdown Comics began accepting bitcoins and dogecoins, as well as grassroots support among the store's customer base and beyond.  He also pointed to the characteristic enthusiasm of dogecoin enthusiasts and said he hopes the event captures some of that energy in a positive way.  Ultimately, he sees DogeParty West as a way to promote the community aspect of digital currencies.  ""[The dogecoin community are] a fun crowd and it kind of fits really well with what we have going at Meltdown, as we're a community as well.""  Meltdown Comics is located at 7522 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. More information about DogeParty West can be found by clicking here.

42397473,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUQm,1396553143,Sacramento Kings NBA Franchise Launches Bitcoin-Only Online Store,"The Sacramento Kings NBA Franchise has officially launched a bitcoin-only marketplace on BitDazzle, a purchasing platform for online merchants that specializes in bitcoin.  The news follows the announcement that the Kings would become the first US professional sports team to accept bitcoin this past January, when the team inked a deal with Georgia-based merchant processing specialist BitPay.  The new website, KingsBitcoin.com, is a co-branded effort between the two organisations that will allow Kings fans to purchase gear, merchandise and tickets using bitcoin.  In an official statement, Kings President Chris Granger indicated that the Kings have been looking to provide more cashless transaction options to fans, and that as a result, the partnership was in line with the franchise's larger goals.  Said Granger:  ""We're constantly looking for the next technological breakthrough that benefits the team and our fans.""  All merchandise on the site can be paid for in bitcoin. Further, those who do not have a bitcoin wallet can sign up for one via the website.  Purchasing options  At press time, a number of purchasing options were available on KingsBitcoin.com, including T-shirts, jerseys and basketballs.  The most expensive item listed was a Kings MVP Experience, which includes a limousine trip to and from the game for four, four VIP passes complete with complementary food and beverage, and four Kings polo shirts.  This item was listed for $4,500 or 10.01 BTC.  The Kings All-Access Experience, which features a locker-room tour, autographed Kings jerseys, lower-level tickets and a chance to watch pregame warm-ups with coach Michael Malone is also available for $3,500 or 7.79 BTC.  Those who select items can then checkout by first providing their details such as their address, email address and phone number.  About the partnership  Though notable for the Kings, the launch is also a first for BitDazzle.  Founded in October, BitDazzle is a partnership between San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase and Cashie Commerce, an online platform that allows businesses to easily start websites or blogs.  The launch is the first on the BitDazzle enterprise platform, a new offering that lets major brands and charities quickly launch co-branded storefronts.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/03/sacramento-kings-nba-franchise-launches-bitcoin-only-online-store,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94154550684901dd7b32ade11958cf04e4c7517c-1010x714.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397454,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUFx,1396549295,Bulgarian Bitcoin Tax Guidance May Leave Money-Laundering Loophole,"Bulgaria's National Revenue Agency (NRA), the government organisation in charge of administering state taxes and social security contributions in the eastern European nation, has issued new taxation guidelines for digital currency.  In a post on 2nd April, the NRA indicated that income from the sale of digital currencies such as bitcoin will be treated as income from the sale of financial assets and taxed at a rate of 10%.  Effectively, earnings from bitcoin trades will be taxed on the same level as ordinary income and corporate income in Bulgaria.  Explained the NRA:  ""Taxable income ... is the sum of the gains realized during the year specified for each transaction, reduced by the amount of losses realized during the year designated for each specific transaction.""  This differs from guidance from the US Internal Revenue Service, which called for digital currency to be taxed as property, thereby allowing capital gains taxes to be imposed on each trade.  One source in Bulgaria suggested that the guidelines merely prevent its citizens from declaring bitcoin as non-taxable income, and that gains realized on purchases are not subject to taxation.  Timing and impact  The release comes in advance of the NRA's 30th April 2013 tax deadline, and includes guidance on where bitcoin gains should be reported on tax forms.  Perhaps most notably, however, the announcement does not seem to have big-picture implications for how digital currencies will be classified or regulated. The NRA's announcement compares bitcoin as a financial instrument, not a currency.  Further, Stamen Gorchev, founder of Bulgaria-based bitcoin informational website Hash.bg and member of the newly launched Bulgarian Bitcoin Association, stressed that the guidance amounted more to an ad-hoc announcement, and that the NRA has no legal authority to determine the status of bitcoin.  Bulgaria's Financial Supervision Commission has reviewed the matter, but does not have the authority to determine the legal status of a currency in the country, according to Gorchev.  He indicated that the FSC sent a letter to the National Bank asking for regulation on the matter in August, 2013.  Money-laundering risk?  Gorchev indicated that the move was perhaps motivated by a desire on the part of the NRA to reduce the risk that citizens would use bitcoin to avoid tax payments, however, he suggests this intent may backfire.  He notes the NRA does not require taxpayers to submit documentation that proves income from bitcoin trading, and that this comment has been raised on social media outlets by the local community.  As a result, Gorchev explained, this could cause problems for the local government:  ""It's a very easy way for someone in Bulgaria who gets some dirty money just to sell some bitcoins, pay the back tax for it, and this way, it's very easy to launder money.""  Income targeted  Gorchev indicated Bulgaria's guidance differs from the recent IRS guidance in that it mostly covers those who earn income from trading digital currencies.  Explained Gorchev:  ""If a miner sells bitcoins, he must pay tax on the sale price and he cannot subtract the cost of producing the bitcoins.""  Furthermore, Gorchev indicated that gains realized on bitcoin purchases aren't taxable:  ""If you buy one bitcoin at $500 and then later purchase goods for $600 with this bitcoin, you are not liable to pay taxes on the realized gain of $100.""  Regulation to follow?  A member of the European Union since 2007, the announcement is notable as it illustrates how different states are approaching taxation and regulation in lieu of formal guidelines from higher authorities.  For example, on 25th March, Denmark declared that it would not tax gains and losses from casual bitcoin trading, a different approach than that announced by Bulgaria yesterday.  The news notably follows calls from member state financial officials for the EU to take action on regulating bitcoin, and as more European countries – such as Greece and Lithuania – indicate that they are looking for the EU to take a leading position on the matter.  Still, Gorchev indicates that Bulgaria is likely to wait for such guidance from the EU as opposed to issuing its own regulation.

42397461,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUJt,1396542389,Chicago Sun-Times Becomes First Major US Newspaper to Accept Bitcoin,"Following its successful test with bitcoin micropayments provider BitWall back in February, the Chicago Sun-Times has announced that it has partnered with San Francisco-based bitcoin startup Coinbase to accept bitcoin payments.  That test saw the newspaper receive more than 700 bitcoin donations over a 24-hour trial period in support of the non-profit Taproot foundation, which offers pro-bono service work to organisations tackling social problems.  The announcement makes the Sun-Times the first US newspaper to accept bitcoin as a payment option, a move that editor in chief Jim Kirk indicated was in line with its digital-first promotional strategy.  Said Kirk:  “Our goal is to keep the Sun-Times current and evolving with changing technology. Accepting bitcoin payments is one of many ways we are working to stay digitally focused.”  The company indicated that it chose to partner with Coinbase as it would offer subscribers the quickest way to begin paying for content with bitcoin.  Sun-Times subscribers can now pay for subscriptions with bitcoin here.  BitWall test    The announcement that the Sun-Times would partner with Coinbase is particularly surprising given that the major newspaper had partnered for a test with BitWall earlier this year.    It is not yet clear how the Sun-Times partnership with Coinbase would affect the companies potentially moving forward with a micropayments partnership. Notably, the Sun-Times appears to only be accepting bitcoin subscription payments through Coinbase.  In contrast, the BitWall partnership tested payments on individual articles.  Bitcoin's role in publishing  The Chicago Sun-Times is certainly not unique in accepting bitcoin, as many bitcoin blogs and news sites accept formal donations. Earlier this year, it was reported that Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad would also begin experimenting with bitcoin micropayments.  Further, if bitcoin is able to reach its goal of becoming a reliable micropayments service, content publishers will be among those that benefit the most, meaning the Sun-Times is likely to be far from the last major newspaper to implement bitcoin payments.  However, some developers have raised questions about bitcoin's ability to handle such transactions.

42397470,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUOo,1396540858,Chinese Bitcoin Exchange Huobi to Stop Voucher Deposits Amid Regulatory Uncertainty,"China-based bitcoin exchange Huobi is reporting via its website that it has not yet received word from any of its four third-party payment processors that they will be taking action to close its trading accounts.  The post follows reports yesterday (2nd April) from competitors that they had been contacted by financial partners and that, as a result, some deposit services would be at least temporarily frozen.  However, Huobi has said that one of its processing partners did call it directly to talk about the potential risk of continuing the partnership. The processor, which was not named in the release, reportedly wants to very strictly enforce guidance from China's central bank that was issued on 5th December last year.  Perhaps most notably, Huobi will be halting voucher deposit services due in part to recent reports that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is looking to further restrict domestic financial institutions from working with bitcoin exchanges effective 15th April.  Huobi works with third-party processors ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), China Construction Bank (CCB) and China Merchants Bank (CMB).  More service closures  Huobi says that none of its financial partners have received formal notices from the PBOC confirming or denying the rumors first reported by Chinese news service Caixin earlier this month.  As mentioned, yesterday's announcements by rival exchanges OKCoin and FXBTC indicated that some deposit services would be halted due to unwillingness by financial partners to work with the bitcoin businesses in the current regulatory atmosphere.  It is unclear if any of those account closures were made in response to official notice or were proactive measures given that there is a growing consensus that Caixin's initial news report accurately reflects PBOC's change in enforcement.  Key to the situation is whether the People's Bank will look to more actively enforce earlier guidance that China-based exchanges could not work with third-party processors.  Major China-based exchanges have been circumventing this rule by accepting deposits into commercial accounts, however, it now seems the new guidance is meant to close this loophole.  Freeze on voucher deposits  Citing uncertainty regarding the current regulatory environment in China, however, Huobi did indicate that it plans to shut down prepaid voucher deposits effective from midnight, 5th April.  Voucher services played a key role in the revitalization of the Chinese bitcoin market following the PBOC's 5th December guidance, in particular helping BTC China regain volume this January.  Further, Huobi indicated that its bank transfer deposit services are now being manually serviced 24 hours a day to ensure customer funds are deposited quickly.  The voucher system was different than a third-party processing agreement, as anyone who wanted to enter the bitcoin market would need to first purchase a voucher code, which they could in turn use to buy bitcoins. Withdrawals worked on a similar system.  The exchange reported that renminbi withdrawal services, as well as bitcoin and litecoin deposits and withdrawals, were not affected.  Inconsistent reporting  Despite the lack of negative news from ICBC, ABC, CCB and CMB, Huobi was unable to confirm whether or not the update is indicative of its ability to operate smoothly in China. It indicated that any news it has heard on the subject has been reported by the media, and that it has no way of evaluating whether or not these reports are accurate.  Translations of its statements indicate that it clarified that the news it was providing was all firsthand, but that the news received across platforms has been inconsistent.  It suggested the difference could be indicative of how certain regions or service providers are responding to the news, but provided the caveat that this was merely speculation.  Price trends up in China  As of press time, the price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Pricing Index (BPI) was down roughly 2% for the day. The price was $428.80, down from an open of $437.51.  However, the situation in China was different. Prices were up 0.62% for the day's trading.

42397469,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUPn,1396533520,Lamassu CEO: Our ATMs Will Soon Become Portals for Bitcoin Services,"Startup Lamassu makes bitcoin ATMs that take in cash and exchange it on the spot for bitcoin. The company was started by Zach Harvey, Josh Harvey and Matt Whitlock just one year ago and, despite regulatory challenges in various locations, more than 200 people have bought Lamassu machines and are working to put them into operation all over the world.  CoinDesk sat down with Zach Harvey at CoinSummit to discuss the machine's roll-out, Whitlock's departure and the bitcoin ATM's true potential.  CoinDesk: How many Lamassu ATMs have you sold now?  Harvey: We've sold over 220 machines, and we've shipped around 80 to 100 machines. So about 120 people are still waiting for their machines. And new orders are coming in daily.  Tell me a little bit about Lamassu the company. Did you co-found Lamassu with Matt Whitlock?  I co-founded it with my brother, Josh Harvey, and Matt Whitlock. Matt Whitlock was with us early on, and then I guess in August, September, we parted ways.  Was it an amicable parting?  Yeah. He actually came with us on, not the most recent trip to our facility in Portugal, but the one before that, after we had parted ways. He still helped us out. Whenever we need help, he helps us. He's still a good friend. We see him at every bitcoin meetup in Manchester [New Hampshire, US], which is once a week. He's very excited about what we were doing.  I guess, you know, it didn't work out as a team, moving forward. But yes, we're still good friends.  So, now you and your brother are running the company?  Yes. I'm the CEO, he's the president. We're just playing different roles in the company. But we're both co-founders. We have adjacent apartments and we spend a lot of the day planning everything. He's more on the technical side of things, he's a computer programmer. And I'm more on the management side of things.  When did you start the company?  We started the company even before we were doing the bitcoin machine – about two weeks before. We were already working on the machine as a project, we just didn't think it was going to be a business.  What we wanted to do was get into bitcoin. We were thinking of doing a bitcoin consultancy, specifically with regard to bitcoin security, trying to help some of the players get into bitcoin and handle security, which is when we founded Lamassu.  Then we realized it would be one of those businesses that would probably take a lot of time to develop, would not be easy. And then when the bitcoin machine really started to take off, we just used the Lamassu branding, etc.  Why had you created the machine, if not as a business?  It was part of the bitcoin meetups in Manchester. It started off with Matt and Josh, and I joined later. For the first time we were going to show it, I helped a bit with the last touches of the machine. The second, we started seeing it as a business opportunity, we started off as the three of us, with Josh and I doing most of the legwork, and Matt was the lead developer.  Speaking of development, I have heard from the operators that they were expecting the machine to have an administrative interface, and they were getting frustrated that they don't have it yet. Is that still in the works?  It's still in the works. We are extremely close. We have a working alpha version that we have not yet presented to our operators, but we are very close to being at the stage where we will. It was a little bit more ambitious than we had first anticipated, and I think when it comes out people will understand why it took so long. It's a game changer in a lot of ways.  The beauty of it is, it gives our machine an additional layer of flexibility. It really turns our machine into an 'anything bitcoin' portal. When you think of an ATM, you think of a machine that just does one thing. But this will open our machine up to have a marketplace of different services that can be used through our machine.  It kind of reminds me of when you get a router and you go and configure it. There's a URL you type in, and all the sudden you have an interface.  The operators will be able to determine what fee they wish to take, what exchanges they want to use, which wallet they want to use. Maybe they want to use BitPay's or Bitstamp's price ticker, maybe they want to create their own. Maybe they don't want to use any third-party services at all. Maybe they want to create backups in case the third-party services they're using go down.  One of the things it's going to do is, they're going to have absolute control of their system, because it will be running on their own dedicated server.  They will have a server of their own that will run this machine and will be divorced from Lamassu as a central service. We will not have a central service. Which means that even if we disappear off the face of the planet, their machine will be absolutely operational.  They're going to go and start their own server, and they're going to load up the back end onto that, pair the machine to it, and we have absolutely no control over it from that point, and no information from them.  So the interface gives them the ability to connect to a server, and it's up to them to go get the server?  They can choose any server they want – Amazon has services where they can buy part of a server, there's another one called Digital Ocean. People who are very wary of their security will want to get a super high-security one. Or maybe they want to use their own if they have some part of a server farm.  There are all kinds of different levels of security they can choose for themselves. It will be up to them. The ones that don't really have an idea of what they're supposed to do will take servers at cloud services that are easy to set up, and people who are experts at networking and services and security will want to handle everything themselves.  What other services could they provide besides exchanging dollars for bitcoins?  That entire system is going to be open source. Anybody can write a module that can plug into a system. If any of the operators want to use it, they just pull in that module. So anybody that has any sort of API can write a module for our machine, and then if the operators want to use it, it could be payment based, or not, if somebody's doing it just for the fun of it.  So it will be like writing apps for an iPhone?  Right.  Do you have ideas about what kind of services people might write modules to provide?  I would be most excited if it were things I didn't even think of, but the basics are, for instance, more secure wallets. There are all kinds of wallets coming out right now, and some of them will have an extra layer of security. You could plug those into our system and use them as wallets instead of using the standard ones that exist today.  Or maybe compliance – maybe somebody has a really simple easy-to-use compliance system. They could write a module and plug that right into our system so the operator would have a very easy time with compliance in whatever jurisdiction.  Then you can start looking at our machines as a portal based on the bitcoin platform. You put cash into this machine, and then anything could be done with that once it's bitcoin.  It could be sent as a remittance to another country. It could be used to purchase anything really, directly. You don't even have to necessarily touch bitcoin.  So if I'm someone who wants to send money overseas, I could put my dollars into the machine, and not only convert them to bitcoin, but also send it overseas?      Yeah. In fact it could even all be behind the scenes. You could have somebody putting $100 into the machine, and their relative in [a developing country] picks it up in their own currency. People don't even know it's bitcoin, it doesn't even interest them. What they want done is to move their money and convert it at the same time.  Say they want to send $2,000 to a [developing] country. They could type in an address or put in a QR code that contains all the information they need to send it to their relative, press 'send', and their relative goes to a machine that spits it out, or some kind of desk or service, or maybe the service would put it into their bank account.  It really opens up our machine to much more flexible usability for the operator, but the most basic part of it is that it will make it really easy to manage and run the system.      In return it'll make it a lot easier for us so we can focus on what's really important as far as development goes. If they want to change their commission right now, we have to change that for them. That's a temporary situation in which we don't want to be. It's frustrating for them, and it's frustrating for us.  Is there a date when the admin interface is going to be released?  We stopped giving dates. We do take deadlines seriously. The second we realized we missed one, we didn't want to just keep saying, 'another two weeks, another two weeks.' That's a little reminiscent of other companies in the bitcoin world.  It just feels like, we're doing our best to get this under control, working day and night tirelessly, and we're very close. Giving a date won't help anyone at this point. All we can tell them is, this is how far we've gotten and this is what we have left to do, and try to give our operators as much information as possible.  Basically what happened with this, is our hardware got out so quickly and on time, and our software was running a bit behind, and this was all happening so quickly – almost as to be expected in a young startup, that things don't run exactly on time.  It's not something we're happy with, it's something that we're dealing with. We are really making a lot of great progress, finally. We had some bad experiences with software development, and now things are a bit more under control. It's been frustrating, but a learning experience, and I will be very excited when it finally comes out.  That will be kind of the last piece of the puzzle that's been difficult for us. Because everything else has been going amazingly: the hardware, our customer support guys are phenomenal, our designers in Berlin are great – everybody we've been working with. We really feel blessed that we found such great people to work with who are doing, I would say, beyond what we expected. Software has been the one point that has been frustrating for us.  Did the delay have to do with Matt Whitlock's departure?  It started with Matt, but it's hard to say. I'm not going to blame it on Matt, on the other hand there were certain issues with the software while Matt was there. It's possible that if Matt had stayed with us, certain things would have been done already.  It has definitely been the difficulty of finding a lead developer [to replace Matt] that would really fit our business needs, of getting things done fast with very good communication. It's something we've been looking for for a long time. Right now we're looking for a lead developer still, and Josh is doing most of the work.  Have you had any pushback from authorities since the Lamassu machines have been deploying?  No, we haven't had any contact whatsoever with authorities from any country. We've had authorities talk about our machine, but not to us directly.  In Massachusetts, the Office of Consumer Affairs put out a consumer warning about bitcoins and bitcoin ATMs, and went on to say that our machine wasn't a bitcoin ATM, which made me happy.  In Singapore they talked about bitcoin ATMs, they talked about our machine, kind of like a general warning. In a sense, that's exciting. But we haven't actually been approached by any government agencies from any countries. Part of the reason for that is that we're not an operator. We do not provide any money services at all.  What about the operators and their experiences with trying to register with various authorities – what has their experience been?  They are all facing obstacles, especially in the US. There people are very wary of what will happen if they start operating a machine. There have been guys waiting six months because they've been concerned about how to launch it.  Others haven't waited that long, have engaged their regulators and gotten pretty good ideas or at least have enough communications to feel OK about it.  In general they're all being very, very careful in the US. Abroad they're usually quicker to launch, but some also have some concerns, depending on the jurisdiction that they're in.  I spoke with one attorney who warned that the regulatory structure, especially in the US, is not yet adequate for people to operate these machines in a legally safe way. How do you respond to that?  'There's nothing to do' isn't really an acceptable answer. Bitcoin is not illegal in the US. So saying, 'There's no regulatory framework, therefore you shouldn't do it' ... that is probably not a lawyer I would go to.  I would go to a lawyer who says, 'There's no regulatory framework, let's find it'. If you go to a regulator and he says something like that, that's definitely not acceptable. As a regulator, you can't just say, 'We don't have a framework so you can't do it.' That's not according to the legal system.      You either have a law that says you can't do it, or you have regulatory requirements saying this is what you're supposed to do.  I think the correct approach has been some of the other lawyers in the field, like Marco Santori, which is, 'Let's be careful'.  In New York, he may tell somebody, 'Don't do it' – just because it's too expensive. Somebody buying a $5,000 machine, if that is a lot for them, they probably shouldn't place it in New York because they'll probably have to pay several times that in legal fees.  That would be a real answer. On the other hand, they could say, 'If you want to have a machine in the US, go and do it in this state. In this state, it will be easier for you. Have you considered doing it in your neighbouring state?'  That's one of the reasons we have our due diligence questionnaire when we sell our machines in the US. We want people to do that thinking before they buy the machine. If you're in the US, you cannot buy one of the machines if you don't check off that you have read our due diligence form, and that you will sign it before receiving the machine.  One operator relocated from California to New Mexico in order to launch the first Lamassu machine in the US. Do you know of other operators who relocated to do this?  The Boston guys, their company was based in Philadelphia, so they did it as well. It just happens to be that Boston's a really cool place to have a bitcoin machine. They have two of them there now. They have one of them in South Station and the other in Cambridge, right near Harvard Square.  Those are two really great places to have bitcoin machines placed. They found out after talking to regulators there that this would be something they'd be able to do. They have a compliance plan in place and they have really good lawyers and they've put a lot of time into it and they're young and resourceful. They found a way to do it.  If anybody asked me, 'Will it be easy for me to set up a machine in the US?', my answer would be no, you should be prepared for that. It would be really amazing if you did it, and we'll help as much as we can, but it's not going be easy. If you want easy, it would be cheaper for you to move somewhere else and start it there.  In what ways can you help the operators?      If they have no idea who to approach, we can recommend a lawyer to them. Some of those will give the first hour free, just to get an idea before they really get into it. So they can call them up and say, 'Listen, I'm thinking of putting a bitcoin machine in Arkansas. Should I, should I not? What do you think it would cost me to do it?'.  That's the kind of way we could help them. Other ideas would be our experience, knowing where it's easier to set up. Or if we already have an operator in some state, we can say, 'We have this operator here, I know what they did. They have special requirements', like a special screen, or special requirements with ID verification that other states don't have – like an extra step.  We want it to be as easy as possible for these operators. The only thing we won't do, is get it compliant for them. We would have zero time for anything else if we started touching regulatory compliance, and we would probably run out of money in a few days.  Will the administrative interface do the ID checking that regulators require?  It's part of it. It's something we've been working on and are making progress with as well. For us, it's just a matter of resources and priorities, and for a while we were selling more machines to countries that didn't really need it as much. Now that we are selling more machines to areas that do need ID verification, we've been putting more resources into it.  The basic way it's going to work is pretty simple: before you scan your QR code, you scan the back of your driver's license. It reads the bar code on the driver's license, snatches all the information, sends it to a third party that specializes in ID verification. It asks verifying questions, in the same way that you have to answer questions through some kind of fraud alert on your credit card to make sure there's no identity theft.  We verify and validate their identity, and then they can go and buy. It's a process that should probably only double the amount of time it takes to use the machine. Instead of 15 seconds, maybe 30 seconds.  That's going to be part of the interface as soon as it comes out?  Yeah. There's going to be a compliance tab.  Do people have to pay for your machines when they order?  Yes. They pay when they order, the full amount. People started feeling a lot better about that when they saw that we are actually shipping these machines.  A lot of respect to the first 15 that ordered on blind faith. I'm happy that we delivered on time for them. We have not been getting any complaints about people getting their machines late. People have been generally very happy about that.  What percentage of customers paid in bitcoins?  Definitely most. I would say probably about 70%.  How has the fluctuating exchange rate affected your company? Has that been, in general, beneficial to you?  In general it's been beneficial. We have to be responsible enough to make sure that, with the money we receive, we can pay our suppliers in order to build the machine.  We don't keep everything in bitcoin. We have to make sure we have a large enough amount of fiat currency so that we are able to pay people in fiat currency.  If we'd received orders from machines when they were $1,200 and left them there, it would be a lot harder to pay for them now that bitcoin is worth half of that. We're careful to keep all the money we use for operational uses in fiat right now. A large percentage of our profit is in bitcoin.  Are you profitable already?  Yes, we are. It's part of what has allowed us to ramp up production, giving more money up front to our manufacturers, and making sure we have enough stock of everything and keeping enough padding so we don't have to worry about what will happen next week.  If the price of bitcoin had remained static, would you still be profitable? Or is your profit mostly due to the rise in the bitcoin price?  Yes. Our profit is from selling the machines mostly. Whatever part of it we kept in bitcoin obviously would be more profitable. At first we kept a smaller percentage in bitcoin and, as we sold more machines, we started taking a little more profit in bitcoin. We expect the price of bitcoin to go right back up.  What is the case for having a physical ATM when anyone could simply buy bitcoins online?  There are a bunch of different ways of looking at it. One is if you pick a random person off the street, what would be easier to explain to them to do, go to a machine, put in a dollar and get bitcoin? Or explain to them how they have to sign up for this exchange – that's not really a bank, but has to talk to their bank – buy a minimum amount, and wait a few days to actually get them? It's a more arduous process than our machine.  If you take somebody off the street, it would be a lot more intuitive to just press a few buttons and get it. And for people who are already familiar with bitcoin, it's an easy process.  It's really a matter of convenience. There are use cases for exchanges and doing it online, and there are use cases for having a physical machine. Obviously, if you're talking about the unbanked, they can't use an online exchange. It cuts the banks out of the picture. Cash is the only way to use fiat without middlemen.

Some 18 fighters from across Europe are taking part in the Bitcoin Fight Night, which is being held in the indigO2, within The O2 venue.  A rather familiar face will also be taking to the ring – broadcaster and bitcoin enthusiast Max Keiser. He's competing in a celebrity bout against a professionally trained fighter who is a big supporter of Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase.  Organiser Patrick Carroll explained:  ""We originally came up with the idea of a Bitcoin Fight Night while attending a bitcoin meet up group run by CoinScrum in central London.""  He said over 700 tickets for the event have been sold so far, but he expects over 1,000 people to show up on the day.  ""We are very much looking forward to seeing everyone this Saturday and expect it to be the biggest UK-based bitcoin gathering to date,"" Carroll concluded.  Free meetup  A free bitcoin meetup is taking place at the indigO2 before the fight night, featuring a panel debate titled 'How Bitcoin Can Fight Back Against the Hackers'.  The panel discussing the issues faced by digital currency will be chaired by bitcoin fan and co-founder of feathercoin Chris Ellis and will comprise of:    Ben Dyson – bitcoin sceptic and founder of Positive Money      Greg Davies – head of behavioural finance at Barclays PLC    Gautam Dhillon – founder of the Treasury Outsourcing Company and former employee of Lloyds Bank & JP Morgan Chase    Michele Seven – freedom advocate  Kristov Atlas – philosopher, computer scientist researching bitcoin security and author of Anonymous Bitcoinhttp://anonymousbitcoinbook.com/.  Josh Walker ­­– bitcoin and maths enthusiast    The panel discussion will begin at around 15:00 (BST), with the fight night starting at 19:00 followed by a VIP after-party at 22:30.  Tickets are priced from £29.75 - £45.75, but those who attend the CoinScrum event are entitled to half-price tickets (£15) and entrance to the VIP party if they RSVP before the event.  Sponsorship  The event is being sponsored by Firestartr.co, which provides seed-stage capital and aids startups in their early stages.  Firestartr.co is increasing its activity in the digital currency space and recently led the Bitstamp audit, which required the creation of the largest single bitcoin wallet and transaction in history.  Cécile Baird, head of operations and portfolio at Firestartr.co, said: ""In order for bitcoin to grow stronger, it’s weaknesses needs to be tackled. The CoinScrum panel event will confront the tough issues that need to be solved.""  ""Thanks to the location and support we can reach out to a wider audience beyond the bitcoin community and include sports fans too,"" she added.

42377106,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5ph,1396527523,CrowdCurity 'Capture the Coin' Contest Rewards Bug Finders With Bitcoin,"Crowdsourced IT security startup CrowdCurity has created a new bug bounty programme with a unique twist.  Titled Capture the Coin, the programme is inspired by the well-known capture the flag game, and aims to reward security researchers for locating private bitcoin keys hidden within the front-end of web platforms.  CrowdCurity  is testing the idea on its own website to start with, and is kicking it off as a competition with bitcoin for prizes.  Jacob Hanson, CEO of CrowdCurity, told CoinDesk:  ""We find it an interesting approach to basically test the security of our own platform.""  How it works  For the contest, CrowdCurity created three paper wallets that store the bitcoin offline. Each is in different amounts, based on the perceived value of the possible security intrusion that the vulnerability represents.  The private keys to those wallets, however, are hidden within their website's code awaiting discovery – for those with sufficient skills.  There are three different rewards: the 1.5 BTC Nakamoto Reward, the 1BTC Dorian Reward and the 0.5 BTC Scytale reward. furthermore, each has its own clues to aid the researchers, which are detailed on the company's blog.  Each reward is for a very specific vulnerability, making this a rather different bug bounty programme than normal. For example, Google's bug reward scheme has a chart it uses to calculate rewards.  CrowdCurity wants to experiment with a more competitive reward style with Capture the Coin.  Said Hansen:  ""[With bitcoin] you can put a monetary value on vulnerabilities. Most companies give away prizes based on levels, but Capture the Coin offers better granularity and adjustments for rewards programs.""  Monetizing vulnerabilities  In the differing bitcoin amounts, CrowdCurity has set a specific a value for vulnerabilities of differing hardness levels. For example, the first place 1.5 BTC Nakamoto Reward should be one that's a significantly tougher nut to crack, since only CrowdCurity should already know about it.  Hansen believes that creating a marketplace for vulnerabilities by using private keys for bitcoin wallets could change the way that security researchers compete in bug bounty programmes:  ""We have different amounts in each of these different private keys. The different amounts correspond to the criticality of the bugs that the company actually sees in the system.""  And if someone finds the private key, possession of the wallet is instant. There's no waiting for someone to decide on a reward like in regular bug bounty schemes.  Security transparency  The block chain's ability to publicly display all transactions means that, in theory, future security systems using Capture the Coin-style cryptocurrency rewards could offer more transparency.  Hansen says the block chain is, ""an intrusion detection system where we can monitor bitcoin addresses and see if private keys are being used"".  Most intrusion detection systems in IT security are passive in nature – designed to wait for a certain threshold to be violated, and then a warning notification is issued.  With block chain-based transaction monitoring, a more reactive system might be possible to quickly mitigate an intrusion.  Explained Hansen:  ""Being able to monitor movements on [a bitcoin] account is actually a very reactive system. You can build a certain chain of reactions once you see a certain movement take place [on the block chain].""  Never 100% secure  CrowdCurity's main business strategy has been crowdsourcing IT security rewards to get results, instead of paying expensive consultants for time, which it views as a disruptive industry approach.  The latter is a model that the company says many bitcoin companies are using, which make up around a half of CrowdCurity's current customer base.  No business is ever completely protected against security threats, and because thefts and security breaches are on the rise, innovative methods to help thwart intruders are necessary.  Capture the Coin is CrowdCurity's test to see how bitcoin can help harden front-end web security as part of its business.  ""Hopefully in the future we will be able to provide this as a service to customers,"" said Hansen.  Cryptocurrency-based security  Using cryptocurrency to incentivize and make security issues more transparent seems like a logical extension of CrowdCurity's crowdsourcing business model.  Private keys for bitcoin wallets embedded in websites could end up being used as 'honey pots' – an IT security tactic designed to entice possible thieves in order to track down them and catch them in the act.  And the tracking method for this honey pot could use the power of the block chain's ledger, something that has not been possible before.  Said Hansen:  ""Now we have programmable money. And you can do this kind of stuff in security that could not be done earlier.""  ""You can't do this with PayPal. You can’t do this with regular money. It’s very, very interesting,"" he added.

The Earthquakes' president Dave Kaval told SiliconANGLE that fans will be able to use bitcoin to pay for items from the team's merchandise store and to buy tickets. However, hotdogs and popcorn don't appear to be on the list just yet.  Winning titles  The 'Quakes' are a major soccer team, having already won two Major League Soccer Cup titles back in 2001 and 2003. However, they aren't the first major US sports team to accept bitcoin. The NBA took that honour in January, when the Sacramento Kings became the first major sports team in the US to accept bitcoin.  “In May, we are actually taking bitcoin in our stadium for merchandise, hopefully for concessions as well, but definitely for merchandise,” Kaval told SiliconANGLE.  Kaval pointed out that the ultimate goal is to produce a seamless commerce experience using mobile platforms. Concessions will be a bit trickier, as mobile POS systems will be necessary, but sooner or later Quakes fans could be smearing mustard from their bitcoin hotdog on their bitcoin season ticket.  Teething problems  The team was apparently forced to push back bitcoin adoption after it ran into problems with two payment processors that went out of business. The Quakes then tapped BitPay.  Kaval said his team did a bit of research and decided to use BitPay due to its professionalism and robust payment solutions.  Interestingly, the Earthquakes are planning to move to a new stadium next year, which seems to have been a factor in the team's decision to try out bitcoin payments. The team hope to employ a number of new technologies in the new facility.  And, of course, technology sells: it's good for your image, it garners great publicity and the kids love it. The Quakes were quick to recognise this, along with the Sacramento Kings.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

Chol Hwan Kim from Key Initiatives Technical Entrepreneur also participated in the investment.  This funding is in addition to the $400,000 Coinplug has already received from Silicon Valley investor SilverBlue in November last year.  Bitcoin ATM, Gangnam style  As well as its bitcoin exchange, Coinplug also develops wallet and merchant payment software. Last month it even launched its own two-way bitcoin ATM in Gangnam, Seoul, in partnership with the largest ATM hardware manufacturer outside the US, Nautilus Hyosung.  Coinplug's Richard Yun said the company would use the money to hire more engineers to expedite development of its bitcoin payment solutions. The company is also planning to release English versions of its software around the end of April.  Yun added:  ""Also, the ATM is doing good. Many people are happy to visit, purchase and sell bitcoin. Because of our bitcoin ATM, people changed their bitcoin point of view, they can convert [digital currency] to fiat money instantly.""  He promised that Coinplug would reveal more about how much revenue the ATM was generating at a later date, and was interested in selling the technology to buyers overseas.  People in Korea were generally becoming more aware of bitcoin and curious about using it, he said, but some had been put off by negative reports in the media about high profile bitcoin company failures like Mt. Gox. The overall mood towards bitcoin in the country ""may be neutral"", he explained.  Aiming at gaming  As for Coinplug's future directions, Yun said that Korea's reputation as a mobile and online gaming haven represented a huge potential market for bitcoin.  The company is targeting this market, including massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and K-Pop and K-Drama online payment solutions, as well as general social and e-commerce.

42377104,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5qx,1396508402,Swedish Exchange Safello Aims to be 'CoinBase for Europe',"Swedish bitcoin exchange Safello is making the push to establish itself as Europe's leading bitcoin exchange with direct payments now available from 86 European banks in 11 countries.  Safello  is using the instant SOFORT payment system, meaning there will be no need to wait for an international bank transfer to be cleared into the company's accounts.  ""The only way many people were able to buy bitcoin before was via an international bank transfer. But now they can simply do an immediate payment,"" Ludvig Öberg, Vice President of Product Development told CoinDesk.  ""As soon as we get your money, whether it is euro, Swedish krona or pounds, we send you bitcoin. If you send us bitcoin we will send you fiat straight away.”  Safello hopes that the speed and ease of a SOFORT payment will open up the market around Europe and introduce bitcoin trading to new customers.  Strong backing  The move comes only two months after the company secured $600,000 in investment – much of it from major bitcoin players such as the Erik Voorhees of Coinapult, serial bitcoin investor Roger Ver and Nicolas Cary from Blockchain.info.  With such backing, in both finance and in expertise,Safello can be forgiven for talking big. Said Öberg:  ""We are aiming to be the Coinbase for Europe.""  The Safello website will be available in nine local languages and the company hopes to set up local representatives to deal with customer service around Europe in the future.  Meeting a need  According to Öberg there has been a clear gap in the market for a pan-European exchange for some time, and Safello intends to fill that gap as soon as possible.  ""Currently there is no easy bitcoin reseller that is available for everyone. Rather there are a lot of local players but no one is making it easy to buy and sell local for the whole of Europe,"" he said.    The 11 countries which will be available for direct payment via the SOFORT direct payment system are: Belgium, Poland, Spain, Hungary, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France and Austria.    Safello already supports the Dutch payment system iDEAL, as well as SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) payments, and will continue to support international wire transfers.  Opportunity amid crisis  It might seem like a strange time to make a major bitcoin push, since the cryptocurrency has been battered in the eyes of the general public following the much-publicized Mt. Gox bankruptcy.  According to Öberg, however, the Mt. Gox collapse has opened up opportunities for new exchanges like Safello, which transfers the bitcoin to the customers’ wallets without holding any of the BTC themselves.  Safello was founded in Stockholm in August 2013 and quickly grew to become Sweden's leading bitcoin exchange.  In October 2013, it expanded to trade in the Netherlands, the home country of CEO Frank Schuil, and in December 2013 it made news as it unveiled Sweden's first bitcoin ATM.  Swedish entrepreneurs are already behind such Internet success stories as Spotify, Skype and SoundCloud. It remains to be seen if Safello can join this club of Scandinavian trailblazers.  For Öberg the European launch is just the first step. He says he believes Safello is marching towards a “global introduction”.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Jona Kallgren,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/03/swedish-exchange-safello-aims-to-be-coinbase-for-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a42a7caf39de7b8f33c95020cf50c94423c9eb5-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377099,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5jP,1396507636,Libra Promises Bitcoin Tax Service to Ease Compliance With IRS Guidance,"Remember when we wondered whether someone would develop a service to help you keep track of the capital gains on bitcoins? Well, now it turns out that someone has – or, at least, wants to. Libra is a new venture that claims it can help you to keep the IRS happy.  Launched by Jake Benson, a former SAP HCM Consultant for Cap Gemini specialising in US and Canadian payroll, the service wants to enable individuals, small businesses and large enterprises alike to comply with the new IRS regulations.  The IRS notice, announced March 25th, carries significant implications for people using bitcoin, even if they are regular users, rather than investors.  Under the guidance, people spending bitcoin are liable to declare capital gains on any increase in value on those coins. That means if you purchased one bitcoin in early October at $100 and spent it today at $440, then you'd be realising a capital gain of $340.  To add insult to injury, because you hadn't held onto those bitcoins for more than a year and a day, that capital gains tax would be short term, making it equivalent to ordinary income tax. Investor holding onto their coins for longer than that period, however, will pay the long-term rate of 15%.  'Critical issue'  Of course, people don't always spend one whole bitcoin at a time. Instead, they'll acquire and spend portions of a bitcoin over time. That means that technically, they have to keep track of lots of bitcoins that gained different amounts of value over different time periods.  Members of the bitcoin community are unhappy enough about the guidance to have filed a petition about the new guidance.  ""Arguably, this is one of the most critical issues surrounding digital currencies,"" Benson told CoinDesk. He added:  ""When I noticed several months ago there was no comprehensive solution to address taxes, I knew it was an opportunity. Tax software might not be the sexiest business in the industry, but it is the most essential right now.""  Benson, who graduated from the University of Texas with a business degree in 2011, wants to cut through the whole tangled mess. Libra will start by obtaining transaction history for an individual, which he says can be done through automatic and manual means.  Simple solution  Then, the service will calculate the cost basis on a per-transaction level, before distinguishing between transactions subject to short-term or long-term capital gains.  Benson explained:  ""Then, we output the calculated totals, and direct the user to which box to fill in on which tax form – we may even provide automatic form output for ultimate convenience.""  He is hoping to do the whole thing in a minimum of four to five clicks for tax novices, and longer term, wants to integrate with other tax software, including the big consumer titles, but also enterprise ERP systems.  The service will be able to handle book keeping retrospectively, so that people can refile for previous tax years if their bitcoin transactions extend back that far.  Extension 'advisable'  The problem for bitcoin users today is that the tax filing deadline for the IRS is next Tuesday, and LibreTax won't be launching its service until the third quarter.  Theoretically, this means that bitcoin users would have to do a lot of their paperwork themselves in the next few days, if they wanted to stay within the law by following the tax guidance. But Benson has an alternative, he said:  ""Libra for individuals will be ready in the September timeframe. That will be right in time for the extended tax deadline, so we advise everyone to file for an extension this year.""
