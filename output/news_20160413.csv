42426782,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdnh,1460577628,San Francisco Fed Chief: Digital Currencies Could Make Crime 'Easier',"The president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco gave a speech on financial technology earlier this week, pointing to digital currencies as an area of potential risk.  In remarks  , John Williams of the San Francisco Fed noted the proximity of his institution to Silicon Valley, and indicated a desire to engage with developers of FinTech – but suggested that some areas of development are perceived as risky by central bank officials.  He pointed to advanced computing applications as having the potential to ""help overcome"" money laundering and terrorist financing issues, before going on to say that financial compliance can prove to be a cost burden for some institutions.  Williams said:  ""The other side of that coin, of course, is that, left unbridled, the ease and anonymity of some types of FinTech, such as digital currencies, have the potential to make criminal and terrorist activity even easier.""  His speech made no further mention of digital currencies, and Williams closed by suggesting that central bank officials see a need for regulation to prevent ""unintended consequences"" of the growth of financial technology.  ""In that regard, well-designed regulation that protects consumers, fosters inclusionary rather than exclusionary practices, and enhances the fairness and resilience of the financial system should help rather than hinder FinTech’s contribution to creating a better financial system and economy,"" Williams concluded.

42426768,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdNh,1460573061,Regulators: Federal Preemption of State Blockchain Laws Unlikely,"A member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and three state-level regulators discussed blockchain technology at a panel today centered on the future of US FinTech policy.  Held at the Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technology Conference in New York City, the panel provided a window into the complicated series of exchanges – ranging from state-level interactions with citizens to potential top-level federal regulation – that are influencing this discussion.  FDIC associate counsel Adriana Rojas said that while her agency wants to take a leadership position, its interaction with state controllers and private institutions is still in early stages.  Rojas told the audience:  ""We need to be proactive. We need to come to these conferences. I think that’s how regulators can get in front of it. ... We can’t regulate what we don’t know exists.""  Apart from providing the FDIC's view on the industry, the day's panel was rare in that the audience was also given a chance to hear what three specific state representatives had to share on the matter.  Alabama  The sharp discrepancies in how states are treating bitcoin and blockchain firms was perhaps best on display during a talk by Joseph Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission, an independent agency that works with government regulators.  Borg said his state is currently receiving applications from industry businesses that ""run the gamut"" from refined business models, to amateur or even legally dubious proposals.  Though one or two inquiries have come from entrepreneurs using an alternative digital currency, ""only bitcoin"" companies have submitted actual applications, he said.  Borg continued:  ""The industry is fragmented as far as we’re concerned. Many people want to play in the sandbox but many of them aren’t designed to play in the sandbox.""  Borg has been with the Alabama commission for 21 years and says that partnerships have been crucial to his organization's work to understand the still-developing industry.  In addition to attending a training session about blockchain taught by the FDIC, he says the commission has ""agreements"" with FinCEN, the US Treasury and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  Ohio  Elsewhere, the panel showcased the sometimes surprising ways the subject of blockchain is coming to the attention of state regulators.  D Michael Quinn, of Ohio's Division of Securities, said he had received an informational request from the owner of a candle shop who was running a mining operation from his back-office.  The entrepreneur contacted the agency in a bid to sell both mining hardware and shares in mining profits.  Quinn said he unaware of a single application being sent to his agency from the ""blockchain or the ledger industry,"" and that most of the contacts he makes are from individuals who want to let people invest in digital currency without actually owning it.  In one poignant moment of the panel, Quinn said he was unaware any groups that represent the blockchain industry. Panel moderator, Marco Santori, of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, interjected to say that organizations such as the Coin Center could be counted as such industry voices.  Perhaps most notably, however, Quinn said the state hasn’t made any decision on the proper course of regulation, but that that might change as he and his peers “get more educated.”  But as far as following New York’s precedent by establishing a state-specific regulatory regime, he added:  ""I can definitively say that Ohio is not going that direction.""  Idaho  Jim Burns, securities bureau chief at the Idaho Department of Finance, described his state’s interest in blockchain technology as still in early stages.  For example, he said he has mostly met educators and ""enthusiasts"" looking to use the technology not for a financial application, but as a way to streamline business operations.  ""We do get very few inquires about the business solutions side. But many people agree that is an area that won’t be regulated,"" he said.  Burns further indicated he does not believe that non-financial applications of blockchain technology will be regulated.  However, he offered a contrarian view of this proposal, noting that licenses can help existing businesses and startups ""keep competition out"" by increasing the barrier to entry.  Federal pre-emption weighed  ""The f-word,"" as Santori described ""federal pre-emption,"" or the option that the federal government might write laws that supercede state controls, wasn’t an option anyone on the panel viewed as likely.  While Borg said there was a ""good argument"" for simplifying the application process, he said it was unlikely any state would agree to federal controls that impacted their revenue or their ability to serve its citizens.  ""The bottom line is you still have to deal with the folks on the ground,"" he said. ""They are not going to call the federal government when something goes wrong.""  Rojas, who said she wasn’t speaking on behalf of the FDIC, explained that the organization would like to ""maintain a good relationship"" with the states and invited the members of the panel and others to tell federal regulators ""how best to regulate them"".  As part of the FDIC’s research, Rojas said it has engaged in conversations with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS). The FDIC is also currently reviewing a white-paper published by the US Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in March, which called for a balanced approach to regulation.  ""We’re reviewing it very closely,"" Rojas said. ""We’re looking at it and very much in favor of working with the OCC.""

42426780,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdjh,1460567790,Blockchain Investment Fund Seeks $100 Million from Major Banks,"A new investment fund is seeking to raise as much as $100m over the next two years to fuel investments in the blockchain space.  Founded by financial technology consultant Chris Skinner and Singapore-based venture capital firm Life.Sreda, the Banking on Blockchain Fund is hoping to raise $50m by year's end, with an additional $50m to be raised by the end of 2017.  Life.Sreda, whose portfolio focuses primarily on FinTech and payments, has committed $5m thus far, according to a report by Financial News.  Those involved with the new initiative include Thomas Labenbacher, who will serve as managing director of the fund. Labenbacher has previously worked for Fidor Bank and Western Union. David Brear, a former director for consultancy Gartner, will serve as a lead partner for the fund.  The fund is aiming to raise capital from mid-size banks, a process for which Skinner told Financial News would include providing consulting services and research aid to participating banks.  ""We will also provide the banks with research outputs and consulting based on the knowledge gathered from the firms we invest in,"" he said.

42426767,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdLh,1460562030,Banca IMI Researcher: Blockchain Won't Work if Banks Don't Change,"The head of interest rate and credit models at Banca IMI, an investment banking and capital markets subsidiary of Intesa Sanpaolo, has penned a new paper on blockchain technology.  Dedicated to spotlighting ""real business cases"" for the technology, Massimo Morini’s report argues that the lesson that should be learned from cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin is that traditional financial business model needs to be reformed, not just improved.  Morini writes:  ""One crucial misunderstanding here is the idea that blockchain technology can be exported to financial markets as they are to make them more efficient. This is meaningless; blockchain technology was created to change some trust-based business processes to make them less reliant on trust; without structural changes in this direction the best of blockchain technology is lost and just the inefficiencies are left.""  Morini goes on to argue that the financial industry must now be prepared to use trust in a ""totally different way"" and to reimagine existing business processes.  Still, he acknowledges that its efficiencies are not needed in all markets, stating that the financial industry needs to emphasize use cases where risks are outweighed by the cost savings of having less reconciliation and faster settlement. Morini highlights over-the-counter derivatives as an instance of such a market, and analyzes both current and theoretical approaches to its design.  Morini goes on to conclude that new business models based on distributed accounting and blockchain-based smart contracts will require additional regulatory clarity to scale, and that digital currencies or assets will need to be convertible with central bank accounts or at financial institutions.  However, he suggested such changes could come quickly, concluding:  ""Legal and regulatory status could come earlier than expected if regulators see advantages in an architecture which is more transparent and creates less risk than most of the current solutions.""

42426776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdbh,1460552442,How Blockchain Could Make Trusts More Transparent,"A lecturer at the Open University and a guest lecturer at Birkbeck College, University of London, Robert Herian holds a BA in American Studies from King's College, London, and an LLM from Birkbeck College, London.  In this opinion piece, Herian discusses a recent high-profile British scandal and how blockchain could offer a solution to the ethical quandary it raises.  Amid the outcry over British Prime Minister David Cameron's tax affairs, his intervention in 2013 to block EU transparency rules regarding offshore trusts bears more scrutiny. It was decided that trusts should not be held to the same standards as companies when it came to making the end owners and beneficiaries publicly known.  But now the Panama Papers raise important questions as to whether trusts ought to be more open to public scrutiny. A major reason for this relates to fairness when it comes to paying taxes. However, blockchain may provide a solution to this problem, enabling trusts to be more transparent, while ensuring the security of their holdings, too.  Trusts are often highly complex legal arrangements; but they tend to work on the same fundamental basis. First conceived many hundreds of years ago, trusts provide a unique method of property management. This uniqueness relates to how wealth is used, and relies on the separation of beneficial ownership from the responsibilities of property management that come with holding legal title.  Trusts come in both public and private forms. But their history points to an intimate desire for individuals and families to be able to preserve their wealth and, importantly, pass it on to the next generation.  Origin of trusts  One popular story of how trusts came into being involved the Crusaders of the 11th and 12th centuries who, before leaving to fight in the Middle East, arranged for their land to be tended and managed by a friend in trust (a trustee), on behalf of their family (as beneficiaries).  This method of property management and transfer had not previously been recognized by Common Law, which viewed the friend as taking the land absolutely when given charge of it.  But Equity, at the time a separate body of law in England and Wales, saw things differently.  Based on fairness, Equity developed rules that protected the beneficial interest of the family, while at the same time applying strict fiduciary duties and obligations of trust and loyalty to the friend. This meant that the friend had to look after the property as they had been directed to by the Crusader.  Trusts now appear in the form of international commercial investment and trade vehicles; public and private pension funds; and charities, to name but three of the more economically significant.  Yet, those same foundations and consensual principles between the Crusader, the friend and the family fundamentally remain.  This means that trusts conform to traditional privacy models found elsewhere in banking and finance, insofar as they shield from public view the identities of the objects of the trust, as well as the nature of many of the trust’s investments and transactions.  It is primarily in regard to where this ""shield"" is positioned that greater levels of transparency apply on the blockchain.  Smart contracts  As part of some recent research, I have been considering how blockchain technology (most famous for its role in the cryptocurrency bitcoin) and other legal-like processes that blockchain facilitates, namely computer programs called ""smart contracts"", might be mapped onto trusts law and trusteeship.  The key to the question of whether blockchain can make trusts more open to the public lies in its fundamental characteristics.  Blockchain is essentially a peer-to-peer, distributed ledger system that is able to register information in an immutable way. This could take the form of a register of legal titles to property and beneficial interests, both of which are central to trusts.  In this sense, blockchain is a highly reliable witness regarding the information it deals with. Furthermore, as part of the process of adding or registering information on blockchain, that information is announced publicly, providing an entire, transparent history capable of public scrutiny.  This does not mean that the blockchain is not private – cultural as well as commercial sensitivity around the privacy of financial information can still be maintained – but it is achieved in a different way.  Using two sets of encrypted keys, one public and one private, to validate transactions provides the possibility for secure, private spaces that nevertheless remain in public view.  Unlike other methods that maintain privacy of investments and transactions by shielding the entire process from public view, including the identities of individual parties, the blockchain breaks the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.  So a trust could take the form of a ""private space"". More specifically what is legally defined as a trust could be mapped onto the blockchain processes behind that ""private space"". This would create, what I call a ""smart trust"" – a secure private space, yet one primed for public scrutiny.  The potential of the blockchain as described here is something of a ""third way"" to existing privacy models.  Because trusts come in many shapes and sizes, blockchain ""smart trusts"" would undeniably suit some types more than others – it is not a case of one size fits all. While trusts have a very long history, the blockchain has a very short one. It will take time to understand if and how the two might work together.  But if greater levels of honesty and transparency are needed, the blockchain could provide an answer.
