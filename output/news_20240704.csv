According to a crypto analyst, Bitcoin faces significant moves ahead and determining the direction of this momentum is crucial. BTC Retests $60,000 Support For The 9th Time In an X (formerly Twitter) post published on July 3, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Dana Crypto Trades’ declared that Bitcoin has successfully completed its ninth test for the $60,000 support region. A support level is a price threshold where assets tend to stop falling, signaling the potential for a bounce back in the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP Price Attempts Bullish Decoupling Amid Major Developments The crypto analyst disclosed that Bitcoin has maintained a support level of $60,000 for approximately nine months, and during those months it has undergone multiple price tests. While the cryptocurrency showed strength by sustaining this crucial level, Dana Crypto Trades highlighted that the support level eventually failed, resulting in substantial price declines for Bitcoin. He noted that the distinctive difference between previous price tests and the recent one was that many crypto investors and enthusiasts believed that the $60,000 support level would be Bitcoin’s bottom, anticipating that it would halt further price declines. The crypto analyst revealed that presently opinions seem to be divided about the direction Bitcoin will take with this new retest, revealing that some individuals believe that $60,000 would hold as the support level, while others remain skeptical. Highlighting Bitcoin’s current lack of momentum, Dana Crypto Trades explained that prices of cryptocurrencies often consolidate around specific levels for an extended period, showing minimal upward or downward movement. He disclosed that the overall high timeframe trend was important in determining the future direction of Bitcoin’s price. Additionally, He stressed the importance of not dismissing any support or resistance level of Bitcoin until its price has completely and undoubtedly broken through on a higher timeframe. The analyst added that after a period of consolidation, large price movements are often expected in a cryptocurrency. This is because the market builds substantial momentum during the consolidation phase, resulting in a significant breakout or breakdown. Analyst Predicts Major Price Swings For Bitcoin In one of his most recent X posts, Dana Crypto Trades shared a BTC price chart, noting that Bitcoin volatility indicators have become less erratic lately. He disclosed that typically when volatility drops to such low levels, it often signals a significant price movement. As a result, the analyst has suggested that Bitcoin could be getting ready for a major price swing. He also emphasized that while the indicators signal an upcoming big move for Bitcoin, they do not specify the direction of the movement, highlighting the uncertainty of whether BTC will rise or fall.

Similarly, Bitcoin (BTC), the market leader, has shown patterns that traders must understand as they navigate the current market conditions. Related Reading: Cardano ADA Trades Below The $0.41 Mark, Will It Break The Barriers? Is Cardano (ADA) On The Brink of a Parabolic Rise? Cardano, often lauded for its technological foundation, has recently caught the attention of experts predicting an imminent rally. Dan Gamberdello, a prominent advocate for Cardano, has publicly stated his expectations for an “explosive” growth phase for ADA. Analyzing the chart shared by Gamberdello, ADA’s price of $0.410 stabilizes above critical moving averages, which Gamberdello interprets as a bullish signal. Traders often use the 200-period and 50-period moving averages to gauge long-term and short-term market trends, respectively. Both indicators suggest a bullish outlook for ADA in the short term. Additionally, a pattern analysis of ADA compared to BTC on the weekly timeframe from another analyst named Sssebi on X further supports this bullish view, drawing parallels with previous cycles that led to significant rallies. His technical analysis reinforces Sssebi is optimistic outlook, which reveals that ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) levels indicate it is currently oversold, historically a precursor to substantial price increases.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recently experienced a notable decline, dipping below the critical $60,000 mark to about $57,257. This downward trend is seen concurrently in the broader crypto market, including ADA’s recent dip to $0.3789. However, popular market analysts have highlighted significant technical movements, such as BTC/USD crossing its 200-day moving average for the first time in ten months, suggesting potential market reversal points.

30423396,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627800,1720126842,"Why Did Bitcoin Plunge Under $58,000? On-Chain Data Says This","Bitcoin has observed a crash below the $58,000 level today. Here’s what could be a potential cause for it, according to on-chain data. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Just Taken Large Profits As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin long-term holders harvested a large amount of profits during the latest price drawdown. Related Reading: These Are The Altcoins In Buy Zone, Analytics Firm Reveals The on-chain metric of interest here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR), which basically tells about whether the BTC investors are selling/transferring their coins at a profit or loss. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are realizing a net profit with their selling right now. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold implies the dominance of loss-taking in the market. In the context of the current topic, the SOPR of a specific segment of the user base is of interest: the long-term holders (LTHs). This cohort includes the investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. The LTHs are considered to be the resolute side of the market, as they rarely sell regardless of whatever may be going on in the wider market. As such, the times that they do sell can be all the more noteworthy. It would appear that the recent Bitcoin market conditions have managed to break even these diamond hands, as the below chart for their SOPR suggests. As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH SOPR has seen a high density of spikes above the 1 mark during the past day. This would suggest that these HODLers have moved some coins that were previously carrying significant profits. More particularly, the indicator hit a value of more than 10 during a lot of these spikes, implying that this group realized profits equal to over ten times the losses during those transactions. As the LTH SOPR spikes came just before BTC’s descent towards the levels under $58,000, it would seem possible that this profit-taking push from these normally-resolute investors was at least in part behind the crash. Another indicator, the Bitcoin Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB), has revealed the breakdown of these LTH transactions. From the chart, it’s apparent that the most active LTH segment during this selloff was the 5-year to 7-year group, meaning that most of the coins sold were previously dormant between 5 and 7 years ago. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Next Bitcoin Target Is $78,700 If BTC Breaks This Resistance It’s hard to say why these old entities have suddenly decided to sell after sitting out a whole cycle, but if this is the start of a selling spree from them, then things might get even worse for Bitcoin. BTC Price Bitcoin had very briefly slipped under the $57,000 level during the latest crash, but the asset appears to have made some recovery since then, as it’s back at $57,700.

30420635,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627844,1720123201,"Worldcoin Sentiment Improves, But March Highs Remain A Distant Dream","Worldcoin (WLD) has been on a rollercoaster ride the past few months. After hitting an all-time high of nearly $12 in March, the coin embarked on a downward spiral, plummeting over 60% in the last three months. This dramatic drop has made investors jittery, with whispers of regulatory woes and profit-taking swirling around the beleaguered token. Related Reading: Ethereum DApps On Fire: Volume Soars Over 90% — Good For ETH Price? However, a recent surge in price suggests a potential comeback story in the making for the token powering the digital identity application. As of today, WLD sits at $2.27, a modest yet significant rise compared to its November 2023 lows. This upward trend has analysts cautiously optimistic, but several factors could determine whether WLD rebounds or retraces its steps. From Gloom To Hope: A Shift In Sentiment Social media sentiment surrounding Worldcoin paints a fascinating picture. Just a month ago, the online conversation was dominated by negativity, with the “Weighted Sentiment” metric reflecting a decidedly gloomy outlook. This negativity likely stemmed from the sharp price decline, leading many to question the project’s future. However, a recent shift in sentiment has emerged. The negativity has dissipated, replaced by a cautious optimism. Online chatter now reflects a “wait and see” approach, with some investors expressing renewed interest in the project. This positive sentiment could prove crucial in WLD’s potential recovery. A bullish online community can translate to increased demand for the token, propelling its price upwards. This sentiment shift can be attributed to a few factors. Firstly, the recent price increase has undoubtedly boosted morale. When investors see a token clawing its way back from the abyss, it fosters a sense of hope and encourages them to hold onto their holdings. Secondly, the oversold signal from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) might be interpreted as a buying opportunity by savvy investors, further contributing to the positive buzz. Bulls Charge Ahead, But Can They Stay The Course? Another interesting development is the activity of “whales,” large investors who can significantly impact a token’s price. According to the Bulls and Bears Indicator, there’s been a surge in buying activity from these whales. This suggests a renewed confidence in WLD’s potential, and if this buying pressure continues, it could propel the token towards the coveted $3 mark in the short term. However, there are potential roadblocks ahead. The RSI, while currently indicating a healthy balance, could swing back towards overbought territory. This would signal a potential retracement, where investors who bought at lower prices might cash out, causing a temporary dip. Additionally, if the bulls lose steam and selling pressure mounts, the recent gains could be quickly eroded. Related Reading: Bitcoin Examined: These Critical Points Are ‘Very Bad’ For BTC, Analyst Says Worldcoin Price Forecast: A Bullish Long-Term View Looking beyond the immediate future, several price prediction models offer a glimpse into WLD’s long-term prospects. One such model estimates a 48% increase in the next seven days, potentially pushing the price to $3.56. This short-term prediction hinges on sustained buying pressure and a healthy balance between bulls and bears. The long-term outlook appears even more bullish. Some analysts predict a price of $6.41 in one year, representing a significant increase from current levels. This optimistic view is likely based on the continued development of the Worldcoin identity application and its potential for widespread adoption. While the future remains uncertain, the recent developments surrounding WLD offer a glimmer of hope. A positive shift in sentiment, increased buying activity, and a potentially bullish long-term outlook paint a cautiously optimistic picture for the embattled token.

This follows the flagship crypto’s recent decline below $60,000. BTC’s CME Gap Has Closed Van de Poppe revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s CME gap has closed and added that it is time for the crypto token to enjoy a relief bounce from its current price level. From the chart he shared, Bitcoin will reclaim $60,000 as support before moving further to the upside. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Starts July On A High Note: Burn Rate Surges 16,854%, Trading Volume Rises 170% Crypto analyst Mkybull Crypto also confirmed that the CME gap has been filled. Like Van de Poppe’s prediction, the analyst expects Bitcoin to reclaim the $60,000 range and possibly continue its upward trend. Mikybull Crypto revealed that Bitcoin has completed its inverse head-and-shoulder pattern on the daily chart. He predicted that the flagship crypto could reach a minimum breakout target of $70,000 when it successfully breaks out above $62,000. Mikybull Crypto also mentioned that the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator indicates that a bullish cross is imminent for Bitcoin. He noted that this indicates strength for the flagship crypto and that its price is poised to rise. The crypto analyst is also undeterred by Bitcoin’s recent underperformance as he is confident that a parabolic rally will soon enough. Contrary to what some might think, he claimed that the cycle top isn’t in yet and that this is simply a “final shakeout” before the market top is in. Based on the chart he shared, he predicts that Bitcoin will still climb above $100,000 and possibly reach $130,000. The analyst had previously mentioned between $138,000 and $150,000 as “optimal targets for Bitcoin in this bull run.” What Next For Bitcoin? With Bitcoin failing to hold above $60,000, the bearish calls are becoming louder in the crypto community. Some predict that the flagship crypto could drop to the $40,000 range soon enough. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto claimed that “there is still a lot that must be done” for Bitcoin to drop that range, suggesting that it is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Related Reading: XRP Price Attempts Bullish Decoupling Amid Major Developments He also provided insights into what will likely happen to Bitcoin at its current price level. According to CrediBULL Crypto, there is a chance that Bitcoin will wick the $58,000 low, hold a higher low above the $56,000 low, and then reverse from there. He further raised the possibility of Bitcoin dropping into the $53,000 demand area if the $56,000 lows are breached. Additionally, the crypto analyst mentioned that $40,000 could become possible if Bitcoin fails to hold above $53,000. However, he believes this scenario of Bitcoin dropping to $40,000 is “the least likely to actually play out.” He remarked that this isn’t something anyone should be placing “heavy weight on at this time.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ICO | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-closes-cme-gap/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Gox has initiated the process of repaying creditors by transferring a nominal amount of Bitcoin to one of the designated exchanges. This development follows months of speculation and planning concerning the disbursement of approximately $8.2 billion in Bitcoin owed to creditors of the defunct exchange. Are Mt. Gox Bitcoin Repayments Beginning? Early today, three wallets historically linked to Mt. Gox executed three transactions. The most significant of these involved the transfer of $24 in Bitcoin to a wallet which then proceeded to send these funds to Bitbank’s hot wallet. Bitbank, listed as one of the exchanges authorized to facilitate repayments, alongside Kraken, Bitstamp, SBI VC Trade, and Bitgo, is set to make these funds available to its customers within a timeframe extending up to 90 days from receipt. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Massively Crash Like In May 2021, Warns Fund Manager However, there is some uncertainty surrounding these transactions, as the funds were not moved directly from the primary Mt. Gox wallets. Observers speculate whether this activity could be a preliminary test ahead of larger transfers intended for creditor repayment. The Mt. Gox Rehabilitation Trustee has previously indicated that the repayment process was scheduled to commence from the beginning of July, although specific dates for the transfers have not been disclosed publicly. The other two transactions, one transfer of BTC worth $3.00 and another worth $0.32, was transferred to a new wallet. This subtle movement of funds occurs amidst a turbulent period for Bitcoin, which has seen its price plummet by more than 20% since reaching $72,000, now hovering around $57,700. What To Expect Peter Chung, Head of Research at Presto Research, recently provided insights into the broader implications of the Mt. Gox repayments. He outlined the expected dynamics between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), predicting significant trading opportunities. “The Mt. Gox’s Rehabilitation Trustee plans to distribute multi-billion dollars worth of BTCs and BCHs to the Mt. Gox creditors between July 1st and October 31st, 2024. This will likely alter supply/demand dynamics in BTC and BCH during this four-month period, potentially opening up a pair trading opportunity,” he stated. Related Reading: Longest Miner Capitulation Since 2022 Signals Potential Bitcoin Rally Ahead Chung emphasized the disparate impacts on BTC and BCH: “Our analysis shows that the selling pressure for BCH will be four times larger than for BTC – i.e., 24% of the daily trading value for BCH vs. 6% of the daily trading value for BTC. This differential reflects varying investor bases, with BCH’s being considerably weaker and more likely to sell off holdings.” He advised traders on potential strategies: “Long BTC perpetuals paired with short BCH perpetuals is the most efficient market-neutral way to express this view, barring funding rate risk.” For those concerned about volatile funding rates, Chung recommended exploring “other approaches, such as short-term futures or borrowing BCH in the spot market.” At press time, BTC traded at $57,727.

30408778,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627647,1720107048,Solana Meme Coins Outperform Ethereum 800% YTD – Top Winners Revealed,"In the first quarter of the year, Solana-based meme coins have emerged as the frontrunners, surpassing Ethereum’s meme coin ecosystem and artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, according to a recent report by market data platform CoinMarketCap. This shift in popularity signifies a change in dynamics within the cryptocurrency market, with meme coins gaining traction and challenging previously dominant narratives such as smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Solana Ecosystem Dominates Growth Chart The CoinMarketCap report highlights that the Solana ecosystem has consistently topped the growth chart for the past eight months, with over 20 new tokens introduced in Q2 alone. Ethereum’s ecosystem followed closely behind with 14 new tokens, while Derivatives and Stablecoins witnessed relatively lesser growth with 5 and 4 new tokens, respectively. This surge in Solana-based token offerings indicates a growing interest in the network and its potential. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Inches Closer To All-Time High – Will TON Hit $8 This Week? Solana’s meme coin ecosystem, in particular, has gained significant momentum in price performance and popularity since October 2023. Although Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain, Solana’s growing prominence suggests a noteworthy trend in the crypto space. Interestingly, SOL memes have significantly outperformed ETH memes, delivering an average return of 8,469% compared to 962% for Ethereum, as seen in the chart below. As “speculative capital” from other chains rushed into Solana, attracted by the explosive rallies of tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK), more meme coins experienced price surges, attracting additional attention and capital. The top winners in the meme coin space include the cat characters MEW, POPCAT, and Book of Meme (MEME). These tokens have outperformed even the most popular ones like WIF, BONK, Ethereum’s Pepe coin (PEPE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Notably, political memes also emerged as a popular subcategory, with the leading MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin gaining over 5100% year-to-date, largely due to vocal support for crypto from former President Donald Trump and the acceptance of crypto for campaign donations. Ethereum Tops Fee Income Rankings Despite Solana’s significant gains, Ethereum continues to dominate the Layer 1 (L1) smart contracts market, representing 62.11% of the major L1s. The report notes that Ethereum’s recent milestone was propelled by the SEC’s approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs. However, Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Solana have also gained traction, adding $42 billion and $18 billion to their market share among L1 networks. Solana currently leads with over 1.6 million active daily addresses, followed by BNB with 1 million active addresses. Related Reading: Avalanche On The Verge: Will AVAX Break Out And Reach $65? In Q2, Ethereum experienced record low gas fees, reaching levels not seen since 2020 due to the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions and the market excitement surrounding Solana-based meme coins. Despite representing 62% of the market cap among major L1s, Ethereum accounted for 70% of the daily revenue, generating approximately $2.7 million. Solana ranked second with around $900,000 in daily revenue. According to Lookonchain, Ethereum topped the fee income rankings in the past year with $2.728 billion, followed by Bitcoin with $1.302 billion. Other notable networks include Tron ($459.39 million), Solana ($241.29 million), Binance Smart Chain ($176.56 million), Avalanche ($68.83 million), zkSync Era ($59.77 million), Optimism ($40.4 million), and Polygon ($23.91 million). Despite both platforms experiencing success in various financial metrics and growth charts, Solana’s native token, SOL, has significantly outperformed Ethereum’s ETH token. As of the current trading price, SOL is valued at $143.25, showcasing a year-to-date growth of 650%. ETH has seen a more modest surge of 68% during the same time frame, currently trading at $3,310.

We are seeing many exciting product launches and regulatory advancements. I look forward to continuing to provide content to our valued audience and to keeping them informed of timely and relevant developments.  In today’s issue, André Dragosch, head of research at ETC Group, discusses the volatility of crypto assets, including bitcoin and ether and how they compare to other emerging technology investments. Bryan Courchesne, CEO of DAIM, explains how advisors can navigate the volatility of crypto within client portfolios.  Happy Independence Day to our American readers.  – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Are Crypto Assets Too Volatile?  Traditional financial investors tend to shun crypto assets because of the high volatility.  To be fair, the volatility of crypto assets is relatively high compared to traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds and most commodities.  Over the past three months, the annualized volatility of bitcoin and ether has been around 45% to 50%, respectively, while the volatility of the S&P 500 was around 15%.  A recent survey by Fidelity among institutional investors also identified high volatility as the No. 1 most-cited barrier keeping investors from allocating to crypto assets.  However, the truth is that high returns come with high risks, i.e. volatility.  Put differently, where there is growth, there is volatility.  Most equity investors know this since most high-growth mega-cap stocks like Tesla still tend to have high double-digit volatility.  Will tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) take off, and will Ethereum be the go-to platform?  Will bitcoin replace the U.S. Dollar as a global reserve currency?  Although these types of scenarios have become increasingly likely over the past few years, there remains uncertainty around these questions.  Uncertainty tends to create volatility.  The history of Amazon holds important lessons in this regard. In the late 1990s, most Wall Street analysts thought “selling books online” was a silly idea. There was a lot of uncertainty about whether online retailing and the internet in general would eventually become mainstream.  In the same way that the uncertainty around the technology has declined, the volatility in Amazon’s stock price has declined over time.  Few investors seem to remember that Amazon’s stock used to record above 300% in annualized volatility in the late 1990s; today, the volatility is well below 50%.  We have already observed a similar structural decline in volatility in the case of crypto assets.  One reason is that bitcoin’s scarcity has increased with every halving, making it more “gold-like.” Halvings are best understood as a supply shock that reduces the supply growth of bitcoins by half (-50%). Hence, the character of bitcoin as an asset class has changed over time  While bitcoin’s volatility was around 200% during the first epoch – the roughly four-year timespan between the cryptocurrency's pre-programmed ""halvings"" of miner rewards – until 2012, it has decreased to only 45% more recently. Similar observations can be made regarding ether.  In a global 60/40 stock-bond portfolio, the maximum Sharpe Ratio is achieved by increasing the bitcoin allocation to around 14% at the expense of the global equity weighting.  The Sharpe Ratio of major crypto assets like bitcoin or ether is significantly above 1, which means that investors are more than compensated for exposing themselves to higher volatility.  Looking ahead, the decline in volatility is bound to continue with every new halving. The next one is scheduled to happen in 2028.  Increasing retail and institutional adoption of this technology is also bound to decrease volatility structurally over time.  The reason is that increasing heterogeneity among investors will lead to more dissent between buyers and sellers, which dampens volatility – the essence of Edgar Peters's Fractal Market Hypothesis.  Just remember: Where there is growth, there is volatility.  - André Dragosch, head of research, ETC Group  Ask an Expert  Q. How can advisors help their clients navigate crypto volatility?  A. Crypto, in its short history, has undoubtedly been a volatile asset. But that does not mean that it should be ignored by advisors. Advisors should not consider assets in isolation but rather how they interact with others in a well-balanced portfolio. When creating a portfolio that can deliver long-term results, diversification is key. Asset prices move in cycles, sometimes together but more or less distinct. This can be measured by an asset’s correlation to other assets. A lower correlation means assets are less likely to move together. If one asset is up 35% in the year, another asset might only be up 4%. If assets are negatively correlated, one asset will be up in a given period while the other will be down. This is important in the context of an investment portfolio because while assets may be volatile themselves, including them with other less correlated assets can lower the overall volatility of a portfolio.  Q. Is there a correlation between crypto’s volatility and other assets?  A. With respect to correlation, a volatile asset like crypto is actually very important to decrease the overall volatility of a portfolio. Lowering the overall volatility of a portfolio is important as it helps smooth investment returns over time. This is important for many reasons. For example, an investor could have significant and unpredictable liquidity needs. If they have a portfolio of highly correlated assets and those assets are experiencing a period of poor returns, they would be withdrawing a larger percentage of their portfolio compared to a portfolio that included less correlated assets. Crypto, having a low correlation with traditional assets, could help in this regard. Its volatility has historically been positively skewed so even though it has big swings, when all other assets are down it can provide a ballast to your portfolio. Smoothing returns also helps from a cognitive perspective for most investors. People can get too emotional when looking at their portfolio’s performance. Big price moves have a visceral effect where large moves up make people want to buy more (usually right before a drop) and large moves down make people discouraged and pull money out (right before performance rebounds). Including at least a small portion of (less-correlated) crypto in a portfolio smooths the returns of a portfolio so when investors check in, they see more modest gains or losses. This helps keep their portfolio out of sight and out of mind which generally improves the chances of long-term success. Crypto, while volatile, should not be viewed in isolation but in the context of how it can help create a truly diversified portfolio that will help create long-term wealth for investors.  - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Keep Reading  Revised spot Ether ETF date: the U.S. SEC has requested issuers submit revised filings by July 8.

With the Bitcoin price continuing to fall from support after support, tens of thousands of traders have lost their positions, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in just the last day alone. Crypto Market Liquidations Cross $290 Million In the last 24 hours, the Bitcoin price has been crashing, eventually falling below $57,000 before recovering again. However, the damage has already been done, with long traders suffering the brunt of the losses over the last day. Related Reading: 200 Million XRP Tokens On The Move, Where Are They Headed? According to data from Coinglass, there has been $292.8 million worth of crypto liquidations in the last day. In total, 105,458 traders have been liquidated, with 88.61% of them being long traders. The majority of these liquidations have happened in the last 12 hours after Bitcoin fell from $61,000 to $57,000 with $204.97 million in liquidations. Bitcoin alone has seen $91.7 million in liquidations, with second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, following being with $69.86 million worth of liquidations. The single largest liquidation event took place on the Huobi crypto exchange across the BTC-USD pair, where a single liquidation call saw $10.49 million lost. Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, recorded $122.67 million in liquidations, OKX exchange saw $89.83 million in liquidations, and Huobi exchange saw $42.07 million in liquidations. Coming in fourth and fifth place is Bybit and CoinEx at $23.04 million and $9.42 million, respectively. Bitcoin Recovery Could Change Trajectory Of Liquidations As mentioned above, the crypto market liquidations have been mostly dominated by long trades given that the Bitcoin price has continued to crash. However, with the price showing a tendency to bounce back up, rising above $57,900 at the time of this writing, shorts are beginning to feel the heat. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Starts July On A High Note: Burn Rate Surges 16,854%, Trading Volume Rises 170% Coinglass data shows that long liquidations have fallen from 88.61% in the last 24 hours to 56.48% in the last hour. If the price continues to rise, then short traders, spurred on by the bearish wave, could suffer more crashes from here. Despite positive sentiment being eroded, the Bitcoin daily trading volume has seen a notable 50% jump, bringing it to $37.59 billion. So far, bulls seem to be developing support, which makes it the point to hold if the recovery is to continue from here. Bitcoin is currently trading at $57,909, with a 3.87% decline in the last day.

Analyst Predicts $90,000 After $58K Drop","The recent dip in Bitcoin (BTC) might be a temporary hiccup, according to Lark Davis, a popular crypto analyst. Davis is calling for a significant upswing in Bitcoin’s value in the coming weeks, with a target of $90,000 by year’s end. This optimistic outlook comes amidst a wave of optimism surrounding institutional investment and the potential arrival of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Related Reading: Ethereum DApps On Fire: Volume Soars Over 90% — Good For ETH Price? Institutional Investors Set To Supercharge The Market Davis believes a surge of institutional money is poised to enter the crypto market, acting as a major catalyst for the predicted rally. He points to Standard Chartered Bank’s projection of Bitcoin reaching a staggering $100,000 by August as a sign of growing institutional confidence. While he offers a slightly more conservative prediction of $90,000, his focus lies on the long-term impact of this institutional influx. The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs is another factor fueling Davis’s bullish sentiment. These investment vehicles would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of directly acquiring and storing the cryptocurrency. Davis argues that the ease of access offered by ETFs could attract a significant amount of new capital, further propelling Bitcoin’s price upwards. Beyond Bitcoin: A Banner Year For Altcoins? Davis’s bullish outlook extends beyond Bitcoin, encompassing a significant portion of the altcoin market. He anticipates a substantial influx of capital into Ethereum (ETH) on the heels of upcoming spot ETFs. Solana (SOL) is another coin on Davis’s radar, with its position as a leader in blockchain development and market momentum making it a strong contender for growth. Technical Hurdles Remain: Can The Bulls Break Through? While Davis’s predictions paint a rosy picture, technical indicators suggest there might be some resistance to overcome before the party starts. The recent price rejection at the $63,956 level and bearish signals from technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest there could be some short-term headwinds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Examined: These Critical Points Are ‘Very Bad’ For BTC, Analyst Says However, Davis remains optimistic. If Bitcoin can overcome the $72,000 resistance level, a Q4 bull run could be triggered, potentially sending shockwaves through the entire crypto market. A Climb Or A Cliffhanger? Meanwhile, NewsBTC’s analysis of Glassnode’s data reveals an increase in BTC’s new addresses, potentially indicating a rise in user interest. For the bulls to charge forward, a daily close above the $63,950 resistance level is crucial. This could trigger a 5% rise and a retest of the $67,140 weekly resistance. If momentum indicators like the RSI and Awesome Oscillator turn bullish, an additional 6% rally to $71,200, the weekly resistance, could be on the cards. However, a drop below $58,300 and a formation of a lower low could signal persisting bearish sentiment, potentially leading to a 3% decline and a revisit of the May low of $56,520.

Should they take it? The Ethereum blockchain offers diverse applications such as Decentralized Finance, Gaming, Digital Art, and Gambling. Ether (ETH) acts as the fuel for these activities. Despite its potential, Ethereum's applications are still in their infancy. I also think Ethereum usage has somewhat stagnated in recent years when looking at on-chain data. I believe investing in ETH is suitable for risk-prone investors willing to hold for at least five years, while those uncomfortable with losing capital should avoid it. Understanding the crypto trilemma and Ethereum's approach to decentralization, security, and scalability is crucial for evaluating its investment potential. In this article, I describe the Ethereum ecosystem, its use cases and whether or not investors should consider exposure to Ether ( ETH-USD ), in my opinion. This is not a technical piece, but an article aimed at explaining Ethereum to non-technical but financially savvy folks. I invite readers interested in ETH to do their own due diligence and research further before taking a final decision on whether to invest. Thesis: Ether is digital oil for limited applications, but a high-risk investment worth considering One narrative about Ether (ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) is that it represents “digital oil”, as opposed to Bitcoin representing “digital gold”. I think this narrative has some limitations, but it is overall a good way to understand what Ethereum is in a nutshell. The Ethereum ecosystem today is the second-largest crypto platform (ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind Bitcoin). Applications of the Ethereum platform range from Decentralized Finance to Gaming, Digital Art and Gambling. I will cover these in detail in the article. In this context, ETH is the “fuel” that allows these applications to take place on the Ethereum blockchain. Stretching the “digital oil” narrative, I’d say Ethereum is like oil you can only use for certain applications. You might power your lawn mower with it, but you won't be able to drive a truck. To be fair, some of the applications of Ethereum, and especially Decentralized Finance, have the potential to disrupt entire industries and be the basis of a new digital economy, often referred to as “Web3”. However, when simply looking at the scale of today’s Ethereum ecosystem there is no doubt in my mind that applications are still limited compared to “web 2.0”. In this current digital era, dominated by centralized apps and digital ecosystems, Ethereum's uses are simply not as widespread. Ethereum usage has also somewhat stagnated in the past couple of years when looking at on-chain data. I believe the key issue with Ethereum today from an investment perspective is that its applications - albeit truly fascinating - are still in their infancy. It remains to be seen whether or not, for example, traditional financial institutions can adopt Web3 - and to what extent. Recommending exposure to ETH depends on an investor’s risk appetite. Unlike Bitcoin, which I think is easier to understand as a potential global reserve asset, assessing the risks of investing in the Ethereum ecosystem is more challenging as it requires at least some degree of understanding of the technology. I believe a moderate exposure to ETH, as a new technology and a platform with great potential, is beneficial for risk-prone investors willing to put capital at risk and hold for at least five years. As a user of the Ethereum ecosystem, I would rather invest in ETH to gain exposure to blockchain as a technological trend, rather than blockchain thematic ETFs. That's why I have a position in Ether that is roughly 25% that of my Bitcoin position. Bitcoin is my single largest overall investment. However, Investors who are uncomfortable with losing their capital should refrain from investing in ETH, in my view. The (very) basics of the Ethereum blockchain Note: this section covers the very basics of Ethereum and the blockchain technology. If you are already familiar with cryptocurrencies, you might want to skip it and go to my next section, where I cover what I believe are the main applications of the Ethereum platform today. The first fundamental concept to understand is the difference between Ethereum and Ether. Ethereum is the blockchain platform that supports various applications (which I will cover in the next section). ETH is the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, acting as the “fuel” needed to run the blockchain. Investing in ETH is often simplified as “investing in Ethereum”, but investing in Ethereum can take different forms. The most obvious one is indeed to buy the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, which “powers” the entire ecosystem. But investing in Ethereum could also mean being actively involved within the many applications of the Ethereum ecosystem. In this article, I will discuss the merits (and risks) of investing in Ether. When referring to Ethereum as an ecosystem, I will interchangeably use words such as Ethereum “platform”, “ecosystem”, “network” or “blockchain”. Readers who are not familiar with cryptocurrencies might wonder what exactly blockchain is. The simplest way to think about blockchain, in my view, is as a decentralized database or a decentralized, very powerful computer. Unlike a traditional database hosted on one machine, the Ethereum blockchain is decentralized and “hosted” by the participants of the blockchain. Any operation (transaction) on the blockchain must be validated on the blockchain itself. For Ethereum, this is done using a “Proof-of-Stake” protocol. Proof-of-Stake involves validators who need to “stake” Ether. Staking Ether means locking it up for a period of time, allowing it to serve as a deposit or reward when transactions occur. In this sense, Ether is the “fuel” of Ethereum. To note, up until 2022 the Ethereum blockchain used a “Proof of Work'' protocol, similar to that of Bitcoin. In the past, instead of staking cryptocurrency, validators on the Ethereum blockchain needed to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate a transaction. I will not expand on the reasons why the switch was made in this article, if not just by mentioning that participants in the ecosystems recognized it as a more energy efficient and scalable technology. I will cover these topics again later in the article, when discussing the “crypto trilemma”. What is the Ethereum platform for? Many articles discussing use cases for the Ethereum ecosystem can be found online. I believe most of them are rather confusing, because they tend to mix actual applications with technologies enabled by the Ethereum blockchain. Also, they sometimes mention futuristic applications that are just wishful thinking at the time of writing. I am a user of the Ethereum ecosystem myself, and below are what I personally see as the 4 main use cases for the platform today. Disclaimer : I have no affiliation whatsoever with any platform, project, or legal entity mentioned in this article. Any platforms mentioned are included solely for informational purposes and based on my personal knowledge of the Ethereum ecosystem. If you are interested in investing or exploring the Ethereum ecosystem, I highly recommend conducting your own research. None of my advice should be considered financial or legal advice. The first, and most important use case in my view, is Decentralized Finance (DeFi) . DeFi is an alternative financial system built on the blockchain that operates without financial intermediaries. DeFi allows users to conduct financial transactions like lending, borrowing, trading and earning interest through smart contracts (contracts that self-execute on the blockchain) and decentralized platforms. In my view, DeFi projects today are mostly within the crypto world itself. In other terms, I have seen very few applications of DeFi that go beyond lending, borrowing or earning cryptocurrencies. Examples of well established DeFi projects include: MakerDAO, a decentralized organization that allows users to create and manage the DAI stablecoin. UniSwap, a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets without intermediaries. Compound Finance, a platform where users can supply their crypto to liquidity pools and receive interest, or borrow against their crypto holdings by paying interest. There are also cases of DeFi being used instead of Traditional Finance (referred to in the crypto world as “TradFi”). Specifically, some financial institutions are bringing real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain to make them tradeable on the blockchain. This process is known as the “tokenization” of assets. In 2018, for example, Austria issued EUR 1.5 Billion in sovereign bonds using the Ethereum blockchain. A more recent example regards Hamilton Lane, a private equity firm that has tokenized $ 2.1 Billion in RWAs using Polygon, an Ethereum “layer 2” blockchain. The use cases and examples of DeFi adoption are truly fascinating. However, in my opinion, DeFi has not yet significantly replaced traditional finance applications. I believe that when institutions ""tokenize"" real-world assets, they do it to attract crypto enthusiasts and find new investors, rather than to leverage blockchain technology for their existing, non-crypto-friendly clients. I will cover my thoughts on Ethereum adoption in one of the next chapters. The second use case of the Ethereum Blockchain concerns online gaming . Gaming on the blockchain has an overall similar user experience as traditional in-browser or mobile gaming. The main difference in my view is the scarcity and ownership element. Games on the blockchain can offer unique digital items, using Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs). Players can own, trade, and sell in-game assets using the blockchain. This creates opportunities to earn real value from their virtual experiences and enhances transparency in gaming. There are many native games to the Ethereum blockchain. Examples of active gaming projects on the Ethereum blockchain include Gala Games, Axie Infinity, Wreck League, League of Kingdoms and Pirate Nation. Other projects, such as Decentraland or The Sandbox, are metaverse-related, in that they offer full virtual worlds where players can build and craft their own worlds. Overall, blockchain gaming is an industry worth an estimated $ 3 Billion in value, and projected to grow to $ 90 billion by 2030. That compares with an overall gaming industry that is worth north of $ 300 Billion globally at the time of writing. Notably, there have also been rumors about traditional game publishers featuring NFTs in their games and bringing the gaming experience at least partially on the blockchain. EA and Rockstar Games have expressed their interest in NFTs for gaming, but it still remains to be seen whether they will be adopted, when and to what extent. Because of the sheer size of the gaming industry and how well NFTs and the blockchain can be integrated in gaming, I personally believe this is one of the strongest investing narratives for the Ethereum blockchain. That’s why I am mentioning it as the second application in my list, just after DeFi. The third use case of the Ethereum Blockchain is Digital Art. Artists can mint their artwork on the blockchain as NFTs, which are unique digital certificates of ownership. NFTs can then be bought, sold, and traded. Each NFT is unique, making it impossible to duplicate or forge, ensuring the authenticity and ownership of digital art. The NFT market has crashed from its height in 2021, with many pieces of digital art native to the blockchain trading at up to 99% less than their all-time highs. However, the market has recovered slightly since then. Disney ( DIS ) launched “Disney Pinnacle” in 2023, a proprietary marketplace where collectors can purchase NFTs of Disney collectable pins. The entire NFT market capitalization is roughly $ 90 Billion as of the time of writing. Forbes estimates the NFT industry could grow to above $ 230 Billion by 2030. The fourth main use case of the Ethereum blockchain in my view is Gambling . I am not going to cover this use case in detail, nor I am going to link to any platform or project, as gambling is a controversial topic. I think the crypto gambling industry is sometimes tied to gaming or DeFi, with blurred lines between these applications. Estimates of the size of this industry range from as low as $ 250 Million to as high as $ 90 Billion. Considerations on Ethereum-enabled technologies vs. applications I have no doubt that some crypto-enthusiasts might disagree with the above list. Some people might for example disagree with how I have not included Decentralized Autonomous Organizations ((DAO)) as part of the applications of the Ethereum ecosystem. DAOs are, at their core, a way to organize any entity in a decentralized manner based on the participants’ consensus. The reason why I have not called DAOs out is because, I believe, the vast majority of applications of DAOs relate to Decentralized Finance. Another example could be related to Non-Fungible-Tokens, or NFTs. I have not spelled out NFTs as an application of the Ethereum ecosystem because, in my view, NFTs are rather a technology - used in applications such as gaming and digital art - than an application itself. The same is valid for the Metaverse, which I consider part of the gaming application of the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, I decided to focus my list on what I believe are applications, rather than technologies. Finally, I have excluded from my list applications that, while are indeed theoretically possible, have little to no adoption at the time of writing. It would be possible, for example, to create a voting system on the Ethereum blockchain that a democratic nation could use for elections. However, no country has chosen to do that, so far. Another application of the Ethereum technology that has seen little adoption so far is that related to the verification of digital identity. Instead of relying on centralized databases, identity could be confirmed by using the blockchain. This would make it very difficult, if not virtually impossible, for criminals to fake identities. Experiments in the direction of digital identity exist - most notably with the launch of “ World Coin ”, a cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum blockchain. However, no country has yet adopted blockchain as a technology to verify the identity of its citizens. I hope the examples above will help readers understand what I meant when I mentioned how I find most online literature about Ethereum rather confusing. I believe most online articles are trying to please Google’s algorithm , and they are therefore forced to mix and match all buzzwords related to this technology. To what extent is Ethereum being used? Considerations on Ethereum adoption Key to understanding whether a bet on Ether makes sense is to gauge to what extent the Ethereum blockchain (and Ether) is being used in an ever-increasing manner. I believe the best way to understand usage of the Ethereum network is to check on-chain data. One of the advantages of the blockchain technology is that it is highly transparent - in that all transactions are verified on the blockchain and therefore publicly visible. To check activity on the Ethereum blockchain I use one of the free service providers available online, Etherscan.io. Once again, I have no affiliation whatsoever with Etherscan or any other platform mentioned in this article. Daily Transactions on Ethereum (Etherscan.io) To assess the growth of the Ethereum blockchain, I started looking at Daily Transactions on a 10 year scale. As shown by the chart above, transactions on Ethereum have experienced an almost exponential growth in 2017-2018 - from less than 250K to more than 1 Million in roughly one year. However, since 2021, they have stabilized between 1 and 1.5 Million transactions per day. I see this as mixed news. On the one hand, the Ethereum blockchain remained utilized through the crypto bear market of 2021 and 2022. This shows, in my view, that many applications of Ethereum are resilient, and the technology proves helpful, and it is not only linked to speculation. On the other hand, transactions have stagnated since 2021, and they have not grown even in 2024 year-to-date, despite ETH experiencing a +42% appreciation year-to-date, at the time of writing. I believe this shows that the run in ETH so far has been mostly speculative, while the Ethereum blockchain is still maturing. Unique Addresses on Ethereum (Etherscan.io) Active ERC20 Addresses on Ethereum (Etherscan.io) Other interesting metrics in my view are Unique Addresses and Active ERC20 addresses. An Ethereum address is a unique string of characters used to receive and send Ether and other tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It functions like an account number in a bank, allowing users to receive funds and interact with the blockchain. These two metrics indicate respectively the total and active users of the Ethereum network. As shown by the two charts above, while Ethereum total addresses have kept growing linearly since 2018, Ethereum active addresses have stagnated between 250K and 500K in the last few years. Once again, I believe this shows a mixed scenario. On the one hand, Ethereum has shown resilience and use cases that go beyond speculation. However, growth in total addresses has not been reflected in growth in active addresses yet. This shows in my view how the Ethereum blockchain overall is not maturing very quickly. The Crypto Trilemma and why it’s important to understand it before investing in Crypto The crypto trilemma is a concept introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. It refers to the challenge of achieving three crucial attributes of a blockchain network: decentralization, security, and scalability. According to the trilemma, it is difficult for blockchain networks to optimize all three aspects simultaneously. A network can achieve high decentralization and security, but it may sacrifice scalability, leading to slower transaction speeds and higher costs. Conversely, improving scalability might compromise decentralization or security. Finding a balance among these three attributes is a major focus of research in the blockchain industry. The Ethereum blockchain has addressed the trilemma with its update to Ethereum 2.0, switching from a Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake protocol. The trilemma has not been completely solved: fees on the Ethereum network can still be significantly high , leading to question its scalability. Also, becoming an Ethereum validator poses high barriers to entry, leading to questions about the network’s security. However, in my opinion, the Ethereum blockchain has achieved a remarkable balance between decentralization, security, and scalability. This is why I personally invest only in ETH and do not allocate significant funds to other blockchain projects, except for Bitcoin, which I believe has a very different investment narrative. I will cover this in the next section. To be clear, many alternatives to the Ethereum blockchain exist - there are thousands of blockchains with their native tokens. Solana (SOL-USD), for example, is a relatively new blockchain project that is experiencing high growth in terms of market cap and native token appreciation. While I do appreciate (and use!) Solana for many applications, I personally believe their approach to the crypto trilemma leaves a lot to be desired in terms of decentralization. Overall, I believe investing in any crypto project requires understanding what’s the approach of the project towards the trilemma. Investing in Ether is no exception, and I personally choose it over others given its track record, many applications and smart, equilibrated approach to the trilemma. Understanding the investing narratives of Bitcoin and Ethereum Readers who are interested in the cryptocurrency industry but have limited technical knowledge might ask whether it is ultimately “better” to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. In my opinion there is such a big difference in terms of investment narrative between Bitcoin and Ethereum, that this question is the equivalent of asking whether it is better to invest in blue chip stocks or junk bonds. Each of these asset types have their own risk profile and characteristics. It is therefore impossible to provide an answer that satisfies everyone. The investing narrative for Bitcoin is relatively easy to understand, in my view. Bitcoin has all the technical characteristics to be an excellent global reserve asset. It is fungible, portable, durable, divisible, secure, easily transactable and - most importantly in my view - scarce. The question is whether global institutions will indeed decide to adopt it, and to what extent, giving it the trust that today only gold and few sovereign fiat currencies enjoy. I covered my investment thesis for Bitcoin in a recent article and I have a bullish target of $ 650,000 / Bitcoin. In the context of my Bitcoin narrative, as long investors understand the why, they do not need to understand the how of the technology behind Bitcoin. In other terms, as long as you understand why Bitcoin possesses the technical characteristics to be a reserve asset, you do not need to understand how it all works. Nor investors need to be actively involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Investors can simply purchase Bitcoin via an ETF , and wait for the asymmetric bet to pay out (if ever). Investing in Ethereum is a different story, in my view. Investors need to understand the technology behind it and the possible applications, in order to gauge whether Ethereum is a bet worth taking. Being a user of the Ethereum network is also an advantage, as it provides a “front row seat” to gauge just how much the blockchain is being leveraged and utilized. In this context, I think Ether is a higher risk bet than Bitcoin. It remains unclear to what extent its applications can grow and tackle large and profitable markets such as gaming and traditional finance. I personally like this bet, and I have an exposure to Ether that represents roughly 25% of my exposure in Bitcoin. However, investors who are not willing to hold on to their stake for at least 5 years, and those who are not comfortable with losing their investment should better avoid investing in Ether for the time being. For investors willing to get exposed to Ether, the new ETFs that have been recently approved by the SEC represent an easy way to gain exposure to the technology. In my view, these ETFs will be preferable to funds that aim at getting exposure to blockchain technology by investing in a set of cryptocurrencies or tech companies. I might cover these differences in a future article, after Ether ETFs start trading. Regardless of how easy gaining exposure to Ethereum will become, I can only recommend investors to gain exposure to ETH only after thoroughly researching the technology and understanding its risks. Risks of investing in ETH I believe there are two main risks with investing in Ether. The first is that blockchain as a technology might never mature to an extent that will significantly reward token holders. While real life applications exist already, they are still relatively small and I think that blockchain technology has a long way to go to become an integral part of our economic system. The second risk is that the Ethereum blockchain might not be a winner in the long term. New technologies and blockchains are constantly developed, and Ethereum might just succumb to a newcomer. This concept is known as “First Mover Disadvantage” in management theory. A notable example is how Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) became an IT leader, despite Xerox being the original inventor of many technologies, such as the user interface, that powered Microsoft's success. While I do personally think Ethereum has the best chances to make it as the winning ecosystem, my assumption may prove wrong with time. There are also further risks linked to being actively involved in the Ethereum blockchain. Scams and frauds of different types are still rampant in the crypto world, and the Ethereum blockchain is no exception. These risks can be avoided if investors decide to passively purchase a soon-to-be-tradable ETH ETF. They should, however, be a consideration for investors deciding to dip their feet into the ecosystem. Conclusion I think risk-prone investors should consider buying ETH as a way to gain exposure to blockchain technology. The Ethereum platform, in my view, is a clear winner of the blockchain ecosystem. It has addressed the crypto trilemma better than other blockchains, and it has by far the most use cases, users and history. For these reasons, I assign a “BUY” to ETH. However, investing in Ether is still a high-risk bet. It remains to be seen to what extent the Ethereum blockchain can grow and tackle profitable markets such as the gaming and the financial industries. On-chain data such as daily transactions and number of active addresses provide a mixed view. While the Ethereum network has proven to be resilient through crypto bear markets, its usage has been somewhat stagnating in the past years. Investors who are not comfortable with losing their capital and they are not willing to hold for at least five years should avoid this bet, in my opinion.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702433-why-i-am-betting-on-ether-eth-usd-after-secs-etfs-approval-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30400222.jpeg

30396270,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627815,1720090852,"Ethereum Faces Sharp Decline As ETH Targets $3,051 Support Level","Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a significant downturn, with its price rapidly approaching the crucial support level of $3,051. This sharp decline highlights increased selling pressure and growing bearish sentiment in the market. As Ethereum nears this critical threshold, traders are closely monitoring its behavior for signs of either a stabilization or a further drop. The $3,051 support level is now a focal point, determining the short-term direction of Ethereum’s price action and potentially setting the stage for future movements in the cryptocurrency market. This article aims to analyze the sharp decline affecting the digital asset and its impact on the cryptocurrency’s price as it approaches the $3,051 support level. It also seeks to provide traders and investors with a comprehensive understanding of the current situation, potential scenarios if the support level holds or breaks, and strategies for managing risk in this volatile environment. ETH’s price is currently trading at around $3,181 and down by 5.05% with a market capitalization of over $382 billion and a trading volume of over $18 billion as of the time of writing. In the past 24 hours, there has been a decrease of 5.25% in ETH’s market capitalization and a 74.43% increase in trading volume. Technical Indicators Pointing To A Decline For Ethereum A technical analysis of ETH’s price action on the 4-hour chart reveals that the crypto asset is actively bearish and trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Ethereum has been consistently bearish since after breaching the $3,360 mark and is currently heading toward the $3,051 support level. Also, an analytical view of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator shows that the price of ETH may continue its bearishness as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator have dropped below 50% and are attempting a move into the oversold zone. On the 1-day chart, the crypto asset has made a sharp drop below the 100-day SMA and is attempting a break below the bullish trend line while dropping toward the $3,051 support level. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the composite trend oscillator indicates a further bearish move of ETH as the signal and the SMA of the indicator are both trending in the oversold zone. What If $3,051 Support Fails? Analyzing potential outcomes if Ethereum breaks through the $3,051 support level reveals that if the digital asset breaks below this level, it may move lower to test the $2,865 support level and probably move on to test the $2,160 support level and other levels below if the price breaches this level. However, if the price of Ethereum faces rejection at the $3,051 support level, it will begin to ascend toward the $3,360 resistance level. Should the asset breach this level, it may continue to climb to test the $3,659 resistance level and possibly move on to test other higher levels if it breaches the $3,659 level.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} plunged under $58,000 in European morning hours, extending 24-hour losses to nearly 5% and dropping to prices not seen since early May.  The sell-off came as wallets belonging to defunct crypto exchange Mt.

Mt. Gox is scheduled to start distributing assets stolen from clients in a 2014 hack this month, although it is unclear when, after years of postponed deadlines.

In a recent YouTube video, Rover dissected the recent price action, highlighting both bearish indicators and potential bullish triggers that could send Bitcoin soaring. Related Reading: Avalanche On The Verge: Will AVAX Break Out And Reach $65?

He revealed setting buy orders between $56,000 and $57,000, suggesting a belief in a potential price rebound. This strategy highlights Rover’s short-term bullishness, betting on a buying spree should Bitcoin experience a temporary dip. THIS IS VERY BAD FOR #BITCOIN… Watch ASAP:👇https://t.co/4g4MII9zY1 pic.twitter.com/8GuJY4idjZ — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) July 3, 2024 Mixed Signals: Neutral Funding Rates And ETF Fluctuations The current market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin paints a complex picture. While price action leans bearish, funding rates, which gauge market sentiment towards leveraged positions, remain neutral. This lack of strong conviction from bears could be interpreted as a positive sign. However, the situation is further muddied by fluctuations in Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) inflows and outflows. This volatility creates uncertainty, reflecting a cautious market mentality. Bitcoin Price Predictions: A Contradiction? Adding another layer to the complexity, current Bitcoin price predictions forecast a significant rise by August 3rd, 2024, with some estimates reaching $80,781. This bullish prediction contradicts the overall bearish sentiment highlighted by the Fear & Greed Index currently at “Fear” (44). Meanwhile, cryptocurrency expert Mikybull said on X that the price of Bitcoin has most likely peaked for this cycle. Conversely, the altcoin market has bottomed out, opening the door for a big altcoin boom. #Bitcoin dominance has already hit its peak in this cycle while #Altcoins dominance has achieved its bottom. Expect massive Alts rally when $BTC leaves the current range. It’s going to be a glorious rally but you need to survive this final shakeout. — Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) June 28, 2024 Short Squeeze On The Horizon? Despite the mixed signals, Rover identified a potential catalyst for a bullish surge: a short squeeze. This scenario occurs when a large number of short-sellers, who are betting on the price of Bitcoin to fall, are forced to buy back their positions to cover losses if the price starts to rise unexpectedly. Related Reading: Ethereum DApps On Fire: Volume Soars Over 90% — Good For ETH Price? The analyst believes the current high liquidity in the market, meaning there are ample buyers and sellers readily available, could fuel such a squeeze, propelling Bitcoin significantly higher. Anything Can Happen The coming days and weeks will be crucial for Bitcoin. A break below the key support levels could trigger a wave of selling, while a decisive break above resistance could signal a return to bullish territory. Crypto Rover’s analysis underscores the importance of close observation as July’s trading activity unfolds. With a mix of bearish and bullish factors at play, the future direction of Bitcoin remains uncertain, keeping both traders and investors guessing the next development.

42417795,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZy97,1720084065,"Bitcoin Drops Below 200-Day Average, Brings Bull Market Trendline Into Focus","BTC fell below the 200-day SMA line for the first time since October.  The focus now is on the trendline representing the surge from October lows.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} decline gathered pace as the largest cryptocurrency fell for a third straight day, dropping below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a good indicator of long-term price trends in both traditional and crypto markets.  The cryptocurrency slid below the average's $58,492 level during European hours on Thursday to less than $57,300, a price last seen on May 2, according to data on charting platform TradingView.  Markets that consistently trade below the 200-day average are said to be in a downtrend, while those trading above the average are considered bullish. BTC rose past the 200-day SMA in October, when the average value was $28,000. The breakout – fueled by expectations for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. – paved the way for a rally to record highs above $70,000 by March.  One factor in bitcoin's price movements is the U.S. interest rate. As rates fall, the attraction of riskier investments such as cryptocurrencies increases. The minutes of the Federal Reserve meeting released Wednesday showed policymakers led by Chairman Jerome Powell do not want to cut rates until more data emerges to give them greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably to their 2% target. That may come as early as tomorrow, when the Labor Department releases its non-farm payrolls figure for June.  ""We believe hawkish comments from Jerome Powell and the ongoing selling pressure are likely to push BTC down to 52,000,"" Valentin Fournier, a digital assets analyst at advisory firm brn, said in an email. ""However, we recommend viewing this as a buying opportunity, as improving regulations around cryptocurrencies and cooling inflation in the US have not been fully priced in and are likely to bring strong momentum once investors shift focus to a longer-term vision.""  See also: Bitcoin Plunges Under $59K as Crypto Bulls See $230M Liquidations  The sell-off may run out of steam if the payrolls data shows the labor market weakened in June. The figure is forecast to show payrolls increased by 195,000, a notable slowdown from 272,000 a month before, according to FXStreet. The jobless rate is forecast to have held steady at 4.0%, while average hourly earnings are projected to have slowed to 3.9% from 4.1% year-on-year.  The bull market progression can be identified by a rising trendline connecting October and January lows. BTC's latest break below the 200-day line has put the focus on the bull market trendline support at $57,590.  A close (midnight UTC) below that level could lead to further selling and downward price momentum, as traders often use trendline breakdowns as indicators to make trading decisions.  Fournier is not alone in seeing further declines. According to Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, prices could slide to as low as $51,500 in the short term.  ""From the current position, a 12% drop to $51.5k (February consolidation area) is more likely than the same amount of growth to $65.8k (50-day MA),"" Kuptsikevich said in an email.

42417809,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZyNZ,1720080855,Decoding The $7B Decline in Bitcoin's Notional Open Interest,"While notional open interest has dropped, OI in BTC terms has held steady alongside positive funding rates.  That's a sign of renewed demand for longs amid the price dip, according to observers.  Notional open interest in bitcoin {{BTC}} futures and perpetual futures, a crucial market sentiment gauge, has declined roughly 18% from $37 billion to $30.2 billion in one month, alongside a 14% slide decline in the cryptocurrency's spot market price, according to data source Coinglass.  At first glance, the data indicates that longs or bullish leveraged bets anticipating a price rise have been squared off over the past four weeks. In other words, BTC's price drop is bolstered by the unwinding of bullish bets.  That interpretation could be partially correct at best and masks the bullish undercurrents in the market.  Open interest refers to the number of active or open contracts at a given time, and notional open interest is calculated by multiplying the number of units in one contract by its current spot market price. Therefore, changes in the asset price impact notional open interest even as the total number of contracts remains steady, thereby painting a misleading picture of market activity.  That seems to be the case in the BTC market.  Per Coinglass, open interest has remained steady above the 500,000 BTC mark over four weeks. Meanwhile, perpetual funding rates charged by exchanges every eight hours have consistently held positive, indicating a bias for bullish bets.  The combination of steady open interest in BTC terms and positive funding rates, coupled with the decline in notional open interest, suggests that some traders have been setting fresh long positions, offsetting other market participants' supposed unwinding of bullish bets.  That's a sign traders are not yet hesitating to put longs, according to Laurent Kssis, crypto ETF specialist at CEC Capital.  ""This assumption is indeed correct. Also, more protection strategies are being implemented as the market remains very uncertain. Don't forget the lat liquidity washouts were decent enough to push the market down below the $60K mark. Hesitation to position long orders is still not dominating, but hedging is a rather large part of the trading.""  Perhaps traders are hopeful that once the selling pressure from Mt. Gox reimbursements and miners is exhausted, bitcoin could resume the upward trend, keeping pace with the Nasdaq.  A similar conclusion can be drawn from the consistent positive spread between futures and spot prices, widely referred to as basis.  ""The basis has dipped slightly but is still attractive, so there is still demand for long positions as part of the basis trade, and expectations of a breakout are building as macro tailwinds accumulate and as the selling pressure is likely to dissipate soon, so investors could be accumulating strategic longs while funding rates are low,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter told CoinDesk.  Activity in the spot and options market also suggests upside bias.  According to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, crypto exchange Bitfinex has been the source of bullish pressure during the price dip.  ""Bitfinex whales have been buying the dips [in the spot] since late June, but I haven't observed similar signals in the other derivatives market,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.  The margin longs on Bitfinex, which involve using borrowed funds to buy an asset in the spot market, have steadily increased since June.  Meanwhile, according to QCP Capital, traders have been buying topside bets in the options market.  ""Despite the sell-off, the options market is still heavily skewed in favor of the topside, suggesting that the market is still anticipating a year-end rally. This aligns with the desk's observation of significant buying interest in the longer-term options at the $100K/$120 strike [calls],"" QCP said in a market update on Wednesday.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/04/decoding-the-7b-decline-in-bitcoins-notional-open-interest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af5533562893e00a029eaace0996b96eacade301-1905x1072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30387530,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627760,1720080353,"Bitcoin Price Could Massively Crash Like In May 2021, Warns Fund Manager","Bitcoin’s price has fallen below the critical support level of $60,000, reaching a low of $57,914. Since Tuesday, Bitcoin has experienced a further 7% decline, reinforcing the ongoing downward trend. Currently, market sentiment is shifting markedly towards the bearish side. Is A May 2021-Style Bitcoin Crash Looming? Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, has raised significant concerns regarding the pattern emerging in the Bitcoin market, reminiscent of the conditions that led to the dramatic crash of May 2021. In a detailed analysis shared via X (formerly Twitter), Kang highlighted the overlooked criticality of the current market dynamics. Kang stated, “Most market participants are not appreciating the significance of a potential loss of a 4-month range on Bitcoin. The closest parallel we can draw is to that of the range of May 2021 where we also came off a parabolic rally of BTC and alts.” Related Reading: Longest Miner Capitulation Since 2022 Signals Potential Bitcoin Rally Ahead He noted the similarities in market conditions, particularly in terms of leveraged positions, which currently exceed $50 billion. “This figure does not include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which is higher, but compounded by the fact that in this scenario we have ranged even longer (18 weeks vs. 13), and we have not had extreme washouts yet while we had a few in the middle of the 2020-2021 bull market,” Kang elaborated. Kang also adjusted his projections for Bitcoin’s bottom, suggesting a steeper fall than earlier anticipated: “It’s likely that my initial estimates of low $50ks were too conservative and we see a more extreme reset to $40ks.” He warned that such a pullback could significantly damage the market, necessitating a few months of consolidation and a downtrend before any reversal to an upward trend might be conceivable. In a dialogue with Alex Krüger, a well-known macro and crypto analyst, the discussion explored the intricacies of open interest (OI) in the derivatives market, a crucial aspect of understanding market sentiment and directional biases. Krüger pointed out, “Much of that OI is not directional though,” suggesting a more complex market behavior than straightforward long and short positions. Related Reading: British Mega Bank Standard Chartered Says Bitcoin Will Hit $100,000, Here’s When Responding, Kang clarified the composition of OI, saying, “Each unit of OI is one long + one short. Even if there are basis trade shorts on the short leg, there’s a directional long on the other end. So yes… less directional shorts.” The conversation further delved into whether derivatives traders are delta neutral, which affects market stability. Krüger queried about market maker positions, and Kang responded, “I can assure you that there are not many market makers in the OI that are delta neutral long perps and short spot paying funding/borrow on both ends for a negative carry trade.” What Happened In May 2021? This ongoing discussion among experts reflects a deepening concern over the potential for a repeat of the May 2021 crash. During that period, Bitcoin’s price plummeted dramatically following a peak of around $64,000 in mid-April 2021. By the end of June, it had lost about 56% of its value. This crash was precipitated by a mix of factors, including regulatory crackdowns in China, environmental concerns voiced by influential figures like Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and a resulting cascade of panic selling among both retail and institutional investors. In retrospect, the May 2021 downturn was characterized by a rapid shift in investor sentiment, driven by external shocks and exacerbated by the high levels of leverage in the market. Today, similar conditions could be forming according to Kang, with high leverage and extended periods without significant price corrections, suggesting that the market may be on the brink of another severe downturn.

Gox's bankruptcy redemptions are bearish for BCH, not BTC, writes Presto Labs' Peter Chung.  Mt. Gox will send back to its former customers $73 million worth of BCH, worth over 20% of the token's daily trading volume.  Fears that selling pressure from bankruptcy redemptions from the estate of Mt. Gox will drive down the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} is unfounded, but it could be a bearish scenario for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Presto Labs' Head of Research wrote in a note.  Bitcoin's price continues to dip below $60,000, with over $200 million in liquidations as the trading day began in Asia Thursday, CoinDesk reported earlier.  In addition to the roughly $9.5 billion in BTC the former exchange will send back to its customers, Mt. Gox will also send back 143,000 BCH worth around $73 million. CoinGecko data shows that Bitcoin Cash has a daily trading volume of $308.8 million, making this redemption worth around 24% of that number.  ""Our analysis shows that the selling pressure for BCH will be four times larger than for BTC: 24% of the daily trading value for BCH vs. 6% of the daily trading value for BTC,"" Presto Labs' Peter Chung wrote in a note, pointing out that BCH's daily trading value is 1/50 of BTC.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Chung said BTC is projected to have limited selling because anyone who wanted out could have sold their claims on bankruptcy claim markets.  In the early days of FTX's bankruptcy, many traders who were not optimistic about a quick bankruptcy redemption, did just that.  ""Weak-handed creditors had plenty of chances to exit over the last ten years on the back of aggressive bidding from the claim funds, so we can safely assume the current group of creditors consists of diamond-handed BTC bulls,"" Chung told CoinDesk in an interview.  Chung argues that traders are going to treat the BCH ""as an airdrop"" and sell it immediately because Bitcoin Cash's fork occurred three years after Mt. Gox's bankruptcy.  ""Creditors are oblivious to BCH's cause,"" he continued.  Long BTC perpetuals paired with short BCH perpetuals is the most efficient market-neutral way to express this view, barring funding rate risk, Chung wrote in the note.  ""Those looking to lock in a funding rate can explore other approaches, such as shorting term futures or borrowing BCH in the spot market,"" he continued.  BCH is currently trading at $360, down 3.8%, according to CoinDesk Indices data.",NEGATIVE,BCH,ASIA | BCH | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/04/mt-gox-doomsday-scenario-involves-bitcoin-cash-not-bitcoin-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/291af9f53b88bc829a6f59825de0b112a5c43631-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Approval of Bitcoin ETFs led to inflows, but benefits like uncorrelated returns have diminished due to institutionalization. Comparing the HODL ETF to the IBIT ETF, IBIT has lower expense ratio, higher AUM, and liquidity, making it a more appealing investment option. VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF ( HODL ) is a passive portfolio strategy meant to track the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The portfolio offers retail investors the ability to add BTC holdings to their tax-exempt retirement accounts, which, I believe, has broadened the investor pool for the once decentralized currency. Given the dynamic shift in traders for the cryptocurrency, many of the investment benefits, such as uncorrelated returns, have diminished as a result of by whom and how the assets are held. Given that I am not a BTC trader and view this investment strategy more as an asset allocation, I cannot recommend a price target for trading purposes. Comparing liquidity and AUM with HODL's peer BTC ETF strategy managed by iShares, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), I cannot recommend HODL as a BUY. I recommend HODL with a HOLD rating with a recommended asset allocation of 3-5%. Be sure to review my coverage of IBIT as much of the information presented may overlap: IBIT Is A Great Vehicle For BTC Investing Should You HODL? HODL was one of the many BTC ETFs that entered the market after the much-anticipated SEC approval of bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024 . This landmark approval allowed for fund managers to sell managed portfolios of spot BTC, in which the portfolios can buy and hold BTC directly. Approval of these ETFs led to a massive inflow of funds within the first few days of trading, resulting in a massive $4.6b inflow across the various BTC ETFs . Fund flows have since waned but still remain relatively positive, depending on the fund. Considering the chart below, there may have been repositioning into the ETFs as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) experienced massive outflows post-SEC approval. I believe much of the shift was driven by GBTC's total expense ratio of 1.5% when compared to the low cost of competing ETFs. HODL's expense ratio is a mere 20bps, slightly higher than iShares's IBIT at 12bps. TheBlock Specific to HODL, the majority of the funds flowed in mid-March and have remained in relatively low volume transactions, suggesting the ETF is being bought and held as an alternative investment vehicle. TheBlock One of the hazards that came with the launch of these ETFs was the institutionalization of BTC, in which BTC is now managed in tandem with other equity and debt instruments. What I mean by this is that BTC now has exposure to cash raises, portfolio rebalances, and other portfolio management strategies that may benefit or harm the direction of the core asset. Though this isn't necessarily a bad thing, this has led to BTC having more correlation with other investment assets that has changed the dynamic of BTC providing uncorrelated returns. Looking at the correlation coefficient with the NASDAQ (QQQ), BTC shows its highest levels of correlation with the index during times of distress. TradingView Comparing HODL to IBIT Given that IBIT and HODL are essentially managed in tandem, I believe comparing both of these ETFs will make do for an investment rationale, with the assumption that the investor is seeking to invest in BTC. At a high level, IBIT does have a higher expense ratio of 12bps compared to HODL's 20bps. This factor will make IBIT more appealing given the lower costs associated with holding the asset, net of returns. IBIT also has a much larger AUM of $18b, overshadowing HODL's AUM of $620mm. I believe liquidity should be a major factor when considering investing in a closed ETF, as shares are traded on the open market as opposed to being redeemed by the investment company. As a result of the AUM, IBIT holds 307k BTC within the portfolio; HODL holds 10k BTC. Net of asset value, IBIT appears to be a much more appealing investment opportunity given the lower expense ratio and higher liquidity. Considering that both ETFs trade in tandem with BTC spot, I believe IBIT should be favored over HODL given the factors listed above. TradingView As a result, I cannot recommend HODL as a BUY given the superior structure offered by IBIT. I recommend HODL with a HOLD recommendation in favor of IBIT. For more information on HODL & IBIT, please visit the VanEck & iShares sites. VanEck HODL iShares IBIT Again, this is not a recommendation for holding BTC and should not be used for active trading purposes. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the ETF and should only be used for asset allocation purposes.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702388-vaneck-bitcoin-trust-etf-may-not-be-the-optimal-bitcoin-fund-to-hodl?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30385177.jpeg

The companies joined forces to develop the altcoin and enhance users’ experience. Nonetheless, GALA has faced a 6.7% price decline following the news. Related Reading: FET Drops 9% As ASI Token Merger Phase 1 Kicks Off Gala Games To Boost User Experience On Wednesday, Gala Games announced its partnership with Hong Kong-based game software and Venture Capital company. The collaboration aims to enhance the token experience for users. The Web3 and blockchain gaming platform focuses on video games compatible with blockchain technology. Additionally, it allows players to earn crypto tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through gameplay. Per the announcement, the companies will work together to develop the token. Animoca Brands will receive GALA tokens from the firm’s treasury to “provide liquidity provisioning services” to the Web3 gaming platform. This move aims to facilitate the token’s orderly trading. As highlighted in the X post, Animoca Brands operates nine Gala Founder’s Nodes and plans to serve as a GalaChain Validator. Many users and crypto investors received the news well. Some users considered the news was bullish for the token. Others stated that the company is finally “making some noise.” The announcement also sparked interest in the gaming and NFT community. LordBenalez, COO of community-driven NFT project Mittaria, expressed interest in the collaboration. “About time. Glad to see the two big companies joining hands. Looking forward to hearing more about the collaboration,” read the reply. GALA’s Price Sees 7% Retrace Despite the overall positive reaction, GALA’s price plunged after the news. The token fell from the $0.0275 price range to the $0.0255 mark, a 7.2% price drop. The recent price action represents a 6.7% retrace in the last 24 hours. The token’s performance also shows red numbers in the longer timeframes. GALA’s price has been downtrend since its March high of $0.081. Following the retrace at the beginning of Q2, the token hovered between the $0.04 and $0.5 range. However, the sideways movement was halted by the late May security breach to which the company fell victim. As reported by NewsBTC, the web3 gaming company suffered an exploit, which resulted in the minting of 5 billion tokens worth $219 million. The incident saw the unauthorized sale of 600 million GALA tokens, worth around $21 million. Additionally, 4.4 billion tokens were burned. This resulted in the price falling from $0.046 to $0.037, a 20% decline following the exploit. Related Reading: Baked Or Burned?

This sharp decline triggered a wave of liquidations, affecting many investors and traders. Market Meltdown And Crypto Liquidation The total market valuation has plunged by approximately 2.7% to around $2.34 trillion, underscoring heightened volatility and market stress. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drops Below $60,000: Key Reason Explained Bitcoin, leading the downturn, shed 1.3% over the week, with a steep 2.8% drop recorded in the last day. This downturn has not only decreased the value of many investors’ portfolios but has also led to substantial losses for traders via liquidations. Data from Coinglass highlights the extent of the carnage, with 59,816 traders liquidated and total liquidations amounting to $170.72 million. The liquidations were predominantly from long positions, suggesting that many traders expected the market to rally. Bitcoin traders faced approximately $45.76 million liquidations, with Ethereum and Solana traders experiencing $44.55 million and $11.09 million, respectively. The arena for these liquidations was on major exchanges like Binance, OKX, Huobi, and Bybit, with Binance traders bearing the brunt at $74.77 million. While other exchanges such as OKX, Huobi, and Bybit also experienced significant liquidations, amounting to $54.29 million, $19.28 million, and $12.93 million, respectively. Despite also facing liquidations, the smaller exchanges had a comparatively minor impact. Analysts’ Viewpoint On Bitcoin Current Performance Despite the current downturn, some market analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects. PlanB, a respected figure in the crypto community, reaffirmed that the bull market is still ongoing, suggesting that underlying on-chain metrics do not show any abnormalities that would indicate a prolonged bear market.

Gox repayments and possible miner sales led to bitcoin dropping below $59,000, with major tokens like ether and Solana's SOL also declining.  Trading firm QCP Capital anticipates a subdued market in the next quarter due to uncertainty around the Mt. Gox bitcoin supply release.  Fears of looming selling pressure on bitcoin {{BTC}} from defunct exchange Mt. Gox and possible miner sales pushed the largest cryptocurrency to under $59,000 on Thursday for the first time since late April.  Mt. Gox will start distributing assets stolen from clients in a 2014 hack in July 2024, after years of postponed deadlines. The repayments will be made in bitcoin and bitcoin cash (BCH), and could add selling pressure to both markets, as previously reported.  BTC lost 3.3% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, with the sell-off beginning shortly after Tokyo equity markets opened for trading. Major tokens declined amid the BTC weakness: Ether {{ETH}} slumped 4%, while Solana’s SOL and dogecoin {{DOGE}} fell as much as 8%.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, is down 4.8% in the past 24 hours.  Futures trades betting on higher prices lost over $230 million in the past 24 hours, liquidations data tracked by CoinGlass shows. BTC and ETH-tracked futures saw over $60 million in long liquidations a piece, while products tracking DOGE, SOL, XRP, and pepe coin (PEPE) recorded at least $4 million in losses.  For long traders, these liquidations were the highest since late June. Crypto exchange Binance took over $110 million in liquidations, the most among counterparts.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Such data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.  Meanwhile, trading firm QCP Capital said in a Thursday broadcast on Telegram that they expect a dim market in the next few months.  “We anticipate a subdued Q3 for BTC as the market remains uncertain around the supply from the Mt.

These large investors who are holding more than $600,000 worth of Bitcoin have been accumulating BTC at an accelerated rate over the last six months. Bitcoin Holders Increase Wallet Holdings On-chain data tracking platform, Santiment, recently revealed that Bitcoin investors have been increasing their holdings over the last six months. According to the report posted on X (formerly Twitter), the major cohort involved in this buying are the wallets holding more than 10 BTC in their wallets. Related Reading: XRP Price Attempts Bullish Decoupling Amid Major Developments The report shows that over the last six months, these holders have increased their collective holdings by 1.07%. While this may seem like only a small increase, it translates to over 5,000 BTC that these wallets have added in the space of half a year. A trend that has been maintained during this accumulation is the fact that the buying has gone up whenever the Bitcoin price has crashed. For example, in early May when the Bitcoin price crashed, these wallets increased their buying. This time around, as the BTC price has struggled to retain the $60,000 level, they have begun to buy once more. Santiment’s data shows that during the last month, their holdings have increased drastically, bringing it to a total of 16.17 million BTC held by these wallets. USDT And USDC Holdings Supports Accumulation Theory One thing that also suggests that these whales have been buying Bitcoin aggressively over the last six months is the change in the USDT and USDC holdings of wallets. Usually, investors will hold these stablecoins as a way to avoid market volatility and wait for better prices. However, once prices get low enough, they begin to buy, and this buying translates to a drop in the balances of their stablecoin holdings. For example, Santiment’s report points to a drop in the USDT and USDC holdings of sharks and whales holding between $100,000 and $1 million, although the USDT holdings have taken more of a hit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Slow Down Selling In July, What This Could Mean For Price USDC holdings of these large wallets have dropped by 1.99% in the last six months, bringing their holdings to 34.2% of the current supply. Meanwhile, USDT holdings have dropped by 5.37% in the same time period, dropping their holdings to 30.3% of the total supply. What this shows is a willingness to buy Bitcoin at these low prices in anticipation of a price recovery. If this buying continues, it could created a much-needed support for the BTC price at $60,000, increasing the possibility of a price increase from here.

30376191,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627662,1720065612,Ethereum Set to Eclipse Bitcoin: ETFs Could Catapult ETH to New Heights — K33 Research,"As the global financial markets prepare to launch U.S.-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Ethereum is positioned to potentially outperform Bitcoin, according to a new analysis by K33 Research. This comes amid concerns that Bitcoin might face downward pressure due to upcoming repayments to creditors of the defunct Mt. Gox exchange. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Breakout Moment: Is a $7,500 Target Achievable? Experts Weigh In ETF Launch to Begin a New Era for Ethereum Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin in performance over the last year, with the former surging 67% while the latter by 95%, but that might be about to change with the anticipated launch of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, expected in the coming weeks. Analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman from K33 Research suggest that introducing these spot ETFs could be pivotal for Ethereum’s valuation. Despite a likely initial dip post-launch, they forecast that inflows into these funds will propel Ethereum’s price over time, drawing a parallel to the earlier impact of Bitcoin’s spot ETFs, which attracted billions of dollars in inflow after launch. This optimism is rooted in the belief that ETFs will catalyze significant capital flows into Ethereum, mirroring the influx seen with Bitcoin. The analysts project net inflows amounting to 0.75% to 1% of Ethereum’s circulating supply within five months post-launch, potentially setting the stage for substantial price appreciation. The analysts noted: ETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader. When Will ETH Spot ETF Launch In The US? Despite the analysts’ bullish outlook, the market appears skeptical, as evidenced by Ethereum futures trading at a discount relative to Bitcoin futures, as highlighted in the K33 Research. Related Reading: Experts Eye Spot Ethereum ETF Launch By Mid-July, Predict Price Rally Ethereum is trading at around $3,312, reflecting a 3.3% drop over the past day and conceding with the ubiquitous decline in the crypto market. In the broader context, the crypto industry is enthusiastic about Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, highlighted that amended S-1 forms for Bitcoin ETFs are due before July 8, with approvals potentially finalized by July 12, paving the way for a mid-July launch.

Playboy Biden has a market cap below $185,000 at the moment despite rallying 860% recently, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $10 million, early investors would generate returns of around 5,000% in a matter of days or hours.

This transaction was recorded on-chain on June 30 between two unknown wallets, indicating it isn’t an escrow unlock. Although the periodic unlock has already been completed since this transaction, XRP traders and enthusiasts are still fascinated by its enormous nature, prompting a detailed look into the on-chain data. Breaking Down The 200 Million XRP Transfer According to on-chain data initially noted by large transaction tracker Whale Alerts, 200 million tokens were transferred from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet on June 30, 2024. The XRP ecosystem is home to many whale addresses, so large transactions from whales are a common sight. The majority of these involve transactions from unknown addresses and crypto exchanges, and vice versa, indicating periods of whale selloffs and accumulations. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 45% Drop For Bitcoin, But Says It Won’t Go Below This Level However, whale transactions can involve two unknown addresses from time to time, like the movement of 200 million XRP tokens being considered. A thorough look into on-chain data shows a correlation between the unknown wallets and Ripple. As the cryptocurrency’s largest holder, huge transactions surrounding Ripple rarely go unnoticed. Some traders even mistook the transaction as part of Ripple’s monthly unlock of XRP from escrow. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 200,000,000 #XRP (94,554,479 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/mb8TQ9p3nU — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 30, 2024 The initial transfer was made from address “rP4X2h” to address “rJqiMb.” Interestingly, on-chain data indicates the recipient wallet was activated by Ripple as far back as October 2021 and is one of the wallets used for periodic selloffs and moving tokens between wallets. Similarly, the source wallet was activated in October 2023 by the recipient wallet, which connects both wallet addresses to Ripple. However, on-chain data indicates that the tokens were not transferred into any crypto exchange. They were left sitting in the recipient’s wallet for around 48 hours before a subsequent transfer of 100 million XRP back to the source address “rP4X2h.” This points to the transaction being only a movement around addresses controlled by Ripple. Related Reading: Fundstrat’s Head Of Research Says Bitcoin Will Reach $150,000, Here’s When At the time of writing, address “rJqiMb” holds 107.2 million tokens worth $51.4 million, and address “rP4X2h” holds 93.6 million XRP tokens worth $44.9 million. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.48, and Ripple’s July unlock of 1 billion XRP tokens has been completed. The unlock occurred in batches of 400 million XRP, 100 million XRP, and 500 million XRP, respectively. While big movements such as these used to spark wild speculation among investors, the community has grown accustomed to Ripple’s token management practices. Still, any sizable transaction raises questions about Ripple’s motives and future plans.

42417807,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZyMX,1720060200,When Do Secondary Token Sales Violate Howey?,"A federal judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Binance ruled that most of the case can proceed, but dismissed charges tied to the sale of BUSD and secondary sales of BNB.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Secondary sales  The narrative  Late Friday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission had brought plausible allegations against Binance, Binance.US and Changpeng Zhao, refusing to dismiss most of the charges against the companies. She did, however, dismiss a charge tied to secondary sales of BNB by sellers who aren't Binance, a charge tied to the sale of BUSD and a charge tied to Binance's ""Simple Earn"" product.  Why it matters  One question around the application of securities law to cryptocurrencies is whether secondary sales are also investment contracts. We've seen a few rulings from district courts, but nothing from appeals courts yet.  Breaking it down  Judge Jackson's ruling mostly maintained the current status quo in terms of litigation around crypto and securities – she ruled that the major questions doctrine does not apply, that the SEC's arguments are (mostly) plausible and that there is a reasonable case to be made based on the facts as alleged.  It's an interesting ruling that everyone will likely pull from. In a blog post on Tuesday, Binance mostly reiterated the court's ruling and said it ""recognizes there are critical limits on the SEC's regulatory authority over the crypto industry.""  The judge's ruling did allow most of the charges to move forward, including counts tied to the BNB initial coin offering and Binance's own ongoing sales of the token; the BNB Vault; Binance.US's staking service; Exchange Act violations (both registration and control person allegations); and anti-fraud provisions under the Securities Act.  I imagine we'll learn more about the arguments around those charges as the case proceeds. In the nearer-term, the judge's ruling on secondary sales by sellers other than Binance – she dismissed this charge – and stablecoins (well, one stablecoin) – she dismissed a charge here too – are already being hailed within the crypto industry.  The judge pointed to transcripts from various hearings in her ruling, noting that SEC attorneys said in court that they are not taking the position that a token on its own is a security but saying that, in her view, the SEC seemed to still take the position that if a token's initial sale carried marketing materials or other factors that suggested it was a security, those factors would continue to apply through future sales (see footnote 15).  ""Insisting that an asset that was the subject of an alleged investment contract is itself a 'security' as it moves forward in commerce and is bought and sold by private individuals on any number of exchanges, and is used in any number of ways over an indefinite period of time, marks a departure from the Howey framework that leaves the Court, the industry, and future buyers and sellers with no clear differentiating principle between tokens in the marketplace that are securities and tokens that aren’t,"" the judge wrote.  However, the judge seemingly left the door open for other arguments in future cases around secondary transactions, writing in subsequent paragraphs that ""more is needed"" to support the SEC's arguments about ongoing sales of tokens. Indeed, the judge said in a few places that one big issue may be that the SEC just didn't have enough in its filings or oral arguments at this time.  On Monday, attorneys for Coinbase filed notices in both the SEC case against the exchange and the exchange's appeal for rulemaking including Friday's decision.  In its letter to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, who's overseeing the SEC case against Coinbase, the exchange's attorneys argued that Friday's decision supports its motion for an interlocutory appeal – the exchange wants an appeals court to rule on how secondary trades fit into the definition of an ""investment contract"" – because it goes against the SEC's arguments against such an appeal.  ""The Binance decision compounds the confusion for the industry and its customers. Two learned district courts, analyzing economically identical transactions on two of the largest crypto trading platforms in the United States, have reached diametrically opposed views as to whether those transactions may constitute securities transactions,"" Coinbase's notice said. ""The result of the SEC’s litigation-focused approach to crypto regulation is that market participants now face different rules, not only in different courts in this District, but in different federal courts around the country.""  In a response on Wednesday, SEC attorneys wrote that Friday's decision supports Judge Failla's ruling on Coinbase's original motion for judgment and supports rejecting the motion for interlocutory appeal.  Friday's ruling highlighted the role of the Howey Test and that the question around secondary transactions was facts and circumstances-based, the SEC team wrote.  ""Moreover, in concluding that the SEC had not sufficiently pled that certain secondary sales of BNB were investment contracts, the Decision made clear that this ruling was based on the particular facts pled in the complaint then before it,"" the SEC attorneys wrote. ""... Contrary to Coinbase's contention here, the Decision made no general pronouncement as to whether 'secondary market crypto transactions were investment contracts under Howey.'""  The ruling, in other words, doesn't have any effect on the allegations the SEC brought against Coinbase or the digital assets the SEC alleged were securities in its complaint, the regulator said.  SCOTUS  Of course, there's also a broader backdrop to this whole thing. In the last few days, the U.S. Supreme Court published three significant decisions that may affect the crypto industry's relationship with federal regulators moving forward. The first, on Thursday, was its ruling in SEC v. Jarkesy, wherein the high court ruled that the SEC and other federal regulators couldn't use in-house administrative proceedings to hear cases.  CoinDesk's Cheyenne Ligon reported that there haven't been that many cases in the crypto industry that were resolved through these administrative proceedings so far, so this may not have too big an impact.  On Friday, the Supreme Court overturned the 40-year-old Chevron Deference precedent, ruling that the earlier Supreme Court had created an ""unworkable"" doctrine.  And on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that there is no statute of limitations on when private parties can sue a federal agency's rulemaking, which might confound the industry's hopes of forcing the SEC to craft crypto-specific rules.

30371238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627665,1720058454,Bitcoin Is Up 2X But Speculators Are Underwater: Will The Sell-off Continue?,"Bitcoin is down at press time, wiping the weekend’s gains and inching closer to $60,000. If bears press on, increasing their shorts, the odds of the coin sliding below the psychological number and $56,800 remain high. Glassnode: STHs Are In Red As the world’s most valuable coin finds itself at a critical juncture, fast approaching $60,000, on-chain data points to weakness at spot rates. Related Reading: FET Bearish Descent Targets Key $0.966 Level, More Dips Ahead? In a post on X, Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm, highlighted how BTC finds itself in a unique situation. While Bitcoin is in green, rallying by over 100% over the last year, data shows that many short-term holders (STHs), primarily traders and speculators, are underwater. STHs are entities or addresses that bought their coins in the last 155 days or before the end of 2023. During this time, not only did prices soar to an all-time high, meaning all coins were in circulation by mid-March 2024, but speculators were raving, expecting prices to continue soaring. However, this didn’t come to pass because no sooner had BTC breached $70,000, rising to $73,800, prices fell sharply. By mid-May, BTC cratered to $56,800 before briefly bouncing to around $71,500. The failure of bulls to break $72,000, a level closely monitored by traders, means sellers have the upper hand at press time. Glassnode’s assessment suggests that though STHs are feeling the pressure, only those who bought and HODL over the last year are in the money. With a 2X surge over the previous 12 months, BTC is technically in an uptrend, aligning with gains from the second half of 2023. HODLers Are In The Money: Why Are BTC Whales Selling? Other parallel data shows that long-term holders (LTHs), especially those who bought in the last five to seven years, enjoy a realized price of less than $7,300. This means that regardless of the current volatility, these HODLers are in the money and can wait for the current shake-out to end. Related Reading: Avalanche On The Verge: Will AVAX Break Out And Reach $65? Amid this state of affairs, Lookonchain data shows that Bitcoin whales have been moving coins to Binance. Often, transfers to centralized exchanges are considered bearish. Therefore, the more coins sent, the more bearish the sentiment and the net negative it is on prices. As of July 3, the analytics platform noted that one whale sent 1,023 BTC, worth roughly $62 million, to Binance. Earlier, another whale transferred 1,723 BTC, worth over $106 million, to the world’s largest crypto exchange.

30367789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627681,1720053027,Longest Miner Capitulation Since 2022 Signals Potential Bitcoin Rally Ahead,"Bitcoin (BTC) has recently struggled to regain bullish momentum, remaining in a consolidation phase just above the crucial $60,000 support. Despite reaching an all-time high three months ago, the largest cryptocurrency witnessed a dip to as low as $59,500 on Wednesday due to increased selling pressure from miners. BTC Selling Spree The ongoing miner capitulation, the longest observed since the summer of 2022 before the FTX implosion, indicates the Bitcoin Halving supply-squeeze effect. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Bitcoin miners have sold more than 2,300 BTC in the past 3 days, amounting to approximately $145 million. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Inches Closer To All-Time High – Will TON Hit $8 This Week? This selling pressure from miners adds to the recent BTC sales by the US and German governments, contributing to the market’s downward pressure and keeping prices within the lower range of the wider consolidation zone between $60,000 and $70,000 witnessed in recent months. Notably, addresses linked to the German and US governments have sent $737 million worth of BTC to exchanges, including Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken, in various transactions. As the selling pressure from governments and miners subsides over time, market observers expect a potential price recovery for BTC, following the typical pattern observed during the post-Halving period, where new all-time highs are often achieved. Bitcoin Price Outlook Market expert Scott Melker points out that the market may be nearing a crucial signal, stating that if a daily candle closes below the $60,300 level, it could lead to a bullish divergence. This would involve the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) moving out of oversold territory, similar to last August when the price was around $26,000. Melker emphasizes the need for a close below the mentioned level, followed by a clear upward move in the RSI without making a lower low. It would require a significant downward move for the RSI to go lower than its level on June 24th. Related Reading: Avalanche On The Verge: Will AVAX Break Out And Reach $65? However, crypto analyst Andrew Kang highlights the significance of a potential loss of the four-month range on Bitcoin, drawing parallels with the range observed in May 2021 following a parabolic rally of BTC and altcoins. Kang notes that over $50 billion in crypto leverage is currently at near all-time highs, compounded by the fact that the market has been in a prolonged consolidation phase for 18 weeks without experiencing extreme washouts, as seen during the 2020-2021 bull market. Moreover, Kang suggests that initial estimates of the low $50,000s may have been too conservative, and a more significant reset to the $40,000s could be possible. Such a pullback would substantially impact the market and likely necessitate a few months of choppy or downward price action before a reversal and an upward trend could be established. At the time of writing, BTC has recovered the $60,350 level after its brief dip below this crucial support for further movements to the upside. The largest cryptocurrency in the market has erased all gains in wider time frames, and it is currently recording a 12% price decrease in the monthly time frame.
