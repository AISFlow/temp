42405751,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPOC,1611354851,"Bitcoin Core Lead Maintainer Steps Back, Encourages Decentralization","Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan has decided to take ""even more"" of a ""background role"" for the sake of further decentralizing the project, according to a new blog post.      Bitcoin Core is the key software underpinning the Bitcoin network. While van der Laan's work is mostly ""janitorial"" in nature, making sure the project's code proceeds smoothly, some in the community view him as a leader of sorts. As van der Laan puts it, he's become a sort of ""centralized bottleneck.""      His announcement comes after finding himself in the midst of controversy on Thursday. Some Bitcoin users didn't like his decision to pull the white paper from bitcoincore.org, following legal threats from Craig Wright. But van der Laan maintains this decision to pull back from Core is one he's been thinking about for a while.    Read more: Bitcoin Developers Weigh the Costs of Defying White Paper Copyright Claim    ""I will start by delegating my own tasks, and decreasing my involvement. I do not intend to stop contributing to Bitcoin, or even to the Bitcoin Core project, but I would like to remove myself from the critical path and take (even more) of a background role,"" he wrote.    Decentralizing Bitcoin Core development    He thinks this move will help to decentralize the project, a digital currency that is supposed to not have any leaders. ""One thing is clear: This is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously,"" van der Laan wrote.      His decision is a part of a much larger effort to further decentralize the project. For instance, 2020 saw a wave of Bitcoin companies doling out grants to developers working on the underlying protocol full-time.      Exchange OKCoin, for instance, is funding Marco Falke, who is the most active maintainer behind van der Laan in terms of commits – code changes that have been successfully added to the project. Popular exchange Coinbase is now supporting two developers as well, after receiving many requests to do so from the community. Several other companies have joined them in doling out grants over the last year.    Read more: Crypto Long & Short: How Bitcoin Development Is Evolving – And What’s Behind It    Bitcoin Core contributor John Newbery launched non-profit Brink for mentoring and funding more developers as well, in an effort to get even more contributors involved, particularly from diverse backgrounds.      Indeed, van der Laan notes in his post that he's no longer the most active Bitcoin Core maintainer, as several others have joined ranks over the years.      Plus, he outlines other ideas for decentralizing the project. For instance, Bitcoincore.org is one of the major websites where users can download new versions of the Bitcoin Core code. But it is privately owned and centralized. He suggests moving it to an organization.      ""Bitcoin is quite different in some of the requirements here from other [free and open-source software] projects, so we’ll have to develop some tools as we go,"" van der Laan wrote. ""We could also, definitely, use some help here.""

42405756,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPV5,1611353772,Bitcoin Developers Weigh the Costs of Defying White Paper Copyright Claim,"The Bitcoin community is debating the extent to which Bitcoin Core developers and maintainers should shoulder the symbolic burden of hosting its white paper, particularly when doing so could unnecessarily sap their time and finances.      The question arose after the Bitcoin white paper was taken down from Bitcoincore.org, a canonical repository for the Bitcoin software and educational resources like Satoshi’s 10-page thesis, following legal threats of copyright infringement from nChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright.      Wright, who has made a career of his claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, also helped to spawn the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV).      The Bitcoin white paper, titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,"" was published by Satoshi Nakamoto under an MIT public license in 2008 and is distributed widely in many forms around the world. Wright has filed a copyright claim and that claim has been processed, but it is still open to challenge.    Read more: What Is the Bitcoin White Paper?    But whether his legal pressure has merit is not the issue: Wright is no stranger to lawsuits and has eagerly sued prominent Bitcoiners, like British podcast Peter McCormack, for challenging his claim as the inventor of Bitcoin.      The issue is whether it would be best to entertain another of Wright’s enervating (but expensive) lawsuits with a show of strength, or if sidestepping the problem entirely by removing the white paper – which exists in numerous corners of the web anyway – would be a wiser path for Bitcoincore.org to follow.      While Bitcoincore.org’s maintainers have scuttled the white paper from the site, Bitcoin.org, the other website in the lawsuit’s sights, has yet to remove the white paper.    Read more: Craig Wright Again Claims Authorship of Bitcoin White Paper    As to the matter of practicality vs. principal, as ever, Bitcoin’s open-source community is at odds with itself.    No harm, no foul    Prolific Bitcoin contributor Gregory Maxwell, for instance, is in the camp that argues hosting the white paper on the Bitcoin Core website carries unneeded legal and financial risk for the Bitcoin Core developers who maintain the site.      ""It's not currently needed there: The bitcoin white paper is already all over the place, it is on dozens of sites, it is in the Bitcoin blockchain and with publicity about this nonsense it's going to get published in 1,000 more places.""    Read more: Why Everyone From Square to Facebook Is Now Hosting the Bitcoin White Paper    The fuss is over a digital paper, Maxwell points out, not even the Bitcoin code itself, which will chug on, entirely unaffected by the brouhaha.    ""Wright might be able to abuse the legal system to take a copy down, or even to take down bitcoincore.org entirely (maybe even bitcoin.org entirely). And what effect would that have on Bitcoin? NONE. No effect at all. What effect would it have on the availability of the whitepaper? If anything it would make it more available. But even if he managed to get the whitepaper taken off every site – a total impossibility – what would that do to Bitcoin? Still nothing.""Greg Maxwell    He adds that instead of distracting Bitcoin engineers with years of hearings and lawsuits costing millions of dollars, it would be better to allow them the freedom to continue their important work maintaining Bitcoin. He cites McCormack’s and other cases as evidence that Wright has plenty of money to throw at court hearings that go nowhere (and he’s even failed to pay legally mandated restitution after losing these fights, Maxwell says in the post).    A matter of principle and pride     Responding to Maxwell’s post, Cobra, a pseudonymous developer who maintains the Bitcoin.org website, disagrees with Maxwell’s conclusion that “this isn’t the right battle.” Where Maxwell thinks it would show weakness to engage with Wright, Cobra believes submitting to the demand is weakness as well.      “With respect to Greg, I think the Bitcoin Core project submitting to unreasonable demands that lack merit is a bad thing, and doesn't inspire confidence in the robustness of the project to social and legal attacks” Cobra told CoinDesk over direct message.      Cobra told CoinDesk the developers are willing to go to court to combat Wright’s “nonsense” allegations if necessary.    Can’t sue ‘em all    Other Bitcoiners, in response to a post by Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan (@orionwl), were more sympathetic.      ""Y’all made the right decision,"" Pierre Rochard, Nakamoto Institute co-founder and Bitcoin Strategist at Kraken, responded. ""Thank you for your excellent stewardship of the project.""    Decentralizing Bitcoin Core    Still, some suggested that van der Laan and other Bitcoin Core developers who would rather avoid legal conflict should pass the Bitcoincore.org domain on to someone who is willing to bear the litigious brunt of a potential lawsuit.      In a blog post yesterday, Bitcoin Core’s lead maintainer made it clear that, in his view, this goes further than the debate over taking down the white paper that, in itself, is likely to be a battle that will need broader support than one person could handle alone.      Indeed, he had already begun considering “decreasing [his] involvement” in the open source project prior to this week’s events.      The “responses on social media” to Bitcoincore.org’s delisting the white paper he writes in the post “have made me realize that people have strange expectations from me, and what my role in the Bitcoin Core project is.”      Van der Laan will be stepping down as chair of Bitcoin Core’s weekly meetings. For the rest of the post, he proposes ways to further decentralize Bitcoin’s development and software distribution.      “Some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale FOSS project are no longer so for one running a 600 billion dollar system. Market cap is famously deceptive, but my point is not about specific numbers here,” he writes.      “This is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/22/bitcoin-developers-weigh-the-costs-of-defying-white-paper-copyright-claim,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e57ae14ae16b63f3ffc02e06439621ab002f6246-2560x1872.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405762,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPa0,1611351197,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Back Above $33K While Ether Up 65% in 2021,"Crypto markets have reversed course across the board and are flashing green Friday. Bitcoin crossed over $32,000 and ether is rallying hard in 2021 so far.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $33,608 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 5.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $28,845-$33,873 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was on an uptrend Friday, a marked reversal from the past several days. The price per 1 BTC bottomed out at $28,845 around 01:00 UTC (8:00 p.m. ET Thursday) and since then the world’s oldest cryptocurrency has been on an upward run. It reached as high as $33,873, according to CoinDesk 20 data, an appreciation of over 17% in that time span. Price has since settled somewhat, at $33,608 as of press time.      Read More: MicroStrategy Buys the Dip, Adds $10M to Bitcoin Treasury      Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director for multi-asset brokerage eToro, says one support level, where traders scoop up bitcoin to push the price back up, seems to have taken hold, leading to the reversal Friday. “There appears to be strong support around $30,000, as prices have rebounded to trade north of $32,000,” Hirsch told CoinDesk. This consolidation is likely the result of smart money continuing to buy bitcoin at a perceived discount.      Quantitative trading firm QCP Capital echoed a similar sentiment about the $30,000 level in its most recent investor letter published Friday. “In the near term, we're expecting a key battle at the $30,000 spot level. This battle for the $30,000 weekly close will be key.”      In the derivatives market, bitcoin funding rates for swaps continue heading towards zero, particularly on venue FTX, which currently has the lowest rate, at 0.0318%. This signals leveraged demand to go long is dissipating.      “We pay close attention to weekend price action and the leveraged [perpetual] funding rates to gauge retail interest,” QCP noted Friday.      Read More: Bitcoin Exchange LVL Launches Mastercard Debit Card      In the futures market, total open interest (OI) on the eight exchanges monitored by the CoinDesk 20 was at $11 billion Thursday, down from Tuesday’s record high of $13 billion. That is a sign institutional investors are losing interest and may be unwinding some of their positions.      “After the BTC top two weeks ago, the strength in U.S. hours has lost momentum for the first time,” QCP also noted. “This is a clear sign of exhaustion in demand from the U.S. institutions and corporates [that] have been the primary drivers of this bull run.”      Yet, macroeconomics may come into play, eToro’s Hirsch noted to CoinDesk. “With economic uncertainty continuing as the COVID-19 pandemic continues raging and central bank money printing continues unchecked, I’d expect more people to eventually rotate back into bitcoin in the not-too-distant future.”    Ether blowing out bitcoin in 2021    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $1,253 and climbing 4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Mining Pools Threaten to Collude Against Contentious Ethereum Update      While bitcoin has gained more than 15% thus far in 2021, ether is doing much better, up over 70% over the same time frame. “Ether appears to have finally broken its recent lockstep correlation with bitcoin, as evidenced by its more rapid recovery after a sell-off, which also appears to have been fueled by profit taking after the second-largest crypto asset hit an all-time high earlier this week,” noted eToro’s Guy Hirsch.      Jake Brukhman, chief executive officer of crypto investment firm CoinFund, told CoinDesk investors are taking profits made from bitcoin and trading into ether and other assets given the 2021 price performance and high profile of bitcoin.      “I think the major assets are going through a dynamic of high hitting, consolidation and rotation,” Brukhman said. “Bitcoin hits [a] high, then consolidates and the money flows into ether. Then ether hits a high, then consolidates and the money flows into polkadot.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Friday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    tezos (XTZ) + 16.4%  chainlink (LINK) + 12.7%  algorand (ALGO) + 8.7%    One notable loser:    ethereum classic (ETC) - 0.60%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 index ended the day in the red 0.44% as traders took profits ahead of corporate earnings reports that will arrive next week.

Meanwhile, Janet Yellen has offered a more nuanced view of crypto and small Ethereum mining pools are organizing a campaign against a potential network upgrade.    Top shelf    Miners revolt! Eight Ethereum mining pools amounting to around 30% of the network’s hash power have formed a quasi-cartel to push back against a proposed blockchain update that would reduce their mining fees. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, floated by Vitalik Buterin, would burn mining fees to help reduce transaction cost volatility. While larger mining pools, like BitFly, F2Pool and Sparkpool, are ambivalent about the upgrade, smaller miners are calling to nix EIP 1559, according to CoinDesk tech reporter Will Foxley.      Trust progress? Grayscale Investments is laying the groundwork for what could be five new cryptocurrency trusts, for chainlink, basic attention token, decentraland, livepeer and tezos. Preliminary paperwork was filed by the firm's ""statutory trustee,” though it does not guarantee any of these investable products will see the light of day, according to reporting from CoinDesk's Dan Palmer. (Digital Currency Group owns both CoinDesk and Grayscale.)      Banking deposits Signature Bank disclosed $10 billion in deposits from its cryptocurrency company clients, in an earnings call Thursday. Representing 16% of the New York firm’s total deposits, this sum is also twice that of competitor Silvergate Bank, which is widely considered the first crypto-forward bank, CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reports. Without revealing names, Signature’s chief executive said it now banks the “top five crypto exchanges.”      Crypto sweep The U.S. government’s top investments watchdog flagged a series of unregistered cryptocurrency companies for allegedly duping mostly international investors with false corporate information. Of the 28 suspect investment firms the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called out Thursday, CoinDesk reporter Danny Nelson found eight that appear to target would-be cryptocurrency investors.      Big in Japan Following the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple, Japanese XRP-stans are left wondering. The cryptocurrency has gained traction in the country as a remittance tool, is backed by one of the largest Japanese financial firms, SBI, and is considered a “cryptocurrency” – not a security, arguably – by Japan’s economy regulator. “The crypto community, I feel, sees this as a big blow to them and as kind of a precursor to what could come in the future, that other companies are also vulnerable,” Mike Kayamori, Liquid Global CEO, told CoinDesk’s Sandali Handagama.

(Blog)      CUT TO THE CORE: A notable Bitcoin Core dev reflects on his time building and argues Bitcoin needs to decentralize. (Blog)    Market intel    Efficient markets? Two events batted around to explain bitcoin’s 13% price drop on Thursday are a bit more complicated than they appear on the surface. Yesterday, bitcoin saw its biggest intraday drop since March 12, 2020, when bitcoin tumbled 39%.      Looking for cause, some suggested the markets threw a temper tantrum in response to a rumor that a double-spend appeared in the wild, on the Bitcoin blockchain. That story was picked up by the mainstream press. Others, that traders were spooked by comments made by Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, who raised concerns about crypto’s use in the criminal underground. That story was picked up by the mainstream press, too.      CoinDesk tech reporter Colin Harper set the record straight: The transaction that looked like a double-spend – the very phenomenon Bitcoin was created to address – was a normal occurrence. The trouble bubbled up after BitMEX researchers found an orphan block containing a 0.00062063 BTC transaction that was also included in a valid block mined to the blockchain.      But it really was no big deal. In what’s called a block reorganization, Bitcoin programmatically dealt with the issue. While the bitcoin was technically “double-spent,” Harper notes, “no new coins were added to Bitcoin’s supply.”      Meanwhile, following a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing where Yellen spoke briefly about money laundering and terrorist funding issues that plague bitcoin on Wednesday, the former Federal Reserve Chair disclosed a nuanced opinion of crypto in a letter to the Senate Finance Committee a day later.      To wit: “I think we need to look closely at how to encourage their use for legitimate activities while curtailing their use for malign and illegal activities,” said the Treasury Secretary nominee. “If confirmed, I intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking and securities regulators on how to implement an effective regulatory framework for these and other fintech innovations.”      She is likely to be confirmed today, CoinDesk regulatory reporter Nikhilesh De said.      While neither the rumored double-spend nor Yellen’s concerns are nonevents, they were both based on limited or faulty information that was picked up, (including in yesterday’s Blockchain Bites).      That said, neither news items should be blamed for the market spat, nor should the new information in the public register be seen as leading to today’s price appreciation. As Nic Carter as written, the efficient market hypothesis, the idea that states that asset prices reflect all available information, is complicated.      For now, like during the panic in March, it’s best to keep in mind that “time in the market beats timing the market.”    At stake    Bitcoin's support Yesterday was a show of solidarity in the Bitcoin community, after nChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright pushed for cultural touchstones, Bitcoin.org and Bitcoincore.org, to pull the first cryptocurrency white paper off their sites.      Wright, who has long claimed to be Bitcoin’s pseudo-anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has filed for patents over Bitcoin’s earliest documentation and intellectual property. The notably rambunctious developer, law student and academic is also the creator of Bitcoin SV (for Satoshi’s Vision), a fork of Bitcoin Cash and competitor coin.      Bitcoin.org rebutted Wright’s legal challenge and kept the document up, though Bitcoincore.org – the main repository for the Bitcoin code base – took it down.      No matter, as CoinDesk Managing Editor Zack Seward reported, some of crypto’s most prominent voices have decided to host a mirror copy. These include Square, Coin Center, Facebook subsidiary Novi and CoinDesk, among dozens more companies, nonprofits and individuals. It has also been uploaded to the “uncensorable” Arweave platform as well as internet alternative the InterPlanetary File System (IFPS), Seward notes.      According to Bitcoin.org, the Bitcoin white paper was published under an open MIT license by Nakamoto, making it a public domain document. “There is no doubt” people have the legal right to host the white paper, the nonprofit said.      Wright has long been a thorn in the Bitcoin community’s side, launching several lawsuits against prominent personalities who questioned his claims of being the authentic Nakamoto. Hodlnaut, the pseudonymous account behind the lightning torch experiment and who was sued for defamation, was vaulted into the spotlight in 2019 with a wave of bitcoin enthusiasts adopting his cartoon cat avatar for their Twitter profile photos.      While the event shows Bitcoin is still capable of rallying together, the real issue at play is much bigger than Wright’s copyright claims. Dozens of businesses have patent key technologies off of, or that support, this open-source system. In some sense, some would argue, a copyright is simply anathema to Bitcoin’s core ideal of permissiveness.

42405760,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPX3,1611342056,"Institutions Keep Buying Bitcoin's Dip, Despite Near-term Volatility: Data","Bitcoin’s price has been on a roller coaster this week, erasing almost all of its 2021’s gains on Thursday. Yet, according to on-chain data, institutions have continued their purchases of bitcoin despite the volatility and near-term bearish market sentiment.      Data from on-chain data site Glassnode shows the number of addresses with 1,000 or more bitcoin (often called ""whales"") continued to increase this week while bitcoin’s price dropped, dipping below $30,000 on Thursday. The count of such addresses dropped in late December and has spiked again since the beginning of 2021.      As well, the number of the total bitcoin transactions on the network remains high, according to data from South-Korea based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. However, the ratio of bitcoin transfers involving all exchanges to all bitcoins transfers network-wide has not gone up, indicating that most transactions were done through over-the-counter (OTC) deals, a preferred approach by institutional investors.      One example of a large buyer during a dip occurred early Friday, when MicroStrategy announced that it bought 314 more bitcoin for $10 million during the latest market sell-off.      ""Only 7% of network transactions are used for exchange deposits and withdrawals,"" Ki Young Jun, chief executive at CryptoQuant, said, adding that ""93% of transactions in the Bitcoin network is used for non-exchange transactions like OTC deals.""      Read More: MicroStrategy Buys the Dip, Adds $10M to Bitcoin Treasury      This “buying-the-dip” behavior by institutions such as MicroStrategy isn’t something new. A fourth-quarter market report from OKEx Insights, the research arm of crypto derivatives exchange OKEx, shows that institutional investors did not take “the-wait-and-see” approach when prices were experiencing high volatility last year.      The percentage of on-chain transactions over 1,000 bitcoin spiked to over 45% in September and remains relatively high from just above 5% in late June last year, according to the OKEx Insights report.      “Institutional investors really piled into the bitcoin space after Paul Tudor Jones announced his entrance, and they didn't stop as 2020 came to a close,” the report read. “Additionally, we can assume that institutions were on the bidding end of the spectrum and buying large amounts of BTC – as opposed to selling – since the price of the leading cryptocurrency rose in a parabolic fashion throughout Q4 2020.”      Read More: Hedge Fund Billionaire Tudor Jones Says Bitcoin Rally Only in ‘First Inning’: Report      The recent price volatility is due to “over-leveraged” speculative traders and retail investors who found themselves “weak-handed,"" according to OKEx Insights Senior Editor Adam James.      “There is little reason to assume institutional interest in the bitcoin space will suddenly disappear in 2021,” James said, noting MicroStrategy’s new bitcoin purchase and BlackRock’s interest in bitcoin futures. “Because institutional investors tend to have longer time frames in mind when investing, they are unlikely to be phased by January's price decrease and potentially happy to make investments at lower prices.”      At the press time, bitcoin's price traded at $33,308.06, up 4.56% in the past 24 hours, according to the CoinDesk BPI.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/22/institutions-keep-buying-bitcoins-dip-despite-near-term-volatility-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45f386b79d47d078f565802996c2deb17dab7a0d-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405759,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPY2,1611338221,Money Reimagined: Letter to President Biden,"Welcome to this week’s Money Reimagined, coming to you two days into a new U.S. presidency.      Already, with various executive orders and a host of cabinet and agency nominee names emerging, President Joe Biden has fostered the palpable sense of a slate being cleaned.      As for what it means for crypto, the turnover in the White House gave Sheila Warren and me reason to invite Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association and Amy Kim of the Digital Chamber of Commerce onto our weekly podcast. We discussed the outlook for regulation under the Biden administration. Check out the episode. But first, read the newsletter, which starts with an open letter to the new U.S. president.    Is Biden ready for a new world of money?    Dear President Biden,      Congratulations on an inspiring inauguration.      The stirring speeches, uplifting poems and dazzling fireworks conveyed a real sense of purpose and hope. But now they’re over. Time to get to work.      Let’s first check the dashboard:    COVID-19 deaths: 408,000  Unemployed Americans: 10 million  Fiscal deficit: $3.3 trillion  Government debt to GDP: 98.2%    You most urgently need to tackle the first two items. But that will only push the third and fourth numbers much, much higher.      What’s more, the dashboard is dangerously simplistic. The problem is not the U.S. government balance sheet per se, but the global account. In November, the Institute of International Finance forecast that world public debt would hit $277 trillion by year’s end, or 365% of world GDP. As for advanced economies, their aggregate debt was at 432% of GDP in the third quarter.      The task at hand: to get the international community to jointly get those numbers into a sustainable state and avoid a 1930s-style global depression.      Ignore the deficit hawks telling you fiscal austerity is the answer. You can’t ask an exhausted public to bear the cost of making bankers and hedge fund managers whole unless you want a violent insurrection far bigger than the one on Jan. 6.      Yet, it’s impossible to foresee the degree of economic growth needed to repay those debts.      The only way out is through synchronized debt monetization. That means addressing the elephant in the room: overhauling the global financial system in which the U.S. dollar is king. It means recreating that system around digital currencies.    Coordinated action    Why must this be an international solution? Well, let’s first look at how a unilateral fix would play out, if it were actually possible:    The Federal Reserve would go full MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) printing dollars with abandon.  More circulating dollars equals higher nominal U.S. tax collection.  Voilà! The fixed-value debt is easily paid off.  Meanwhile, the USD exchange rate tanks versus EUR, GBP, RMG and JPY.  Cheaper U.S. exports, more expensive imports lead to U.S. production growth.  U.S. employers hire like crazy.    Appealing, right? In this case, the cost – inflation – is essentially exported to foreigners.      The problem, of course, is that it only works if every other major economy has the opposite problem – if their economies are too strong, their currencies too weak and their government debt loads well under control. Since that’s not the case, this kind of unilateral action would have catastrophic consequences because it would immediately trigger counter-devalutions from other countries. You’d get something like the devastating currency war triggered by the 1933 Smoot-Hawley Act.      It’s why, in this case especially, monetization must be jointly calibrated.      What does that look like? Well, for one, all central banks’ balance sheets would explode even more than they have already – see chart below. But this time it would likely be with bonds bought directly from their governments.      Governments would use the proceeds to repay creditors, the catch being that money, now in greater supply, would buy less than it had previously. The big question is whether this inflationary hit comes as a one-off price adjustment or breeds self-perpetuating hyperinflation – results would vary from country to country, depending on the degree of trust commanded by the government.      But whether they deliver a one-off transfer from creditors to savers or trigger an ongoing collapse that hurts everyone, those extra dollars, euros, yen and yuan must go somewhere. Because all currencies are increasing supply simultaneously, their holders will instead seek out scarce assets such as gold, real estate and, of course, bitcoin.      (Pro tip for the new president: While bitcoin (BTC) is well off its early January highs, its spectacular surge through December suggests people are seeing the scenarios play out. Its price is a useful temperature gauge. Keep your eye on it.)    New system    Setting aside the inflation challenge, there’s a structural problem with synchronized monetary policy: All currencies are not created equal, which makes it difficult to find common ground. The rules for the dollar, the one currency that’s universally used as a denominator for assets and liabilities outside of its home country, differ from others.      This creates incentive misalignments for the Federal Reserve, which has a mandate to serve the U.S. public but also acts a de facto lender of last report to the outside world.      We witnessed this last March. When the global economy seized up due to COVID-19, the world’s banks scrambled to find greenbacks to ensure they could meet their dollar obligations. So the Fed went on an asset-buying spree like never before, creating bank reserves and international swap lines that pumped trillions of dollars into the global banking system.      But what happens if the outside world’s interests conflict with those of the U.S.? What if the U.S. needs a weaker dollar but the world needs a stronger dollar?      Over time this mismatch has created imbalances in the global economy. Many economists worry that it’s approaching the breaking point.      Willem Middelkoop and David Marsh of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a high-level think tank, this week called on the U.S. and China to find a coordinated digital solution or face “monetary breakdown.” They point to former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s suggestion for a new, International Monetary Fund-coordinated digital international reserve currency as a possible mechanism. (Carney refers to this dollar-alternative as “synthetic hegemonic currency.”)      Is a multilateral currency the answer? Or might we instead just move to a common protocol enabling decentralized exchanges between central bank digital currencies and other digital assets such as bitcoin? In the latter case this new, programmable form of money could enable low cost exchange-rate hedging, making an intermediating reserve currency redundant.      The point is that although the U.S. seems all-powerful right now, digital alternatives to the dollar-centric financial system are emerging. Washington, Wall Street and Silicon Valley must be ready.      It’s a good sign you’re seeking to fill regulatory agencies with crypto-savvy leaders, all people well placed to address the big questions raised here. (See “Relevant Reads” below.)      But the changes coming will be huge. To navigate them will take leadership, a bold vision and an openness to new ideas.      Thanks for listening.    Parabolic expansion    Consistent with the theme of this week’s column, a look at central bank balance sheets is in order.      This chart, produced by CoinDesk’s Damanick Dantes and Shuai Hao, using the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database, gives a pretty good sense of the monetary expansion delivered by five of the world’s most important central banks over the past decade and a half, and especially in 2020.      They’ll likely do much, much more as a reckoning with debt and the COVID-19 fallout comes due. It’s why many bitcoin enthusiasts aren’t phased by this week’s pullback in its price.    The Conversation: CSW strikes again    “Faketoshi” is at it again.      Craig S. Wright, the man who wants you to believe he is Satoshi Nakamoto, is pulling more stunts. This time, he is doubling down on his May 2019 move to register a claim to Satoshi’s famous 2008 white paper with the U.S. Copyright Office, by sending takedown messages to two long-running Bitcoin sites: bitcoin.org and bitcoincore.org.      Upfront, let’s be clear: Anyone could have made the U.S. copyright registration. The registration is merely recognition that a claim has been made; it’s not proof of authorship. In fact, the U.S. Copyright Office took pains to clarify that after Wright’s registration, saying it “does not investigate the truth of any statement made” and that it “does not investigate whether there is a provable connection between the claimant and the pseudonymous author.”      Nonetheless, diverging responses from bitcoin.org and bitcoincore.org sparked yet another feisty debate over Wright’s actions and over how to deal with someone with a penchant for such legal actions.      Bitcoincore.org, which is associated with a group of developers focused on the upkeep of Bitcoin’s core protocol, decided to remove the white paper from its site. This prompted an angry reaction from Cobra, the pseudonymous moderator of bitcoin.org, who accused the moderators of bitcoincore.org of “surrendering” in a way that “has lent ammunition to Bitcoin’s enemies, engaged in self-censorship, and compromised its integrity.”      This, retorted long-time Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell in a Reddit thread, is absurd. “With due respect, Cobra is just wrong about ‘capitulation’: The real capitulation is agreeing with the conman that his impotent drama about the white paper might matter or could really accomplish anything.”      Maxwell defended bitcoincore.org’s decision as a “pick your battles” move, arguing that it wasn’t worth letting the well-funded Wright force a costly legal battle when it does nothing to the resilience of Bitcoin itself. Taking it down didn’t matter, Maxwell said, because the MIT-licensed white paper is already everywhere. And “with publicity about this nonsense it's going to get published in 1,000 more places.”      Sure enough, a race to host and re-publish the white paper quickly got underway. A Twitter thread by Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, which started with a tweet listing five websites that were hosting the white paper and which asked, “Who else wants to join this party?”, just got longer and longer. By the end of the day, 124 replies were on that thread, most of which included fresh links to sites hosting the white paper. One reply, from Michael McSweeney at The Block, even pointed out that the U.S. federal government was one of the sites.      For the record, CoinDesk has been hosting the white paper for some time. You can find it here. Free to read. Free to share.    Relevant reads: Biden’s crypto gang    Last week, we looked at the mostly positive responses in the crypto community to news that former Commodities Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler was likely to become head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The community likes people who understand the tech and there was good news to celebrate this week as well.    We learned that former CFTC Commissioner Chris Brummer, who runs the DC Fintech Week out of Georgetown and has written a book on crypto assets, is expected to be nominated to lead that institution.  The Wall Street Journal reported that former Treasury official Michael Barr is expected to be nominated to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates banks. As CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De pointed out, Barr was once a board member of crypto firm Ripple.  And even after some tough words about bitcoin by Treasury Secretary and former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in her spoken Senate testimony Wednesday, bitcoiners were pleasantly surprised to find that her written testimony Thursday took a much more nuanced position toward the cryptocurrency.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael J.

The card is among Mastercard’s premium products and can be used anywhere globally, said LVL CEO Chris Slaughter. Mastercard did not respond to requests for comment by press time.      “It took a couple of months to get [Mastercard] to be comfortable with it being connected to crypto,” Slaughter said. “Convincing them that it was aligned with their premium brand was more involved because their view on crypto businesses is that they’re transactional businesses, not member services businesses. … We’re a subscription service, which is analogous to having a premium card membership in Mastercard’s eyes.”      The debit card is part of LVL’s aim to bring traditional banking services and crypto closer together for the average consumer. In November 2020, the firm removed trading fees on its platform in favor of a subscription-based service. Slaughter said he expects the debit card to generate a “substantial portion” of the firm’s revenue.

Such accounts are opened in the company’s name and have sub-accounts for individual users. In contrast, Slaughter said, LVL offers demand deposit accounts that are opened in the customer’s name and can’t be controlled by LVL.      LVL’s back-end bank is Evolve Bank & Trust, a community bank based in West Memphis, Ark., that the exchange accesses through San Francisco fintech firm Synapse. (Synapse offers APIs that allow other companies to add bank services like checking accounts to their platforms.)      “Other people want to do crypto-linked debit cards but [LVL] is the fastest to market on this,” said Synapse CEO Sankaet Pathak. “One functionality that people constantly desire in the crypto space is the same thing that happened with E-Trade and Schwab – they want deposit capabilities, direct deposit and card issuance linked to their accounts.”      In recent months, companies like peer-to-peer crypto marketplace Paxful, digital investment platform Bitpanda and Manhattan-based bank Quontic have launched or announced plans to launch debit cards linked to crypto accounts.      Last month, BlockFi announced plans for a bitcoin rewards credit card.      “A lot of the debit cards that exist in the crypto ecosystem are the kind that are oriented around this idea of spending your crypto, which at least clients at BlockFi are not interested in doing,” CEO Zack Prince told CoinDesk in an interview at the time.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/22/bitcoin-exchange-lvl-launches-mastercard-debit-card,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60d9da6641645a9b5eb6910322b6e5dc2ac9887f-1080x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sources told Bloomberg the technology company plans for its facility to be capable of manufacturing 3-nanometer chips in the future.  The exact spend amount could fluctuate, but Samsung is vying to bring back to the U.S. some of the chip fabrication market share that Asian markets currently control.  ""This is the news the bitcoin mining industry has been anxiously waiting for; a U.S.-based chip foundry will drastically change the power dynamic between the East and the West,"" said Nick Hansen, CEO of Seattle-based mining company Luxor Technology, in a direct message with CoinDesk.  In the future, this could have positive effects for supply chain strains suffered by bitcoin mining machine manufacturers that routinely struggle to obtain a steady and sufficient quantity of chips from foundries.  ""Currently, accessing consistent supply of mining machines is a huge bottleneck for industry growth. This will uproot a long-held duopoly in China that has broad-reaching implications,"" Hansen said.  But bitcoin miners face incredibly strong competition for these chips from technology giants including Apple and Nvidia, making them a much lower priority customer for most foundries.  Amid a surge in bitcoin's price and interesting in mining, demand for new mining ASICs and existing manufacturing constraints have caused leading manufactures like Bitmain to sell out of mining ASICs almost through the end of 2021.  Bloomberg reported that Samsung plans to invest $116 billion into its foundry and chip design businesses over the next decade in a strong bid to overtake leading manufacturer TSMC.

42405755,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPS8,1611331243,At Least One Key Huobi Executive Is In Custody in China: Sources,"At least one key executive from crypto exchange Huobi is now in custody with Chinese police due to an investigation related to the exchange’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading service, multiple sources have told CoinDesk, giving more credence to rumors that have been circulating on Chinese social media.      The two people, including COO Jiawei Zhu, were taken by the police in November and December 2020, respectively. Trading on the exchange is not affected because the police are investigating a case related to the Huobi’s separate OTC trading business, said these sources, which include former employees close to Huobi’s core team members and industry executives with direct knowledge about the matter.      Zhu was taken by local police during a company trip in the city of Zunyi in South China’s Guizhou province in November. He is currently still in custody, according to the sources.      CoinDesk first asked Huobi to confirm details in the story on Jan. 15. The exchange had not provided comments as of press time.      Zhu was assisting the police with an investigation, according to a report by Chinese publication The Paper, dated Nov. 30. The police did not take coercive measures to make Zhu cooperate, and the situation is similar to OKEx founder Star Xu’s case, the report indicated. No further details regarding Zhu’s detention in November are provided in the report.      The other person, who is one of the managers in charge of Huobi’s OTC trading services, was detained in December but was released recently by the police, according to one former employee.      It remains unclear whether the local police also put in custody the exchange’s co-founder, Lin Li, during the trip. Li might have been assisting the police with investigations, according to the sources. “Few people know Li’s whereabouts nowadays,” one source said.      Huobi Tech, the Hong Kong-based public company acquired by Li through a reverse takeover, has yet to file any disclosure related to the incident with the Hong Kong Exchange, indicating Li is not facing any criminal charges.      A number of Huobi’s current employees across different departments including trading, finance and legal have been interviewed by the police to assist the investigation. But the police have not been able to bring in more people for questioning because a large part of the exchange’s operations is decentralized, one former employee said.      “Three of their key people are in prison,” Su Zhu, CEO of Singapore-based crypto investment firm Three Arrows, said of the investigation about Huobi in a Dec. 12 podcast. Zhu later clarified to CoinDesk about his comment on the podcast saying that he meant people were in custody rather than in jail and he is not certain why they are in custody.      Huobi came on the police’s radar, in part, because of a particular investigation in 2018, which is also related to major exchange OKEx’s OTC trading services, one former employee said.      The current investigation appears to be focused on potential financial crimes conducted through the exchange’s OTC trading services, including online gambling, two former employees said.      The investigation is related to a particular case the Shanxi local police have been working on, three of the sources said. It was the local police from Shanxi province who were trying to find Huobi’s key executives while they were on the trip in Zunyi, according to two of the sources.      The investigation took place at a time when local police in Shanxi province were ratcheting up their anti-corruption campaign and tightening surveillance over financial transactions via a variety of platforms, according to the sources.      Despite Huobi’s fairly close relationship with the Chinese government, the exchange was not exempt from the investigation because the case is politically sensitive, the sources said.      As one of the largest crypto exchanges founded in China, Huobi has been working with the Chinese government to develop blockchain technology. It has jointly launched multiple blockchain initiatives with the Chinese government and has a Communist Party committee setup in Beijing Lianhuo Information Services Company in 2018, which is one of its subsidiaries based in the city.      Star Xu, the OKEx founder, was reportedly held in custody in October to assist the Chinese police with an investigation. The rumors that Huobi’s executives were taken by the police emerged on Chinese social media in November shortly after the trip. A Huobi spokesperson at the time denied the rumors in an interview with CoinDesk.      The Chinese police appear to have intensified their crackdown on crypto exchanges’ OTC trading services in the last year.      Zhao Dong, one of the most prominent OTC traders in China and co-founder of crypto lending platform RenrenBit, was taken by the Chinese police to assist its investigations in July 2020.      OTC trading has become one of the major channels for Chinese crypto investors and miners to find counterparties and process trade orders since the People’s Bank of China, which is the country’s central bank, started to clamp down on crypto trading on centralized exchanges in September 2017.      Such trading tends to be difficult for Chinese authorities to trace, and is less strict about Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) compliance, compared to trading on centralized exchanges.    Read more: Huobi Guarantees Normal Operations During OKEx’s Suspension of Crypto Withdrawals    One of the reasons Huobi has yet to inform its customers of any information related to the incident is that, unlike OKEx, the exchange’s private keys to its crypto wallets are held by multiple people. Thus, Huobi can still process withdrawals, the sources said.      OKEx, by contrast, informed its customers the exchange would be suspending withdrawals because the private key holder was assisting an investigation with the Chinese public security bureau and could not be reached at that moment. The exchange resumed withdrawals on Nov. 26, five weeks after the suspension.

42405757,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPU6,1611328365,Ethereum's Road to $2K: 3 Reasons to Be Bullish,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, set a new all-time high of $1,439.33. This is the first time the digital asset has been over the $1,400 level since Jan. 13, 2018. Ethereum’s YTD gains now total 66.15% – over 6x higher than the leading cryptocurrency and outstripping both Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK). Despite experiencing a temporary correction, it is still one of the strongest performers among the top 10 assets.      While there were no obvious fundamental catalysts to spur the rise to a new all-time high, ether had been close to breaking the key level for over two weeks after climbing to $1,350 on Jan. 10. The exponentially growing market for decentralized finance, known as DeFi – which now holds over $24 billion worth of crypto assets in its protocols – was also a likely contributor to the bullish momentum behind the asset.  Now, with Ethereum heading closer towards uncharted territory, all eyes will be on the second-largest cryptocurrency hitting its next major milestone, the psychological $2,000 mark. This fabled level is more than a 50% gain away from the current price (at press time), but there are 3 major events scheduled to go live in 2021 that could help make this possible.    1. CME Ethereum Futures    The world’s largest derivatives platform, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), publicly announced on Dec. 16 its plans to launch Ethereum futures by Feb. 8, provided it receives regulatory approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Derivatives are essentially trading contracts that allow investors to bet on the future price of an underlying asset without having to actually own it.      This new cash-settled financial product – which means any profits made will be paid out in US dollars as opposed to ether – comes three years after the exchange launched bitcoin futures, which is now the world’s most traded bitcoin futures product and accounts for over 20% of all open contracts.      The arrival of Ethereum futures will ultimately bring more maturity to the crypto market and, although futures are not physically delivered, greater liquidity. This is beneficial because it will give institutional investors in particular the opportunity to hedge spot positions, which reduces overall risk and in turn makes Ethereum a much more attractive investment.    2. Ether Burning and Predictable Fees    Any action carried out on Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dapps) or protocols are treated as transactions, which require a fee attached to them to encourage miners to process them.  Right now, transaction fees are determined via an auction-style system where users who attach the highest fees to their transactions get them processed the quickest by miners. This system causes a number of issues, namely unpredictable and often extremely high fees during periods of heavy congestion. Network congestion arises whenever there’s a spike in trading activity. For example, if ethereum’s price changes sharply and thousands of traders suddenly want to enter or exit the market around the same time.      EIP 1559 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal put forward by the project’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin, along with developers Eric Corner, Ian Norden, Rick Dudley, and Matthew Slipper, to implement changes to the way ether transaction fees are presented to users, as well as the management of ethereum’s supply.  EIP 1559 suggests scrapping the current auction-style fee system in favor of an algorithmically determined base cost, called the “BASEFEE.” The BASEFEE aims to introduce a uniform fee across all ethereum-centric platforms and services that rises and falls depending on network activity. This means no more fee discrepancies between ERC-20 compatible wallets, protocols, and exchanges.  The EIP does, however, include an option for users to tip miners should they want their transaction processed faster.  The second function of EIP 1559, and the one that will likely have the greatest impact on Ethereum’s future price, is the introduction of burning ether.  Burning means completely removing tokens from existence, causing a reduction in the circulating supply. EIP 1559 plans to burn the BASEFEE so the vast majority of the ether used to process transactions is destroyed as opposed to being given to network validators.      The idea is this will encourage the steady deflation of ether, which, in turn, should help bolster prices over time.      The EIP is anticipated to go live sometime after the Berlin hard fork, which could be as early as February.    3. Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 Rollout    Ethereum is in the process of transitioning from a Proof-of-Work blockchain to one that operates using a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, with the goal of becoming a faster, more efficient, and more scalable platform. There are four separate phases to the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade – Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 – each laying the technical foundation for the next until the final phase is completed.      Phase 0 went live on Dec. 1, 2020, and saw the implementation of the Beacon Chain – a new blockchain layer that will coordinate activity between individual Ethereum shard chains.      Phase 1 is the next stage in Ethereum’s development and will see the launch of 64 shard chains. All transaction activity across the network will eventually be divided among and processed by these separate blockchains. The benefits of this new system will be that transactions won’t need to be validated by the entire network, only by a single shard chain. This will greatly reduce the time it takes to confirm transactions, and it means the overall network will be capable of handling significantly higher volumes without suffering the level of congestion it currently does.      While there is no confirmed date for the launch of Phase 1, it’s expected to arrive sometime this year.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/22/ethereums-road-to-2k-3-reasons-to-be-bullish,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34d11645de9b63c6ee73c0e8a67f23b76e5f2841-2000x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405744,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPJH,1611327550,Russia's Sber Bank Files to Launch Its Own Stablecoin,"Sber, Russia's largest retail bank, has applied for a license with the country's central bank to issue its own digital token for corporate clients.      The digital asset will be available for the companies banking with Sber, which have been expressing interest for blockchain-based deals for some time, a spokesperson from the bank told CoinDesk via email.      ""This stablecoin will allow companies to use smart contracts on Sber's platform based on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Tokenizing both material goods and fiat money on this platform will allow transactions to be fully automatic,"" the Sber press office said.      The digital token will not be a cryptocurrency, but instead ""a tokenized form of the rubles the companies hold on their Sber accounts,"" they said. ""Just like money on a bank account, but running on a different tech infrastructure.""      Sber Deputy Chairman Anatoly Popov told the Interfax news agency on Friday that bank applied to register its blockchain platform with the Bank of Russia at the beginning of this month. According to Russia's law on digital assets, which came into force Jan. 1, 2021, all centralized issuers of digital assets in Russia must register with the regulator.      According to Popov, the registration process takes up to 45 days, after which Sber expects to receive either approval or comments and requests from the central bank. If the projects gets the green light, it's expected to launch some time this spring. One possible challenge might be the lack of clarity regarding taxation of digital assets in Russia, he said – detailed regulation for which is yet to be passed.      Sber launched its Hyperledger Fabric-powered blockchain platform last summer and aired plans to launch its own digital token at the time. The bank has been consistently active in the blockchain space, participating in a number of pilots involving securities on a blockchain.

42405761,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPZ1,1611325116,First Mover: Bitcoin ‘Double-Spend’ FUD Gives Newbies a Volatility Lesson,"Bitcoin (BTC) appeared to stabilize above $31,000 after Thursday's plunge, the biggest since March.      ""A break of $30,000 could have been bad news but it managed to turn things round,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the London-based foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, told clients early Friday in an email. ""We may see a small rebound now, just as we did earlier this month. But the price action we've seen this month suggests there's some nervousness around these levels.""      In traditional markets, European shares slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open, amid growing concerns over the potential impact of coronavirus-related measures in places including the U.K., Italy, Germany and Hong Kong. Gold weakened 1% to $1,851.43 an ounce.    Market moves    It was one of the those days in cryptocurrency markets where, at least for the bulls, everything seemed to go wrong.      Bitcoin prices tumbled 13% on Thursday in the biggest market meltdown since the panic-fueled selling of last March, when the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus became clear. Ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, tumbled 19%, just days after eclipsing its old all-time high from the 2018 bull run.      ""The broader cryptoasset market is finally giving back some of its recent gains in what many continue to believe is a 'healthy' or 'much needed' market-wide correction,"" the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken wrote in a daily email.      As reported Thursday in First Mover, the mood in the bitcoin market had flipped bearish as troubling patterns appeared in price charts, most notably the breakdown of what's known among analysts as a ""contracting triangle."" Essentially, bitcoin had been trading for the past couple weeks in an ever-narrowing range between roughly $34,000 and $40,000, and as prices slid below the lower threshold, the sell-off accelerated.      It didn't help that there were all sorts of other nettlesome news tidbits floating around on social media and the mainstream financial press.      Those included reports of a dreaded ""double-spend"" on the Bitcoin blockchain that might reveal a severe security vulnerability. As reported by CoinDesk's Colin Harper, the hubbub turned out to be no big deal: ""In this case, a chain re-organization of one block occurred, which is fairly common,"" Jason Lau, COO of OKCoin exchange, told CoinDesk.      But the fear, uncertainty and doubt (known as FUD in crypto circles) kept coming as crypto traders and twitterati debated the perceived risks emanating from the rapid growth in the dollar-linked stablecoin tether (USDT), which is under investigation by the New York Attorney General's office.      Some investors focused on U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen's remark during a confirmation hearing earlier this week that cryptocurrencies are a ""particular concern"" when it comes to terrorist financing. But in a follow-up response to questions asked at the U.S. Senate hearing, Yellen wrote that cryptocurrencies also have the potential to ""improve the efficiency of the financial system,"" as reported by CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De.      While traders in digital markets are accustomed to volatility, it may have been a lot to take for the newbies who've only recently crept into digital markets – lured by last year's quadrupling in price, a doubling the year before that and the alluring narrative that bitcoin should hold its value during an era of rampant central bank money printing because of the hard limits on new supplies of the cryptocurrency, which are coded into the underlying blockchain network's original programming.      “Corrections are a natural part of any market and are especially natural in the bitcoin ecosystem,” Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale Investments, told CNBC. New York-based Grayscale, a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk, has been one of the biggest on-ramps in recent months for big institutional investors looking for exposure to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally.      Where does all this leave the market?      Bitcoin's cumulative percentage returns for 2021, which had swelled to as high as 45%, have now been whittled to just 8.3%.      That's still roughly triple what U.S. stocks have done this year. Even so, for crypto traders, it's quite a comedown. Some high-flyers had bought bitcoin options that won't pay out unless prices are above $72,000 on Jan. 29. To get there at this point, the cryptocurrency would have to more than double over the next week.      According to Kraken, the exchange, plenty of buyers appeared in over-the-counter markets as bitcoin fell: ""Flow out of the Americas was predominantly driven by opportunistic BTC buyers who had long been targeting the $30K-$33K region.""      As noted by CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey, Thursday's price plunge came on unusually light trading activity: Daily volume on eight exchanges tracked by CoinDesk totaled $860 million as of late afternoon in New York, a paltry showing compared to the past month’s $4.3 billion average.      Still, it's hard to avoid the nagging question: ""Is this the start of a deeper retracement of merely the testing of the range floor?"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset exchange firm EQUOS, told clients in a note.      For now, prices appear to have stabilized around $31,000, but analysts have warned that a drop below the psychological threshold of $30,000 could lead to further selling.      According to Blom, it's a bullish sign that some 270,000 bitcoins, worth some $8.5 billion at current price levels, are headed for ""known accumulation wallets, depleting exchange balances, which now sit at their lowest levels since August 2018."" In simple terms, bitcoin holders aren't exactly rushing to liquidate.      ""Fundamentally, nothing has changed the core messaging,"" Blom wrote.      The easiest thing to say is that bitcoin is likely to stay volatile.      ""Early in 2021 we have already seen intraday volatility rear its ugly head, and we believe it is likely to do so again throughout the year,"" the cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares wrote Thursday in a report.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin’s shorter-term price woes are likely not over yet, analysts say, with one of them predicting a further decline to $26,000.      “I’m not sure the low of $28,000 seen early Friday is the bottom,” Ki-Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. He highlighted a negative “Coinbase premium” as evidence of weak dip demand from large investors.      CryptoQuant’s Coinbase premium indicator measures the spread between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, which includes the stablecoin tether. A positive spread implies strong institutional inflows.      The Coinbase premium fell as low as -$227 in the past 24 hours. According to Ju, bitcoin consistently traded at a premium of over $50 on Coinbase throughout the rally from $20,000 to $40,000, indicating major spot-market inflows from large investors.      Some analysts remained optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects.      ""The history of bitcoin is littered with such shakeouts, and we expect a whipsaw reversal to $50,000 in short order,” Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, said.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Faces Further Losses Before Rally Restarts, Say Analysts    What's Hot    Bitcoin worries 'fading' as crypto goes mainstream, S&P says (CoinDesk)      Minority mining pools threaten to collude against contentious Ethereum update (CoinDesk)      Guggenheim Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, who predicted bitcoin prices would eventually go to $400K, told CNBC Tuesday that he sees a possible retracement to $20K in the near term (CoinDesk)      Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen offers U.S. Senate a more nuanced take (in writing) on cryptocurrencies (CoinDesk)      Investment-grade corporate bonds have lost money so far this year, in shift from 2020 when Federal Reserve emergency support lifted the market (WSJ)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    U.S. President Joe Biden to sign executive orders to boost food benefits, workers' rights as part of coronavirus-relief economic actions (CNBC)      Georgetown law Professor Chris Brummer (who runs an annual conference on financial technology) tipped as potential candidate to replace Heath Tarbert as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees on-exchange cryptocurrency derivatives in the U.S. (CoinDesk)      European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says pandemic still ""poses serious risks"" and that ""in this environment ample monetary stimulus remains essential"" (CNBC)      JPMorgan board holds CEO Jamie Dimon's annual pay at $31.5M (Reuters)      Morgan Creek's Mark Yusko starts ETF for SPACs along with former Credit Suisse CEO Brady Dougan's new firm (WSJ)    Tweet of the day",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/22/first-mover-bitcoin-double-spend-fud-gives-newbies-a-volatility-lesson,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc2da47458301e29f9de1c0701de417ecdae1352-1450x814.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Every tether is backed by a reserve and their reserve is more than what is in circulation,"" Gregory Pepin, Deltec Bank deputy CEO, said on the latest episode of the ""Unchained"" podcast hosted by journalist Laura Shin. ""We can see it firsthand, so I can confirm that.""      Tether Ltd., the company behind the tether stablecoin (which has a value linked to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis), has been long accused of lacking of transparency about the coin's backing. Indeed, a Tether lawyer said in 2019 each USDT was only about 74% backed by fiat equivalents.      USDT's market capitalization has grown from $4 billion to an astonishing $24 billion in the past 12 months. Reserves are said by Tether on its website to include ""traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.""      Fears about a shortage of backing resurfaced last week after a Medium post cited the discrepancy between the amount of tether issued during the nine months to September 2020 and the funds held at Bahamas-based domestic banks as evidence of a massive shortage of reserves at Tether.      ""There weren’t nearly enough dollars in all the domestic banks in the Bahamas to back the tethers that were floating around in the crypto market,"" the anonymously penned post stated, citing Bahamas central bank figures.      Pepin, however, refuted that claim, stating that Deltec is not a domestic bank and doesn't have an authorized dealer license, which is needed to hold Bahamian dollars in cash and deposits.      ""We cannot take domestic customers and we cannot hold domestic Bahamian dollars. So that report is actually not relevant,"" Pepin told Shin. ""And actually, if [the post's author] took a little effort to go and dig a bit about the size of the Bahamian market of banking, [that person] would have found out that the entire mass of banks have around $200 billion in assets, I believe. And we are a part of that.""      Pepin also offered clarity on the bank's recent disclosure of bitcoin (BTC) purchases for clients, which triggered rumors it was doing so on behalf of Tether. Both the bank and Tether denied the claim last week.      ""We have a very competent and well-respected investment team. And as part of their portfolio education for customers, they actually did an allocation in bitcoin on behalf of those customers,"" Pepin said, noting that the 50-year-old bank's customers range from asset managers to high-net-worth individuals.

Per details shared with CoinDesk, the exchange is in the final phases of integrating the secondary scaling network. It should be live within three to four weeks, OKCoin’s team told CoinDesk.      “We have been a bitcoin exchange since 2013, and while we are excited about [decentralized finance] and other assets, we know bitcoin is the foundation of the entire industry Bitcoin's network is often congested and has high transaction fees, particularly during bull markets,” OKCoin CEO Hong Fang told CoinDesk.    OKCoin Adopts Lightning    The Lightning Network is a technology stack built on top of Bitcoin which facilitates faster and cheaper transactions than Bitcoin’s primary network.    Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?    This integration means OKCoin can lower deposit minimums for bitcoin on Lightning to 0.000001 BTC ($0.03), while the withdrawal maximum is $750. OKCoin representatives told CoinDesk that Lightning Network deposits will show up under users’ regular bitcoin balances, and that users only have to pay Lightning Network fees (usually pennies) when withdrawing.      OKCoin is one of the members of Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain, another scaling solution, wherein a network maintained by a federation of members like OKCoin processes transactions for a fraction of the cost of Bitcoin’s primary network.      OKCoin’s CEO told CoinDesk the exchange may “explore other networks” in the future but is focused on implementing Lightning live on the platform first.

At the turn of 2020, Kraken Exchange announced it would launch support for the network sometime in the first half of 2021. Shortly after the new year, U.K.-based CoinCorner integrated the solution for users of its exchange after having it as a payment option on its merchant plug-in for some months.

42385713,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBKqar,1611322502,Social Networks Are the Next Big Decentralization Opportunity,"The fundamental flaws in modern social media infrastructure are nothing new, and nor is the idea of using blockchain and other decentralized technologies to help remedy them. But never before have these issues risen to the fore as they are currently. Never before have so many people been so aware of the ethical and practical weaknesses at the heart of Big Tech’s systems for controlling our communications.      The American people’s collective jaws are still somewhat agape at the speed and oomph with which Apple, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others have recently acted to combat online discussion perceived as encouraging right-wing anti-government violence. High-profile actions like Twitter suspending U.S. President Trump’s account, and Apple and Google and Amazon concurrently deplatforming Parler got everyone’s attention. Just as disturbing was Google threatening to remove Facebook alternative minds.com from the Android Play Store if it didn’t remove content Google found offensive.    Ben Goertzel is founder and CEO of SingularityNET, a blockchain-based AI marketplace project.    Minds managed to stay on the Play Store by hastily gutting parts of its site like the commenting functionality. And it’s definitely not an alt-right, MAGA-oriented social network. Bill Ottman, who founded minds.com, is pretty clearly left-wing in orientation, though he keeps his personal politics out of his company’s operations. Along with a lot of fantastic content, Minds.com does have some nasty commentary on it, and more QAnon bulls**t than I would ever want to read. But, just as on Facebook, I don’t need to go to those pages except when struck by a particular bout of perverse curiosity.      And the internet, of course, also has a lot of nasty stuff and a lot of QAnon BS on it, which one can readily find using Google’s search engine. Why is it that Google considers it ethically okay to point searchers to QAnon pages, but also feels an “ethical” need to screw with minds.com because it has a minority population of QAnon members?    Who’s going to solve social?    One can sympathize to some degree with the folks who run these Big Tech companies. They’re in a classic “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” situation, which none of them foresaw before they got so huge.      If they allow offensive content or folks arguing for violence in a not-quite-illegal-but-pretty-nasty way, then they’ll get blowback when it turns out content they hosted played a role in some actual horrible acts.      If they start banning content, inevitably they’re going to ban stuff that isn’t actually extraordinarily dangerous, and suddenly they’re evil opponents of free speech.      And with the volume of situations and people they’re dealing with, how can these companies consistently figure out the right place to draw the line, especially when society as a whole doesn’t have a consistent or coherent idea of where to draw the line.      See also: Ben Goertzel - Lessons in Failing to Apply Blockchain and AI to Combat COVID      Twitter, generally the most forward-thinking of the Big Tech titans, has appointed a small team to develop a decentralized social media protocol. The idea, apparently, is to make Twitter one among multiple services using a common standard protocol, and to move controversial issues like content moderation and banning from the Twitter layer down to the decentralized protocol layer. The aspiration is admirable but at the present time it’s not at all clear how the fundamentally centralized logic of the Twitter business model is going to harmonize with the radical degree of decentralization that would be needed.      My own strong feeling is: Twitter is not going to solve this, as good as its intentions may be. The centralized Big Tech world is not going to solve this. Government is not going to solve this either. It’s far too slow-paced and obtuse to deal with fast-evolving issues that are highly complex in both human and technological dimensions, in a way that’s compatible with the subtleties of Western constitutional and business law.    China's way    The mainland Chinese government has “solved” the issue of Big Tech and social media in its own way: by exerting explicit and detailed government control. This works fine in the modern Chinese context, but only because this context doesn’t involve Western-style expectations of free speech or business autonomy. If you're a mainland Chinese tech CEO, you don’t need to do a lot of soul-searching about what’s ethical or not. You just have to accept government guidance. Elsewise, at best you’ll end up like Jack Ma, laying low for a while and then shifting your focus to philanthropy.      The good news is: The elements of a truly workable solution to Western society’s social media problem are reasonably well known and not incredibly mysterious.      The more complex news is this: The blockchain community knows how to fix these problems, but it is not remotely as well-resourced as Big Tech, is not exactly a darling of the government and has a better track record making cool tech for elite geeks than apps that give warm fuzzies to the average TikTok user.    Golden opportunity for blockchain    We have recently seen another example of an acute social problem where the blockchain community held many of the keys: the COVID-19 pandemic. Blockchain technology is tailor-made to provide secure, anonymized tracking and tracing of COVID-19 infection.      Technologically, there’s no good reason every Western citizen with a smartphone didn’t have a blockchain-based COVID-19 tracking and tracing app on their phone. These apps could have analyzed personal medical data using secure decentralized AI and fed everyone’s data into agent-based epidemiological simulation models running on decentralized platforms.      Had this happened, the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America would have likely squashed COVID-19 as rapidly as the Asian countries (where use of less privacy-preserving track-and-trace apps tended to be socially accepted). Had blockchain played a key role in helping the West dodge COVID-19 while preserving privacy, this would have been a pivotal moment for decentralized technology. It would have proved in a wonderful way that it’s good for something besides geeky financial gambling and money laundering.    We have the core tech to enable radically more ethical and beneficial social media networks.    The obstacles to using blockchain to help with COVID-19 weren’t mainly technical. In fact, during 2020, an interesting variety of software tools were created using secure decentralized technologies to do track-and-trace, personal health evaluation, epidemiological modeling and a lot more. But the adoption of such software has been minimal so far. This was a golden opportunity lost.      Decentralized social media is an even larger and more critical opportunity. As tragic as the COVID-19 pandemic has been, it’s soon going to be squelched by vaccines. There is no vaccine for badly designed social media networks on the horizon. The negative impact of Big Tech-controlled social media on humanity has far greater destructive potential than the coronavirus pandemic.      There’s a decent argument that Big Tech social media, by fanning flames of hate and tribalism, could significantly increase the odds of the annihilation of the human race.      Academic boffins like Nick Bostrom are worried about superhuman AGI repurposing human molecules to add extra memory capacity to their hard drives. But there is far more evident risk in Big Tech’s use of narrow-minded machine learning algorithms to maximize shareholder value at the expense of human well-being, intelligence and compassion.    Components to save social media    The basic principles needed to create better social networks are not too hard to see:    Open-source code: Code should be open source so that everyone has the ability to inspect and understand the algorithms that are putting images and videos in front of their eyes, people into their friendship circles, and texts and ideas into their minds.  Decentralized control: Ownership and control should be decentralized, so no company and no government is tasked and burdened with calling all the shots.  Democratic decision: Major decisions about social network structure and dynamics should be made democratically. And if democratic decision making doesn’t converge on a result, it’s ok if a social network splinters into multiple ones, just as Linux, Bitcoin and Ethereum have forked into multiple versions.  Explainable AI: Recommendations of connections and content should be made using open-source AI that is created via democratically governed projects, and that has the ability to explain the reasons behind its judgments. These explanations need to be shown routinely to users in a way they can understand.    The technologies to manifest these principles are here right now, albeit at varying levels of maturity.      In SingularityNET, we have been working on blockchain-based AI tools suitable for serving as the cognitive core of decentralized social media networks. Your social media and Internet usage data should be owned and controlled by you, and the AI algorithms used to model this data should be under your control. You should be able to inspect and interrogate these models and understand what they are thinking about you and why they are recommending certain things to you and not others.      Transparent, explainable AI applied to a person’s social media and Internet usage data has the potential to be a powerful tool for self-understanding and self-growth. An AI watching what I do will very likely understand some aspects of myself better than I do, and this is of interest to me because I would like to better understand myself.      It’s easy to imagine a smarter, more transparent version of Alexa or Google Assistant designed to serve as an “AI media navigator” finding me what I ask for in a savvy but unbiased way, and recommending me people and content that it genuinely thinks will be of interest to me. But this sort of vision is hilariously distant from the current reality in which the various Big Tech-controlled AIs are monitoring, modeling and guiding me with the objective of milking money and keeping me staring at certain particular apps or websites as long as possible.      See also: Ben Powers - The Web Wasn’t Built for Privacy, but It Could Be      One could argue that corporate control of our minds, hearts and bank accounts is the price we pay for all the valuable processing power Big Tech companies are utilizing to deliver us our daily diet of social media posts. But this is one more failure of moral and technological imagination. It is well within our current capability to deliver modern social media functions based on decentralized compute power as well as decentralized algorithms. This has been a theme in the blockchain world for years now, with projects like Golem, SONM and CPUCoin. SingularityNET has been incubating the NuNet.io project toward this end.      All of these decentralized-processing-power startups need some maturing to serve the needs of decentralized analogues of Facebook, Twitter and Tiktok. But the basic algorithms and architectures are there. What if decentralized, democratically controlled processing infrastructures had received even one-tenth of the financial and software-development firepower that centralized server farm infrastructure has?      With a decentralized infrastructure for social media, the whole issue of banning this or that person or topic from this or that social network would basically disappear.      Decentralized, transparently operated, secure, AI-driven reputation systems would rank and rate posts and posters, resulting in a system where nobody needs to happen upon posts they find offensive or disturbing.      On the other hand, if you don’t want to remain ensconced in your familiar community and idea-sphere and want to take the risk of contact with something new and potentially troublesome, you can tell this to your AI navigator as well.    The bad, the ugly and the glorious    Decentralization doesn’t cure all the perversities of human nature.      For sure, some people will use decentralized social media to plan crimes together. But people also gather in parks or bars for such purposes, and we don’t solve this by banning group face-to-face conversations out of earshot of government microphones. I have no doubt law enforcement will rise to the occasion of decentralized social networks as it’s done with prior tech innovations.      There is also no doubt that fraud attempts will be rampant on any decentralized social network and AI-driven navigators will need to rely on sophisticated “AI reputation system police” to militate against fraud and attempts to game the system. But the key point is this: The AI policing should be on the level of squashing reputation-system fraud, i.e., seeing through cases where people are pretending their content is something it’s not rather than squashing content itself.      Let us not forget that, alongside all the hate and stupidity, there is a massive influx of brilliant ideas and wonderful creations being put out there on the internet every minute of every day. Most of these have a hard time finding the audience they deserve because of today’s centralized online information architectures.      We have the core tech to enable radically more ethical and beneficial social media networks. All that remains is to get this tech out of the blockchain ghetto and into the internet mainstream. It’s not a small task but the potential benefit is huge. What we’re talking about here is not just a revolution in a certain sector of the software industry. It’s a massive upgrade in how the collective mind and heart of humanity guides its own growth.

42385726,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBKqpx,1611315616,"Bitcoin Faces Further Losses Before Rally Restarts, Say Analysts","Bitcoin's shorter-term price woes are likely not over yet, analysts say, with one predicting a further decline to $26,000.      The cryptocurrency fell by 13% on Thursday in a spot market sell-off, hitting a low of $28,845 earlier on Friday, the lowest level since Jan. 4. In the hours since, the cryptocurrency has regained some poise to trade back above $31,000.      ""I'm not sure the low of $28,000 seen early Friday is the bottom,"" Ki-Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. He highlighted a negative ""Coinbase premium"" as evidence of weak dip demand from large investors.      CryptoQuant's Coinbase premium indicator measures the spread between Coinbase's BTC/USD pair and Binance's BTC/USDT pair, which includes the stablecoin tether. A positive spread implies strong institutional inflows, as Coinbase is considered synonymous with high net-worth individuals and institutional investors.      While prices have recovered to $31,000, the spread remains flat to negative, implying a lack of dip demand from big investors.      The Coinbase premium fell as low as -$227 in the past 24 hours. According to Ju, bitcoin consistently traded at a premium of over $50 on Coinbase throughout the rally from $20,000 to $40,000, indicating major spot market inflows from large investors.      A drop in the GBTC premium, which measures the difference between the value of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's holdings and the market price of the holdings, is another bearish factor to consider.      The premium has all but evaporated in recent days, a sign of weakening of institutional demand. While retail investors directly buy bitcoin on the spot market, many institutional investors invest through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust for regulatory reasons. New York-based Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Singapore-based Stack Funds, also cited the negative Coinbase premium as a cause of concern for the bulls and took note of the bearish technical setup for bitcoin.      ""Bitcoin broke short-term support on Thursday, and while the market is trading positively now, we may see lows down to the $26,000 mark in the coming weeks,"" Matthew Dibb, Co-founder, and COO of Singapore-based Stack Funds, told CoinDesk over WhatsApp.      After failing multiple times to establish a foothold below $32,000 earlier this month, sellers finally secured a daily close (UTC time) below that level on Thursday. Coupled with a fall out of a contracting triangle, that indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside.      Bitcoin's recovery is already being capped by the former support-turned-resistance of $32,000. A move above $35,000 is needed to abort the bearish view, according to popular Twitter trader ""Cred.""      ""That level could be put to the test, as the derivative market is more relaxed now, and we have seen some good buying interest around $30,000,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Broker AG said. ""The perpetual funding rates and futures premium are reverting toward their mean from elevated levels observed earlier this month when bitcoin was trading near record highs.""      The perpetuals funding rate or the cost of holding long positions is currently seen at 0.008%, down significantly from the high of nearly 0.10% observed on Jan. 19, according to data provider Glassnode.    Down but not out    Despite the latest decline, bitcoin is still up 6% on a year-to-date basis and up over 35% from the price of $23,000 seen precisely a month ago. Analysts remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.

J Capital also alleged that the large number of mining machines reported by the company was ""simply not possible"" after reportedly checking with its government contacts in China.      ""Defendants' [Bit Digital] positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis,"" the court filing reads.      Bit Digital said Tuesday that its mainland China mining operations are managed by XMAX Hong Kong, and all “utility bills and other expenses” are paid to Hong Kong suppliers.

According to a reporthttps://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210122/p2g/00m/0na/034000c by Japan's Mainichi on Friday, authorities in Japan allege the people were found to have been exchanging NEM's XEM cryptocurrency for other cryptocurrencies via an illicit exchange on a darknet marketplace.  The stolen cryptocurrency is a portion of the $560 million worth of XEM and other cryptocurrencies siphoned off the Tokyo-based Coincheck exchange in a massive January 2018 hack.  The 30 individuals are alleged to have traded more than 10 billion yen (US$96 million) based on the exchange rate at the time of the theft when XEM was around its all-time high of $1.6. Prices today are well below that at around $0.21, according to CoinMarketCap.  Some of the suspects involved in the arrest allegedly exchanged their illicitly traded digital currencies for fiat currency at various legal exchanges in Japan and overseas, netting large profits.  The identities of those who hacked Coincheck still remain unknown.  See also: Japan Rallies Behind XRP as Ripple Faces US Litigation  The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department will soon finalize its probe into those that exchanged the stolen tokens as the statute of limitations is approaching, according to Mainichi's report.

Of the 28 suspect investment firms the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called out Thursday, CoinDesk found eight that appear to target would-be cryptocurrency investors. Some purport to be trusted newcomer trading hubs; others peddle their services to retirees. One even fashions itself as a law firm that can help against crypto fraud.      Flagged companies AxTrading-Investment, Passive Trade Plan, RetireWell Investors, Reclaws International Inc. and SmartCoins24 all offered cryptocurrency and blockchain services on their websites Thursday, CoinDesk found. Three other entities whose websites were down, BitminingFX, Cryptobravos and FXBitcash, also made the SEC's blacklist.      The entities' websites appear to mix welcoming rhetoric and sweeping claims in their efforts to woo investors. Passive Trade Plan's described itself as ""a trusted authority on digital currency investing"" while Smartcoins 24 promised to ""trade the hottest coins of 2018.""      ""Our bitcoin trading services is suitable for those who are new to the world of cryptocurrencies, as well as for bitcoin experts and large-scale bitcoin investors,"" read the website for AxTrading-International.      The SEC said Thursday that investors have filed complaints against all 28 flagged entities. These firms ""use misleading information to solicit primarily non-U.S. investors,"" SEC said. It said it added the firms to its warning list, called PAUSE, to help investors ""avoid being a victim of fraud.""      The SEC periodically warns the investing public against too-good-to-be-true opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. Previous notices have detailed fraud in Initial Exchange Offerings and cases of public companies pumping their value with initial coin offerings. Back in 2014, the agency warned that investors should avoid getting swept up in the bitcoin hype machine.

Per CoinDesk's prior reporting, the recent drop in bitcoin's price is likely due to widespread profit-taking by U.S. and European investors, according to trading activity on leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.  Bitcoin dropped to $29,112 on Coinbase at 0:30 UTC on Thursday, a level reached on Jan. 4 when the leading cryptocurrency started rallying hard to an all-time high of just below $42,000 on Jan. 8.  At press time, the price of bitcoin was $30,025, down about 15% over the last 24 hours.  Guggenheim's CIO Scott Minerd, who has said bitcoin should be worth $400,000, said yesterday he thinks bitcoin maybe have topped temporarily, saying that a retrace to $20,000 is possible.  The continued selling has pushed bitcoin's year-to-date gains below 1%.  Bulls may be able to pare losses though, according to Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone who told CoinDesk, ""Bitcoin appears similar to May-June 2017 price range of $3,000-$2,000 before breaking out higher.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/22/bitcoin-breaks-below-30k-erasing-almost-all-of-2021s-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c49fc2abb613aaba752ac94303a7c4856795625-1995x1502.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The leading cryptocurrency's drop is ""probably just a dip,"" according to Techemy Capital trader Josh Olszewicz, who is not expecting a prolonged correction.  Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone agreed, telling CoinDesk he could see bitcoin ""probing for support and resistance within a mostly $30,000 to $40,000 range for awhile until embarking on the next leg of the stair-step rally.""  But Guggenheim's CIO Scott Minerd thinks bitcoin maybe have topped temporarily, saying that a retrace to $20,000 is possible.
