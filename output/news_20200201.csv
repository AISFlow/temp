42383247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uqJ5,1580572800,Hyperledger's Brian Behlendorf Says Blockchain's Potential Is 'Hitting a Tipping Point',"Last December, Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf said 2019 was a year of “careful, prosaic BUIDLING.” Now, in an interview with CoinDesk’s Michael Casey in Davos, Switzerland, Behlendorf says a lot of what the blockchain ecosystem was building is getting closer to becoming a net positive for the world.      Citing “double-digit” blockchain usage in the diamond trade for tracing provenance, a variety of blockchain-based digital identity projects and the rise of the central bank digital currency (CBDC), Behlendorf painted an upbeat picture of a technology moving quietly from concept phase to “in-production” deployment.      “At this point, there have been enough pilots. There's a path here through this technology to production employment,” he said.      By using tools like digital identity and secure transactions, Behlendorf believes many of the biggest problems of the day can, in some ways, be improved.      “We’re moving towards much more self-managed, self-sovereign distributed digital identity, which would not have been possible without distributed ledger technology. I know that's a big recurring theme here that we're hearing, and now you're seeing legitimization in the form of the central bank's recognizing the technology inside. So I'm feeling a tipping point,” he said.      The annual event in Davos, he said, is the right place to get government and business leaders to engage on such projects.      “I worked for the World Economic Forum for two years as chief technology officer so I've been coming here for quite a while,” he said. “The forum itself was founded on these idealistic notions of making the world better.”      The goal, said Behlendorf, was to build consensus around pressing issues.

42383249,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uqLb,1580558428,Zcash's Funding Vote and the Woes of Decentralized Governance,"The zcash community has agreed to continue funding the development of its privacy coin, ZEC, as spearheaded by the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and the Zcash Foundation, according to voting results published by the foundation Thursday.      The decision marks the end of a months-long – and often contentious – campaign to address imminent funding losses for both organizations.      For the ECC and Zcash Foundation to continue developing zcash, particularly as its use case faces increased scrutiny from international regulators grappling with the implications of privacy coins, the funding is a lifeline for hiring top talent.      For others, however, the vote signals a broken promise from the coin’s inception, namely one to limit the original Founder’s Reward to only 2.1 million ZEC (10 percent of the total ZEC supply). Expectations of this promise being broken resulted in a “friendly fork” in July 2019 with the creation of Ycash.      Significantly, the vote also signals the funding of a public blockchain through a de facto miner tax. Compared to other funding mechanisms, such as initial coin offerings, treasuries or outside grants from third parties, innovations in zcash are dependent on the coin’s performance.      “I opted for the initial Dev Fund to sunset itself, so that in the future, if Zcash were a success and a community were to grow up to support it, that community would have to collectively decide what to do next,” zcash co-founder and ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox wrote in an August Medium article, asking for a new general development fund.      Regardless of disputes, the past year was notable for the ECC and zcash in general due to cryptographic advances such as its Halo discovery and an initiative to bridge with ethereum, all while running in the red during a bear market.      Without further monetary subsidies, it's unclear how the coin would fare going forward.      Community transparency reports showed the ECC spending more than it took in, as well as adjustments to the previous Founder’s Reward meant to increase revenue. A poor fiscal track record isn’t the best look for a firm looking to raise community-derived funds, one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity told CoinDesk.      “Going in with good intentions doesn't always create good processes,” they said of the voting process.      If current prices hold at around $65 per coin, the ECC can expect around $480,000 per month in funding after November 2020’s zcash halving, the privacy network’s first. (Zcash’s recent price history has been rocky, however: 2020 began with the coin down nearly 45 percent from its 2019 start, though it has since doubled in price since Jan. 1.)    Milestone year    Launched in 2016, zcash’s developer fund was on a four-year leash set to expire in November 2020. Known as the Founder’s Reward, 20 percent of block rewards were taken from miners and diverted towards zcash’s founders and investors along with some assistance for continued development.      The newly approved Zcash Improvement Proposal (ZIP) 1014 will now split block mining rewards 80/20 between miners and a general community fund for coin development in a similar manner to the initial Founder’s Reward. The 20 percent pool will be further split into three groups: 35 percent for the ECC, 25 percent for the Zcash Foundation and 40 percent for third-party developers.      The third group was included to boost product decentralization, said Amentum Investment Management CEO and zcash community member Steven McKie.      Votes were cast by members of the Zcash Community Forum along with a 72-person community advisory panel. Of the 112 eligible voters, 88 members cast ballots with the overwhelming majority calling for continued funding.      “I am thrilled to see the convergence from the Zcash community after a long and fruitful debate,” Zcash Foundation Executive Director Josh Cincinnati told CoinDesk.      Both the Zcash Foundation and ECC have accepted the community proposal, which is expected to be ratified in November under zcash’s Network Update 4 (NU4).    Why a block subsidy?    For a research-heavy project like zcash, securing funding was a must for the Zcash Foundation and ECC. And, since the product is the coin itself, taking funding from the coin’s future success was a no brainer, said McKie.      Compared to alternatives, McKie said a developer fund was a more mature approach for the continued funding of zcash.      “Zcash is one of the most technical public chain assets out there. Zero-knowledge proofs [require] an incredible level of math on top of low-level programming,” McKie said in a phone interview.      “If you’re making a product, might as well just go straight for it,” McKie added.      Ian Miers, a zcash co-founder and academic cryptographer, agreed, noting the difficulty of decentralizing votes for the allocation of public goods.      “The cryptocurrency community has learned a lot over those four years, and one of the clear things is you need some way to fund ongoing development,” he said.      ECC’s head of growth, Josh Swihart, said the community’s efforts stand as a future example of democratized governance done right. “[It’s] incredibly difficult to transition power, to decentralize power,” Swihart said.    Coin politique    Apart from the Ycash fork, the foundation and ECC had their own bumps in the road, too.      The final vote went without miner input – since no miners participated in the first round. The foundation opted not to count miners in the second round, according to an email from Cincinnati, because of the lack of participation.      Negotiations around the zcash trademark also took months longer than expected, in what Wilcox described as an “emotionally painful” process.      Defining the electorate itself was even difficult, as some thought ZEC bag holders deserved representation.      A vote by ZEC bag holders was held, although it amounted to more of a straw poll than political bloc, said McKie. While the ECC took the outcome under consideration, the Zcash Foundation did not. As ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Miers noted on the Zcash community's main chat forum, blockchain voting has yet to solve the challenges associated with manipulation or sybil attacks.      Finally, the initial ZIP passed in the first voting round was effectively vetoed by the ECC. The ZIP placed an upper-bound dollar limit on funding the ECC through the new block reward distribution. For a firm on the bleeding edge of privacy advancements, the company said any cap would hamstring the organization’s ability to attract talent. As such, the ECC said it would not accept any proposal with similar constraints.      Calling the ECC a “principled” organization, the source who spoke with CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity said the ECC unintentionally kept investors hostage.      The source went on to say that speaking out against the ECC’s actions only led to “strained relationships” and wasn’t worth the cost. Still, the vote is over and the community can move on, they said.      “The outcome here is that the ECC is giving up a chunk of control over zcash,” the source said. “That's a decent outcome, and I wish it had happened six months ago.”",NEUTRAL,ZEC,BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING | ZEC | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/01/zcashs-funding-vote-and-the-woes-of-decentralized-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91bb15a340528d123c8a0af59e0997a63e9a6189-1200x936.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403929,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1qG,1580547600,Stacking Fasts: Inside the Crypto Community's New Diet Craze,"It’s been 27 hours since my last meal and my body is starting to eat itself.      Autophagy, literally self-eating, is the latest dietary trend in the crypto community. More commonly known as fasting, the idea is to abstain from ingesting food for a set amount of time, ranging anywhere from 24 hours to an entire month or beyond. In doing so, proponents hope to improve their bodily health and mental acuity.      With nine hours left to my own exercise in self-starvation, I feel neither healthy nor sharp. In fact, I’m pretty sure I’m hallucinating. I’m imagining the taste of last night’s dinner. Fatty salmon. The salt on my tongue. A bed made of arugula. Alas, just cotton sheets and pillow to chew on. My only consolation? I’m not alone.      I’m skipping meals alongside the Bitcoin Fasting Group, a Telegram channel for crypto-minded people to discuss nutrition, organize fasts and encourage one another through their hunger. Using the predictable pattern of the bitcoin blockchain, which hashes a new set of transactions every 10 minutes, the group schedules 36- to 72-hour communal fasts once in a 2,000-block cycle, or about every two weeks if using a calendar.      I joined the channel in the middle of January after seeing a tweet promoting a fast. Beginning at block-height 614,000, a bunch of us (it’s impossible to say how many of the 242 members voluntarily participated) planned to forgo breakfast, lunch and dinner for the sport of it. The fast would start in the middle of the week, and I wanted to test the claims it would improve my productivity.      Katie Ananina, the channel’s founder, citizen journalist, and crypto bohemian from Siberia, gave me some pointers before embarking on this extreme – though relatively short – diet. First, don’t expect much; second, like a good Austrian economist, “try to keep a low time preference” (meaning I should value long term gain over short term discomfort).    She now sees the fasting group as a parallel conduit to 'hyperbitcoinization'    Ananina started fasting after going down the bitcoin rabbit hole in 2017. Once she began questioning the basic tenets of economics (which she studied at St. Petersburg University, before dropping out) her skepticism spread to other areas of her life. She now sees the fasting group as a parallel conduit to “hyperbitcoinization,” as both bitcoin and fasting encourage people to “exercise free will and self-discovery.”      “For a subset of the cryptocurrency community, getting interested and invested in this technology meant throwing out orthodoxy about the nature of money and other parts of society,” Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s director of communications, said over email. “Including nutrition.”    Building blocks    Though the process isn’t fully understood, fasting kick-starts a metabolic state called ketosis, where the body burns fat instead of carbohydrates, which has been linked to improved feelings of well-being, increased longevity and something called the best-known nerve growth factor.      “There’s a mountain of evidence that has caught on with the trend,” said Dr. Monique Tello, an internist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Tello has become a fasting evangelist after picking up the habit in medical school. She added that the best example may be how the practice has spread organically by word of mouth and on social media. (It’s how I heard of it!)      “The internet has allowed alternative theories of nutrition to circulate, with communities forming around them,” Agrawal said. “The more people try it, the more data there will be. If that data looks promising to someone they may try it, too.”      Successful accounts of fasts in the crypto community aren’t hard for Tello to imagine. “Our bodies are very well adapted to deal with long periods of less food or no food,” she said. The story goes something like this:      Imagine our cave-dwelling ancestors, who hunted and gathered every meal: Their very existence was tied to the precarities of nature. Millennia of living through cycles of bounty and dearth are proof, for some, why human beings are not meant to be in a constant state of digestion.    Cave coiners    It’s this evolutionary perspective that may explain coiners’ experiments with heterodox diets. “The diet our culture has slipped into, high in added sugars and refined grains, is not good for clear thinking at all,” Tello said.      Just as bitcoin seeks a return to a sustainable economic system that challenges modern monetary policy, fasting subverts the received wisdom around “healthy diets” and modern supply chains, which produce foodstuff in total excess. “Beef is to food as bitcoin is to money,” said a member of the bitcoin fasting group, arguing for a ketogenic lifestyle.    Ananina encourages members to be self-sovereign and do their own research.    The essential nature of a bitcoiner is “someone who can search out valuable information, think critically, and is capable of taking responsibility for their own life, health, and finances,” said Hodlonaut, the astronautical feline Twitter personality and early member of the Bitcoin Fasting Group, in a private message.      Hodlonaut was an early member of the channel, and has been experimenting with fasting since 2017, about two years after he discovered bitcoin.      The ever-quotable Nic Carter, venture capitalist with Castle Island Ventures, called this phenomenon “epiphany-induced general skepticism.”    Stacking fasts    That this enlightenment to modernity’s shortcomings has resulted in as deep a skepticism of carbohydrates as central banking has taken the coin community pretty far out.      In 2017, it was reported bitcoiners were switching to all-meat diets. The trend led at least one person to eat nothing but meat for two weeks. (For what it’s worth, Teller said carnivorous diets are “hardly sustainable” and “have been associated with high levels of bad cholesterol in the bloodstream,” though could lead to “short-term weight loss.”)      A similar spurt of interest has been directed towards fasting. Since October, the Bitcoin Fasting Group has ballooned to more than 250 members, with more joining every day.      No matter how someone comes to bitcoin or heterodox diets, proponents of both will likely offer their support. However, this assistance is conditioned on whether the person is able to make their own informed decisions.      ""Eating a low carbohydrate diet is a good way to prepare for fasting,” said Dr. Jason Fung, author of “The Complete Guide to Fasting,” and frequently cited source in the Telegram channel. “The average weight loss during fasting is 1/2 pound of body fat per day. Total weight loss is often more than this because of water loss.""      Ananina encourages members to be self-sovereign and do their own research. “Obviously, feel free to share your experience and ask questions, but the decision is always on you,” she said. Her philosophy is interwoven with the culture of the chat. With every documentary that’s recommended or research report posted, is a comment reminding others to draw their conclusions.      Kiernan Wright, former CEO of the Canadian mining company Honey Badger, is also new to the fasting group. I asked him if it seemed cultish to schedule fasts around the bitcoin block schedule. “This is more like a club than a religion, anyone can leave or join at will,” he said. “Bitcoin is a wonderful tool for organizing things, to push the boundaries of what is possible and to do it in a non-violent, non-coercive way, which is crucial to our survival.”      At the end of my 36-hour fast, I found myself neither hungry nor tired. After a period of ravenousness, the pangs settled and I was able to comfortably fall asleep.
