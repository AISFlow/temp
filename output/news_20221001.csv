42420934,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvtV,1664633367,Liberal Arts Colleges Show the 'Inherent Interdisciplinary' Nature of Web3,"Professor Ricky Crano, formerly of Tufts University, is always amazed at how students' attention picks up when he brings up crypto.  “Everyone was coming at it pretty fresh and curious, uncertain what to make of it at the end of the day,” he said. They were reading primers on everything from Bitcoin to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), in the last week of his ""Science, Technology and Society"" seminar.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Education Week.""  “Tufts was a special place for exploring [crypto] in the classroom, thanks to the hybrid liberal arts and strong computer science and engineering environment,” Crano said.  Studying blockchain and cryptocurrency goes hand-in-hand with a liberal arts education. Whether you’re an aspiring decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol developer, an artist minting paintings as non-fungible tokens (NFT) or a humanitarian curious about the promise of a disruptive monetary system to help the unbanked and underserved, the entry points for the crypto space span multiple disciplines.  Several liberal arts college professors are introducing these topics within their coursework across a variety of subjects.  Crypto and economics  At Amherst College, economics professor Neil White teaches a course called “Money and Banking” focused on how modern finance operates. From banks to regulators to inflation, White covers a broad range of topics surrounding economics. In the past year he has taught the course, he’s added crypto to the syllabus.  White includes a one-week crash course that covers the basics of bitcoin; he thinks it’s a solid place for a student to begin their journey into crypto, from the technology behind the blockchain to its use case as a method of payment.  “You have this electronic thing that can be traded and essentially traced through a public ledger. And we [study] that to compare and contrast it with the traditional monetary system for payment,” he said.  See also: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  But it isn’t merely theoretical. While many of his students may end up with careers at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs after graduation, a familiarity with crypto could help them distinguish themselves.  “The point is to not go into all the details about crypto, but more to give them a basic level of knowledge so that [students] can go out and learn about that stuff themselves, ” White said. In fact, he suspects a number of non-economic majors likely enroll in the course because of its crypto module.  Crypto and anthropology  Farah Qureshi, an anthropology professor at Colby College, teaches a course called “The Anthropology of Money” that spends time understanding the cultural aspects of crypto and other currencies. She takes an interdisciplinary approach to teaching, and the course attracts students interested in a number of subjects.  “The fact that I've even gotten that many people who are even signing up for the class, just literally only seeing surface level descriptions. It says a lot about how that education kind of needs to be out there, ” Qureshi said.  As a graduate student, Qureshi studied how crypto and mobile money systems could increase financial inclusion. She was particularly interested in bitcoin’s origins during the 2008 financial crisis. Money is often overlooked when studying anthropology, she said, but it impacts nearly every human institution.  As a part of the curriculum, students in Qureshi's course investigate a particular currency over the semester. One recent student who studies art history chose NFTs as her “currency” to research in the course.  “We have cultures looking at the history of repeating savings and credit associations … we also look into cultures of mobile money, as well as just the way that technological appropriations have been pushed through,” Qureshi said.  Science, technology and society  Crano said Science, Technology and Society (STS) focuses on how technological advancements have reshaped human society.  He noted that while crypto is still nascent, it could also have its effects though what that will be is less understood. But there’s an appetite and an interest among his students, he said.  When Crano taught his course “Reading Lab: Automation” online in the fall of 2020, he left the last two weeks of the course open-ended, allowing students to elect from a batch of readings what they would most like to talk about.  In his course, Crano’s students read Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper introducing the Bitcoin system and a chapter of “Blockchain and the Law: The Rule of Code” by Aaron Wright and Primavera De Filippi that covered DAOs.  Crano chose these readings because of the blockchain’s ability to automate accounting and community governance, as well as having a personal interest in cryptocurrency as a whole in the broader world of technological developments.  “As a media technology and digital culture researcher, scholar and educator, I always try to keep an ear to the ground,” he said. “Also as a perennial kind of Marxist skeptic, I would say in a very loose sense I’m always trying to find things to demythologize.”  He said that STS allowed crypto to be demythologized; rather than studying the advanced technology that comprises the blockchain, look at its societal implications.

Fifty to 70 employees – or roughly 40% of the exchange's workforce of 150 – are being pushed out of the company, three sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. The eliminated workers were told on Friday they would be paid for 45 days, they would not be required to report for work henceforth and their accesses were withdrawn simultaneously.  ""The crypto market has been in the grip of a bear market because of the current global economic slowdown,"" WazirX said in a statement on Saturday. ""The Indian crypto industry has had its unique problems with respect to taxes, regulations and banking access. This has lead to a dramatic fall in volumes in all Indian crypto exchanges.""  ""As India's No 1. exchange, our priority is to be financially stable and to continue serving our customers,"" the company said. ""To achieve this, we've had to reduce our staff to weather the crypto winter. This situation is similar to the trying times the industry faced in 2018; at that time, we doubled down and built our innovative P2P engine. The crypto industry operates in cycles and the bear market is inevitably followed by a spectacular bull market. We will continue to focus on our customer needs and continue to build. We are confident that we will come out stronger when the bull market arrives.""  One of the sources said ""the workforce has been cut from several departments including customer support, HR and other departments. Managers, analysts, associate managers/team leaders were among those laid off."" The entire public policy and communication team was fired, according to another employee who lost his job.  ""The company was never really forthcoming or transparent with its financial position, either when it was doing well or now,"" said one of the WazirX employees who lost his job ""abruptly"" on Friday.  WazirX daily trading volumes have been steadily declining from a one-year high of 478 million on Oct. 28, 2021, to 1.5 million on Oct. 1, 2022, according to CoinGecko data. Trading volumes on some days have been lower than a million and ""this is not enough to support operations,"" the sources said.  The decline in trading volume began shortly after India's implementation of harsh crypto tax laws in March, when WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty told CoinDesk ""we have entered a period of pain.""  In recent days, the Indian exchange has been faced with a slew of problems including an online spat between Shetty and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao about whether or not Binance is the parent company of the Indian exchange. Daily trading volumes were around 5 million around the time of the spat but after, its volumes dropped to less than 2 million, according to CoinGecko data.  ""During one all-hands meeting after the online spat, we were told we have decent reserves so we are financially safe,"" two employees who were laid off said.  WazirX has also been a target of a money laundering investigation launched by India's Directorate of Enforcement, which included a raid against one of WazirX’s directors.

42420931,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvsT,1664600601,Student Organizations Pull Their Weight in DeFi Protocol Governance,"The crypto space changed dramatically during the second quarter of 2020 – often referred to as DeFi Summer – when governance tokens were created that allowed token holders to vote on-chain on policies to lead a particular protocol.  Decentralized finance, known as DeFi, is a growing subsector with $54.91 billion in total locked value across several blockchains. DeFi enables people to have access to financial services and yield generation without the need of a traditional middleman like a bank.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Education Week.""  More and more, student blockchain clubs are participating in on-chain governance as a vehicle to be heard and to learn about decentralized governance within the Web3 ecosystem.  Student blockchain organizations, including those at University of California-Berkeley, London Business School, University of California-Los Angeles and Columbia University, already vote on-chain for protocols such as Uniswap, Compound, Aave and dYdX.  And several student organizations, such as Georgia Tech and Cornell, are gearing up to launch governance programs in the near future.  Learning curve  Students voting on-chain learn by getting “first hand experience on how the space works,” said Jamin Feng, head of the governance department for Lions DAO, Columbia’s student blockchain organization. By voting and being informed about voting, students get to learn how these protocols work.  See also: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  They can also gain developer experience since creating governance proposals requires writing code.  “You get to see the developments on the ground level” and “basically be part of the conversation for the major catalysts for DeFi,” said Feng.  Colleges enter the community  Just as students who take part in DeFi governance benefit by first-hand experience in voting and writing proposal code, the crypto space also gains.  Many protocols consider themselves to be public-good infrastructure, and as such, they seek to be publicly owned in a decentralized manner. Giving voting rights to community stakeholders through governance tokens is how these protocols promote decentralization.  For example, Safe, a popular digital asset management platform that currently secures around $40 billion in its Ethereum contracts, said it launched its own governance token “in order to decentralize the governance of [Safe’s] critical infrastructure.” So by including student groups in on-chain governance decisions, protocols are sharing the responsibility with a wider group of people, thus achieving greater decentralization.  Just as in American politics, on-chain governance of DeFi protocols suffers from low voter participation. And yet – just as with the U.S. government – there is a lot of money at stake.  There are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) with “thousands of people with billions of dollars locked into a treasury, and the conversation that’s going on [about governance] is between, like, six people,” said Deven Matthews, who leads the Blockchain at Berkeley governance department.  Enter student blockchain clubs, whose members are both motivated to understand the ins and outs of a DeFi protocol and have time to do the work required. “We actually have the capacity to do a lot of research into what these proposal changes are doing, and we want to understand how everything works before we vote, because we’re learning along the way,” said Matthews.  Earlier in the year, Blockchain at Berkeley submitted a proposal to reduce the proposal threshold for voting on governance of the Compound protocol.  The governance process started with Blockchain@Berkeley creating a poll on Jan. 6 to gauge the Compound community’s sentiment regarding different potential proposal thresholds.  Students at Berkeley, Columbia, UCLA, University of Michigan and University of Pennsylvania all voted to lower the proposal threshold to 25,000 COMP – or roughly $610,000 – from 65,000 COMP. Lions DAO even posted a Twitter thread that announced how they were voting for the proposal.  See also: Web3 Education Can Help Creators 'Own a Piece of the Internet'  Berkeley’s proposal passed in March, and the impact was significant. At the previous proposal threshold of 65,000 COMP, only 11 to 12 addresses could propose governance changes, but after passage the number of addresses that had the power to propose more than doubled.  This proposal was “an important step in not only making Compound more decentralized, but also more autonomous,” tweeted blockchaincolumbia.eth, highlighting how student organizations are using their governance powers to protect and affirm the value of decentralization and autonomy in the Web3 ecosystem.  Rich corporate aunts and uncles  While student clubs can meet the challenge of becoming knowledgeable about DeFi protocols, many do not have substantial financial resources. Engaging in governance can be quite expensive, however, even prohibitively expensive.  To submit a governance proposal on Uniswap, for example, 2.5 million UNI needs to be delegated to an address. That is $15.7 million with UNI at $6.29, according to CoinDesk data.  Student organizations get involved with on-chain governance not by purchasing a large number of governance tokens themselves, but through token delegation, “the process where a token holder transfers their on-chain governance rights to others,” according to a blog post by the head of network operations at venture fund Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which explained why and how it delegates its tokens to many student organizations.  “Student club governance only exists because a16z exists,” said Kydo, a graduate student at Stanford. A16z has delegated tokens to the Stanford Blockchain Club.  See also: Autodidacts Welcome!  Despite the lucrative delegation power a16z has given to student organizations, students and a16z say the students are free to vote as they wish. “There aren’t any requirements for how much we need to vote and what we need to vote on, or really anything,” said Matthews.  To have there be strings attached contradicts the intention of delegation in the first place, said Park Hay Yeung, a graduate student from London Business School. The token delegate program, he said, is “meant to add more diversity and voices to the committee and not to have a single voice dictating the trajectory of a protocol.”",POSITIVE,COMP | UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMP | UNI | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,Sage D.

Four primary categories were investigated to determine the best universities for blockchain across the globe: (1) an institution’s strength in research and academic contributions to advancing the field; (2) the existing blockchain offerings on campus, whether in the form of classes, educational centers, clubs, etc.; (3) employment and industry outcomes; and (4) overall academic reputation. Every university received an individual score in each category. These scores were then normalized and added together to determine the overall score for the university and its rank.  The 50 schools we ranked came from just four regions: Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Asia and the Pacific Islands. Asia and the Pacific Islands dominated the list with 20 schools. A closer examination of the schools by region showed clear strengths among each of the four metrics.  The best universities for blockchain in Asia and the Pacific Islands  Universities in Asia and the Pacific Islands had the highest average overall score of 63.7, as well as the highest average research output score for regions with more than one school on the list. Asia and the Pacific Islands cemented its place as the top region for blockchain education with the sheer volume of research it is producing in the blockchain space. Sixty percent of the top 10 research producers are located in Asia and the Pacific Islands.  The best universities for blockchain in North America  North America has 16 universities in our final 50 and they also achieved the second-highest average overall score of 57. North American schools scored the highest in campus blockchain offerings. While North American schools may be lagging behind their Asian and Pacific Island counterparts in blockchain research production, they tended to offer a greater variety of blockchain classes, have more research centers on campus and more student clubs dedicated to blockchain technology – all of which are counted in the campus blockchain offerings score. Graduates from North American universities also tended to have improved employment outcomes, yet another metric we measured, compared to other regions.  The best universities for Blockchain in Europe  Although Europe did not come out on top in any category by region that was investigated, the 13 European schools that made our final ranking scored second-highest in reputation and employment outcomes. Survey respondents viewed European universities as more prestigious than their Asian, Pacific Island or Middle Eastern counterparts.  The best universities for blockchain in the Middle East  This year only one university in the Middle East made the Top Universities for Blockchain in 2022. King Saud University stood out from all but one U.S. school – Cornell University – for its number of blockchain research published papers and citations.
