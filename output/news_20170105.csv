42379154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n9GV,1483643753,Bitcoin's Rollercoaster 2017: What's Happened So Far,"2016 may have been a dynamic year for the price of bitcoin, but 2017 is shaping up to be a dramatic one already.  Bitcoin's race past $1,000 (and subsequent gyrations above and below that line) have already sparked headlines (both good and bad) worldwide, as today's dramatic fall from above $1,100 drove a massive influx of interest in the the digital currency.  If you’re just tuning in to the action, you may be wondering how things got to this point in the first place.  To get you up to speed, it may be helpful to look back at the past week's major price developments that took exchange markets near new all-time highs – and, as today showed, dramatic lows.  Here's the blow-by-blow for 2017 thus far:  Bitcoin tops $1,000  The year got started with a bang on 1st January, when the price of bitcoin crossed the $1,000 mark.  After spending the day approaching that level – climbing as high as $999 before settling back down – the price climbed to its then-highest point since January 2014.  The movement was notable given less-than-average trade volume figures at the time. Conversely, in the days before, bitcoin prices had approached (but not quite exceeded) $1,000.  Read more here.  Bitcoin eyes all-time highs  Things began heating up within a few short days.  As reported by CoinDesk on 4th January, early trading this week saw the digital currency’s price drift ever higher after crossing the $1,000 line.  A high of $1,060 meant that the price was inching closer to its all-time high of $1,165.89, reached on 30th November, 2013, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  It was during this time as well that mainstream media sources, including The New York Times and The Washington Post began taking note, which continues to today  Read more here.  Bitcoin closes in  The price, as may be expected, continued to climb that day.  Bitcoin shot above the $1,100 line in late-day trading on 4th January, quickly spiking to as much as $1,129.28 before settling back. CNY-denominated markets saw sharp gains that day as well, surging more than 23%.  A notable development at that point was the emergence of sell-side pressure in markets like Bitfinex.  As reported at the time, there were more sell orders than buy orders between the $1,137 and $1,140 – potentially foreshadowing the developments to come.  Read more here.  Sell orders slow rally  4th January continued to surprise with heightened volatility, with markets seeing some of the day’s gains lost before re-reaching them once more as trading continued.  The day saw prices climb as high as $1,141.05 during the session, the highest total since 5th December, 2013, according to BPI data. Yet prices fell as low as $1,087.53 before climbing once more, signaling that there could be more volatility to come.  It was here that at least some observers – who previously had indicated broadly bullish sentiment – began to suspect that a market pullback was on the horizon.  Read more here.  Bitcoin bounces back  Today, opened with significant gains, as the price climbed as high as $1,153.02 – well within striking distance of the all-time BPI high.  As reported this morning, the market behavior seen seemed to follow a pattern previously exhibited the day prior. That is to say, sharp movements upward before consolidation.  One noticeable change was a shift to more buy orders on exchanges like Bitfinex, potentially signaling that the price of bitcoin would climb even further.  Read more here.  Bitcoin pulls back  This morning’s dramatic price plunge, however, would cast a shadow on those bullish sentiments.  Just hours after climbing closer to the all-time high set in 2013, market averages suddenly tumbled. Markets had been fluctuating between the $1,080 and $1,070 lines, according to BPI data, before falling to as low as $887.47.  Overall, USD-denominated markets fell as much 23%, with CNY-denominated markets tumbling more than 15% as well.  However, in the hours since, the price of bitcoin has recovered. At press time, the average market price is $978.25.  Developers keep on working  Of course, we'd be remiss to note that bitcoin is an open-source technology – meaning, tweaks to its core protocol are ongoing.  Amidst all the ups and downs, a number of bug fixes were released that showcase how bitcoin could continue to evolve and become more useful, even in the face of challenges.  Read more here.

42379150,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n9FF,1483635646,Volatility and Liquidity: How Bitcoin Compares to its Crypto Competitors,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, angel investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast.  In this opinion piece, Woo takes readers on a deep dive into the historical performance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that he believes already compete against it as general purpose consumer ""payment coins"".  2016 has been a bull year for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.  Just as an example, last year we saw the rapid appreciation of monero, the mega-hyped launch of zcash (which peaked at an astounding $5,300 per coin) and subsequent pumps in other similar offerings including shadowcash and navcoin.  But, while it may seem like these crypotcurrencies are something new or novel, I would argue that all of these are ""payment coins"" competing in the battle to win the war to be general money.  Let me explain.  While most altcoins tend to be forging into market specific ""appcoin"" territory, what makes payment coins unique is the sheer size of the potential win. While appcoins can only capture a market segment that effectively puts a cap on their valuation, payment coins being a kind of generalized money can capture ""M2 money supply"" as a ceiling – ie trillions.  When I look at payment coins, I see that very strong economic network effects are in play.  As I covered earlier with my Commerce Index, liquidity and low volatility are very important for a coin to be useful for general trade as both of these qualities are crucial to make it compelling for end consumers to charge their wallet with a payment token for spending. With high volatility, there’s too much risk holding funds, and with insufficient liquidity, wallet recharge and merchant fees will be high.  When looking at the combined qualities of liquidity and price stability together as a Commerce Index, we could see other coins catching up with Bitcoin. In this study I will be doing a deeper dive into these two qualities individually.  For the sake of this study, I will be looking at the leading coins by market cap, namely bitcoin, monero, dash, Zcash and ShadowCash. All of these coins are well above $5m market cap, navCoin and others at less than $3m have been excluded.  Liquidity of payment coins  The plot above shows the liquidity (weekly traded volume) of each payment coin.  For the sake of comparing apples with apples, the Chinese zero-fee markets for bitcoin have been ignored as volumes can be faked easily. If we had included them, you can multiply bitcoin's volumes by 10x to 100x.  The liquidity of alternative payment coins has been on a rapid rise in 2016, particularly in the case of monero (which if this year’s trend continues could match bitcoin in just one year). But, there’s an argument here that liquidity can climb quickly upon the introduction of a new currency as can be seen by the steep liquidity growth of bitcoin in its first two years.  Of note is Zcash’s introduction which opened with remarkable liquidity, levels similar to what monero and dash enjoy today but which took them two to three years to achieve.  It's pretty clear that liquidity can be won very quickly.  Volatility of payment coins  Arguably achieving low volatility is more important than sheer liquidity as this is key to mass adoption.  Consumers need to be sure a payment currency is stable before charging their wallets. If the token price swings wildly like we saw in bitcoin's early days, we would see very few people holding it in their wallets, and no chance for user adoption.  It’s the prerequisite – if nobody is using your coin because of high volatility, then who cares if you have liquidity to assist in lowering merchant fees.  In this section, I’ll plot each payment coin’s volatility trend.  Bitcoin Volatility  In a previous volatility study, I established that bitcoin is well on the path to being the most stable currency in the world, an astounding claim, one that surprised even me.  Yet, when I break down the mechanism in which price stability is achieved, it makes sense.  Price stability happens at the exchanges. If you want to buy or sell a currency, and there’s millions of buyers or sellers on the other side of the market wanting to take your order, you will see a very small change in price movement from your trade.  When we look at fiat forex markets, the orders comprise of speculative trade, international trade and remittances. National trade within a currency never hits the forex exchanges.  But with bitcoin nearly all merchant and remittance activity worldwide hits the exchanges to convert to fiat, thus the potential for a much deeper order book. Another way to say this that with bitcoin, every cup of coffee you buy, anywhere in the world adds to market stability.  Its ceiling on stability should be orders of magnitude higher than fiat currencies.  The study concluded bitcoin would achieve fiat level volatility by mid-2019, which in my opinion is a level that will create a positive feedback loop that leads to more mainstream comfort with the currency.  This should open the way for bitcoin as a viable mainstream currency for the use of day to day commerce, further increasing its stability. A side conclusion was that payment startups such as BitPay are too early, and that their time will come in 2-3 years.  Monero Volatility  First up in our alternative payment coin list is monero, the biggest payment coin behind bitcoin.  Unfortunately, monero over its 2.5-year history has shown an increasing trend in volatility, and we've seen a lot more speculators pushing the price around during its 2016 price breakouts.  Here, we see how keeping liquidity high and volatility low can be like pulling on opposite ends of a tug-o-war. Often high volatility attracts traders which then feeds an increase in liquidity.  Though monero may be losing out on reduced volatility, it has a very important feature. Unlike dash, zcash and shadowcash, it is unique in that it is not a fork of bitcoin, so it has a chance of winning the payment coin war by competitor implosion should there be a vulnerability in bitcoin’s codebase.  In this regard, monero is an excellent bitcoin hedge in my opinion.  Dash Volatility  Dash was pleasantly surprising, showing a volatility reduction in line with bitcoin, and a slowly climbing liquidity rate, that if sustained, could catch bitcoin in one to two years.  In terms of lag, dash is about 18 months behind bitcoin in volatility, but unlikely to catch up if its present trend continues.  Last time I checked, 65% of dash is locked up in MasterNode staking, which creates a flow of currency to MasterNode owners, also 10% of block rewards are spent to develop the network.  This flow of currency could be responsible for dash's lower volatility.  The theory is that currency flowing to more people should add more depth and more even distribution to the order books of dash, and that it’s these two properties that ultimately reduces volatility.  ZCash Volatility  ZCash is the new kid on the block, at barely six weeks old, it’s not had enough time in the market to even calculate a single 60-day volatility point on a chart.  I ran a check of 30-day volatility, and it varied between 90% and 9500%. That’s literally off the charts, so we'll need wait some time before we see any meaningful trends.  ShadowCash Volatility  Shadowcash, like dash, is making inroads with liquidity, with just over two years to match bitcoin liquidity if 2016 trends can be sustained.  From our two years of history on this coin, we can see a slight reduction in volatility, but not at any rate that will catch up with bitcoin. Like dash, this coin allows staking with a 3-4% return for holders compared to dash’s 10-11% returns.  This could be the reason for SDC’s proportionally smaller decline in volatility compared to dash.  Conclusions  I started this study to double check my assumptions that bitcoin was well ahead of the pack in network effects. What the data showed was this was only partly true.  Bitcoin’s lead in liquidity is not unassailable, monero could match it in a year, while dash and shadowcash could achieve it in just over two.  This ignores bitcoin's zero-fee markets, which are colossal so perhaps it’s not a fair comparison. Probably the most accurate comparison would be to look at on-chain transaction volume which is difficult data to get, involving estimates of transaction values (technically, an estimate of change outputs back to the sender).  Interestingly, dash and shadowcash’s staking mechanisms (which distribute payouts to more participants than just miners) seem be making a significant difference in reducing volatility.  This is in no way conclusive, but in theory it makes sense.  All of bitcoin’s competitors tote features that bitcoin is lacking – faster confirmation times and private payments. Both of these features will most likely be coming to bitcoin as layer two protocols in 2017.  If and when this happens, the battle for payments and general money will be fought solely on the playing field of economic network effects, that of liquidity and volatility.  Bitcoin remains the standout contender in this regard.  This article originally appeared on Woo's blog and has been republished with his permission.

Bitstamp has another 21 days of its campaign on the BnkToTheFuture platform. The exchange is selling shares totalling 2% of total equity.  At press time, Bitstamp had raised $1,365,240 out of a planned $1.2m, drawing from 258 backers.  Co-founder and CEO Nejc Kodrič said the funding will go towards expanding into new markets, as well as offering new services to the existing trading platform.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our successful BnkToTheFuture campaign will enable us to focus more of our attention on new, unexplored markets and to implement some exciting new features (like new trading pairs, for example) and functionality to our site. We will continue to put our users first and make sure that our platform offers advanced solutions in a user-friendly manner.""  The move comes months after Bitstamp obtained a Payment Institution License from Luxembourg in mid-2016, which opened the door to new markets across Europe and, at the time, signaled a more positive regulatory environment for bitcoin startups in the region.  The funding success is a far cry from two years ago, when Bitstamp revealed that it had lost $5m in a phishing attack.  Bitstamp is the seventh-largest exchange by 30-day trading volume, according to data provider Bitcoinity.  Kodrič said that the funding success validates the exchange’s approach and puts it on a path to continued growth.  “We are extremely grateful for the success of our BnkToTheFuture campaign and remain thankful to every investor or client, whether it be new or old, for believing in Bitstamp and seeing our potential,” he said.

42379135,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n8yt,1483628748,What is 'Enterprise Ethereum'? Details Emerge on Secret Blockchain Project,"A secretive project that would aim to make ethereum more suitable for corporate users is taking shape, according to multiple sources familiar with the project.  Rumored to be called Enterprise Ethereum, the exact nature of the effort remains veiled behind an unusual degree of privacy – especially so for participants who are better known for their work in more transparent open-source communities.  Based on comments from sources, the group – which has the appearance of a broad consortium – intends to remain quiet until it is ready for a forthcoming public launch. Yet, word is already beginning to leak out.  On Thursday, 15th December, a group of startup founders and representatives from some of the world's largest financial institutions reportedly gathered in New York to discuss the common problems they face when building enterprise applications on ethereum.  On site at the undisclosed location appears to have been several bulge bracket banks, including at least one who was in the past involved with R3CEV, a stock exchange and a major software provider, among others.  Independently confirmed attendees include Deloitte blockchain spin-off Nuco, Taiwanese blockchain consortium Amis and ConsenSys, an ethereum platform known for working closely with major tech firms including Red Hat and Microsoft.  Though all the parties involved were discreet, a few additional details have begun to take shape.  ConsenSys chief of staff Jeremy Millar, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Barclays, described the secretive project to CoinDesk, stating:  ""We are collaborating with a number of large corporate users of ethereum in banking, energy, supply chain, insurance and other industries along with leading enterprise technology vendors and blockchain startups to establish a standard for private ethereum networks.""  According to Millar, who joined ConsenSys after founding enterprise blockchain consulting firm Ledger Partners LLP, the work is being done in partnership with multiple Ethereum Foundation members and core contributors.  Emphasis on privacy  Present at the meeting was Alex Liu, founder of blockchain consortium Amis.  A former employee of Qualcomm and Samsung, Liu indicated that the Enterprise Ethereum project would consist of an ""enterprise-grade stack"" and provide tools for users with demands to ensure the privacy of transactions – a major pain point for institutions today.  But, he added that the technology would leverage the strengths of ethereum’s public blockchain.  ""The scalability, security, privacy that any enterprise blockchain will want, those are being added or addressed,"" Liu told CoinDesk, adding:  ""But you’ll also see interaction with the public chain.""  In the days following the Ethereum Enterprise meeting, Nuco co-founder Matthew Spoke confirmed he was in New York City to participate in the event.  Possible motives  So far, the reason for the secrecy appears to be concerns about the competition coming from other sectors of the blockchain industry. But, there's reason to be skeptical about this possible reasoning for the group's launch.  Former IBM blockchain developer Henning Diedrich, who left the company last year to work on his own smart contract language, contends that ethereum's software is already suitable for private blockchains that he tested at IBM.  However, he noted that the relatively nascent state of enterprise products like Hyperledger and R3CEV's Corda platform may be forcing enterprise interest in a more robust offering from ethereum, a comparatively more tested alternative.  Though Diedrich argued that ethereum developers still have room to improve the product, he remains skeptical that a large-scale ethereum consortium is even necessary.  ""Sure you can always make it easier,"" he said. ""But the limits are being tackled.""  Not so fast  Regardless of who else might be involved, blockchain consortia have already proven their ability to help organizers recruit high-profile participants.  Ethereum users are no different, according to Hudson Jameson, a former lead blockchain researcher at USAA, and now a member of the Ethereum Foundation.  Jameson told CoinDesk that he believes ""2017 is going to have a number of consortiums, primarily between banks that are all testing on ethereum or ethereum derivatives.""  But, to his knowledge, not a single one of his peers at the Ethereum Foundation was at that secretive meeting in New York City on 15th December.  As for Alex Liu, he’s not surprised in the least that little is known about ""Ethereum Enterprise"", if it exists.  Liu indicated the secrecy is part of the plan, but only for the short term.  He said:  ""As you’ll see, the most exciting thing to come out of it was a series of events over the next month or two months that will become successively more formal.""

42379139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n93v,1483624439,Bitcoin Freefall: Prices Drop Nearly $200 in 1 Hour,"Bitcoin prices tumbled sharply this morning.  According to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), market averages dropped abruptly only days after passing the $1,000 mark on 1st January. This morning's decline came after prices reached a high of $1,153.02 in early morning trading.  Still, despite coming within reach of all-time highs, prices fell more than 20% across global exchanges before recovering. Markets were fluctuating near $1,071 before reaching a brief low of $887.47, the lowest figure observed on the BPI since 25th December.  At press time, the average price of bitcoin was $958.31, a decline of more than 15% from the day's peak.  The movements marked a sharped contrast from yesterday's trading sessions.  Then, prices surged past the $1,100 mark, a rally that saw markets climb more than 10% over the course of the day. At the time, however, sell order pressure kept markets below the all-time high, leading some analysts to predict that prices could fall sharply in the face of additional pressure.  Meanwhile, CNY-denominated markets fell more than 15% from the start of the day, dropping to a low of ¥6,160.68. BPI data reports that CNY markets are trading at an average of ¥6,644.34 at press time.  Rally in question  Today's price move raises the question of whether the rally that began last month will continue into the new year – or if we're in for a repeat of 2013-2014, when bitcoin peaked and quickly fell.  One might be tempted to look at the steadily rising markets over the past few weeks – in mid-December, the price hadn’t yet crossed the $800 line – but this metric is only part of the equation.  The answer to whether the current bitcoin rally is sustainable may lie in the volume numbers, or the amount of money traded per day across global bitcoin exchanges.  At least one exchange operator reported that the volume picture is different this year than it was during the last market high in late 2013, which saw prices cross the $1,100 mark before tumbling over the months to come.  When reached for comment, representatives from Chinese bitcoin exchange Huobi – which boasts nearly a quarter of the world’s bitcoin trading market share – said that the situation is very different from three years ago.  Exchange reps told CoinDesk:  ""In 2013, when the price was 8,000 yuan, the weekly trading volume was 393,000 BTC, with an amplitude of the week up to 103%. The trading volume was very small. Today, bitcoin [prices] broke 8,000 yuan with 735m BTC trading volume, which is expected to double in a week.""  The firm added: ""Current trading volume is 37x of that in 2013 and bitcoin price fluctuates 15.95%, which is much more stable than the year 2013.""  Data from Bitcoinity  , too, suggests that trade volume is higher today overall than it was during that period.  The number of trades per minute, as shown in data provided by the site, points to a fundamentally different picture – though the higher velocity could swing markets in either direction depending on momentum.  Ultimately, market watchers may just have to wait and see what happens next.

42379142,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n97h,1483618554,Will 2017 Bring an End to Bitcoin's Great Scaling Debate?,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, CoinDesk contributor Corin Faife recaps developments in bitcoin's biggest technology debate.  In bitcoin's early days, discussion of the protocol was almost the only thing that mattered – and 2016, it could be said, has brought this discussion back to center stage.  The reason has been the continued focus on network scalability, more specifically whether modifying bitcoin's block size is the right way to increase the number of transactions the network can process.  It's important to note that to some, the continued ""debate"" isn't really a debate at all.  As evidenced at the technology's annual developer summit, there remains a strong (if not overwhelming) consensus that a proposal called Segregated Witness is the best solution – if it is approved, it will nearly double bitcoin's capacity.  Yet, a vocal minority continues to remain opposed (partly over disagreement about ""Satoshi's vision"" and partly due to trust issues with Bitcoin Core, its primary volunteer developer team). As such, the argument over the pros and cons of this proposal has still not been conclusively resolved.  While bitcoin's price has once again returned to its 2013 highs, it could be said that only one number matters in 2017, the percentage of miners that agree to upgrade to a version of the protocol featuring the SegWit upgrade.  The progress of developments (like the much-hyped Lightning Network), as well as the business models of many startups, arguably depend on SegWit's implementation.  Against this backdrop, 2017 is likely to prove a pivotal year.  For now, let's look at how the debate unfolded in 2016, along with the related projects and personalities that fed into it.  1. Two camps form  The debate over block size and scalability was already contentious in 2015, but the main difference was that a range of proposed solutions were on the table and the partisan lines were less clear.  Then, in December 2015, Blockstream co-founder and developer Pieter Wuille introduced a proposal called Segregated Witness, which would increase network throughput without modifying block size by changing the way that transactions were stored in order to use less space.  Also beneficial, developers argued, was that it could be introduced via a mechanism called a soft fork (meaning that miners who adopted it could co-exist on the network with those that did not).  As evidenced by ethereum this year, a hard fork could risk splitting the economic network into two incompatible versions. (Opponents claim that a hard fork is more democratic, as it allows voting and the possibility of two outcomes).  Following the release of the Segregated Witness white paper, proposed solutions to the scalability problem were effectively flattened into two groups: those who wanted an increase in block size (with a further debate over what the ideal size was), and those who wanted to maintain block size while improving efficiency in other areas.  So, 2015 rolled into 2016 with a far more polarized version of the debate than had previously been seen.  This initially left Bitcoin Core developers who supported the Segregated Witness solution scrambling to do a better job of clarifying their position, with the launch of a website, Twitter feed, and Slack channel to bridge perceived communication gaps.  Meanwhile, support for the alternative path gathered steam with the release of Bitcoin Classic in February, a repackaging of the Bitcoin Core software which would double the maximum block size from 1MB to 2MB.  Yet at almost exactly the same time, another power bloc emerged in the form of a consortium of miners and exchanges who declared that they would not back any proposal resulting in a hard fork of the network, throwing doubts over the viability of getting Bitcoin Classic off the ground.  2. Bitcoin Core progresses  Toward the mid-point of the year, a group of about 20 contributors to the Bitcoin Core code met in Zurich to review the Segregated Witness code.  Held in late May, the meeting brought the distributed group of developers together to discuss the code itself, and broader issues of strategy and communication for the roll-out of the code.  Not long afterwards, the Bitcoin Core developers merged the Segregated Witness code into the master branch of the bitcoin codebase, allowing for a new round of testing of the code on the bitcoin testnet.  With momentum firmly behind them at this stage, and after a few more months of testing the Core, developers announced that version 0.13.0 of the Bitcoin Core software would include SegWit code, albeit in a pre-activation state that could be triggered with a subsequent update. The version also included faster block relays on the network, among other technical updates.  Meanwhile, in July, an upgrade to the bitcoin network's block relay structure was also announced.  The project was an improvement to the Bitcoin Relay Network, a system developed to boost the speed at which block data was propagated amongst bitcoin miners and thereby reduce the incidence of orphan blocks.  When the Bitcoin Relay Network began to ‘show its age’, bitcoin developer and Blockstream co-founder Matt Corallo redesigned its successor – the Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine – using the UDP protocol instead of TCP, allowing for even faster data transmission between nodes.  3. Hurdles left to jump  Even after the strides of progress seen by the Bitcoin Core team, the last months of the year were to prove that consensus is still proving to be hard fought.  One of these hurdles came in the form of ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com owner Roger Ver, two influential opponents to the Bitcoin Core roadmap, both of whom have a stake in the protocol's mining network.  In late October, ViaBTC switched from using Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival software client backed by Ver that does not include support for Segregated Witness. Instead, it tackles the problem of scaling by introducing a configurable maximum block size which can be defined by individual miners.  (For an easily digestible explanation of how this works, see Peter Rizun's post on how a Bitcoin Unlimited node deals with large blocks).  Given that Segregated Witness needs to be backed by 95% of the hashing power of the network in order to be adopted, any mining pool commanding 5% of the hashing power or more can effectively block the process, leaving progress towards scalability at an impasse.  This is more or less where the end of the year leaves us: with a widespread support for Segregated Witness, but a small and vocal minority of opponents holding out against it.  At the time of writing, over 50% of bitcoin nodes are running the SegWit-compatible 0.13.0 or 0.13.1 software according to Bitnodes, yet over 7% of nodes are running some version of Bitcoin Unlimited – a large enough share of mining power that the network might not be able to switch.  However, even with the scales so heavily weighted toward Bitcoin Core, the story is far from over.  If and when the network adopts Segregated Witness, the 1.8x increase in transaction volume may buy only a finite amount of time before familiar limitations start to resurface. Though it could be argued that keeping an artificial cap could force innovation in other areas, most (if not all) developers believe the block size will one day need to rise.  With this in mind, in 2017 and beyond, it seems certain that the 'block size debate' will continue.

42379148,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n9Cj,1483614149,3 Things Smart Contracts Need Before They Can Finally Take Off,"Arthur Breitman is the CEO and Kathleen Breitman the COO of Tezos (tezos.com), a new blockchain platform currently in development. Before founding Tezos, Arthur worked at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley where he served as a vice president. Kathleen was a senior strategy associate for blockchain consortium R3.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, the Breitmans provide their overview of the ongoing issues with smart contract development, selecting just three they believe remain barriers to mainstream use.  Smart contracts hold tremendous promise as the 'killer app' for blockchains.  If you're not familiar, a smart contract is a computer program that automatically executes the terms of a contract on a blockchain. In principle, you can use smart contracts for a wide variety of purposes, such as wireless service contracts, apartment and hotel room rentals, freelance work contracts, automating payments – anyplace you'd want to cut out the middle person.  With more than $17bn in assets stored in just the top 10 cryptocurrencies, there currently is a huge opportunity to give existing blockchain assets additional flexibility and utility by adding smart contract capabilities.  It's also obvious that the technology offers a robust upside to traditional markets.  For example, consider the use case of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, which accounts for $700tn in notional value per year. Moving even a small percentage of those trades to smart contracts represents an enormous potential savings.  But before smart contracts can live up to their promise, the platforms enabling them need further development.  Here are three ways smart contract systems can earn our trust in 2017:  1. Provide formal verification capabilities  Writing code that works exactly the way we want is incredibly difficult.  All software is vulnerable to bugs or attacks of various kinds – but with smart contracts, actual assets are at stake. We need a better way to ensure these contracts are robust and secure. One way is to use formal verification, a mathematical technique of checking code to prove that it will execute as intended.  Smart contracts should be implemented in a language that's easy to verify. For this reason, functional languages, like Haskell and OCaml, are better suited to smart contract code than imperative ones like C/C++, Java and JavaScript, because their structure is easier to reason about and to verify formally.  True, more programmers are familiar with JavaScript, but the focus needs to shift from ease of use to security.  Bear in mind that formal verification has some limitations. It is not completely automatic and still requires human skill.  Also, formal verification can only prove the properties we actually think to check; if you don't verify the right things you can still leave vulnerabilities open. But still, it is a step in the right direction when implemented properly.  2. Ensure transparency so code can be inspected  One of the biggest experiments with smart contracts was The DAO, a virtualized investment vehicle that raised $150m – and then immediately fell victim to an attacker who siphoned off $50m into their own account.  When security researchers began to analyze The DAO, it was tedious to understand what it was actually doing because The DAO's bytecode (the virtual machine code) was all that was visible on the blockchain, and it was not clear which version of the source code was actually being deployed.  Smart contract code needs to be transparent, with no loopholes, so we know exactly what we are signing when we enter an agreement – and also so errors are easier to spot. One way to accomplish that is by using an interpreted language, instead of a compiled one, so the actual code is visible on the blockchain and can be easily inspected.  Otherwise, bytecode needs to map exactly to the source code that created it to ensure that they match. That requires the compiler itself to be certified.  3. Provide a clear governance mechanism  Because smart contracts are stored on a blockchain, by definition the code is immutable – meaning, in a perfect world, the code doesn’t change.  But software is never perfect. Changes to the underlying platform can and will happen, which can affect how smart contract code executes. How a given blockchain handles those changes is critical to instilling trust in its platform.  Where there is no clear governance model, there is no certainty the ground won’t suddenly shift beneath your feet. When it works in their favor, core developers or whoever is running the show has the power to change the rules of the game midstream.  Of course, how vulnerable a blockchain is to this kind of abuse of power depends largely on its community. Still, blockchains of the future should have clear governance principles laid out from the start, so that protocol changes are made in a predictable fashion and nobody gets hit by any big surprises.  Once we get the kinks worked out, smart contracts will take off and form the backbone of many of the contracts we engage in everyday, handling everything from your electricity bills to your dog sitter to the arrangement you have with a landlord – all behind the scenes and over the Internet, making our lives easier.  And like the Internet, we won’t think about the technology behind it, we just know that it works – consistently and dependably.

42379140,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n96R,1483590616,Bitcoin Price Bounces Back to Within $25 of All-Time High,"After failing to set a new high during yesterday's trading, bitcoin's price is edging up once again to start 5th January.  At press time, bitcoin prices had increased $10 during the first hours of the day's session to top $1,140, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  The upward movements follow a pattern observed on 4th January, when the digital currency's price appreciated sharply after crossing $1,100 before meeting resistance at $1,140.  With the move, global exchange averages are again within striking distance of the previous all-time high of $1,165.89 set on 30th November, 2013. Also notable is bitcoin's highest-ever single exchange listing of $1,242, observed on the now-defunct exchange Mt Gox.  Yet, bitcoin prices have faced resistance as they have approached both historic benchmarks.  In the last 24 hours, more than 52% of BTC/USD orders on Bitfinex have been buy orders, according to BFXdata, though sell orders had mounted in yesterday's sessions.  Still, developments could lie ahead.  As of 4:15 UTC, buy orders accounted for 77% of all trades on Bitfinex, suggesting upward pressure could be poised to mount.
