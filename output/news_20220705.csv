This was propelled even further by the crash that rocked the digital asset back in mid-June. Since then, bitcoin has struggled to keep its head above the $20,000 level, and as it continues to fail, bearish sentiment has grown rampant. This is evident in the short bitcoin inflows that were recorded for last week. Record Numbers For Short Bitcoin The latest CoinShares report has shown that institutional investors are only investing in bitcoin for the short term, and what&apos;s more, they believe that the digital asset is set to decline more. It shows that inflows into the short bitcoin ETFs had hit their highest point since its inception with $51 million for the previous week. Related Reading | Mounting Support For Bitcoin At $19,000 As Market Ushers In A New Week The ProShares short BTC ETF is the latest in line for these types, and while it had seen significant inflows for the prior week, it was chalked up to the fact that the ETF had just launched. However, last week has put into perspective how institutional investors are viewing bitcoin going forward.

42374369,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZHfh,1657061804,"Celsius Repays $183M on DeFi Protocol Maker, Gets Back Collateral, Blockchain Data Shows","Celsius, the crypto lender that has halted withdrawals and is reportedly cutting jobs to stave off a liquidity crisis, has been aggressively repaying debt on one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, blockchain data shows – possibly to get back bitcoin-equivalent tokens that had been posted on the platform as collateral.  Since July 1, according to the on-chain data, Celsius has paid down $183 million of its collateralized debt to Maker, one of the largest decentralized lending platforms. Transactions on the blockchain data tracker Etherscan verify the downpayments originated from a wallet linked to Celsius. The debt was repaid in the Maker protocol's native stablecoin, DAI.  The transactions resulted in not only the extinguishment of the debt but the release from Maker of 2,000 wrapped bitcoin (worth $40 million) that had been posted as collateral, the data shows. Wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) is a token configured for the Ethereum blockchain that represents bitcoin (BTC) – the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and thus one of the most liquid.  Celsius still owes 41 million DAI (about $41 million worth) in loans to Maker, but it has about 22,000 wrapped bitcoin (about $440 million worth) posted against those loans – so there could be an even bigger potential kicker if the rest of the debt were repaid.  “By repaying the debt, Celsius is possibly freeing up collateral (BTC) that then can be sold on centralized exchanges or via over-the-counter to meet creditor demands and customer withdrawals,” Fundstrat analyst Walter Teng told CoinDesk.  “Given that DeFi loans are overcollateralized, it makes sense for them to do this, as the value unlocked from paying back their loans (collateral less loans) is greater than the value of the loans themselves (should they opt to not repay).”  Celsius representatives didn't immediately return emails requesting comment on the blockchain data or the transactions.  The beleaguered crypto lender is scrambling to protect and preserve its assets to avoid insolvency, after a hit to its finances from the implosion of the Terra blockchain and its UST stablecoin in May, and then in June from the failure of the once-top tier crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  Celsius suspended withdrawals and transactions for its ​​1.7 million users starting on June 12, hired restructuring consultants and reportedly cut 150 jobs. Regulators have opened investigations of the company.  The native token of the Celsius platform, CEL, has tumbled 80% this year.  Read more: How Crypto Lender Celsius Overheated  As of May 2022, the firm had lent out more than $8 billion to clients and had $12 billion in assets under management.  Loans on decentralized finance platforms such as Maker are generally overcollateralized, which means that the borrower pledges more assets in value to the lender than the value of the loan.  Another benefit of the loan paydowns is that it reduces the price point (of wBTC) at which the Celsius collateral would automatically be liquidated by the Maker protocol.  After the payments, the liquidation level of the Celsius wBTC collateral dropped to $2,722, according to the website DeFi Explore. WBTC now trades at $20,200, making the loan 1,101% (about 10 times) overcollateralized.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/05/celsius-repays-183m-on-defi-exchange-maker-gets-back-collateral-blockchain-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a9e8aea8f12058c5c0b826a3f617ed6de402a67-1641x1231.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin dips early but recovers  In its ongoing moves above and below the $20K threshold, bitcoin took the latest in a series of recent, small dives during Asian market hours Tuesday but later regained its perch above the psychologically important mark.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,300, up roughly 2% for the last 24 hours. Investors see $20,000 support as a gauge of the current bear market's staying power.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at about $1,140, up slightly for the same period. Other major cryptocurrencies by market cap in the CoinDesk top 25 were largely up from the previous day, with AVAX and SAND among the biggest winners, recently rising more than 9% and 5%, respectively. LTC recently dropped nearly 2%.  Equity markets inch up  Equity markets rallied late to finish up, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbing 1.8% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ticking up by fractions of a percentage point. Investors may have found silver linings in recent economic data suggesting that the economy is slowing enough to allow central banks to reduce the pace of interest rate hikes. The U.S. Federal Reserve's extreme hawkishness has alarmed investors fearful of recession. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) found weaker-than-expected manufacturing output for June. Separate recent reports have shown savings rates and consumer confidence dropping.  The flow of bad crypto news was slower than it has been most days over the past six weeks, although London-based crypto lender Nexo announced it had signed a term sheet to acquire 100% of fellow lending platform Vauld, a Singapore-based company that said on Monday that it was suspending all withdrawals, trading and deposits on its platform as it looked at restructuring options. Vauld joined a growing list of crypto firms swept up in the industry's recent price declines.  What is crypto's nature?  Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman raised a philosophical issue about cryptos, citing an adviser to the firm, Bill Powers, who recently asked if bitcoin was ""'really a store of wealth or if it was just a store of excess wealth.""  Dorman wrote: ""Over the past decade, we haven’t had to distinguish between the two, but with central banks on the warpath to stamp out inflation via negative wealth effects, we may soon find out. So far, the evidence is pretty damning. Bitcoin does not like financial tightening.""  But Dorman added that the thesis for bitcoin is almost ""certainly not"" dead, noting its frequent mention during the early weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine when the U.S. and allies imposed heavy sanctions on the Russian banking system, and when the Canadian government tried to shut down funding for protesting Canadian truckers.  ""Bitcoin is likely just a call option on a future where bitcoin is used for something, and its price is, therefore, a reflection of the increased or decreased probability of eventual adoption,"" Dorman wrote. ""But until that day, bitcoin may simply be a store of excess wealth. So as long as you believe that excess wealth will once again return, bitcoin is probably a good asymmetric call option.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,831 -0.1%  DJIA: 30,967 -0.4%  Nasdaq: 11,332 +1.7%  Gold: $1,766 -2.4%  Insights  Are Crypto Games Worth Playing?  There’s a lot wrong with Polium’s attempt to build a game console for Web3 games. We could start by looking at the logo, which has some striking similarities to that of the Nintendo GameCube. But the problem with this isn’t aesthetic, but how most crypto games are structured: for profit, not for fun.  Ask yourself, is there a crypto game worth playing? The most popular genre, play-to-earn, usually has the same depth, complexity and graphics quality as a Super Nintendo game from the late 1980s. Many countries in Asia, like South Korea, have specific rules banning them. Plus, backers of play-to-earn games are fairly explicit that it's one big labor arbitrage play and not something for fun.  Game consoles are notoriously tough to succeed in. Usually, the business model involves selling the actual hardware as a loss leader, subsidized by a library of games. This was controversial with investors 16 years ago when PlayStation 3 launched, but by the era of PlayStation 5 this became more accepted. Why? Because Sony (SNE) has a universe of experiences to sell the customer on its console, from movies to games.  In 2012, when mobile gaming was just taking off, a project called Ouya hit Kickstarter with the promise of bringing mobile games to TV. Clearly, there was some demand for it as the Kickstarter campaign raised $8.5 million from 63,000 people.  A footnote of gaming history  The console lived a short life and was consigned as a footnote of gaming history. Ouya, lacking the expertise of Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft (MSFT) just wasn’t able to build a good product. While mobile gaming did have a good run in the early part of the decade, the hits didn’t keep coming to make a console purchase worthwhile. Plus, the games themselves were better suited for the small screen of a phone and not for a TV.  There might be a time when Web3 games have matured to the point where they are ready for a console of their own. Studios are raising some serious cash to build out these games. But they need to build games that people want to play, both on their phone and on a console. Right now, that has to be something better than Axie Infinity, which data shows players are abandoning by the millions.

Bitcoin (BTC) leveled off to around $20,000 in Wednesday trading, down 2% from its high of $20,720 the previous day. The first cryptocurrency has changed hands largely in the $18,000 to $21,000 range for most of the past month as investors gauge the impact of rising inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty.  The majority of altcoins were in the green on Wednesday with Avalanche (AVAX) leading the charts, up 6.4% in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up 0.7%.  An Increasingly Correlated Asset  For much of its short history, bitcoin has been uncorrelated to traditional markets, which served as a desirable quality for recession-conscious investors. However, according to data from Coin Metrics, bitcoin’s correlation to U.S. equities, specifically the S&P 500, has strengthened since March 2020.  “The correlation hit a new all-time high in Q2 ‘22 with BTC and U.S. equities moving almost lock-step,” Coin Metrics wrote in a newsletter. “At the same time, BTC moved increasingly against risk indices like the VIX.”  The release of the June consumer price index next week may show whether the recent hawkish monetary policies of the U.S. central bank have been effective. If prices decline, and other economic indicators also continue their recent descent, investors may feel more confident that the U.S. is solving the dual problems of inflation and a steep economic contraction. If the CPI continues to increase, markets could be discouraged.

Voyager Is Next Crypto Lender to Fall  Today’s positive crypto market movements were overshadowed by crypto lender Voyager’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Tuesday.  Voyager’s decision is part of the domino effect of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s liquidity problems. The Singapore-based firm filed for for Chapter 15 bankruptcy last Friday. According to writer Frances Coppola, nearly 50% of Voyager’s total assets were from its loan book, and nearly 60% of the loan book consisted of loans to Three Arrows Capital.  Crypto companies – and lenders in particular – have faced solvency issues in recent weeks, with several stopping customers from withdrawing their funds. Celsius kicked off this trend last month, announcing in mid-June that it would suspend withdrawals. CoinLoan, CoinFLEX and Voyager itself all announced restrictions or outright halts on withdrawals in recent days, Nikhilesh De and Danny Nelson reported today.  Voyager’s VGX token plummeted to a low of $0.20 hours after filing for bankruptcy and is now trading at around $0.21, 12% down in the last 24 hours.

42374366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZHdB,1657053019,Crypto Fundraising After End of Roe Tepid So Far,"Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the decades-long constitutional right to abortion and effectively rendering legal abortions unavailable in large swaths of the United States.  Within days, members of the crypto community sprang to action, forming decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects aimed at raising funds (in crypto, of course) for pro-choice organizations.  ChoiceDAO – whose core contributors include the founder of Girls Who Code and former core contributors to ConstitutionDAO and Ukraine DAO – is attempting to raise $1 million for various reproductive rights organizations. LegalAbortion.eth, an initiative by UnicornDAO, offers would-be donors a wallet to which they can send crypto donations, which will then be converted to fiat and sent to seven preselected pro-choice groups. CowgirlDAO is selling an NFT collection to raise funds for abortion access, with a goal of $3 million.  The crypto community’s response so far has been tepid compared with other collective fundraising efforts. Donations to pro-choice campaigns so far have been a trickle compared with the outpouring of support for Ukraine following Russia’s invasion. (At least $20 million in crypto was donated to Ukrainian military and civilian causes within three days of the start of that conflict, and the sum now stands at $135 million.)  Nadya Tolokonnikova, a member of Russian feminist activist group Pussy Riot and the leader of UnicornDAO, told CoinDesk that she thinks the crypto community should be more vocal about the loss of bodily autonomy in the wake of Roe’s overturn.  “I’ve seen people who identify themselves as libertarians and support people’s rights and non-invasion of governments into people’s rights and people’s bodies – they support things like Canadian truck drivers, but now are being silent about what’s happening to women,” Tolokonnikova told CoinDesk.  “I want to encourage people to be more empathetic, because I know that the space still disproportionately consists of mostly men,” Tolokonnikova added. “Maybe it’s more difficult for them to get connected to a problem that does not concern them directly.”  A missed opportunity for crypto?  Some privacy and crypto advocates, including Fight for the Future’s Lia Holland, see the industry’s underwhelming reaction to the end of Roe as a missed opportunity to showcase the real-world utility of crypto.  “This may be the moment where the rubber meets the road on the promises that crypto and blockchain make,” said Holland, who serves as campaigns and communications director for Fight for the Future. “We have not truly seen DAOs – or crypto, quite frankly – in the U.S. prove themselves as tools for marginalized people to fight oppression directly and evade state surveillance on the scale that surveillance is about to be conducted.”  Holland told CoinDesk that, in the case of abortion access, the utility of Web3 could go far beyond fundraising.  “Digital rights activists are concerned that we will see similar deplatforming, both in terms of financial and essential health information and support that we saw in the wake of the passage of FOSTA-SESTA,” Holland said, referring to a controversial law meant to stymie sex trafficking, which led to a wave of censorship and deplatforming at Web2 companies.  Big Tech’s censorship of abortion information has already begun. Facebook and Instagram have cracked down on posts offering abortion pills, deleting them and banning the transgressors. Facebook’s parent company, Meta (FB), told employees last Friday they were not allowed to openly discuss the ruling on Slack.  Though Holland doesn’t discount the role of fundraising (“It’s a good thing to be doing,” she said), the real benefit could come from establishing a place to share information and offer support without the risk of surveillance and deplatforming that comes with Web2 platforms.  “There could be – and I think, so far has been – an opportunity lost [for the crypto community] to respond to a moment like this by saying, ‘Bitcoin fixes this’ or what have you, which is essentially the conversation that happened when OnlyFans said they were going to stop hosting sex workers under pressure from payment platforms,” Holland said.  “We need the signal of crypto to be acting strongly and responsibly, to provide real utility for the people and organizations that very well may be about to need it the most we’ve ever seen in the history of the internet,” she added.  For its part, ChoiceDAO hopes eventually to become more than a vehicle for crypto fundraising.  “The goal is to kick-start a flywheel of participation that causes the DAO to continue to grow and work on important initiatives in the future,” a spokesperson for the DAO told CoinDesk.  “At the end of the day, focusing on pure capital discounts the community – which in many ways can be more powerful than money.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/05/crypto-fundraising-after-end-of-roe-tepid-so-far,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74431c218c39150642675e47b1de3cb9fe055792-4444x3333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421506,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoW7h,1657042242,The Era of Easy DeFi Yields Is Over,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been one of the areas of crypto most affected during the recent market downturn. From the collapse of Anchor and other DeFi protocols in the Terra network to the constant pressure in LIDO and stEth as well as the insolvency of large asset managers that were active in different protocols, there have been many events that have challenged DeFi’s entire value proposition.  Unsurprisingly, the total value locked in DeFi protocols has shrunk about 70% from its all-time high to $74 billion today and the native yields in DeFi protocols have contracted significantly. These recent shocks have drastically changed the composition of the DeFi market and the nature of alpha (above-market returns) and risk in DeFi protocols. In this article, we outline a framework for the evolution of alpha and risk management in the next phase of the DeFi market.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a blockchain analytics provider. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Easy yields were the main narrative of the 2020-2022 rally in DeFi. An overleveraged environment for stablecoins as well as aggressive incentive programs enabled traders to capture astronomical yields without the need for sophisticated financial logic. The ease of generating alpha also induced a lack of attention to risk management mechanisms. The nature of DeFi has changed and the balance between alpha and risk in DeFi has drastically shifted.  The risk-return balance in traditional markets  Returns and risk are the core foundation of investment strategies in traditional capital markets. From a financial return perspective, most markets can be considered “efficiently inefficient” to use an adaptation of the Efficient Market Hypothesis proposed by Eugene Fama in the 1970s. While there is plenty of alpha in traditional markets, sophisticated strategies are needed to identify and capture it. Traditional markets rely on intermediaries and strong regulatory frameworks to prevent asymmetric risk conditions. Simple metrics such as value at risk (VaR) have been widely accepted as a way to quantify potential losses in a portfolio. Quantifying risk with such a simple statistical metric is only possible because traditional markets assume the existence of a robust enough infrastructure to prevent massive systemic risk. While scarce high returns and managed risk are the norm in traditional capital markets, the picture in DeFi is quite different.  The evolution of alpha and risk in DeFi  DeFi is a novel and highly inefficient financial environment whose basic building blocks, or primitives, resemble products in traditional capital markets. As a result, there are plenty of opportunities for capturing alpha and different dimensions of risk. However, in the first phase of the market, the returns were way too easy and the risks way too high. The change in composition of the DeFi space is starting to alter the relationship between risks and returns in a trajectory that is closer to other financial markets. From an evolutionary perspective, we can see three main stages in the dynamics between risk and returns in DeFi.  Phase 1: An abundance of high returns and complex risk management  The first phase in the evolution of DeFi has been characterized by relatively easy-to-capture yields and extremely obscure risks related to DeFi protocols. The proliferation of incentive programs in DeFi protocols, the leverage in stablecoins and increasing trading activity made easy yields the norm of this phase. An environment in which simple liquidity provision trades in automated market makers (AMM) or leveraged lending trades in lending protocols could consistently yield above 15%-20% obviously attracted a lot of traders and speculators, which contributed to the hype cycle of the first phase of DeFi.  The high yields of the first DeFi rush were accompanied by massive vulnerabilities and risk exposure. The complexity of many DeFi protocols opened the door to significant technical and economic hazards that are hard to mitigate. Most participants in DeFi are familiar with smart contract risk that has resulted in major exploits in protocols. However, economic risks such as whale manipulation attacks or impermanent loss cost investors millions of dollars in losses daily. The mechanisms for managing and controlling those risks are complex and require deep understanding of the technical and economic behavior of DeFi protocols. Consequently, the vast majority of trades in DeFi protocols are executed without proper risk management routines which often translates into sizable losses.  Phase 2: Scarcity of high returns and complex risk management  The recent change in the DeFi market has directly caused a contraction in the first-order yields produced by protocols. It is hard to find protocols that produce double-digit returns based on simple liquidity provision trades. However, there are still plenty of high-alpha opportunities in DeFi as the market remains one of the most inefficient environments in any asset class. Identifying most of the high-return opportunities requires more sophisticated views about the market via complex financial logic that often combines different protocols.  While capturing high returns in DeFi protocols has become more complex, risk management remains equally difficult. The correction in the DeFi space has been too quick for risk management processes to adapt. Furthermore, the increase in complexity of DeFi strategies translates into a broader range of vulnerabilities that requires more sophisticated risk management models.  Scarcity of easy high-alpha returns together with high economic risks is likely to limit the adoption of DeFi protocols to more sophisticated institutional investors and traders instead of retail investors.  Phase 3: Scarcity of high returns and simpler risk management  DeFi is not going to remain a risky environment forever. As the market evolves, it is expected that protocols will start incorporating native risk management capabilities to streamline their adoption. We are already seeing incipient ideas in this area with protocols like Bancor, Euler, Maker incorporating mechanisms for natively managing intrinsic economic risk. For example, we can imagine a next-generation AMM that automatically insures against impermanent loss or a lending protocol that better protects against liquidations. Even though some of these initial built-in risk management models have been challenged under stressful market conditions, the value of risk management as a native protocol capability remains compelling.  If DeFi protocols start natively managing common risk conditions, it would directly simplify risk management for investors, traders and other market participants because they would only have to focus on more elaborate forms of risk. This new risk-return composition of the DeFi market closely resembles traditional capital markets in which high-alpha returns are difficult to achieve but a significant portion of risk management is built into the market infrastructure.  The era of easy yields in DeFi is over  Recent market events have drastically changed the balance between high returns and risk in the DeFi space. As DeFi evolves, high yields powered by incentive programs will transition from being the norm to an exception. The asymmetry of DeFi will still provide opportunities for great returns but those would come in the form of sophisticated financial strategies. Similarly, risk management is likely to become simpler as DeFi protocols and other components of the infrastructure enable native protection against known economic risks.  From that perspective, the era of easy yields in DeFi is likely over but the new phases of the DeFi market promise a more mature economic structure and equally appealing opportunities.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/05/the-era-of-easy-defi-yields-is-over,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/251566d6d295fa651f0c8d3bdea79cfc922941a6-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The crypto market did find a bottom in June when BTC&apos;s price traded close to $17,000 and pushed the Fear and Greed Index to extreme levels. Since that time, the number one cryptocurrency has pushed the market slightly upwards and has been forming a new range between $18,600 and $21,000. These levels stand as the major area of resistance along with $22,000. Market participants seem more positive on a probably break above these levels, according to a recent report from Arcane Research.

42393965,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwazP,1657037832,Coordinape Is Decentralizing Compensation Decision-Making,"When traditional companies decide on compensation levels, the discussion typically occurs between an employee and manager. Even within decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), the circle of decision-makers for compensation can be quite small.  This article is part of ""Future of Work Week.""  But what if there was a way of having a whole community of working contributors decide compensation in an open way?  Enter Coordinape  Initially emerging from Yearn Finance’s grant process, Coordinape’s flagship product is the Gift Circle. “It’s a way to do decentralized retroactive compensation and, importantly, it’s about deciding on compensation,” said Coordinape co-founder and former Yearn contributor Tracheopteryx said in an interview.  “The future of labor needs to be able to break out of the top-down rigid, hierarchical structures we’re familiar with from the corporate world…” Tracheopteryx said. “We need to create better ways for human minds to come together and think. And that’s what Coordinape is trying to do. And one of the ways in particular that Coordinape is taking on is compensation.”  First, a user defines a group to establish membership of a Gift Circle for a given project with an income budget that is dedicated to a project’s contributors. During the working period and within their circle, contributors decide how many GIVE tokens to gift to their teammates.  Each GIVE represents a portion of the total compensation budget that is going to be distributed. For example, if a contributor receives 10% of all GIVE tokens from teammates within the circle, that contributor would receive 10% of total compensation.  According to Zack Anderson, co-founder at Coordinape, GIVE is a powerful reputation marker because of the money attached to it. The GIVE token says a contributor should get some of this funding because of his or her contribution to the project.  When a contributor is sending GIVE around, the individual worker is deciding on whom to compensate and not to compensate, said Zemm, co-founder of Coordinape. The contributor’s job, in addition to working on the project, is deciding who, from their experience, deserves to get those gifts.  Conversations on compensation  The idea underpinning Coordinape’s Gift Circle is that a group of contributors doing the work is going to know compensation better than one individual at the top. And while the gift giving ceremony may reward those who are most visible or outspoken with their work efforts, the Gift Circle prompts conversations about who deserves what, which “is a lot more valuable than the allocation,” said Anderson.  Questions of “what is valuable?” and “how are you performing, according to my expectations?” naturally arise when contributors are strategizing about their GIVE allocation in a gift circle.  Coordinape is attempting to create more clear pathways for conversations centered around compensation to play out. By having these conversations, a contributor can discuss internally and with peers what significant contribution looks like and whether someone’s work is “actual output or emotion without progress,” according to Anderson.  “How can we make sure that what we say is important and what we say we want to focus on is actually getting focused on?” Anderson said. Coordinape’s answer is the Gift Circle, which “pushes out the decision-making of who should receive what funding down to the edges,” said David Hoffman, co-founder of Bankless Nation.  Coodinape is currently used by roughly 300 DAOs including Bankless, PoolTogether and DAOhaus. BanklessDAO uses Coordinape to distribute 4.5 million BANK, 15% of its total seasonal budget, for contributor rewards.  Circle map  After contributors have sent GIVE to their peers, an interactive map is generated that shows all interactions between members.  Each line in the circle map represents an interaction of GIVE between two contributors. Any member of a circle can see how a given teammate allocated their GIVE to others and see how many GIVE tokens another contributor received, providing a visual representation of how compensation is distributed.  Ultimately, the circle map promotes transparency insofar as it shows how members of a circle perceive where value is created for the community and for each other.  As a result, it becomes easier for contributing workers to understand when their work is going in a direction that’s extremely exciting for their colleagues and when it’s not.  Philosophy of Coordinape  Many projects, teams, companies and DAOs make compensation decisions in a top-down way, creating an adversarial environment between leaders and workers.  A small group of people at the top controlling a large group of people out in the world is a limited way to work, both structurally and cognitively, because when the decision-making power is confined to a small group, there’s only so much that they can do, said Tracheopteryx in a interview with CoinDesk. He stated that this corporate fiction, the dominant scaling technology for human effort in the world today, significantly impairs collective intelligence and obstructs effective human coordination, especially for compensation.  Even if the most benevolent and generous leader is in charge and making decisions, he/she can only be so good at deciding compensation, because deciding “good” compensation requires the consideration of many factors that are beyond the scope of a single individual and a small group of people.  “Good” compensation includes understanding more than just people wanting to be paid a fair amount relative to their peers’ income, feeling seen within the community and experiencing psychological safety.  “There’s a lot of stuff woven into good compensation beyond just the number,” said Tracheopteryx.  The important question for Coordinape is, “Who has the capability to decide who gets what?” Currently, only a small group of people possess this capability and so Coordinape is trying to increase the number of people that possess this capability to decide who gets what.  If decisions around compensation occurred in a fairer and more just way, then “you’ve taken a big chunk out of the problems we have as a culture,” according to Tracheopteryx.  CoVaults  Currently, the extent of Coordinape’s tools is deciding the compensation of the contributors within a circle. The execution of the actual compensation happens off-chain.  Specifically, Coordinape converts the results at the end of the epoch into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file which lists what percentage of GIVE tokens each contributor in the circle received. Users can then export the CSV and use it to process compensation payments off-chain.  However, later this summer Coordinape expects to launch its first smart contract product called CoVaults, which, according to Zemm, is a “custom-built escrow contract that we’ve been developing over the last year that allows people to deposit funds into a vault and manage how those funds get distributed out to a collection of circles.”  If people want to escrow ERC-20 tokens into a vault and have on-chain distribution execute automatically, they can do that now with CoVaults, factory-type contracts that are minted and managed by the owners.  By virtue of distributing on-chain, Coordinape allows contributors to know that resources for a project’s compensation have been placed in the vault and trust that funds will be distributed seamlessly when the epoch is over. Additionally, users of CoVaults have the option to earn yield on deposited funds for payroll through their integration with Yearn Finance.  Emphasizing simplicity, Anderson adds, “With CoVaults, people have a one stop shop because it’s a much more complete user experience where you can come deposit funds, start a circle, run the epoch and disperse the funds seamlessly all in one place.”  According to Tracheopteryx, CoVaults is one important Lego block in the future roadmap to create infrastructure that allows for truly self-sovereign labor.  In face of wicked challenges  “We’re in a critical time on planet Earth right now,” Anderson says. “We are facing a lot of really wicked challenges that require collaboration at a global scale.” Despite being in the clumsy toddler stage where awkwardness persists, DAOs, according to Coordinape, might be one of the solutions that can help. If DAOs are to be successful, a lot of things are needed, and one of them is for people to be rewarded fairly for contributing in them.  Coordinape, in pursuit of making a natural free flow reward system, is trying to create new ways for human beings (or silly apes) to coordinate. Quoting writer William Gibson, Tracheopteryx said, “The future is already here. It’s just not evenly distributed.”  More from Future of Work Week  'We're Freaking DAOing It': The People Who Think DAOs Are the Future of Work  Meet the pioneers who work at decentralized autonomous organizations.

42374364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZHWt,1657036856,Bitmain to Start Selling New Ethereum Mining Rig Model Wednesday,"MIAMI — AntPool, the mining pool affiliated with mining rig giant Bitmain, has invested $10 million to support the Ethereum Classic ecosystem and plans to continue investing more, the pool's CEO, Leon Lv, said at Bitmain's World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) on Tuesday.  While the Ethereum network is working to convert to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, Ethereum Classic is slated to remain proof-of-work (PoW). PoS will drastically change how Ethereum validates blocks, adds them to the blockchain and issues new ether (ETH). In doing so, it will eliminate the need for specialized mining rigs, such as the ones Bitmain makes.  Ethereum Classic, however, will continue to mine its native ETC cryptocurrency using these rigs.  ""Our goal here is not you make the one stronger than another one [ETC vs ETH]. Our purpose is just to simply support PoW because we think pow is better than PoS,"" Lv told CoinDesk on the sidelines of the conference.  The initial $10 million investment will go to the development and exploration of applications of the Ethereum Classic mainnet, as to promote the overall performance of the network.  The funds have been earmarked in a separate wallet and AntPool hopes to bring together a ""community"" to decide on how to best invest them, Lv told CoinDesk at the sidelines of the conference. That could take the form of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) or an informal community with open participation, Lv said.  While Bitmain and AntPool are primarily focused on bitcoin, this PoW community will become one of AntPool's core businesses over the next few years, the CEO said.  Bitmain started selling its latest Ethereum mining model (the Antminer E9) earlier in July. The mining rig manufacturer also announced at the World Digital Mining Summit in Miami that it will be accepting payments in ETC for all of its Antminer models.  AntPool is the third-biggest bitcoin mining pool according to data from BTC.com, close after F2Pool.  UPDATE (July 27, 15:46 UTC): Adds quotes from Lv and information about AntPool's market share.

This adds to a previous loan of $123.5 million, and the new $50 million in borrowings accrues interest at 11.5% and matures on Dec. 1, 2024, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. TeraWulf is one of the most indebted publicly listed miners compared with its equity, data analyzed by CoinDesk has shown.  Bitcoin miners have seen their revenues dwindle as the price of crypto has lost about half of its value this year, with some resorting to selling long-held bitcoin tokens to pay their debts and operating costs.  TeraWulf wants to not only be ""resilient and securely positioned,"" but also in position to ""take advantage of certain value-creating opportunities that might otherwise not be available during more healthy markets,"" Chairman and CEO Paul Prager said in a Tuesday press release.  Maryland-based TeraWulf has received its first batch of 3,000 Bitmain Antminer S19 XP mining rigs for its Lake Mariner facility in upstate New York, according to the press release. The miner expects this batch to be running by August, adding to the 3,300 that are now operating at that mine.  Upon completion of work at Lake Mariner, the company expects to have 50 megawatts of capacity there. The Nautilus Cryptomine facility in Pennsylvania remains on track to be operational in the third quarter.  TeraWulf has put down $60 million in deposits for mining rigs, which it can use to buy monthly batches of machines at the then-current prices, the press release added.

In that regard, miners sought to establish new firms in Texas and proceed with the minting process. Furthermore, the state has affordable energy rates, favoring mining activities.

Hence, mining in the region could promote the application of digital coins. The adoption of cryptocurrencies became more audible after launching two laws dubbed H.B. 1576 and H.B. 4474.

The company said proceeds from the sales were mainly used for payments toward ASIC servers, capital investments in additional data-center capacity and debt repayments. Core said it will continue to sell self-mined bitcoins to pay operating expenses, fund growth, retire debt and maintain liquidity.  “We are working to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance liquidity to meet this challenging environment, and continue to believe that we will be operating in excess of 30 EH/s in our data centers by year-end 2022,” CEO Mike Levitt said in a statement. “We remain focused on executing our plan, while taking advantage of distressed opportunities that may arise.”  Core Scientific’s operations produced 1,106 bitcoins in June, about 36.9 bitcoins a day, slightly higher than in May. Bitcoin production was helped by server deployments in June, but production advances were limited by a “substantial increase in curtailment activity,” Core said in its update. Daily production rose by about 14% during the month.  The company expects to release second-quarter earnings on Aug. 11.

42374373,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZHgx,1657030851,First Mover Americas: BTC Stabilizes as Fresh Regulatory Developments Surface in Europe,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: The crypto market appears to have stabilized, with altcoins taking the lead on Tuesday. Crypto lender Nexo is set to take over its troubled Singaporean rival Vauld.  Market Moves: The Bank of England’s has called for “enhanced regulation” of the crypto asset market to mitigate against potential risks.  Price point  Crypto markets appeared to stabilize on Tuesday even as the fallout continued from June's price plunge – with fresh developments on the regulatory front and an agreement by the crypto lender Nexo to take over its troubled Singaporean rival Vauld.  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 1.2% on the day while U.S. index futures and European equities fell as fears of an impending recession continued. The euro fell to a 20-year low against the dollar.  Some altcoins were outperforming BTC on Tuesday, with Cosmos's ATOM leading the way, up 7.3%. Polygon’s MATIC followed with a 6.1% increase on the day.  Meanwhile, concerns over cryptocurrency regulation in Europe are progressing.  On Monday, European lawmakers said that non-fungible token (NFT) trading platforms should be made subject to European Union anti-money laundering (AML) laws. The amendment is part of a larger discussion of proposals submitted by European lawmakers.  In the U.K, the government has announced it is seeking views from investors, professionals and companies on taxation of decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. According to the statement, the government wants to gather evidence on the taxation of crypto-asset loans and staking.  In other news, Samir Shah, previously JPMorgan’s (JPM) head of asset management sales, left the bank to take up the position of chief operating officer at cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Pantera Capital. In early April, Pantera announced plans to close a blockchain fund with about $1.3 billion in committed capital.  The London-based crypto lender Nexo announced it has signed a term sheet with Singapore-based Vauld. Pending due diligence, Nexo will acquire up to 100% of the troubled firm. Nexo aims to use the acquisition to accelerate its presence in Asia.  Market moves  By Camomile Shumba  The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee called for “enhanced regulation” of the crypto asset market to mitigate against potential risks.  Noting recent market turmoil, the committee said crypto assets did not yet pose a threat to the wider financial system. They might, however, in the future as they become more integrated into mainstream finance, according to meeting summary notes published Tuesday. The committee focuses on the central bank's role in maintaining financial stability.  The collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin in May and crypto lenders including Celsius and Babel Finance freezing withdrawals this month, have focused regulators’ attention on the digital asset industry. That’s on top of more than $2 trillion of market capitalization being wiped out over a period of months.  “This underscored the need for enhanced regulatory and law enforcement frameworks to address developments in crypto asset markets and activities,” the bank said in its quarterly ""Financial Stability"" report.  The Treasury has already announced that the Bank of England is looking into bringing systemic stablecoins into its Special Administration Regime, meaning the central bank would regulate stablecoins that are connected with the wider financial system. A systemic stablecoin backed by a deposit with a commercial bank would introduce “undesirable financial stability risk,” according to the report.

V has been terminated, the firms announced Tuesday.  The closing conditions agreed upon when the merger was proposed in March last year have not been met, the companies said.  When first agreed, the merger was set to form a combined entity worth $10.4 billion, reflecting an implied enterprise value for eToro of about $9.6 billion.  According to Betsy Cohen, chairman of Fintech V, ""The transaction has been rendered impracticable due to circumstances outside of either party's control.""  As the decision was taken mutually, neither party is required to pay a termination fee.  While SPAC deals have been a popular way for crypto companies to access public stock markets in recent years, their attraction has cooled during the downturn in the crypto markets. Media outlet Forbes had planned to go public through a $630 million SPAC deal with Hong Kong-based Magnum Opus Acquisition Ltd. (OPA), but this was scrapped in late May.  ""While this may not be the outcome that we hoped for when we started this process, eToro’s underlying business remains healthy, our balance sheet is strong and will continue to balance future growth with profitability,"" eToro CEO Yoni Assia said in the statement.

42374363,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZHaf,1657021682,Bank of England Panel Calls for Enhanced Crypto Regulation to Limit Contagion,"The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee called for “enhanced regulation” of the crypto asset market to mitigate against potential risks.  Noting recent market turmoil, the committee said crypto assets don't pose a threat to the wider financial system yet, but they might in the future as they become more integrated into mainstream finance, according to meeting summary notes published Tuesday. The committee focuses on the central bank's role in maintaining financial stability.  The collapse of Terra’s stablecoin in May and crypto lenders including Celsius Network and Babel Finance freezing withdrawals last month have prompted regulators to focus attention on the digital asset industry. That’s not to mention the more than $2 trillion of market cap being wiped out over a period of months.  “This underscored the need for enhanced regulatory and law enforcement frameworks to address developments in crypto asset markets and activities,” the bank said in its quarterly Financial Stability Report.  The Treasury has already announced that the Bank of England is looking into bringing systemic stablecoins into its ""special administration regime,"" meaning the central bank would regulate stablecoins that are connected with the wider financial system. A systemic stablecoin backed by a deposit with a commercial bank would introduce “undesirable financial stability risk,” according to the report.  The Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. 's financial industry regulator, said it will consider the collapse of Terra’s coins when constructing new rules for the industry.  In April, the Treasury announced that it planned to set up a crypto regime and bring stablecoins under existing payments regulations.  The U.K. is not alone in calling for policies to guard against the financial stability risks crypto assets could have. The European Systemic Risk Board, which is responsible for ensuring the stability of the financial system in the European Union, said recently it wanted to set standards with regulators around the world to mitigate against crypto assets that could have an impact on the financial system.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/05/bank-of-england-committee-calls-for-enhanced-crypto-regulation-to-limit-contagion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9e1ed7accff01d8c1f91be668540279602aa872-3927x2945.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374362,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZHZP,1656980457,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Rebounds Past $20K; China’s Blockchain Revolution Is Missing On-Chain Data,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin gains ground, hovering just above $20K.  Insights: China's blockchain revolution may not be so revolutionary.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

Bitcoin crept back over the $20,000 threshold that has been a psychological observation point since the start of the summer for investors gauging the length of the current bear market. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,300, up 5% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin plummeted below $19,000 at one point last week before regaining ground during a Friday rally.  Ether rose even more in Monday trading along with several other major altcoins as investors seemed more receptive to risk. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was changing hands at more than $1,150, a nearly 8% gain over the previous day. Among other major cryptos, SOL and SAND jumped more than 9% and 8%, respectively.  Still, the crypto Fear & Greed Index remained wedged in extreme fear territory as the industry absorbed its latest body blows, and analysts remained downcast about prices for at least the near-term, short of convincing evidence that inflation is under control and the global economy will not fall into recession. Bitcoin and ether are off more than 5% and 6% from their highs early last week, and most other cryptos are also well in the red over the same period.  ""Bitcoin has been under even pressure for almost all last week,"" FxPro Senior Market Analyst Alex Kuptsikevich wrote in an email. ""A brief bounce at the beginning of the day on July 1 was more likely due to emotional excitement from the start of a new period (month, quarter, half-year) rather than fundamental changes in the situation.""  Ether price weakness  ETH’s price weakness continues as The Merge, which will see the network change from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake protocol, fast approaches. Trading was light as the U.S. celebrated its Independence Day. U.S. equity markets were closed in observance of the holiday, but European indexes were up with the Stoxx Europe 600 rising 0.5% on Monday.  To be sure, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently called the crypto winter a good time to buy bitcoin for investors who can wait for the next bull market. And a survey from Mastercard (MA) reported that over 51% of Latin Americans made at least one transaction with cryptocurrencies between March and April of this year.  But industry-wide cascade of bad news continued with crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital filing for bankruptcy late Friday after weeks of speculation that it was functionally insolvent; American-Israeli crypto lender, Celsuis, laying off some 150 employees over the weekend as it battles a financial crisis that saw it halt customer withdrawals last month; crypto lending platform CoinLoan limiting the size of withdrawals; and another crypto lender, Singapore-based Vauld, suspending all withdrawals, trading and deposits on its platform as it looks at restructuring options.  Troubled economic backdrop  Kuptsikevich noted the troubled economic backdrop that is likely to continue bedeviling crypto markets.  ""The global picture remains bearish as stock markets show no glimpses of tightening financial conditions by central banks,"" Kuptsikevich wrote. ""On the weekly charts, BTCUSD remains below the 200-week average, having failed a timid attempt to climb higher last week.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,825 +1%  DJIA: 31,097 +1%  Nasdaq: 11,127 +0.9%  Gold: $1,808 +.02%  Insights  China's Blockchain Revolution May Be Falling Short  Blockchain technology is a national priority for Beijing, having been name-checked in 2019 by People’s Republic of China President Xi Jinping as an important opportunity that needs to be seized, and mentioned as a key technological pillar of China’s five-year policy plan in 2021.  “We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies,” Xi has been quoted as saying, outlining the government’s policy to integrate the technology into the IT fabric of the bureaucracy at large.  And with this came the Blockchain Service Network (BSN), a state-backed infrastructure program that would allow enterprise developers to assemble and develop code to build blockchain-based applications with relative ease.  Of course, this isn’t real blockchain per se. It’s a neutered version of that called ""permissioned blockchain."" No corporation or government, in China or elsewhere, wants their key data to be in a decentralized state they can’t control.  As the South China Morning Post reported last week, China is home to nearly 1,800 blockchain services companies that purport to be integrated into most parts of the economy and bureaucracy.  Companies are unconvinced  There’s a problem, though: Outside of China, companies have realized that enterprise blockchain is pretty useless. As CoinDesk reported in early 2021, IBM (IBM), which is effectively synonymous with enterprise computing, has dismantled its blockchain team. Shortly after, Microsoft (MSFT) discontinued its Blockchain service on Azure cloud. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which once touted blockchain as part of a ""smarter era of food safety,"" has abandoned the initiative.  Technology market research firm Gartner noted in its hype cycle forecast for 2021 that “successful permissioned enterprise blockchain projects are scarce.”  While things like decentralized finance, payments, and tokenization all have some appeal, Gartner said, enterprise blockchain is stuck because “most users are stuck trying to align use cases to the technology.”  “The value of permissioned blockchain is hard to understand since it does not implement the most revolutionary aspect of public blockchains – i.e., trust minimization and elimination of central authority, achieved via decentralized consensus,” Gartner wrote in another post on the topic.  Incentives  In China’s case, companies are doubling down on blockchain because of the many incentives available, such as a $140 million subsidy fund in Guangzhou – the actual utility of the technology be damned. If the government thinks the technology will help its economic ambitions and wants to throw money at it, companies will happily oblige and play along.  This is especially true if they can leverage this with investors to juice a funding round. At one time, China was home to nearly 35,000 blockchain companies, according to publicly available corporate registration data. Of course many were firms jumping in by adding blockchain to their name to access development subsidies, as well as out-and-out frauds. That number, according to SCMP’s report, is down to around 1,800, so the herd has been thinned.  Still, it's questionable what exactly these 1,800 companies are doing. On-chain data is key to verifying any claims involving blockchain. But with these permissioned chains, it's impossible to use a block explorer to inspect the data and verify claims of data volume, something that’s a central tenant for the “trust machine” that is blockchain.
