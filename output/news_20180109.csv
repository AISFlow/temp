A Jan. 8 report by Yonhap News states that representatives from the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC), as well as those from the relevant agencies in Japan and China, met last month to discuss the oversight of cryptocurrency investment.  FSC chairman Choi Jong-ku, according to the source, told reporters that the countries plan to cooperate in their efforts to curb speculative investing. Jong-ku reportedly called investing in cryptocurrencies ""irrational,"" going on to say:  ""[A] fever of speculative investment in cryptocurrencies is ongoing … however, cryptocurrencies are unable to play a role as a means of payment.""  The report follows a statement by the country's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and Financial Intelligence Unit, which outlined how the two bodies have begun inspecting six banks to ensure they are in compliance with newly-implemented anti-money laundering regulations.  The banks in question have ties to the country's bitcoin exchange ecosystem, which in recent months has seen elevated trading volumes and prices trading at high premiums compared to other marketplaces around the world. South Korean officials have expressed concern about price speculation around cryptocurrencies in the past.  And in what is perhaps a sign of the speculative boom taking place in the country, data site CoinMarketCap excluded three Korean exchanges earlier this week due to the price differences.

42400846,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8dj,1515531637,Bitcoin ETF Proposals Withdrawn After SEC Pushback,"UPDATE (10th January 9:57 a.m. EST): VanEck and First Trust Advisors LP have also withdrawn their efforts to create bitcoin-tied ETFs, according to public filings.      Several firms seeking to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to bitcoin have withdrawn their filings at the request of officials from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Direxion Shares ETF Trust  , Exchange Listed Funds Trust and ProShares Trust all filed to create exchange-traded products in the past month. Yet notably, none of the proposed offerings would have held bitcoin directly – rather, their price movements would have been driven by changes in the still-nascent market for bitcoin futures.  In letters dated Jan. 8, Direxion and ELF withdrew their requests, citing feedback from the SEC.  As Angela Brickl, Direxion's secretary, wrote:  ""On a call with the Staff on January 5, 2018, the Staff expressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation of the underlying instruments in which the Fund intends to primarily invest and requested that the Trust withdraw the Amendment until such time as these concerns are resolved. In response to the Staff's request, the Trust respectfully requests withdrawal of the Amendment.""  ProShares' letter, dated Jan. 9, includes similar language. ""This request for withdrawal is being made in response to a request from the Staff,"" Richard Morris, general counsel and secretary for ProShares, wrote.  The timing of these withdrawals is notable, given that the SEC just released two other rule change proposals which could allow for a bitcoin ETF last week. Those proposals, filed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe), would exempt its proposed ETFs from several market manipulation rules which govern traditional assets. The SEC is seeking public input on the proposals.  Both of the proposed rule changes note that bitcoin does not behave like traditional assets.  While the SEC has released the Cboe proposals for public comment, it has a longer history of pressing for bitcoin ETF proposal withdrawals. Several organizations killed their ETF efforts last year at the request of the agency – at the same time, at least two of these proposals were denied because bitcoin futures contracts did not exist at the time.

42428415,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7kFh,1515528257,Smart Contracts Proposal MAST Inches Closer to Bitcoin's Code,"A long-standing proposal to bring ""smarter"" smart contracts to bitcoin's main net has just taken one step closer to implementation.  Developers have submitted a pull request for Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), marking the first time this smart contracts proposal has been the subject of a pull request seeking its integration into bitcoin's code.  The pull request combines pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) with MERKLE-BRANCH-VERIFY, allowing users to define how payments would occur. As previously reported by CoinDesk, these two features, combined with a third Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) called ""Tail Call Execution Semantics,"" would allow users to create private smart contracts on the bitcoin network.  These private smart contracts would allow users to define their own criteria by which a payment would process, enabling multiple factors to be considered by the program. The smart contracts would then execute on their own.  The combination of BIPs would also allow for these smart contracts to be stored in a compact manner on the actual bitcoin blockchain, meaning they would not take up a large amount of block space, or the amount of data that can be stored within each block of transactions.  If developers and the broader bitcoin community approve of the change, it could be added to bitcoin by way of a soft fork.

In an official announcementhttps://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/Press_center/KODAK_and_WENN_Digital_Partner_to_Launch_Major_Blockchain_Initiative_and_Cryptocurrency/default.htm, Kodak said the cryptocurrency would underpin ""an encrypted, digital ledger of rights ownership for photographers."" Kodak is working with a company called WENN Digital on the initiative.  The idea is that photographers could use Kodak's forthcoming blockchain to register works, with ""KODAKCoin"" functioning as a medium of exchange on the platform. Users can receive payment in the cryptocurrency as well as pay for rights, according to the company.  The unveiling marks the first time Kodak has revealed its interest in the technology. The company is perhaps best known for its photography-related products, though a bankruptcy and subsequent recovery in 2013 led the firm to focus more actively on printing and digital film.  Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke said in a statement:  ""For many in the tech industry, 'blockchain' and 'cryptocurrency' are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it's used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem. Kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.""  It's not clear at this time how much Kodak intends to seek through the ICO, but the company said that the token sale – set for Jan. 31 – will be open to accredited investors from countries including the U.S. and Canada.  ""This initial Coin Offering is issued under SEC guidelines as a security token under Regulation 506 (c) as an exempt offering,"" Kodak said.  Market data suggests that, at the very least, Kodak is enjoying a bit of an investor windfall as a result of its announcement. As of press time, shares for Kodak are up roughly 37 percent for the day, having risen from an opening of $3.10 to as high as $5.50 before settling down around $4.30, according to Google data.

Public records show that on Jan. 3, state senator Carol Blood submitted three proposed laws to the Nebraska Legislature, one of which would amend the state's money-laundering statutes to account for cryptocurrencies while the other two focus on blockchain applications more broadly.  One of the bills – echoing efforts in other U.S. states – would allow for the tech's use for notarization and the establishment of a document's provenance. If passed, the measure would ""authorize and define smart contracts...[and] authorize use of distributed ledger technology in the Electronic Notary Public Act and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.""  And following in the footsteps of Nevada, one of Blood's proposed bills would ""prohibit cities and villages and counties from taxing or otherwise regulating the use of distributed ledger technology."" A similar measure was signed into law last summer, which prevents local jurisdictions from taxing the use of smart contracts as well as requiring a license to use the tech in the first place.  Whether lawmakers in Nebraska will embrace the proposed laws remains to be seen. According to the Nebraska legislature's official website, the bills in question have been referred to their respective committees for further deliberation, though no hearing dates have yet to be scheduled.

That the regulator would act swiftly to issue the cease-and-desist notice is perhaps unsurprising, given moves by agencies in other parts of the world to quash ICOs ahead of their launch. SC said in its Jan. 5 statement that it had noticed an uptick of ICO promotion within Malaysia, including solicitations of elderly citizens.  The SC added that it would work with other bodies, including Malaysia's central bank, on the ICO issue.

In October, Dimon said he was done talking about bitcoin following his controversial comment. Yet, soon after he opined that bitcoin buyers will ""pay the price"" if they are ""stupid enough to buy it.""  While Dimon is still not interested in the subject of bitcoin, he had praise for blockchain technology.  The CEO told Fox Business today, ""The blockchain is real.

The turn-key software provider announced it had raised $10 million more than projected on sales of its MOBI token, which in turn is based on the Stellar network. After it launches, Mobius plans to develop its platform as a facilitator for smart contract-based micropayments.  In a press release, the company noted that 32,000 participants registered for the presale, which took place through the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018. The full initial coin offering (ICO) will launch on Jan. 18, with the company expecting to sell some 7.5 million tokens.  The company will limit each potential buyer to 25,000 tokens ""to ensure a decentralized token distribution with as many people participating as possible,"" according to the release. Furthermore, buyers will only be able to purchase MOBI tokens using Stellar's lumen cryptocurrency.  Mobius chief executive David Gobaud said:  “The token purchases will help us fulfill our mission of connecting the existing internet and billions of people and devices around the world.”  According to its website, Mobius will use smart contracts to facilitate real-time machine-to-machine micropayments, among other uses. According to a provided example, if a machine, or part of a machine breaks, a computer would automatically be able to bid for a replacement part and arrange for its delivery.  While the ethereum network has been more popular with companies launching token sales, some companies have recently looked to the Stellar network instead.

42428425,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7kVh,1515502819,Ethereum Price Highs Overshadow New Wave of Tech Issues,"The price of ether is shattering all-time highs.  Rising to more than $1,000 for the first time ever last week, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed its place as the second-largest blockchain by total value, days after being temporarily surpassed by Ripple's XRP token. However, as with that controversial market move, the massive uptick in value bears a deeper look from more novice or potential investors.  Indeed, ether's price rise has masked a wave of technical problems – issues that went so far as to cause the cryptocurrency to be taken off a major exchange this weekend. Largely discussed on internal developer channels, reports of the problems to the public have been unusually quiet, scarcely touching Reddit, Twitter and other active ethereum forums.  But what may be most of note is not the scant reaction, but the fairly fundamental nature of the issues, as most relate directly to the most basic operations of blockchains.  For one, a glitch in the software that determines how much a transaction should cost to send – named the ""gas oracle"" – has caused a massive inflation in user fees, with some paying far higher than is necessary for a transactions to go through.  If this seems somewhat unwelcoming to newcomers, it's met by other issues. In another case, the computers that run ethereum are struggling to download a full history of its transactions.  More forward-looking projects are showing signs of strain also. The test network for Casper, ethereum's long-awaited ecologically friendly alternative to proof-of-work, and arguably a core tenet of its value proposition, is currently splitting into incompatible forks.  In a reminder for those eager to hit it big on crypto, ethereum heavyweight Vlad Zamfir wrote in response to the issues:  ""(Ethereum is) still not safe or scalable.""  As such, the comments may best serve as a note of caution, one that hints at the current state of ethereum and suggests the work-in-progress nature of cryptocurrencies more broadly.  Inflated transaction costs  Perhaps the most concerning issue is within ethereum's algorithm to estimate transaction costs – leading users of wallets and exchanges to overpay for transactions by up to 70% percent.  Speaking to CoinDesk, ethereum developer Nick Johnson explained that this is due to a glitch in ethereum's internal, automatic gas pricing function.  While the code had sustained the spike in transactions caused by the popular CryptoKitties app and the recent popularity of initial coin offerings, recently ""something odd has been happening with the estimated gas price,"" Johnson told CoinDesk.  Johnson explained that the gas oracle – today used by popular wallets such as MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Shapeshift, and others – calculates transactions costs for users based on fees paid in the most recent ethereum transactions.  However, Johnson said in an email, ""while it's still possible to transact on the network at a fairly low price, the oracle started returning increasingly high estimates.""  According to Johnson, the core issue seems to be that some users were simply paying more to use the blockchain, boosting the gas oracle calculation.  Griff Green, founder of decentralized charity Giveth, told CoinDesk he noticed the unusually high costs and took to Twitter to urge users to manually calculate the correct transaction fees.  Green praised Bittrex for flagging the issue by preventing new ether and asset deposit address generation – and while other major exchanges and wallets have yet to respond, Green told CoinDesk that he expects ethereum developers to release a new algorithm soon.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This is just some random tech shit that devs have to deal with to keep the network alive.""  Blockchain syncing issues  Adding to this, developers have been struggling to get network nodes to sync to the blockchain. Those that try either fail, or are faced with a long wait.  Stepping back, any new node that wishes to mine ether or run the blockchain as part of its own wallet is faced with this problem. And while the issue has circulating for some time, it has worsened in recent weeks.  According to Peter Pratscher, who runs the mining pool Bitfly, it's down to a failure of a function called ""warp sync"" as a result of the current size of the ethereum state – a figure that equates to a current sum of all of ethereum's computation, and is stored by all nodes.  Pratscher said that because of the failure of this function, ""new nodes will need to do a traditional sync of the ethereum blockchain, which requires quite some time (in the range of several days).""  Discussions are currently underway on how to reduce the size of the ethereum state, including the idea of deleting what is known as ""dust accounts"" – empty addresses that have been inactive for a long time.  Pratscher concluded:  ""I hope that the dev teams will get ahead of the issue and provide some improvements in this regards.""  Testnet setbacks  While a smaller issue in comparison, largely because it doesn't impact the live ethereum network, the problems facing the Casper test network also provide evidence of the early-stage nature of ethereum as a technology.  Perhaps due to the pressure felt for ethereum's need to scale, Casper development efforts have surged in recent months, however, the nascent test net is currently splintered, and nodes cannot connect to the blockchain.  As a result, the test network, which was hoped to renew a source of ""fun"" in testing environments, has largely fallen silent.  Speaking to CoinDesk, prominent Casper developer Karl Floersch asserted that this has nothing to do with the Casper code itself, which is ""working exactly as expected with no hiccups.""  Still, given the new nature of the testnet, developers have been quick to suggest a range of possible issues and fixes that could once again see a jumpstart in activity.

42428435,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7klh,1515498309,Below $15K: Bitcoin Plays Defense Amid Bear Move,"Bitcoin remains on the defensive, despite yesterday's sharp recovery from $14,000 levels.  Data source OnChainFX indicates the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 4.54 percent in the last 24 hours. As of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index is at $14,750 levels.  The BPI fell to a low of $13,957.19 at 15:14 UTC yesterday, reportedly due to a sell-off triggered by price data site CoinMarketCap's unannounced decision to exclude three Korean exchanges from its averages.  However, bitcoin (BTC) was already on the back foot, possibly due to fears of China crackdown on the bitcoin mining industry in the country.  The BPI's failure to hold above $15,000 today only underscores the bearish undertone in BTC. Further, the technical charts indicate BTC is still not completely out of the woods.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Yesterday's recovery from the low of $14,000 ran out of steam at a high of $15,384. The retreat to sub-$15,000 levels indicates an increased risk of a downside break of the bear flag/rising wedge pattern.  The 50-day moving average (MA) is sloping upwards in favor of the bulls and could offer support at $14,030 levels.  The bulls have failed to capitalize on a favorable setup. Despite the higher low pattern (marked by circles) along the 50-day MA and a higher high pattern, prices have dropped to sub-$15,000 levels. The price action now indicates the bear grip is strengthening.  An argument is being put forward on social media that an inverse head and shoulder pattern could be in the making. While that is true, it is not necessarily good news, as the inverse head and shoulder is a bullish reversal pattern (that works well at the bottom of the downtrend). An inverse head and shoulders at the top usually works as a bull trap.  View  A close (as per UTC) below $14,700 (flag/rising wedge support) would mean the rally from the Dec. 22 low of $10,400 has ended. Prices could then breach support at $12,500 (Dec. 30 low) and slide towards $10,400-$10,000.  In the larger scheme of things, a break below $8,000 (support of the trend line sloping upwards from Sep. 15 low and Nov. 12 low) would be a cause of worry for the bulls.  Bullish scenario: A rebound from the 50-day MA, followed by a close above $16,000 would increase the odds of an upside break of the rising wedge.

42428422,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7kPh,1515492021,Bank of Israel: Cryptocurrencies Are Assets Not Currencies,"Israel's central bank has said that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are more an asset than a currency.  Addressing a meeting of the Knesset Finance Committee yesterday, Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg, deputy governor of the Bank of Israel, said, ""Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies are not a currency, and are not considered foreign currency.""  Defining the Bank of Israel's position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, she said that digital currencies should instead be viewed as a ""financial asset"" and that bitcoin does not fit the central bank's legal definition of currency.  Baudot-Trajtenberg also warned that that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not backed by official bodies like central banks or governments, and that investors and users should be aware of the risks, including a high level of volatility that might lead to sudden drop in value.  Further citing possible compliance risks for banks, she continued to say that the anonymous nature of virtual currencies leads to the possibility of their use in money laundering and financial crimes. Banks, she said, need to take necessary measures to combat fraudulent activities involving cryptocurrencies.  The Bank of Israel's banking supervision department has formed an internal team to look into such risks, the statement indicates.  However, cryptocurrency technology poses problems for the authorities when it comes to designing regulations, she said, stating.  ""Our assessment is that ... there is a real difficulty in issuing sweeping guidelines to the system regarding the proper way to estimate, manage, and monitor the risks inherent in such activity,"" the deputy governor added.  The new comes a month after Israeli financial watchdog – the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) – said that it is seeking to ban any company that has a major involvement in bitcoin trading from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  In past months, a number of other central banks and financial regulators have issued warnings as the prices of cryptocurrencies have soared to record levels. Countries including the U.K., India, Russia and more have recently sounded the alarm over the perceived risks of investing in bitcoin.

42428427,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7kXh,1515488439,Bitcoin Mining Wastes Energy? What If That's Good?,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.        No one seems to know what assumptions to use. Depending on what efficiency ratios we assume for currently operating ASIC mining rigs, they're either consuming 35 terawatt-hours per year, the equivalent of Denmark, or something far less, closer perhaps to Bolivia. The stinginess of mining pools to provide information about their operations can be partly blamed for this.      We also don't know how much of mining runs on low-carbon energy, such as the mining farms that use geothermal energy in Iceland or hydropower in Washington State. Surely that matters.      And then there’s the ""compared to what?"" question.    Gas-guzzling banks    If bitcoin is to be assessed as an alternative to fiat currencies, banks and traditional payment systems, then we must consider the costs of securing those systems – the physical bank branches, the armored cars, the staff employed in fraud detection, and so forth.      While only a portion of those legacy costs goes to energy consumption, savings from foregoing those costs could be put toward constructive uses for humankind, such as building more renewable energy sources.      But then, what metric do we use to compare bitcoin to banks? Bitcoin is still a pipsqueak compared with the total value of fiat transactions, which still means its energy consumption is proportionately very high. Motherboard recently claimed that one bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as the average house does in a week.      Still, we all know that transaction growth on the network has slowed due to congestion and a fixed block size. So, as rising bitcoin prices keep enticing miners to add more hashing power, the numerator is increasing while the denominator stays steady, resulting in a massive surge in per-transaction electricity.      And while that's hardly a shining endorsement for bitcoin, it's less of a critique of its energy efficiency than of its scaling challenges.    Things change    Which brings me to an even bigger gripe I have with the ill-defined bitcoin energy debate, which is that too many people assume that technology remains static, perhaps without thinking.      That's a crazy assumption for an industry in which intense competition for block rewards and an open-source developer pool come together in a dynamic cauldron of development. Technological advances in both cryptocurrencies and energy are changing more rapidly than any of us can keep up with. We must keep that in mind.      On that note, point number one: Lightning is coming. While its payment channels solution isn't specifically aimed at energy efficiency, if we think about the cost issue as a per-transaction metric, it could help making bitcoin less damaging to the environment – at least when assessed relative to its utility as a payments service.      Whether Lightning succeeds in encouraging more people to use bitcoin for small transactions, rather than hoarding it to capture price gains, remains to be seen. But if you compare what it costs to run the tiny amount of computer processing power to send peer-to-peer payments over a network of Lightning channels against those of the banking and infrastructure needed to process card payments over the Visa network, this future model for bitcoin starts to look far more efficient.      Point number two comes via Coin Center's Peter Van Valkenburgh, who astutely argued that the more miners are enticed to compete for bitcoin – again, a function of its rising price – the more they are encouraged to seek ever-more efficient sources of power to boost margins and secure an advantage over others.      With the price of solar and wind energy in some places now at 2 cents per KwH or lower, that search will increasingly lead them in the direction of renewable sources.      Where the argument gets really interesting is when we assume that a rising bitcoin price will drive demand for hashing power so high that the network, as some alarmists say, will consume more power than the U.S. by 2019.    Bitcoin saves humanity?    If that happens, then it should not only incentivize miners to seek low-cost renewable energy, but also drive energy firms to work hard at developing solutions for them, with spillover benefits for the rest of the world.      In other words, the incentives that bitcoin demand puts in place could not only drive efficiency and green energy solutions in the crypto world but help to spur them in the wider economy too.      In retrospect, Van Valkenburgh's point should have been blindingly obvious to all familiar with how Moore's Law and the incentives of economic competition have driven technology toward greater efficiency for the past 50 years.      It wasn't obvious because, as I mentioned, people tend to think in terms of a stasis. They fail to see the dynamic feedback loops generated by rapidly changing technologies such as bitcoin.      This, I think is the most important lesson from the many debates that roil the bitcoin community.      In an industry where technological change – rapid, relentless technological change – is the only constant, any debate about the future must acknowledge it as a variable.

42428432,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7kjh,1515483013,Nvidia Curbs Data Center GPU Use – But Crypto Miners Are Excluded,"GPU maker Nvidia has tweaked its software license agreement to limit the use of its products by data centers – unless they're mining cryptocurrencies.  An update to the company's license agreement emphasizes that the drivers which allow computers to work with the GeForce or Titan chips cannot be used in data centers unless they are being used for ""blockchain processing"" tasks.  It states:  ""No Datacenter Deployment. The [software] is not licensed for datacenter deployment, except that blockchain processing in a datacenter is permitted.""  That phrase is a stand-in for the more commonly used term ""mining"", or the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain. Nvidia's graphics card products – along with those from rival chip maker AMD – have been highly sought by miners in recent months, as previously reported.  The boost in demand has been significant for chip manufacturers, with Nvidia, in particular, posting $2.23 billion in revenue after the second quarter in 2017. That marked a 56% jump from the previous year, with the company seeing $280 million more in profits than was projected during that time period.  Without permission from the manufacturer, companies must use Nvidia's more expensive enterprise-level products for other data center applications like running artificial intelligence tests. The price gap is significant - while a GeForce card is in the $700s range, the enterprise-level product, the Tesla V100, runs for just under $10,000.  According to The Register, a Nvidia spokesperson pointed out that the GeForce and Titan GPUs were designed for individual customers, not for large companies to use in a constantly-operating data center.

42428423,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7kTh,1515474258,Big Pharma Seeks DLT Solution for Drug Costs,"What if blockchain could be used to actually save lives?  That's the thinking ongoing at pharmaceutical heavyweights Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi. The three companies – typically black boxes when it comes to their work – are now eyeing blockchain as a means of streamlining the process of developing and testing new drugs. Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk, representatives from the companies shed light on how they are combining efforts to develop a blockchain framework that can address current logjams in the clinical trials process.  But while it might seem strange that these fierce competitors are interested in working together, according to Jaydev Thakkar, product innovation lead for digital health at Amgen, there is growing momentum to collaborate on foundational issues of industry-wide importance.  Thakkar said:  ""[The focus is] to help each other so that running the engine of clinical research is as optimized as possible for each of us.""  In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have been put under more pressure to bring new, more personalized drugs to market faster and at more affordable prices and in a personalized fashion.  But because of government regulations, the growing complexity of the studies undertaken and stringent standards, the current research and development process is highly cumbersome – with studies typically lasting between six and seven years. And about 90 percent of the drugs that enter clinical testing fail, according to Ken Getz of the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University, making the average cost of successfully developing a single drug about $2.6 billion.  ""The likelihood of recouping that $2.6 billion investment is much lower today than it was five years ago,"" Getz said.  Yet, Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi believe blockchain can help.  ""This is about execution and operations models,"" said Munther Baara, senior director of development business technology at Pfizer. ""It's all about collaboration.""  All about data  Ultimately, reducing the length and cost of clinical trials and improving their success rate is dependent on one thing in particular: improved data management and movement.  On that front, the pharmaceutical industry faces the same problem as does the rest of the U.S. healthcare system, the fact that most data is stored in proprietary data silos with limited interoperability and transferability.  ""The issue that we all struggle with in pharma is ... the fact that data is fragmented. If you see five different physicians, you end up with data stored in five different systems,"" said Baara.  And for pharma, the limited access to and portability of patient data means that locating and recruiting individuals who meet the eligibility criteria for a given trial is challenging.  The current recruiting process involves hiring research organizations and investigators to beat the bushes, so to speak, by visiting physicians’ offices to find patients who qualify and are interested in participating in a study. The inverse is also frequently true, in that patients with diseases who want to participate in research often have difficulty being matched to an appropriate study.  To bridge these gaps, a blockchain-based system could be used that allows individuals who want to participate in trials to aggregate their health data and make it visible to recruiters, according to the pharma executives.  While the data on the ledger wouldn't immediately be connected to a particular identity, recruiters could prompt an anonymous eligible candidate, and once the individual consented, their identity would be revealed.  Baara added:  ""The beauty with the blockchain is the control is with the individual.""  Circling back  Yet, the individual is sometimes difficult to keep around.  Because clinical studies typically span several years, retaining patients has also become a problem for the industry, particularly since entire studies can be invalidated if enough patients don’t show up within the required time window.  As such, a blockchain-based conduit for patient interaction could offer immediate utility.  ""Today doctors and nurses running clinical trial programs are still having to resort to calls or post to remind patients about their appointments, which in this setting are particularly time-sensitive,"" said Dany DeGrave, senior director of innovation programs and external networks at Sanofi. ""In the future, we envisage automation will make the whole process a lot more efficient.""  Not only do the executives think a blockchain system could automate communication between pharma company and patient, but they also think such a system would ensure the integrity of data. The latter is particularly important as regulatory approval for new drugs hinges on accurate data, and public trust in the pharma industry has ebbed and flowed over the years as stories of fabricated results make headlines.  According to DeGrave, the immutable nature of blockchains could play a critical role in guarding against the falsification of data, and allow the public and other researchers better trust in the systems being used to track data.  Currently, the three companies are working with the IEEE Standards Association, the standards body of the world’s largest technology association, to develop testbeds for implementing the technology and addressing the challenges.  Regulators, for their part, also appear to be warming up to the concept. Representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, the primary agency overseeing the U.S. industry, will share their thoughts on the topic at an industry symposium in February.  Getting it right  But as many industries flirting with blockchain are discovering, finding a sweet spot for implementing the technology is never quite as simple as it may sound.  Specifically in the healthcare setting, firmly entrenched legacy electronic health records vendors, like Epic and Cerner, could stand in the way, much to the chagrin of blockchain startups in the space.  ""We need to overcome any barriers to the conversion of health care data into blockchain by providing the right incentives to the incumbents, in order to fully and quickly realize the potential we see in this new technology,"" DeGrave said.  That said, though, Pfizer's Baara expressed optimism that the trend of consumers demanding more control of their personal health data will, over time, incent the current data custodians to relax their stranglehold.  Yet, costs associated with innovating in the space and the risk-averse nature of the heavily-regulated sector also means there's an additional imperative to make sure things go smoothly the first time around.  ""Like in any industry, we need to make sure the technology is mature enough before making sweeping changes to minimize any potential disruption,"" said DeGrave, concluding:  ""The costs associated with change in our industry are enormous, so we’d better get it right early on.""

42428429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7kdh,1515465931,2018: The Year We Democratize Blockchain,"Eric Piscini, a principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP, is the global leader of Deloitte’s financial services blockchain consulting efforts and co-lead at its the global blockchain and cryptocurrency team.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      As the technology behind bitcoin nears its 10th year in the market, let's celebrate the positive.  The world has seen tremendous interest in blockchain across industries and countries, from thousands of new startups, to blockchain labs popping up in commercial and federal organizations, to a number of consortia established looking to solve their industry’s biggest challenges.  One can go so far as to argue that 2017 saw the democratization for cryptocurrencies.  Democratization of a given technology can happen in many ways, from the number of people, products and solutions using that technology, to its business value or the level of disruption it activates. As opposed to previous technology waves – like open source – blockchain technology is, at its core, is designed to empower people versus organizations. It is thus natural that blockchain democratization is also core to its success.  With kids accepting bitcoin on lemonade stands, teenagers investing in ether to pay for college and traders standing up crypto-trading desks, there is no doubt that cryptocurrencies have helped democratize blockchain. Ask anyone who has been involved in blockchain without being involved in bitcoin for proof of that. In a way, blockchain has been democratized via cryptocurrencies — but the real democratization of blockchain is about to happen.  With democratization at its core, here are some of the things I expect to see happen in the year ahead.  For a host of reasons, it is a critical year for every aspect of the space.  1. Killer apps  2018 might very well be the year of the killer customer app on blockchain.  While the CryptoKitties were cute, they also demonstrated some limitations of the technology platforms; it will likely incentivize those in the industry to develop more stable and scalable blockchains. And, as the foundations mature, we will see major advancements in the usage of blockchain solutions for consumers. Whether it be personal electric grid management, digital identity, gaming, loyalty or credit scoring, we will probably use a blockchain app in 2018 without knowing that it is backed by blockchain technology.  2. Major tech developments  Advancements will come in the next few months that will make the use of blockchain platforms easier than ever before. And it will happen across the main stacks of Hyperledger, ethereum and Corda, among others.  This will address a key challenge that we all face today — the scarcity of talent, especially in developers and architects. When it's easier to provision and develop on blockchain technologies, innovation will be unleashed, many more solutions will be created, which will help drive more experimentation and successful platform launches.  3. Governments and regulators will drive adoption  These groups are now engaging and leading in blockchain efforts after studying and getting up to speed on the technology.  They now understand the value of blockchain for themselves and their constituencies. We will see large-scale use of blockchain led by governments, probably first in developing economies and small countries where incumbents are less influential. Financial inclusion, digital identities, regulatory reporting and payments will be the main areas improved by blockchain in 2018.  4. Corporations and non-profits will become major players  I believe these organizations will be the main engine in translating the promises into real commercially viable solutions, a massive role in the democratization of blockchain. Most importantly, they will have to accept that their long-term role in our economies might be dramatically different than it is today. We have seen both sides of the coin so far, pun unintended.  Those taking the defensive position – like notaries – will go the dinosaur way. On the other hand, those going on offense, with aggressive moves from major corporations, like banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, will help build the next generation of business platforms on blockchain.  The biggest question: Will they be nimble enough to compete with the startups? Will they be protected by regulations? Will they generate return on their investments so far?  5. The jobs market will take notice  When it comes to talent, which is the first thing I think about when I wake up each morning, the job market too will be impacted and blockchain will offer new productive lives for many. The decentralization of work has already started and I’m a big believer that blockchain will fuel its growth. Imagine a world where each of us can monetize our time, skills and experiences on-demand and be rewarded with micropayments from a decentralized platform.  Work has been democratized many times over but it might very well be the last phase.  All that said, there might be a downside to the democratization of blockchain. If you consider blockchain as a non-human trustee, autonomous organizations running on blockchain are – as we have seen with the DAO – not so sci-fi anymore. Democratization of technology often requires strong ethical behaviors and, sometimes, a regulatory framework. We cannot overstate these aspects in our race to introduce blockchain to the world.  6. There will be surprises  No, I did not forget cryptocurrencies and other tokens.  They have reached democratization in financial markets already, with many exchanges and financial instruments. Will it open a new wave for anyone to invest into a new asset class, will it burst into flames, will it enhance existing businesses, or will it create new decentralized business models? All of the above, which is why 2018 is going to be the most exciting year in blockchain so far.  Democratizing blockchain will be central for us in 2018, as I believe it will generate an unprecedented level of change in the next decade.
