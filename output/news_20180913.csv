The city announced its intention to test blockchain by developing a database that allows local officials to create a secure, private system which will collect and store personal information and preferences, as well as create an internal ""token of value.""  One proposed use case: enabling registered users to submit votes on the network and see an aggregated result of the votes, according to the RFP.  ""To begin, the city hopes to prove the viability of identity, basic voting, opinion survey, and a token of some arbitrary value,"" the RFP explains, going on to state:  ""It is the city's belief that more robust applications of blockchain technology may become commonplace and so the city desires to establish a base technical foundation upon which it will build additional functionality. This project will also allow the city to develop skills and expertise around this emerging technology.""  In an addendum to the RFP, which updated the due date to Sept. 14, 2018, the city added that it was not requiring a specific budget. Rather, due to the experimental nature of the proposal, Dublin officials expect to establish a cost for the trial as proposals become submitted.

42429667,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0X3h,1536866108,Indian Central Bank Argues Cryptos 'Not Valid' as Currency in Court Battle,"The Reserve Bank of India argued Wednesday that bitcoin cannot be recognized in the country before the nation's Supreme Court.  In a case that has been brought by a number of exchanges against the Indian central bank for blocking their access to banking services five months ago, the RBI stated in an affidavit that current legislation means that cryptos cannot be considered either currency or money.  The RBI stated:  ""It is submitted that crypto-currencies fall short of being true currencies. It is further submitted that RBI does not consider virtual currencies such as Bitcoins as 'currency' under the extant laws. There are no enabling provisions under the extant law to treat Bitcoin as currency.""  Further, according to a report from CNN's News 18, the RBI continued to say that, as cryptos are peer-to-peer networks and not controlled by a service provider, ""They can't even be considered as a valid payment system.""  In order to be recognized as a ""valid currency"" the bank said instruments should ""possess identical or similar characteristics of cheques, postal orders and money orders.""  The next hearing on the case is scheduled for September 17, the news source indicates.  Back in April, the central bank ordered domestic banks and financial institutions to stop working with the country's crypto exchanges within three months.  Later that month, a petition was lodged against the RBI by Kali Digital Ecosystems, an Indian firm that had been planning to launch an exchange called CoinRecoil in August.  According to the text of the petition, Kali was seeking ""an appropriate writ, order or direction quashing the [RBI's] circular."" It stated that the ban is ""arbitrary and unconstitutional"" and that the company is unable to begin operating due to the RBI's restrictions.  The issue has since addressed by petitions from other exchanges seeking to overturn the ban, which the Supreme Court is hearing at the same time.  Since the RBI circular was issued, exchanges have been forced to drop rupee-to-crypto trading services, relying instead on crypt-to-crypto trading. However, trading volumes have taken a big drop and the companies face an uncertain future unless the court rules to overturn the ban.

42429674,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0XDh,1536863734,Back Over $200 Billion: 3 Reasons Crypto Prices Could Be Heading Higher,"The cryptocurrency market has been making history for all the wrong reasons as of late, most notably by recently surpassing the plunge of the infamous Dot-Com bubble in the early 2000's.  With that said, cryptocurrencies tend to make recoveries when all hope is seemingly lost, and today's price action of the world's second largest cryptocurrency, ether and many others is no exception.  At press time, several of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are reporting 24-hour gains above 10 percent, including monero (XMR), litecoin (LTC), and EOS. Ether (ETH) is leading the pack while boasting a 17 percent price increase. Further, the total market cap has edged back up over $200 billion, after falling lower earlier this week.  Still, it's too early to call any type of long-term bullish reversal in the market, but there are three encouraging signs cryptocurrencies may see much-needed relief at least in the short term.  1) Ether Recovery  Until today, the price of ETH/USD had fallen more than 40 percent since September 5 and 85 percent from its all-time high north of $1,400 set last December.   Today though, tells a different story. Since the low of $167.32 yesterday, price has recovered more than 20 percent reaching a 24-high of $207.67, according to data from the Bitfinex Exchange.  ETH/USD Daily Chart  As seen in the above chart, the recent price recovery can be attributed to finding support on the lower trend line of a falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern, in a historical support zone depicted by the green box.  Further, the daily RSI was showing bullish divergence, giving all the more reason for a relief rally to occur.  In order to provide confirmation of a larger trend reversal, price would need to close a daily, more preferably a weekly, candlestick above wedge resistance with a notable increase in volume.  A common method of estimating the breakout target of a falling wedge is to add the base range to the breakout point. Since the base range of this wedge is over $900, a long-term measured objective for price would be in the $1100 area if price were to break out near $230.  Many alternative currencies are built on the ethereum blockchain, so a strong recovery from ETH would likely translate to a recovery for others as well.  2) BTC Short-Term Strength  The future prospects for cryptocurrencies in general are heavily dependent on bitcoin (BTC) - the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Down 70 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December, BTC could scare the most seasoned investor. However, a closer look at the long duration technical chart reveals the cryptocurrency is silently charting a major bullish reversal pattern.  Weekly chart  As can be seen, BTC's recovery from the low of $5,859 in August established the first higher low pattern of the year, the previous low being $5,755 hit in June. Further, the recent sell-off ended at $6,119, meaning another higher low has been created.  The trendline connecting the higher lows indicates long-term bearish exhaustion. Hence, there is reason to be optimistic as long as prices hold above the trendline.  What bulls need now is for BTC to set a higher high by moving above the July high of $8,507. That would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield a sustained rally above $10,000.  3) Risk Appetite in Global Markets  Risk assets across the globe have picked up a bid in the last 24 hours on reports that the U.S. and China are heading back to the negotiating table.  For instance, the AUD/JPY pair, which is widely considered as a risk barometer of global markets, is up 1 percent at press time. Meanwhile, the dollar index is down 0.24 percent.  Clearly, investors are hoping that these talks would yield results, however, trade wars would end only if the U.S. officially drops tariffs. More importantly, the past experience suggests such talks tend to break down in a few days.  That said, the renewed hopes of the U.S.-China trade talks could keep the risk assets well bid in the short-term.  Further, Turkey hiked rates by 625 basis points today to save its stumbling currency and the move has pushed equity markets higher across the globe.  All of this will likely bode well for the cryptocurrencies as the investor community still considers bitcoin and other innovations as risk assets.

42429655,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Wbh,1536860758,Landmark Crypto Crime Case Ends With Jail Sentence for GAW CEO,"Josh Garza, the CEO of the now-defunct cryptocurrency mining company GAW Miners, has been sentenced to 21 months in prisonafter pleading guilty to a wire fraud charge.  As part of the sentence, Garza was given 6 months home confinement and three years of supervised release overall. The court proceedings, which took place on a cloudy day in Hartford, Connecticut, saw several customers of the disgraced company read statements about their experiences with GAW. Garza himself gave a courtroom statement prior to the sentencing and expressed remorse about his actions.  Thursday's sentencing caps a years-long saga that began in 2014, with allegations that GAW was acting as a Ponzi scheme by selling more cryptocurrency mining processing power than the firm actually possessed. During that time, GAW released a controversial cryptocurrency called paycoin that would feature prominently in the Justice Department's case.  It also marks a conclusion of sorts for an early effort by the U.S. government to police the crypto space, arguably setting the stage for some of the enforcement actions and lawsuits filed in the past year and a half against a slew of alleged scammers.  The original allegations of fraud made against GAW – vociferously denied by Garza and other supporters at the time – ultimately proved to be true in the wake of the company's 2015 collapse and subsequent lawsuits initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, later, the Justice Department.  Internal company emails leaked amidst GAW's collapse also included revelations about paycoin, its failed cryptocurrency project that was pitched as having a price ""floor"" at $20, as well as confirmation that the company was being investigated by the SEC.  Paycoin would later feature in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Garza, with the SEC avoiding that element of GAW's operations in its focus on the so-called ""hashlets,"" which the company pitched as ""virtual miners"" that the U.S. regulator later deemed a security.  Garza pleaded guilty in July of last year in the Justice Department's case, though the SEC suit remains ongoing, according to public records.  Controversial company  GAW Miners, based in the United States, initially served as a reseller and distributor of mining equipment, later moving into the hosted mining business – that is, the firm would purchase and operate machines on behalf of its customers.  Toward the latter half of 2014, GAW began pitching the Hashlet, which the company sold through an in-house marketplace. It was around this time that skepticism about GAW's claims began to steadily grow, including questions about its mining operations, relationships with well-known businesses and Garza himself, who played an outsized and at-times controversial role in public messaging on social media channels and in the media.  Indeed, GAW made waves that August when he announced that he had purchased the BTC.com domain name for $1 million. It would later be shown that the domain name was obtained through a long-term agreement that ultimately lapsed.  In December of 2014, GAW launched paycoin. At the time, Garza publicly delcared, ""I have confidence that paycoin will be established as the new dominant global online currency.""  But opposition to GAW had been steadily growing, with a public gulf widening between the company's often-zealous clients on its official forum and opponents – in many cases customers or former customers themselves – on BitcoinTalk. Even still, the coin was positioned as a payments-friendly altcoin with the backing of GAW.  Yet as CoinDesk reported at the time, paycoin would ultimately fail due to the very same pump-and-dump tactics that Garza and GAW decried when launching it. As data from CoinMarketCap shows, paycoin's $20 ""floor"" didn't last long, as the price tumbled below $2 by the end of January 2015.  A buyback scheme was subsequently announced, but the cryptocurrency's price continued dropping in the days that followed.  Road to fraud lawsuits  Ultimately, the paycoin debacle would prove to be the first stage in a months-long collapse for GAW. The period saw Garza himself go (in the eyes of some) from cryptocurrency messiah to cryptocurrency pariah.  February saw the release of hundreds of thousands of internal emails, including those written by Garza himself, which revealed the existence of the SEC inquiry – reported first by the cryptocurrency blog CoinFire but denied at the time by the company. Subsequently leaked emails would also show that GAW had, in fact, sold more mining processing power than it actually possessed.  The following weeks and months featured the emergence of new efforts to revive GAW's fortunes, through aborted services like Mineral (a crypto exchange) and CoinStand (a paycoin-focused site for buying products from Amazon).  That summer, a power company in Mississippi won a default judgment against GAW after the company failed to pay for power at a facility in the state.  In December 2015, Garza, GAW and ZenMiner, an affiliated mining company, were sued by the SEC for the unlicensed sale of securities and operating a Ponzi scheme, as CoinDesk reported at the time. An investigation by the Justice Department, simultaneous with the SEC pursuit, culminated with the wire fraud charge guilty plea.  Nearly two years after the initial SEC lawsuit filing, a U.S. district judge held Garza liable for more than $9 million, a move that came months after the SEC's bid for an $11 million default judgment against GAW Miners and ZenMiner was approved.

42429669,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0X7h,1536858011,FOAM Is Live: Decentralized World Map Launches on Ethereum,"One of the year's most hotly anticipated blockchain applications is now live.  FOAM, which aims to build a reliable, resilient world map using smart contract technology, announced that the decentralized application (dapp) has launched on the ethereum blockchain and is already ""seeing the first users populate the map.""  Speaking to CoinDesk in June, FOAM co-founder and CEO Ryan John King explained the motivation behind the dapp, saying ""people think location is a solved problem."" Rather, King argued, centralized mapping services like GPS – which is owned by the U.S. government and operated by the Air Force – are ultimately vulnerable and unreliable.  FOAM's solution is to spread the work of cartography among a diffuse network of individual users, who register locations on the FOAM map using a cryptographic technique called proof of location. FOAM is targeting several use cases, from games to supply chain management.  Users are incentivized to populate the map with new locations through the use of a token (also called FOAM), which the company distributed in a $16.5 million sale that ended in August.  The tokens also serve as a quality-control mechanism, enabling users to challenge and vote on the accuracy of newly registered locations. This mechanism, which has been employed in several dapps, is known as a token-curated registry.  Blue dots, denoting proposed but yet-to-be-confirmed locations, have begun popping up in areas such as New York and Berlin. And according to FOAM, over 500 ""points of interest"" were added by users in the first 24 hours following the launch.  Screenshot of map.foam.space showing proposed points of interest  Of note, FOAM token buyers are required to put the tokens to use by placing at least 10 points of interest on the map. Otherwise, they will not be able to transfer their tokens outside of the protocol. Even if they do fulfill the requirement, however, token transfers are prohibited for the first 45 days after launch.  The aim of these restrictions, it seems, is to prevent FOAM tokens from being objects of pure speculation, rather than contributing to the project of cartography by cryptography.

42429663,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Wrh,1536854708,A New Line of Powerful ASIC Miners Is Coming to Ethereum,"A chip designer with extensive experience in developing bitcoin mining devices is turning her sights on the ethereum protocol.  Chen Min, the former chief chip maker at bitcoin mining chip developer Canaan Creative, launched a new venture to build cryptocurrency mining devices called Linzhi. The firm's first project tackles the ethhash algorithm used by ethereum and ethereum classic, with a new line of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) miners set to be released sometime next year.  Dubbed Project Lavasnow, Linzhi's new ethereum miner claims to use 1/8th the amount of electricity as Bitmain's ethash miners, according to a presentation Chen developed for the Ethereum Classic Summit held this week. It also expects to run 1,400 million hashes per second, compared to 190 from one of Bitmain's AntMiners.  The increased hashpower means one of Linzhi's miners should generate roughly $20 per day, compared to a projected $3 from a Bitmain miner. As a result, the company expects customers to break even on the cost of a miner within four months of purchase.  Linzhi did not announce how much each miner would actually cost.  At present, the company is still working on developing the product. Customers may begin receiving their miners in April 2019, according to the presentation.  While many individual miners and members of the ethereum community at present are opposed to ASICs, Chen said in her presentation that hardware alone does not cause centralization.  Rather, ""it is the style of the business,"" she said.

Co-founder John Egan told CoinDesk that the company is looking to make it easier for new users unfamiliar with blockchain to purchase these collectibles and hold them.  An issue with many current wallets and other tools, he said, is that they are focused on developers, rather than casual users. Decentralized apps (dapps) are one area he sees drawing potential new users into the space.  ""The motivation here is no one wants to build in an ecosystem that customers can't get access to, so it's really important to build those on-ramps … [Vault] doesn't present them with a lot of technical information, just gives them a way to start using [dapps],"" Egan said.  Moreover, Vault will not list token prices or enable the trading of tokens, he said, adding:  ""It's like the early days of baseball cards, you didn't buy them to make 50 [times] their value later, you bought them to own them or trade them with your friends. I think that's the big opportunity with collectibles … you want to have these things because you want them, not because you're chasing [prices] … I think that's what the future is, the utility is coming.""  ""You can kind of see it in the [user interface] ... the application doesn't attempt to encourage this idea of profit-seeking, it encourages this idea of holding things because you believe it has intrinsic value,"" he said.  He likened his vision for Vault to Apple's iOS, noting that while developers could already create apps for smartphones, introducing an ecosystem that made it easy to share and use apps spurred adoption.  ""Our desire is to be the most used crypto wallet and sort of knock down barriers in terms of getting into the space,"" he said. ""I think collectibles have the best chance of bringing us out of the early adopter phase and moving into mainstream use, because most people are excited about these games.""  As part of its interface, users can add friends as contacts, negating the need to memorize or share complicated wallet addresses.  ""We're not a trading desk, we're not a Coinbase, we're not a Gemini, we're trying to be a utility. I think if we're successful long-term, you'll begin to see this ecosystem flourish like you saw the web flourish,"" he concluded.

42429657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Wdh,1536844480,BitGo Receives Regulatory Approval to Custody Crypto Assets,"Crypto security startup BitGo has received approval in the U.S. to act as a qualified custodian for digital assets.  The company, which has spent most of 2018 attempting to launch a regulated custodian entity, announced that the BitGo Trust had been approved by the South Dakota Division of Banking on Thursday, meaning it can now offer institutional clients a regulated storage solution for digital assets, said chief compliance and legal officer Shahla Ali.  Ali told CoinDesk that this may mark the first time a regulated custodian was designed and built from scratch specifically to target crypto assets.  ""Currently ... we offer an online hot wallet solution, which is available to anyone to download our software and store their coins. We also offer a custodial solution which is a combination of hot and cold wallet,"" she said, although ""that offering, though secure, is not regulated like the Trust.""  She continued:  ""The trust company will enable us to offer a qualified custodial offering that is regulated, that has the money laundering and know your customer requirements. Our custodian offering already has money laundering and KYC requirements … [but the Trust is] for institutional clients … especially for those who are registered advisors and broker dealers.""  Although BitGo Trust was specifically approved by South Dakota regulators, Ali noted that ""generally other states will give you reciprocity in the sense that other states have money transmission laws and they'll exempt you from money transmission requirements.""  BitGo representatives met with state regulators during the process to approve the Trust, she said. Now that it's been approved, ""our hope is to build this platform out, to really demonstrate to regulators and customers that this model can work and we can really build a great trust company that safeguards assets.""  Although BitGo has customers who are ready to begin storing their assets with the Trust, under South Dakota regulations, the general public has 30 days to file an appeal against the decision. The company said it is set to begin operations on a technological level, and will do so once the 30-day period has expired if no appeals are filed.  Once it does launch, BitGo will immediately begin taking custody of assets, indicated Ali.  Ali said the BitGo team has worked to ensure that its custodial offering matches what they believe customers will need to be comfortable storing digital assets. There are currently no standards for the space the firm is entering, so BitGo has had to develop its own to draw in clients.  ""That's certainly our hope, we believe that will happen, we've obviously engaged with many many large market makers who do not engage with the cryptocurrency space because they can't custody their assets,"" she explained. ""Even large family offices that are managing their own funds want a secure option where they don't have to fear [thefts].""  She hopes to draw both institutional investors, as well as family offices, and sees a secure custody offering as a tool to reassure investors and local governments alike that cryptocurrencies can provide value to these groups.  Ali explained:  ""I think you'll see that the fringes will go back into the dark and cryptocurrency will come into the light and become a globally acceptable either a commodity or security, however it's structured. I think it'll alleviate some of the concerns the governments around the world have that it facilitates money laundering, that it facilitates drugs.""  Nine-month journey  BitGo has been working to launch as a regulated custodian since January 2018, when it originally announced it would acquire the Kingdom Trust Company. At the time, Kingdom Trust was a digital asset custodian with roughly $12 billion in assets under storage, as previously reported.  The move was aimed at bringing institutional money into the crypto space, CEO Mike Belshe told CoinDesk. BitGo hoped to attract investors who had skills other than technical proficiency in blockchain technology.  However, the deal fell through, and in May, the company announced its intention to build its own custodian from the ground up.  Marketing vice president Clarissa Horowitz told CoinDesk at the time that the decision was made after the company engaged with customers.  ""We realized they would be best served by a custodian who was entirely focused on their assets,"" she said.

42429658,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Wjh,1536840005,Constantinople Ahead: What You Need to Know About Ethereum's Big Upgrade,"Constantinople, ethereum's next system-wide upgrade, is coming soon to a node near you.  Finalized August 31, Constantinople includes five different ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs). Once released on ethereum, the proposals will permanently alter the blockchain with a host of new backwards-incompatible upgrades.  This means that nodes — the network of computers that run ethereum software — must either update together with the whole system or continue running as a separate blockchain entity.  More formally known as a ""hard fork,"" system-wide upgrades have instigated a fair amount of drama in the past. Most notably, in the case that a portion of users don't agree with the change, this may result in two different versions of the same blockchain running concurrently.  As dramatic as these things can get (having formerly resulted in a competing cryptocurrency named ethereum classic), most of the upgrades in Constantinople won't be noticeable to average users. Indeed, described by independent developer Lane Rettig, the upcoming ethereum hard fork won't feature any ""big changes"" for end users at all.  Characterized as primarily a ""maintenance and optimization upgrade"" by Rettig, Constantinople features small, yet highly technical, ethereum improvements to network efficiency and fee structure, as well as, upgrades that pave the way to ethereum's hotly anticipated scaling roadmap.  Additionally, the hard fork includes changes to ethereum's underlying economic policy, and the delay of the difficulty bomb, a piece of code programmed to activate what is known as the ethereum ""ice age"" in which new block creation on the network eventually slows to a complete halt.  As detailed by CoinDesk, the economic change has been the cause of contention, with conflicting views expressed by ethereum stakeholders in the months prior to the upgrade.  At press time, anxiety is continuing to brew among the networks miners that are faced with an impending pay cut following Constantinople. But still, achieving a balance between all stakeholder concerns, developers are confident that the upgrade will be broadly well received.  While a formal block number has yet to be finalized, core developers and clients are currently implementing, reviewing and testing the Constantinople code.  As ethereum trader Eric Conner told CoinDesk:  ""Complex coding and testing takes time. And ethereum is live so it's essential to be sure no changes are breaking.""  The new ethereum  The five EIPs set to be released in Constantinople are:  EIP 145: A technical upgrade written by two ethereum developers, Alex Beregszaszi and Pawel Bylica, EIP 145 details a more efficient method of information processing on ethereum known as bitwise shifting.  EIP 1052: Authored by core developer Nick Johnson and Bylica, EIP 1052 offers a means of optimizing large-scale code execution on ethereum.  EIP 1283: Based on EIP 1087, which was written by Johnson, this proposal mainly benefits smart contract developers by introducing a more equitable pricing method for changes made to data storage.  EIP 1014: Created by the founder of ethereum himself, Vitalik Buterin, the purpose of this upgrade is to better facilitate a certain type of scaling solution based upon state channels and ""off-chain"" transactions.  EIP 1234: Championed by Afri Schoedon, release manager for major ethereum client Parity, this upgrade is the most contentious of the batch, reducing block mining reward issuance from 3 ETH down to 2 ETH, as well as, delaying the difficulty bomb for a period of 12 months.  All in all, the changes include: code optimizations to improve processing times for developers; fairer pricing structures for changes made to smart contract data storage; a code edit making scaling solutions through state channels easier to occur on ethereum; and changes to ethereum's economic policy.  Given these code changes are likely to shape the progress of the second most popular blockchain for years to come, Constantinople is worth taking a deeper look at.  Optimizing code  To begin, both EIP 145 and 1052 are targeted at improving network efficiency, by making changes to ethereum's underlying virtual machine — the EVM.  Powered by software at the heart of ethereum, the EVM processes smart contracts into a series of ones and zeros also called bytecode.  Seeking to maintain the longevity of ethereum and optimize performance to better serve user needs, both EIP 145 and EIP 1052 seek to optimize the developer experience for smart contract developers specifically.  EIP 145  introduces native ""bitwise shifting"" functionality which is able to run through bytecode without relying on arithmetic operations such as multiplication and division. In effect, this means that the smart contracts underlying decentralized applications like CryptoKitties will be processed faster by the EVM.  Additionally, when smart contracts on ethereum are executed and called upon, EIP 1052 introduces an upgrade by which only the essential data of the contract code is checked rather than the entirety of the code itself.  Namely, rather than verifying the full contract, EIP 1052 makes it so a compressed line of code, or a ""hash"" can be verified instead, saving computing time and cost — especially for lengthy smart contracts that run on thousands of lines of code.  Cheaper storage  Further EIPs deal with how smart contracts are stored on ethereum — such as EIP 1283, which reduces the amount developers need to pay when building smart contracts.  As it stands, without EIP 1283, certain updates to smart contract code cost a hefty amount of gas, the computational unit of energy required to execute operations on the ethereum platform.  EIP 1283 implements a better cost analysis for contracts, by breaking down what contract changes have been written in ethereum's short term storage, called memory, rather than the blockchain itself.  If none or a few of those updates end up on the blockchain, it reduces the overall cost for developers. As Johnson, the author of the original proposal concept behind EIP 1283 recounted to CoinDesk:  ""In some cases in the past, we were charging gas for things that didn't actually happen or didn't actually cost any real resources and now we're trying to adjust things so we only charge gas that aligns with the work we actually have to do.""  In the future, Johnson added that developers are looking to implement what is known as rent fees.  As detailed by CoinDesk, the idea is to charge a fee for users holding data permanently stored on the blockchain. Johnson said this would be an effective way to disincentivize ""using up storage for things you don't need them for.""  State channels  Aside from a revamped gas fee structure for smart contract developers, EIP 1014 helps progress an experimental scaling solution called state channels.  Actively under development as a part of efforts to scale ethereum for larger transaction volume, these channels minimize the amount of operations that need to happen on the ethereum blockchain itself, freeing up network resources and space.  Created by founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin, EIP 1014 is described on GitHub by state channel developer Liam Horne to be ""a significant performance increase in state channels.""  Others on the same forum have echoed the sentiment, urging for its inclusion into Constantinople and affirming that EIP 1014 would better facilitate transactions happening ""off-chain.""  Economic policy  Finally, there is EIP 1234, the latest addition to the four other proposals set to be released in Constantinople dealing with the incremental increase in block mining difficulty known as the difficulty bomb.  Originally intended to encourage the transition into an more ecological, proof-of-stake based consensus system named Casper, the switch is still a long way off. As such, steps must be taken to delay the bomb — and decrease ether issuance alongside it.  Simply put, given the removal of the difficulty bomb, blocks will be faster to mine following Constantinople. This means that steps must be taken to reduce the reward per block as well — and EIP 1234 reduces them from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block.  Because ethereum doesn't have a formal monetary policy — currently maintaining an uncapped inflation model — according to a trader named Eric Conner, the reward reduction in EIP 1234 can be thought of as akin to a ""stop gap"" that is aimed at effectively curbing a ""supply bleed"".  Schoedon, author of EIP 1234, described it as ""the best proposal to stabilize issuance while simultaneously delaying the bomb"" in an email to CoinDesk.  Still, certain members of the ethereum mining community opposed the decision to decrease mining rewards, arguing thinner profit margins and the potential of mining operations to become increasingly centralized in the hands of few.  The concerns come at a time when ASICs — a highly competitive type of mining hardware that removes hobbyists from the mining industry — are becoming increasingly widespread on ethereum.  What's next  In summary, all five EIPs have impacts to ethereum that touch on a number of broader goals and initiatives still to be worked out on the decentralized platform even after Constantinople is fully released.  At present, each EIP will continue undergoing testing, implementation and peer-review in the weeks to come, though the process is by no means a linear progression.  As ethereum core developer Nick Johnson notes, technically ""anyone can contribute tests"" to a global test suite that is later run against all client implementations. However, it's not as if ethereum clients must wait for these tests to be finalized before moving forward with code implementations of their own.  Schoedon, who boasts Parity as ""probably one of the fastest teams implementing the changes for Constantinople"" emphasized last Saturday in an email to CoinDesk that they were the first client, having implemented all five EIPs, to be ""feature-complete"" for Constantinople, awaiting now peer-review before full acceptance into their official codebase.  This aspect of preparation to do with testing and review that goes into a hard fork can be as time-consuming of a process, if not more time-consuming, than reaching consensus on a decentralized platform.  So, despite an original release date for October 8th, the grand premiere of ethereum's next hard fork may not be due until later in the month or even sometime in November.  Luckily, the sneak peak of all five EIPs to be included in Constantinople has given ethereum fans and critics alike a good sense on what to expect.  The only thing left to stay tuned for now is a prime execution.

42429672,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0X9h,1536836411,Bitcoin Price Looks North After Passing $6.4K Resistance,"Bitcoin (BTC) is teasing a decent bullish move, having cleared crucial resistance a few hours ago.  The leading cryptocurrency moved past $6,400 earlier today, signaling that bearish exhaustion – as indicated by Tuesday's spinning bottom candle – is paving way for a corrective rally.  Notably, the positive price action was preceded by a solid defense of the long-term trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low and an upside break of the symmetrical triangle.  As a result, the stage looks set for an upside move. However, caution is still the name of the game, as the bearish moving averages (MAs) could work as hurdles and complicate the recovery.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,450, having clocked a high of $6,490 earlier today, according to Bitfinex data.  Hourly chart  The symmetrical triangle breakout, as seen in the above chart, indicates a bullish reversal, meaning the sell-off from the recent highs above $7,400 has ended and the bulls have regained control.  Further, the 50-hour and 100-hour MAs are beginning to curl up in favor of the bulls. So, while there is a reason to be optimistic here, the downward sloping (bearish) 200-hour MA is warning the bulls against being too ambitious.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the persistent bear failure to penetrate the lower end of the pennant pattern is finally yielding a bullish move. A UTC close today above $6,400 would further cement the short-term bullish case.  However, as of writing, the downward sloping (bearish) 10-day moving average, is putting brakes on the price rally.  View  The bullish price action on the hourly and daily chart indicates BTC could test the 10-week MA of $6,847 in a day or two.  The bearish moving averages may slow down the pace of the bullish move, but are unlikely to derail the corrective move higher. Moreover, price action always supersedes lagging indicators like the moving averages.  A downside break of the pennant pattern seen in the daily chart would revive the bearish view.

Gox has announced that corporate creditors can now enter claims to claw back trapped bitcoin through a recently approved rehabilitation process.  Nobuaki Kobayashi, attorney-at-law and the rehabilitation trustee for Mt. Gox said in a release on Wednesday that former corporate users of the exchange will have until Oct. 22 to file proof backing up their claims for refunds of crypto assets held by the exchange.  ""We have released an online rehabilitation claim filing system ... which allows corporate users to file their proofs of claim by online methods in connection with the civil rehabilitation proceedings,"" Kobayashi said.  The release follows previous news that Mt. Gox's online filing system had been opened up to individual (non-corporate) users on Aug. 23.  CoinDesk reported at the time that, after the filing deadline, the trustee will submit a statement of approval or rejection to a Tokyo district court for final decision, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 24 next year, which may be subject to further changes.  Last year, several Mt. Gox creditors filed a petition to the bankruptcy court in Tokyo in an effort to move Mt. Gox out of the bankruptcy case – which started since its infamous hack in 2014 – into civil rehabilitation. The court subsequently approved the petition in June.  Currently, Mt. Gox creditors are also drafting refund policies via their legal representatives, seeking to receive their bitcoin assets in the original form of the deposit – instead of cash– via a designated cryptocurrency exchange.  Mt. Gox, at its peak the largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, declared bankruptcy in 2014 following the theft of 744,000 BTC from the platform. Creditors subsequently began a years-long process in a bid to retrieve their funds still held by the exchange.  Mt.

42429660,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Wnh,1536826811,"Blockchain Could Boost Trade Finance by $1 Trillion, WEF Research Says","Blockchain is able to fill in much of the $1.5 trillion-dollar supply-demand gap in global trade finance by easing financing for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in emerging markets, new research says.  Jointly conducted and released by the World Economic Forum and Bain & Company, the research indicates that, by deploying blockchain, global businesses can generate an extra $1 trillion in trade finance that would otherwise be missed out on.    According to an Asian Development Bank calculation, the global trade finance gap is currently at $1.5 trillion and is estimated to grow to $2.4 trillion by 2025. The research further explains that this issue largely arises from limited access to credit and loans for SMEs that are looking to expand their businesses.      The researchers argue, however, that this missing funding can be reduced by $1 trillion if blockchain ""is used more broadly,"" since distributed networks are able to share business records across financial institutions along the supply chain and bring transparency to businesses' credibility.      ""They would help mitigate credit risk, lower fees and remove barriers to trade,"" the researchers write, adding:      ""If implemented, the main beneficiaries are set to be SMEs and emerging markets, which suffer most from a lack of access to credit and have ample room to grow trade.""              The researchers further added that a blockchain-based trade finance system would be particularly beneficial to Asian economies as they account for 7 percent ($105 billion) of the trade finance gap, with 75 percent of the global document-based transactions across supply chains.    CoinDesk previously reported that authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong have both moved to launch blockchain-based trade finance systems in an effort to help SMEs gain more access to financing tools and to prevent fraud.

The Financial Services Agency hosted the fifth study group meeting on cryptocurrency Wednesday, with trading platforms, scholars, lawyers, and government officials present. Kiyotaka Sasaki, vice commissioner for policy coordination at the FSA, said the authority currently has about 30 people in charge of the overall supervision of crypto-related activities, including license registration reviews.  The FSA, Sasaki said in a Reuters report, is planning to add 12 more people for the fiscal year of 2019 to better respond to the growth of the cryptocurrency exchange industry.  According to a document released after the meeting, the FSA has been reviewing 16 cases, while more than 160 firms including public companies are now planning to submit applications for an exchange license.  The FSA said 12 of the 16 companies reviewed withdrew their applications when instructed by the regulator, while it rejected one exchange. The other three, including Coincheck, are still waiting for a final decision.

42429668,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Wzh,1536811203,10 Years After Lehman: Bitcoin and Wall Street Are Closer Than Ever,"Hank Paulson, former secretary of the U.S. Treasury, called it ""an economic 9/11.""  Having loaded up on mortgage debt that went sour, then failed to find a savior in the government or private sector, the 158-year-old Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008.  The fallout over the following days, weeks and months would threaten to topple the entire financial system, necessitating trillions of dollars in rescue lending to banks and other firms by governments and central banks. The global financial system hadn't looked more fragile at any point since 1929.  Worse, support for the system was undermined by the fact that Wall Street executives still collected multimillion-dollar bonuses – even as millions of the taxpayers, who helped fund those bonuses, lost their homes.  Within a couple of months of Lehman's bankruptcy, though, a new piece of technology would debut – almost unnoticed – one that appeared to offer an alternative to this catastrophe-prone system. On October 31, 2008, an unidentified individual going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper to a cryptography mailing list.  The paper described ""a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that] would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.""  Satoshi had almost certainly been working on the protocol for months or years prior to Lehman's collapse but, according to Cornell computer science professor and blockchain researcher Emin Gun Sirer, there was a timely motive to the launch.  Sirer told CoinDesk:  ""It's very clear that Satoshi was affected by the events that led up to the financial crisis of 2008, and then it's obviously recorded in the genesis block as well.""  Sirer is referring to the Times of London headline bitcoin's creator pointedly inserted into the first bitcoin block ever mined, on Jan. 3, 2009: ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.""  As awareness of bitcoin spread, different people saw different things in it, but for many, it represented an alternative to fiat currency issued by central banks (which had just fired up the proverbial printing presses again) and the fractional reserve banking system (which had nearly collapsed beneath a mountain of lending).  Most of all, it promised to bypass the financial institutions the crisis had cast such doubt on.  Laszlo Hanyecz, known as ""Bitcoin Pizza Guy"" for becoming the first person to use the cryptocurrency to purchase real-world goods (two pizzas for 10,000 BTC in May 2010), told CoinDesk that he believed bitcoin could replace ""the established system of banks and the endless line of middlemen all taking a cut.""  Yet over the past decade, the worlds of bitcoin – and its cryptocurrency and blockchain offshoots – and traditional finance have begun to interact in ways almost no one would have predicted early on.  Wall Street veterans are decamping to work for firms focused on cryptocurrency. Major financial institutions are flirting with blockchain. And cryptocurrency investors are pushing for the creation of investment vehicles by industry incumbents.  Ten years after bitcoin was born into the flames of the financial crisis, have the cryptocurrency community and Wall Street made nice?  Bitcoin versus the world?  Early on, the ethos around bitcoin was undeniably subversive.  One early adopter and miner, who asked to remain anonymous, told CoinDesk that ""in the very beginning"" there was ""a great deal of discussion about the anarcho-capitalist and/or libertarian ideals"" that bitcoin appeared to make possible.  He mentioned dark web markets such as Silk Road, which used bitcoin, but noted that these rested on a misunderstanding of the protocol's limited anonymity.  Even ignoring its illicit use cases, though, the creation of decentralized money appeared to pose a threat to the established order. It provided, the early adopter said, an escape from ""the interpersonal and cultural damage and destruction done by the monetary monopolies"" – meaning banks and governments.  Taariq Lewis, a long-time cryptocurrency developer whose most recent project is codenamed Lyra Protocols, agreed that ""bitcoin was always meant to bypass the financial system.""  As such, some early bitcoiners worried that participating in such a project could be dangerous.  Stefan Thomas, who discovered bitcoin through the random-browsing site StumbleUpon in 2010, and then went on to work as Ripple's CTO before starting his own venture, told CoinDesk:  ""A lot of people early on in the bitcoin community were very worried that central banks would look at this as a fundamental threat to one of the key, key, pillars of power of the government, which is the ability to issue currency. And so a lot of people early on stayed anonymous, they did not reveal their real identities.""  As it turns out, he said, most of the supposed central bank ""illuminati"" were simply curious about the new technology.  Although, that's not to say that mavens of established finance haven't lashed out on occasion. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO since before the crisis, has called bitcoin a ""fraud,"" though he's since walked that statement back. And Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who bailed Goldman Sachs out in the week following Lehman's bankruptcy, has called bitcoin ""rat poison squared.""  To be sure, for all the hope it's inspired (and acrimony it's generated), bitcoin is far from toppling the incumbent financial system.  Wall Street banks – most of them – not only survived the crisis, but have grown bigger than they ever were before it. Central banks and fiat money show no signs of going anywhere, and bitcoin remains a tiny sliver of the global monetary system.  ""It's turned out,"" said Sirer, ""that undoing the Fed and replacing money as we know it is actually a tall order, and it has to happen in stages if it's going to happen at all.""  In the meantime, he added, ""There's a lot to be had from playing nice with the existing system and making it better.""  l33t meets the Street  The view that bitcoin and traditional finance are anything but oil and water – unthinkable when bitcoin was young and the crisis' wounds were raw – is now practically mainstream.  Thomas described the shift in thinking over the past five years.  In 2013, he said, Ripple was one of the first to think about taking blockchain into the enterprise space, and the typical reaction to that from that time period ran:  ""What the hell are you doing? This is the opposite of the whole point of this. The point is you don't need a bank, why would you work with one?""  He usually replied that banks are where consumers keep their money, so it ""isn't so realistic"" to expect that to change soon.  Tone Vays, a cryptocurrency researcher and consultant who worked at the investment bank Bear Stearns prior to its March 2008 collapse, and subsequently became a VP at JPMorgan Chase, made a similar point.  ""Most people aren't ready yet to be in control of their own private keys,"" he said.  Far from eliminating middlemen, Vays said, the bitcoin ecosystem will have its own banks – in fact, it already does, in the form of Coinbase and other big exchanges.  Nic Carter, who worked as a research analyst for the asset manager Fidelity before joining the cryptocurrency venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures, said much the same thing. Bitcoin demonstrated that ""money and state can be separate,"" he said, but added, ""I don't think bitcoin is incompatible with banks.""  That sentiment is typical of a new generation of bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts and professionals.  Many of them, noted Amber Baldet, who worked as JPMorgan's blockchain program lead before leaving to co-found a new blockchain startup, are ""not necessarily of the same initial philosophy that captured the hearts and minds of early users.""  In fact, Baldet, Vays and Carter have all previously worked in traditional finance.  ""Coming from the world of traditional finance, I am quite optimistic about the intersection of the two,"" said Carter. ""I think cryptocurrency will eventually be financialized and will be custodied by large institutions, regulated markets will emerge, along with all the hallmarks of what will become essentially a vibrant virtual commodity market.""  Indeed, many in the cryptocurrency community appear to be welcoming the entrance of financial incumbents – for instance, bitcoin investors are holding their breath for SEC decisions regarding proposed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  Defining revolution  It's worth noting, though, that despite signs of rapprochement, some in the cryptocurrency community remain wary of Wall Street, central banks and the like.  ""Bankers are experts on all the different kinds of market abuse and they are kept honest by market surveillance and government oversight,"" Hanyecz said. ""In bitcoin markets, anything goes, so I think bitcoiners would be wise to consider that before wishing for more institutional involvement.""  And Carter cautioned that ""bitcoiners will have to be vigilant that bitcoin itself is not totally co-opted.""  But for Zooko Wilcox, old school cypherpunk and CEO of the Zcash Company, the point of cryptocurrency is not to ""convert everyone else in the world to share our revolutionary fervor."" Rather it's to provide people with ""something they need – a fairer, safer, and more efficient financial system.""  The kind of system, in other words, that Lehman's bankruptcy proved the world didn't have.  Cryptocurrency ""began with a small group of hardcore revolutionaries,"" Wilcox said, but:  ""Success will mean billions of people finding cryptocurrency to be convenient and reliable without ever understanding either the scientific or the political revolutions behind it.""

The corporation, which holds stakes in 700 industrial entities in Russia, is working with the Waves platform to develop a blockchain system to manage data on its vast holdings, which include the carmakers Autovaz and Kamaz and the firearms manufacturer Kalashnikov.  Announced Thursday, Rostec has signed an agreement with Vostok, a startup founded by the Waves platform team. The two partners will invest a combined $2 million to bootstrap the project, but Rostec's share was not disclosed. Over the next month, the joint team will present a roadmap for the project.  The project will pave the way for the application of blockchain technology to Rostec's operations – specifically, for standardizing, collecting and analyzing data about the products manufactured under Rostec's supervision, which include both military and civilian goods.  The information coming from these disparate locations to Rostec's head office is not standardized and thus difficult to parse. Blockchain is expected to improve the organization and security of this data, some of which is sensitive military information.  Smart cities  The project will also seek to develop solutions for so-called smart cities, which leverage data to manage urban resources more efficiently. To that end, the project would facilitate the sharing of data via blockchain between federal and municipal government bodies and citizens.  Rostec has already been piloting smart city technology in several Russian cities designed to automatically regulate and adapt power consumption, traffic management, the work of street cameras with face recognition and other systems. These systems will be migrated to blockchain rails, a press representative of Rostec told CoinDesk.  For Waves, the deal is a high-profile partnership that offers the opportunity to reach major players in the Russian economy.  ""Working together with Rostec, which is the main provider and driver for projects in digital economy, will not only get us access to the wide range of corporate and government clients but also will give us a strong impulse for the further development,"" Waves' and Vostok's CEO Sasha Ivanov said in a statement.  Rostec was created in 2007 as a state-funded corporation responsible for accelerating technological development in Russia and is chaired by Sergey Chemezov, one of the closest public officials to president Vladimir Putin.  Rostec was assigned a key role in Digital Economy, the national development program designed by the Russian government to promote innovation in the country. In March 2017, blockchain technology was officially included in the program when prime minister Dmitry Medvedev issued an order to explore the possible use of the tech for managing Russian economic and governance practices.
