42433597,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzUfh,1612995407,Dogecoin's Surging Price Has Resurrected Its Technical Development,"It was all a meme.      Well, Dogecoin still is a meme – just a more expensive meme. And as the price rises from the depths, Dogecoin’s historically scattered development is rising with it.      Take Dogecoin lead maintainer, Ross Nicoll, for example. His last commitment to the open-source project on Github came in October of 2019, but in the past two weeks he’s taken on a handful of new pull requests to make changes to DOGE.      As he and four other Dogecoin developers take up the keyboard in the name of the Shiba Inu-emblazoned memecoin (which is now worth over $9 billion at $0.07 a coin), they’re tasked with upgrading a software whose last major release happened nearly two years ago in June 2019.      “People say it’s a joke coin but we’re very careful to take care of the code. When it took off there was a resurgence in attention and we want to keep the currency operational,” Ross Nicoll told CoinDesk.    Read more: Dogecoin Smokes Its All-Time High After Snoop Dogg Becomes Snoop DOGE  What is Dogecoin?    When Jackson Palmer co-created Dogecoin, he meant it as a joke, a mockery of the cryptocurrency space that he didn’t take seriously. The memecoin launched on Dec. 6, 2013. It's based on Bitcoin’s codebase (it was forked from Litecoin) but its creators tweaked a few of Bitcoin’s key design features.      For one, Dogecoin’s inflation is significantly larger than Bitcoin’s own and it hasn’t had a supply halving since 2014. Each block contains 10,000 DOGE, so some 5.2 billion DOGE are mined each year. Dogecoin’s mining difficulty adjustment (which controls how hard or easy it is to find a block) is tweaked every block, unlike Bitcoin, which adjusts every 2,016 blocks. It is mostly “merged mined” with Litecoin, meaning miners run programs to mine both chains simultaneously.      Additionally, DOGE has faster blocks than Bitcoin (1 minute vs. 10 minutes), so transactions are faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. This comes at the cost of producing many more orphan blocks than Bitcoin – blocks that are rejected by the network and do not contribute to the longest blockchain transaction history.      Dogecoin also includes a community-donated developer fund, which currently holds just over $1,700,000 worth of DOGE. Nicoll said that the developers share access to the fund via a multisignature wallet.    Old doge, new tricks    One of the things that brought Nicoll and others back to DOGE were the “scaling problems” the team discovered. Over the past month, Dogecoin’s full node count (those running the Dogecoin source code and recording the network’s transaction history) has grown from a few hundred to some 1,300, Nicoll said. Most Dogecoin nodes, he continued, are running on the default setting that only allows outbound connections but not inbound ones.      Because Dogecoin node users are not disabling this firewall to allow incoming connections from peer nodes, the network’s topography is wonky, Nicoll explained. Hundreds of nodes only have a one-way connection to the rest of the network, and since they aren’t connecting to other nodes, some wallets are having trouble syncing.      Nicoll and his peers are tackling this problem first. They also have their hands full catching up to the seven major releases Bitcoin Core has made since Dogecoin’s development more or less stopped.      That’s because for many years Dogecoin’s technical development was copied step-for-step from Bitcoin Core, meaning the code for any new Bitcoin release was copied and adapted for Dogecoin. Since March 2014, “[Dogecoin Core] has always been based on Bitcoin,” Dogecoin developer Maximilian Keller told CoinDesk. This was a security decision that he said “has contributed significantly to the stability” of Dogecoin.    Read more: What Is Dogecoin?    “[The Bitcoin] rebuild has gotten extensive review and testing, and ever since we have used the knowledge gained there to push out updates. Given that, I don't see the latest release being that long ago as an issue. It has been running stable, and the rules of the network have not changed since in a way that would put it at risk.      “The Dogecoin network does not necessarily have the same challenges as Bitcoin, so it's less of a pressing issue for us [to update regularly],” Keller said.      The technical mimesis stopped a few years back, so now there’s a gulf in development between the last minor release of Dogecoin (v.1.14.2, which came in November of 2019) and the most recent activity. (If you look at Dogecoin’s GitHub, for example, you’ll notice that all of its top 20 most popular contributors are Bitcoin Core developers).      So Dogecoin’s development group of five is “working on new versions,” primarily Dogecoin version 1.21, which will take aspects of Bitcoin Core 0.21 but will still require remolding the code to fit into Dogecoin’s design, Nicoll said.      He continued to say that it would be best to push the update within a year lest it “get to the point where Bitcoin Core is accelerating away from us.”    Is Dogecoin technically safe?    Nicoll and his compatriots are reinvolving themselves at a time when Dogecoin’s price is howling at the moon, but would they be turning their attention to it if porn stars, rappers and the world’s richest man weren’t tweeting about it?      “We’ll always prioritize security. I’m not going to say that [development] won’t slow down again, but we will always be there looking for security issues to make sure the software is kept up to date,” Nicoll said when asked if new DOGE holders should be leery of Dogecoin’s spotty development.      Looking past Dogecoin’s technical architecture (which, to be clear, does not have any gaping holes), the network’s hashrate is roughly 300 terahashes. To put this into perspective, Bitmain’s latest and most powerful miner produces over 50 terahashes at peak performance and Bitcoin’s hashrate is roughly 161 exahashes (or 161,000,000 terahashes).      But Dogecoin uses the Scrypt hashing algorithm instead of Bitcoin’s SHA-256, which is supposed to be ASIC resistant, meaning Dogecoin is meant to be mined with computer processors (CPUs) or graphics cards (GPUs), resulting in a lower hash, though ASICs like the Antminer L3+ run Skrypt.      It’s theoretically easy (compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum) to 51% attack Dogecoin to cheat its network to steal coins from others. Some back-of-the-napkin figures crunched by CoinDesk suggest that it would cost roughly $8 million to attack the Dogecoin network for a week (using Antminer L3+ ASICs).      Why hasn’t it been attacked, then? Maybe it’s because it really is too much of a joke to be worth it. Then again, maybe it’s because no one is so low as to attack a coin bearing the face of a puppy.

According to a source familiar with the matter, the functionality will see Mastercard customers’ digital currency payments settled in crypto at participating merchants, a first for the financial giant. The company has not yet disclosed which digital currencies it intends to support, or where.      The details shed new light on CEO Michael Miebach’s Q4 pledge to integrate digital currency payments “directly on our network” in a move the new chief, helming his first earnings call on Jan. 28, said will provide maximal flexibility to customers and merchants alike.      Previously, Mastercard supported limited cryptocurrency transactions through its cryptocard partners Wirex and Uphold. But those programs only cover payment, not settlement; the coins are converted to fiat currency well before reaching the merchant.      The new initiative promises to upend that dynamic among the store owners and businesses who opt in. They will be able to conduct their business beyond the bounds of the fiat ecosystem, assuming, of course, their customers have crypto they’re willing to spend.      That’s hardly a safe bet given the buy-and-hold mantra pervading the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The source pointed out most bitcoin buyers primarily treat their coins as investment vehicles, not payment tools. And the source underscored there’s no guarantee Mastercard’s crypto settlement initiative will support bitcoin.      Instead, cryptos will be evaluated against Mastercard’s 2019 “Principles for Blockchain Partnerships” framework, the source said. Released in the wake of Mastercard’s libra exit, the document placed emphasis on stability, consumer protection and regulatory compliance in vetting potential partners.      “Many of today’s 2,600 digital currencies today fail to do this,” Mastercard said at the time.      In a blog post published after this story, Mastercard Executive Vice President for Blockchain and Digital Asset Products Raj Dhamodharan hinted stablecoins will be the primary beneficiary of Mastercard's coming integration.      ""Our philosophy on cryptocurrencies is straightforward: It’s about choice. Mastercard isn’t here to recommend you start using cryptocurrencies. But we are here to enable customers, merchants and businesses to move digital value,"" Dhamodharan said.      Relatively few merchants currently accept crypto, bitcoin or no. Tesla’s stated plans to sell cars for bitcoin remains a hypothetical. A widespread crypto economy is still far from reality.      Read more: Mastercard President Says Crypto Patents Will Pay Off When Central Bank Digital Currencies Arrive      But Mastercard has been laying the groundwork for that future through years of patents around the digital currency space. The company said it holds 89 blockchain patents and is waiting for approval on an additional 285 around the world.      In the U.S. those filings have included: methods to keep crypto transactions private, on-chain credit card payment verification, instant blockchain payment processing and how to handle crypto refunds, among others.      Mastercard first filed a patent for handling bitcoin payments in 2013 but abandoned that effort in 2015. It began hiring a team of wallet developers and crypto veterans in 2019. The company now hosts a platform through which central banks can test digital currencies.      The payments space is rushing to support blockchain-based currencies at a pace not seen since Bitcoin pioneered the concept of stateless, peer-to-peer immutable transactions in 2009. PayPal intends to roll out bitcoin payment functionality later this year. Visa’s CEO said the rival company may add crypto payments in the future.

Cryptocurrencies ""challenge the ability of governments to levy taxes and to control capital flows more broadly,"" according to a recent report from Bank of America Securities obtained by CoinDesk. Uncertainty over how the U.S. governments will act to limit these use cases presents an key risk for cryptocurrency investors.      ""Encrypted private wallets with digital assets that can be transferred across borders would seem to undermine the monetary sovereignty of every nation-state,"" the report says.      In an ""extreme case,"" regulators could simply ban all institutions and intermediaries from transacting with cryptocurrencies. Or the government could increase customer information reporting and access requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges, which the report describes as a more plausible possibility.      Also, support for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are not ""just a form of payments competition,"" the report says. ""They are also an effort to replace private digital assets with publicly-controlled ones.""      How effective state-run counter-privacy measures will be is a separate question. The authors admit that no matter how burdensome, anti-privacy regulatory changes ""might instead be meaningless."" Users committed to transaction privacy ""could potentially create a second 'truly private' wallet to which they send currency from their now-public wallet, and continue to make anonymous cross-border transactions.""      ""At some threshold, banning private digital assets would become too politically risky, too disruptive to constituents,"" the report says. But carefully targeted regulations designed to restrict privacy could impose a ""serious burden"" on users.      Bank of America's analysts said they are closely watching the risks and expected responses by the US government to limit private cryptocurrency transactions. And given ""uncertainty about how cryptocurrency markets would react to a reduced-privacy environment,"" the report suggests investors should ""approach digital assets cautiously.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/10/anti-privacy-regulations-pose-risks-for-crypto-investors-bank-of-america-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61e24f376fe70160d65883bb3384389b4e456961-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Not only that, but Tesla has plans to accept bitcoin for purchases going forward.

However, the price of that bitcoin has appreciated 4,100% since the 2013 transaction.

This new category of stocks, whose value climbed as a result of the power of social media, are being called “meme stocks.”      This David and Goliath saga has already come close to bankrupting one hedge fund and caused others to lose billions overnight. Just as a brigade of Reddit-influenced investors was about to fly a victory flag, Wall Street peeked over the Battleship board and changed the rules, in real time, to give themselves an unfair advantage.    Patrick McConlogue left the hedge fund Citadel to co-found the decentralized interoperability protocol Overline.network.    The game is not fair and it never has been. Individual investors, even when operating in a swarm, are destined to lose.      How do I know? I helped design the game.      A few years back, I worked at the massive hedge fund Citadel. The multi-billion dollar fund was caught up in this recent scandal for bailing out hedge fund Melvin Capital after everyday traders on Robinhood appeared close to liquidating the fund through mass buying of the GameStop stock $GME.      My role at Citadel was as a data scientist in Long Term Quantitative Strategies. The entire department, filled with programmers and compliance officers, is dedicated to something called ""alpha,"" which determines the buying strategy of the fund. I was responsible for innovative proprietary technology that capitalizes on public data faster than any other hedge fund. It’s a classic situation of machines against humans. I respect many of my colleagues, the problem isn’t the people; it’s the rules of the game which heavily favor the funds.      See also: State of Crypto: How Will the Government React to GameStop?      With this in mind, let’s return to what happened on the markets recently.      A group of traders on the r/WallStreetBets Reddit thread, now consisting of over 8.8 million members, noticed that someone had overly “shorted” the GameStop stock. They decided it was the perfect time to buy. It was only around $18 per share and easily affordable for the common investor who kept buying, driving up the price of the stock.      As the buying frenzy continued, the hedge funds who had taken the opposite position started to hemorrhage money. BIG money.      The small investors celebrated their success online as news broke that the hedge fund Melvin Capital Management had lost so much on the $GME short position that they had to be bailed out by bigger hedge funds. While the markets were closed, Melvin Capital’s sinking battleship received an emergency infusion of $2.75 billion from Citadel and Point72.    DeFi is not just a new kind of technology. It’s a movement to make trading more transparent.    The next day it became a cause célèbre for the likes of Elon Musk, AOC, Chamath Palihapitiya, and Dave Portnoy. Using their huge online platforms they cheered on the small investors, who by then had identified and invested in other stocks to try to beat the hedge funds at their own game.      That drove millions to join their ranks in buying GameStop in bulk, pushing the price of $GME up astronomically to more than $400 a share. Now a $100 investment at $18 a share was worth $2,200! That’s a lot of money to individual, small and dare I say inexperienced investors. But not so fast. Remember, the game is rigged.      Last month Robinhood – the commission-free stock trading app used by small investors – suddenly shut down buy orders for $GME and a few other stocks that were under siege. Was no one selling any more stock at any price? Was buying this stock suddenly illegal? No, neither was the case. So how was this possible?      See also: Lex Sokolin - Robinhood Can’t Democratize Finance Using Old Tools      On trading apps and platforms like Robinhood, the stock you think you own is not actually yours. More accurately, on Wall Street, those “stocks” on trading platforms are called “derivatives.” Effectively they are a promise from Robinhood that the stock they claim to sell you is a stock they actually have access to in what is referred to as a “clearing house”.      As the small investors bought $GME stock on their platform, Robinhood ran out of the capital required to purchase the actual stock from clearing houses that they were selling to investors as derivatives. Essentially, Robinhood sold more than it had and, when they ran out, they simply froze the ability to buy the stock and only allowed users to place sell orders.      This is where things went from bad to worse. Remember, when the stock price goes down, the people who hold the “shorts” make money. Hedge funds (like Citadel) own supercomputers and have direct access to stock markets. They don't deal with clearing houses. So, while small investors’ stocks (derivatives) were frozen, the hedge funds traded massive positions and quickly earned back the billions in losses they had sustained during the previous few days. This was never a fair fight, as the two entities, institutional and retail investors, were never playing the same game.      See also: Jill Carlson - GameStop and the Real Market Manipulators      Robinhood users, when signing up for the popular trading app that offered “free trading” were likely unaware of their role in the hedge funds’ ability to reap huge profits. More importantly, the small investors in Robinhood had no transparency into the products they thought they were buying. The opaque chain of ownership of assets has even spread beyond the stock market as companies like Tesla, who decided to move their reserves into bitcoin to the tune of $1.5 billion.      The system is broken. Big companies and small investors know it. There is a financial technology that’s been poised to solve this long standing inequity epidemic and has been waiting in the wings to calm the waters and empower small investors.      The solution is decentralized finance or “DeFi”. And traders are flocking to it in droves.      DeFi is not just a new kind of technology. It’s a movement to make trading more transparent. It circumvents centralized control in exchanges like Robinhood and even crypto exchanges like Coinbase to ensure your trades can never be frozen. DeFi defies prioritization of one trader over another because there is no middleman who can change the rules or make any decisions. DeFi is an open source market where middlemen do not exist.      When you press the “Buy” button on Robinhood or other trading apps, literally hundreds of middlemen stand between you and the end stock purchase. There are market makers like Citadel, clearing houses, brokerages, dark pools, and simple technological limitations. Any one of those middlemen complicates the trade to the disadvantage of small investors.      I left Citadel to the DeFi ecosystem to build Overline.network - a transparent exchange technology without middlemen tamper proof and un-freezable. Beyond this, the entire space has significantly matured over the last three years. So much so that billions of dollars from regular investors flow through it every day. Blockchain technology has demonstrated banks are not necessary, and DeFi shows the world you can trade without exchanges.      GameStop got it right with their tagline, “power to the players.” The last month has proved that the people hold the real power in the market, not the hedge funds, and DeFi levels the playing field once and for all.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Patrick McConlogue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/10/market-battleship-why-its-rigged-and-how-defi-can-help,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d58dc5b6e690ea816471ff9c06e4020dac0a770-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That lack of liquidity potentially hurts its use for transactions, the investment bank said.      Addresses holding amounts of bitcoin worth more than $1 million are on the rise, with wallets holding over 100 bitcoin owning over 60% of all coins issued. Almost 30% are held in wallets that hold between 1,000 and 10,000 coins.      In the report, Morgan Stanley said the case for bitcoin as a means of exchange ""becomes harder to defend"" if liquidity continues to fall, as it won't be as attractive a vehicle for trading in goods and services.      This, however, could change with the evolution of products that enable a user-friendly experience for spending crypto assets.      Morgan Stanley highlights PayPal's confirmation of its entry into the bitcoin market in October 2020 as an example of this even if its use proves modest. With 325 million potential customers on PayPal's platform, companies should see significant opportunity in creating products and services that can facilitate the use crypto for buying and selling.

42433599,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzUnh,1612979317,Blockchain Bites: The US vs. Bitcoin?,"Three stories    1. Tesla caught a lucky break in announcing its $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase when it did. The auto giant is reportedly being investigated by Chinese authorities over safety and quality concerns, news that came to light the same day headlines were dominated by Tesla’s treasury, according to CoinDesk markets reporter Muyao Shen.    Media gadflies, like NYU economics professor Nouriel Roubini, have criticized Tesla and bitcoin. Speaking on CoinDesk TV this morning, “Dr. Doom” raised questions about “market manipulation” – including CEO Elon Musk’s public comments on crypto and that a particular wallet “sucks” – and Tesla’s “failing” business model, which, he says, is now being masked by an asset with “no intrinsic value.”  Still, it’s an open question as to whether other corporations will follow Tesla, Square and MicroStrategy’s lead in chipping into dollar reserves with bitcoin. JPMorgan thinks the strategy is an anomaly, due to the crypto’s volatility, while CNBC screaming head Jim Cramer said it’s “almost irresponsible” to not have the asset on a corporate balance sheet. Twitter is reportedly considering it.    2. Decentralized finance is heating up. Most notably, Amazon’s AWS Marketplace is offering Origin Protocol’s decentralized e-commerce platform Dshop to software-as-a-service customers (SaaS), as part of its partner network.    Never mind bitcoin on the balance sheet, a subsidiary of Europe’s biggest telco is taking a stake in DeFi heavyweight Flow Network, a proof-of-stake blockchain, and becoming a data provider to the Chainlink oracle network. (CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports out what this might say about the future of enterprise blockchain.)  Meanwhile, a version of Curve Finance’s automated market maker is being built on Polkadot, a proof-of-stake chain that offers an alternative to Ethereum. Separately a piece of digital land sold for a record 888 ETH.    3. A U.S. citizen is suing the Internal Revenue Service, which could have wide implications for all cryptocurrency holders and privacy rights. CoinDesk privacy reporter Ben Powers gives a rundown of James Harper v. Charles P. Rettig, in which the plaintiff argues the IRS had violated Coinbase users’ constitutional rights by sending 10,000 letters warning they may not have paid taxes properly.    The suit centers around how the government requests and comes into possession of personal data, and whether individuals have lost their right to privacy by dealing with “third parties” like Coinbase. In an increasingly web-mediated world, more and more behavior is based on network technologies – meaning, theoretically, more private information may be subpoenaed by the government.  Nigerian citizens are rejecting governmental overreach in banning cryptocurrencies by turning to peer-to-peer exchanges. “Decentralized systems are hard to ban,” one user told CoinDesk contributor Alyssa Hertig.  At stake    Bitcoin ban? With bitcoin going parabolic and maverick boosters like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor earning ears to the thesis that the dollar is a “melting ice cube,” concerns that the U.S. government could outright ban the cryptocurrency are surfacing.      “If you think the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. government will let this thing get out of hand where literally corporates are starting to replace dollars…” Dan Nathan, founder and principal of Risk Reversal Advisors, said on CNBC yesterday.      Well, as the segment host asked: “What can they do?”      “They can regulate the hell out of it,” the reply went. Indeed, governments across the world are shifting their weight around on crypto. India has floated a ban on “private currencies.” The U.K. recently squashed crypto derivative products and regimes in China and Nigeria have long-standing restrictions on crypto trading.      But whether the U.S. government could interfere with the nascent digital economy is another question. This is the land of the free, after all, and what’s more sovereign than bitcoin? More to the point:      Bitcoin has a $647.2 billion market cap, and much of the infrastructure is being laid down in the U.S. Multi-billion dollar companies like Coinbase are gearing up to go public, while INX is already selling shares on the Ethereum blockchain. Surveys reveal that anywhere from one-tenth to half of the U.S. population owns cryptocurrency.      It’s for these reasons that industry watchers like Wall Street Journal MoneyBeat reporter Paul Vigna think “the ship has sailed” on a full-throttle ban, as he said yesterday afternoon on All About Bitcoin, a new CoinDesk TV show.      This morning on First Mover, Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith gave a sobering appraisal of the current prospects for crypto regulation: More is coming, but it’s more likely to be informed and beneficial.      Under the Trump administration, regulators like former acting head of the OCC Brian Brooks laid the foundation for “banks and institutions” to grow into their role with cryptocurrencies, Smith argued. This happened despite Brooks’ bosses Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Donald Trump thinking little of the industry.      “With the Biden administration, we’re going to see a much more thoughtful, measured approach [to crypto policy],” Smith argued. This is a particularly insightful comment considering the 11th hour legislative attempt to limit on-chain privacy with FinCEN’s “unhosted wallet rule.” (More on the status of that here.)      “They [Mnunchin’s admin] had written something that was so crazy, without understanding how these networks work that we were able to threaten to sue based on process,” Smith said.      While she predicts Biden appointees to be more open to civil discussion, Smith notes that regulators that know how the snaking process of rule-making works could be dangerous. “It’s a risk that you run when you have someone who knows what they’re doing… They have the ability to inflict an incredible amount of damage,” she said.      Has the ship sailed? It’s hard to say – but commenters aren’t speaking from the dock, waving their hats in farewell. Everyone, regulators, bulls and reporters are all on deck bracing against turbulent waters. Who knows, maybe Roubini is right, maybe it’s a ship of fools.

42433590,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzUTh,1612975780,This Virginia-Based Bank Is Letting Customers Buy Bitcoin at the ATM,"Blue Ridge Bank is letting customers buy bitcoin where they retrieve cash.      Customers at the Charlottesville, Va.-based bank will soon be able to buy and redeem bitcoin at 19 of its ATMs, with an 8% fee on transactions. To make this happen, the bank has partnered with BluePoint ATM solutions, a national ATM operator, and LibertyX, a Boston-based bitcoin ATM software provider.      The number of bitcoin ATMs surged last year as the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for contactless payments. The bank joins a small list of community banks interested in serving the bitcoin community, including New York-based Quontic Bank, which launched a bitcoin rewards debit card this year.      Blue Ridge has $2.8 billion in assets after completing a merger with Richmond-based Bay Banks early last year, and adopted the service to further evolve for serving the next generation of customers, said CEO Brian Plum.      The bank didn’t act in response to requests from its current customer base, Plum told CoinDesk in an interview.      “You do have growing interest in cryptocurrencies,” Plum said. “It doesn’t diminish what we can do with our current ATMs, so it’s not like this was a matter of substitution.”    Read more: Number of Bitcoin ATMs Up 85% This Year as Coronavirus Drives Adoption    Anti-money laundering watchdogs have warned of the potential for illicit activity posed by bitcoin ATMs. In June 2020, a CipherTrace report said bitcoin ATMs were used to send money to “high-risk exchanges” known for facilitating criminal activity.      The ATMs limits for bitcoin purchases are capped at $5,000 per day, said Justin Pence, BluePoint’s chief operating officer. Customers are also buying the bitcoin with a bank-issued debit card, he added.      In April of last year, Blue Ridge extended a Paycheck Protection Program loan to MobileCoin, but the bank does not yet have a core crypto banking team, Plum said.      “We are open and pursuing what makes the most sense for us based on economics and the regulatory environment,” Plum said about potential additional crypto services in the future. “It is a volatile space. If you think about commercial banking it is anything but a volatile business. … A lot of what’s happening in crypto right now is exciting, but you need to have the infrastructure in place.”      Update (Feb. 10, 17:53 UTC): Additional comments added from Blue Ridge and BluePoint executives.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/10/this-virginia-based-bank-is-letting-customers-buy-bitcoin-at-the-atm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c83e7091c7a4e1b97b2a49f97977a557ecb3c14-576x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Inflation watch: European shares and U.S. stock futures were higher as Bloomberg News reported that ""inflation has quickly become the biggest issue in markets on speculation the Federal Reserve will let the economy run hot out of the pandemic."" The U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday in its monthly CPI report that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in January, for a 1.4% increase over the past 12 months. The headline reading was in line with economists' expectations.    The News    Argo Blockchain plans new bitcoin mine in western Texas: The publicly-listed company has agreed to buy 320 acres of land to build the 200-megawatt data center, at a cost of $17.5 million to be funded via the issuance of ordinary shares. Argo will use a $100 million credit facility to fund the construction of the site, which ostensibly would be one of the world's largest bitcoin mines.      Bitcoin ""can’t be stopped"": Nigerians look to peer-to-peer exchanges after crypto ban. Some Nigerians plan to continue using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies despite a directive issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria last week ordering banks to close down accounts associated with cryptocurrencies.      Salesforce.com going remote: The company is the largest private employer in San Francisco and occupant of the city's tallest building, known as the Salesforce Tower, and yet it's planning for most employees to work remotely part- or full-time after the pandemic, the Wall Street Journal reports. First Mover has written previously about how a permanent shift toward remote working could represent one of the biggest labor-market trends in generations, and yet the Federal Reserve and other economic authorities have barely begun to address the transition.    Market Moves    Everybody wants bitcoin, but where will it come from?      A collision course is setting up in the bitcoin market: a wave of new buyers appearing just as easily obtained supplies of the cryptocurrency fall to their lowest levels in more than three years.      Electric-vehicle maker Tesla's announcement this week that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin triggered a new round of wagering that more corporate treasurers might soon follow CEO Elon Musk's lead.      At least one Wall Street analyst argued that iPhone maker Apple, the world's largest company, should push into the game. There's also speculation that software giant Oracle might be next, partly fueled by CEO Larry Ellison's service on Tesla's board of directors. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft could all be candidates, suggests Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics.      Even the obstreperous CNBC personality Jim Cramer weighed in on Tuesday: ""Every treasurer should be going to boards of directors and saying, 'Should we put a small portion of our cash in Bitcoin?'"" Cramer said on the financial-news network. (A JPMorgan analyst, for what it's worth, argues that corporate treasurers are likely to be turned off by bitcoin's notorious price volatility.)      Yet, if companies start buying bitcoin en masse, finding fresh supplies of the cryptocurrency is likely to come at a cost, according to professional analysts in digital-asset markets.      The number of bitcoins sitting on cryptocurrency exchanges – ostensibly ready for a quick sale if the price is right – has fallen to about 2.3 million, the lowest since July 2018, based on data from Glassnode, a blockchain analysis firm. It's down from about 3 million as recently as early 2020.      The decline may reflect the activity of big investors who bought bitcoin over the past year and then swiftly transferred their holdings to custody providers or offline ""cold storage"" solutions, awaiting long-term gains, according to Arcane Research, a Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm.      ""A proper supply crisis is taking place in front of our eyes,"" the Arcane analysts wrote.      Prices for bitcoin are already up 62% year-to-date, versus 4.1% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks. That track record alone might be enough to tempt more companies, investment firms, endowments, pension plans, governments, endowments, pension plans and regular people – especially at a time when bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against currency debasement, during an era of easy-money policies from central banks around the world.      ""If you think bitcoin is lively now, wait till there's a liquidity crunch,"" says Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS.      Some 900 new bitcoins are minted each day by the underlying blockchain network, worth roughly $42 million at current prices.      Compare that with the $2.02 billion that has flowed into bitcoin-focused investment products so far this year, based on a report Tuesday from the digital-asset manager CoinShares. That works out to an average $51.9 million per day.      And the CoinShares report doesn't even cover demand from investors or corporate treasurers who may be buying bitcoin directly through their own accounts, or from retail traders who are looking for a piece of the action.      The math is pretty simple: There's not a lot of bitcoin for sale at current price levels.      ""Holders are not selling their bitcoin in response to price increases,"" says Philip Gradwell, chief economist for the blockchain-forensics firm Chainalysis. ""If this behavior continues, then price should continue to rise if demand continues.""    Bitcoin Watch    ""Doji candle"" signals indecision, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole writes      Bitcoin's daily price chart shows signs of indecision in the form a Doji candle. The range play is typical of price consolidation seen after a notable rally.    If buyers fail to defend Tuesday's low of $45,060, bitcoin may revisit the former record high of $41,962, now perceived as a new level of support.  Token Watch    Ether (ETH): Second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit fresh all-time high Tuesday of $1,824, according to CoinDesk 20 data. “We expect some exhaustion on ether coming from the price itself, above $2,200, but also from the fees to use the network itself while solutions are being built to tackle this issue,” Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey.      Litecoin (LTC): Alternative cryptocurrency hits 3-year highas network activity picks up, with the number of new addresses climbing to the highest since 2019.      DeFi Soars: Collateral locked in decentralized-finance protocols closes in on $40 billion, up from about $1 billion a year ago, according to DeFi Pulse:    First Person    Opinions and observations      Has Ethereum already passed threat from Ethereum killers? Sure, other ""smart-contract"" blockchains might eventually do what Ethereum does, and do it faster and cheaper. But ""Ethereum's immense intangible assets are the real moat behind its dominance,"" including a cryptocurrency brand second only to Bitcoin's and a ""fanatically loyal community,"" Zabo co-founder Alex Treece writes for CoinDesk Opinion.      End of ""Petrodollar"" era could loosen U.S. dollar's domination as global reserve currency, according to Reuters column by Mike Dolan.      ""Investors who have grown accustomed to central banks always coming to the rescue could find themselves in serious pain"" if inflation ticks up and the Federal Reserve steps in to tighten monetary policy, columnist James Mackintosh writes for WSJ.      Bitcoin to Keep Dominating? David Russell, an analyst for TradeStation, emails First Mover to say: ""Lots of people expected a rally in altcoins this year, and there are legitimate reasons to like smaller coins associated with the growth of DeFi. But investors shouldn’t overlook the much bigger trend of institutional adoption, which could channel hundreds of billions of dollars into the market much faster than anyone thought. It’s a completely different catalyst that could disproportionately favor bitcoin at the expense of altcoins. DeFi and Altcoins offer a steady trickle of innovation and excitement. But institutional adoption could represent a tsunami of cash. Risk-averse corporations and institutions are doing the buying. If they’re just now getting the courage to enter a market that was previously viewed as risky, they will favor the safest asset in that market. This is similar to global investors in a new emerging market. They often target the biggest and most mainstream companies like banks and telecoms rather than smaller industrials.""      Opportunism is alive and well in crypto: After just two days, it appears that a website called The Doge Store is already selling a T-shirt for $19.99 with the words ""Elon's Candle"" and an image of bitcoin's price chart (candle view) leading up to the moment earlier this week when Tesla announced its $1.5 billion purchase of the cryptocurrency. By the way, the 19.5% price jump over the course of Feb. 8 was the largest daily move in percentage terms since Dec. 7, 2017, and also represented the largest-ever daily price increase in absolute dollar terms, at more than $7,500, according to Arcane Research.

42433576,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzOHh,1612967419,How Traditional Exchanges Are Boosting Crypto Adoption,"Over the past year, demand for regulated crypto investment products has soared.      The increasing variety of exchange-traded products (ETPs) listed on traditional exchanges, and the rapid development of indices, have enabled more investors to gain exposure to crypto assets without the complexities of ownership and custody.    Clara Medalie heads research and market analysis at Kaiko, a provider of institutional-grade crypto market data.    Crypto ETPs are now traded in Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Austria, Sweden, Gibraltar and have been green-lighted in Hong Kong, with new applications awaiting approval in a handful of other countries. Further, the launch or planned development of crypto indexes by CME Group, CBOE, Nasdaq, Bloomberg, S&P Dow Jones, and IHS Markit lays the groundwork for a variety of tradable funds and derivatives products.      Traditional exchanges serve as the infrastructural interface between market participants ranging from licensed issuers to calculation agents to data providers to custodians, which is why the growth and diversity of crypto investment products will depend heavily on their lead. Collaboration with the crypto industry for the infrastructural requirements of these products will be crucial for ensuring success, which has the potential to drive a virtuous cycle of market efficiency.      Let’s take a look at the role that exchanges play.      The flurry of crypto ETP activity has been led by Germany’s Deutsche Boerse and Switzerland’s SIX exchange.      SIX exchange now lists 22 crypto ETPs from seven issuers and recently reported record numbers of trades and order book turnover. In early January, a Bitcoin ETP on Deutsche Boerse reported average daily volumes at €57 million, up from €15.5 million the previous month, and nearly equal to that of the highest volume ETF on the exchange.      The willingness of these exchanges to collaborate with crypto industry participants and invest in the infrastructure required to list these products has encouraged a group of innovative ETP issuers seeking to capitalize on surging demand for regulated offerings. Companies like CoinShares, VanEck, 21Shares, FiCAS AG, and WisdomTree have thus far all successfully listed crypto ETPs in Europe.      In the U.S., exchange-traded crypto products have faced a series of regulatory hurdles that have prevented any approvals. Yet, a powerful alternative has emerged, highlighting the ever-growing demand for regulated investment vehicles.    Crypto trusts    A crypto trust is a type of fund typically run by a professional management team. Accredited investors are able to invest in these trusts by purchasing shares over-the-counter, and there are fewer regulatory requirements compared with publicly traded ETPs.    The best example is the Grayscale Trust, which offers several funds tied to the value of crypto-assets whose shares can be purchased over-the-counter. Grayscale (which is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group) has become an indomitable force in crypto markets, with billions in AUM and yearly returns of +200%https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-investment-trust/#market-performance. Grayscale leads institutional investing in the U.S. through its regulated crypto offering and is the best evidence yet of demand for these types of products, which are not yet available on traditional exchanges.    See also: BlockFi’s Bitcoin Trust Takes Aim at GBTC      Yet, OTC-traded trusts have several disadvantages compared with traditional exchange-traded products: ETP markets are more liquid which makes price discovery more efficient, investors can easily enter or exit markets without having to lock up funds for a given time period, and the structure and rules of an ETP are fixed which provides an additional layer of security for an investor.      Ultimately, the approval of an ETP in the U.S. would pose a significant challenge to the business model of funds like Grayscale. Investors typically prefer the increased flexibility and efficiency that comes with ETPs, which positions traditional exchanges to take the lead pending regulatory approval.    Indexes drive ETPs    The crypto indices developed by exchanges and data providers over the past few years have driven the growth and diversification of crypto investment products. Indices provide information about the price performance of an asset or basket of assets, and can be leveraged to build ETPs, funds and derivatives.      CME’s cryptocurrency indices have enabled the launch of a variety of bitcoin and ethereum futures and options contracts. Open interest for CME’s derivatives contracts soared in 2020, at one point surpassing that of all other crypto derivatives exchanges. The huge success of CME’s crypto derivatives offering is the best example yet of how traditional exchanges are driving adoption. CME’s derivatives markets have improved overall market efficiency, which drives more investors to participate, which drives further efficiency – a virtuous cycle.      Other exchanges and data providers are taking note: CBOE, Nasdaq, IHS Markits, and S&P Dow Jones have all either already launched or announced plans for crypto indices in 2021, which could eventually be used in tradeable crypto products.    Europe vs. the U.S.    We can see a clear divergence in regulated products on either side of the Atlantic. Europe is much more ETP-friendly, while the U.S. has become a force in regulated crypto derivatives and indexes.      The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has staunchly rejected any crypto ETP proposals thus far, turning down exchange-traded fund (a type of ETP) applications filed by Bitwise, Wilshire Phoenix and VanEck. Europe has taken a much friendlier approach towards ETPs, but has been notably stricter with derivatives, with a recent ban in the U.K. on crypto derivatives.      See also: S&P Dow Jones Indices to Launch Crypto Indexes in 2021      In both regions, innovation has thrived when regulation allows it.      In a recent report published by Bitwise and ETF Trends on financial advisors, 47% of respondents noted that the approval of a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. would make them more comfortable allocating crypto to client portfolios, a sign that regulation is currently one of the biggest roadblocks to adoption.    In conclusion    We are still in the very early stages of cryptocurrency financial products and there remain many regulatory hurdles to pass.      Yet, what we do know is that adoption is accelerating and regulators and exchanges, at least in some countries, are open to innovation. The pace of ETP applications has picked up considerably over the past year, indicating that demand is surging and companies are racing to fill this gap.      As regulatory frameworks become clearer, the willingness of traditional exchanges to build the infrastructure to support tradable crypto products will drive further market efficiency. However, collaboration with crypto actors will be crucial to the success of these initiatives.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Clara Medalie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/10/how-traditional-exchanges-are-boosting-crypto-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41398dd3f34889b972c8e9365499a93c4082f4f4-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Litecoin traded at $195 earlier on Wednesday, its highest level since March 2018, according to CoinDesk 20 data. At the lower press-time price of $180, the cryptocurrency is up 8.3% on a 24-hour basis.      Litecoin's network activity has picked up alongside the 25% price gain seen this week alone. The number of active addresses has risen to 231,973 – the most since June 5, 2020, according to data source Glassnode. Meanwhile, the number of new addresses has increased to a 22-month high of 101,862.      The uptick in the number of new addresses is widely taken to represent an influx of investors. However, it is not a perfect indicator, as a single user can own multiple addresses.      Cardano (ADA) is also seeing keen trading, having surged by 28% to over $0.87 – a level last seen in January 2018.

42433580,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzONh,1612960200,Valid Points: Eth 2.0 Validators Earn Record $1.2M as ETH Price Rallies,"“The biggest risk for Ethereum is that it could end up like the Concorde.”      That’s Lyn Alden, a renowned investment strategist, who wrote a blog post a few weeks back reviewing the Ethereum protocol from an investor’s perspective.      In her post, Alden points out that one of the biggest risks for the value of ether is that Ethereum never reaches mass adoption, just like the Concorde jet of the 1970s. While the Concorde was functional and operational for over 25 years, Alden writes, it never quite reached the product market fit it was seeking for commercial flight.      Ethereum has ambitious goals in aiming to become the world’s supercomputer. Developers of Ethereum anticipate the network will eventually host and run millions of active decentralized applications (dapps) ranging from finance to gaming to business and more.      Key to this vision is a base layer protocol able to handle influxes of millions of dapp users and their transactions. The base layer of Ethereum, built for its long-term use case and vision, is Ethereum 2.0.      So whether you’re an Ethereum enthusiast, critic or somewhere in between, it’s hard to understate the importance of Eth 2.0 to the value of ether (ETH) in the eyes of investors.      This week, we'll explore ideas for a new Ethereum-compatible blockchain called LUKSO. Then we'll look at the bullish price activity of ether and how that’s impacting network rewards.    New Frontiers: LUKSO    Ethereum is supposed to be boring.      Lost in the Medium tech explainers and rainbow price charts predicting $20,000 ether by end of the year is an understanding of what the Ethereum ecosystem is actually trying to accomplish: decentralized infrastructure for the internet.      Fabian Vogelsteller – founder of digital economy blockchain LUKSO and co-creator of the ERC-20 token standard – is one entrepreneur zeroing in on that notion as he explores using Ethereum’s passive technology stack for the creative economy.      LUKSO is an Ethereum blockchain but not in the way most conceive of that idea. Rather, it’s a clone of Ethereum that is 100% compatible with user-facing tools such as MetaMask. The project is currently building a new chain based on Catalyst – a clone of the Beacon Chain meshed with a stripped down variant of popular Eth 1.x client Geth that remains in the R&D phase for Eth 2.0 developers – with the end goal of on-boarding the digital economy fringes such as art, clothing and collectibles.      “By combining an execution environment (Catalyst) with a beacon chain running Casper FFG, LUKSO will likely become the first ETH 2.0 Blockchain to execute smart contracts, even before Ethereum itself,” LUKSO’s Medium post from Monday reads.    Proving ownership with NFTs    Nonfungible tokens (NFT) have been hot lately. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban recently sold a handful of NFTs in his likeness for thousands of dollars while the pseudonymous HashMask creators raked in millions over one weekend. LUKSO has also been gaining traction in that arena. The project was used to verify ownership of digital clothing for the Helsinki Fashion Week, according to an August Vogue article.      “By securing each item on a blockchain and providing digital certificates of ownership, digital items can be limited in supply, which ultimately increases their value,” LUKSO co-founder and managing partner Marjorie Hernandez told Vogue.      Unlike other blockchain’s independent of Ethereum, LUKSO is not a competitor in any meaningful sense to Eth 2.0, Vogelsteller said. Rather, it's an independent blockchain for the digital economy that uses Ethereum’s tech stack in a similar manner to how Ethereum was originally conceived: as a quasi-programming-language for bringing blockchains to life.      And while it's conceptually simplistic to place blockchains into silos, projects like LUKSO break the mold by showing how Ethereum is more than one blockchain. Indeed, a larger ecosystem of many Ethereum-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum Classic, Quorum or NEAR exist in concert with Ethereum.      By focusing on one specific type of user, moreover, Vogelsteller hopes to address one problem Ethereum has yet to answer: “How can we make it usable for people?”    Pulse checking Eth 2.0    If you’re new to Valid Points and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about jargon and terminology used throughout this newsletter.      Ether price seems to be hitting new all-time highs every day this week.      On Monday, news of Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin and the launch of CME ether futures sent prices to fresh all-time highs at around $1,720. On Tuesday, ether prices rallied again, even as sell-side liquidity dried up, and registered an even bigger high of $1,824.      As investors and traders scramble to revalue ether in uncharted price territories, miners and validators on Ethereum’s dual blockchain network are reaping record-breaking revenue.      Ethereum 2.0 validators earned their highest daily total income ever on Feb. 8, at $1.2 million. This only accounted for roughly 2% of what Ethereum miners earned that same day, which was in the ballpark of $52.2 million.      The additional ether generated on Eth 2.0 by validators is a small fraction of what miners are making on Ethereum. While the total income of validators is expected to grow as new validators enter the network and Ethereum is eventually merged in Eth 2.0, it is not likely to ever reach the same amounts as those that miners receive.      This is because Eth 2.0, by nature of being a proof-of-stake protocol, is projected to issue ether as a form of rewards at a much slower and reduced rate than in a proof-of-work protocol. Eth 2.0 issues rewards in the form of annual interest that accrues to the staked ether of validators, instead of in the form of block rewards to miners.      On the topic of network rewards, the CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator is ready for activation on Eth 2.0 in roughly seven days time. I’m excited to watch first-hand how interest accrues to the 32 ETH CoinDesk has staked on the network and the overall performance of our independent validator setup.

Runets did not disclose the names of the buyer or seller involved in the transaction, or the type of equipment imported.  According to data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Russia currently accounts for 6.9% of global crypto mining capacity, putting it in third place behind the U.S. (7.24%) and China (65.08%).

""The main issue with the idea that mainstream corporate treasurers will follow the example of Tesla is the volatility of bitcoin,"" JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday.      Tesla, the Fortune 500 electric car maker headed by Elon Musk, disclosed its bitcoin investments worth $1.5 billion on Monday, sending the cryptocurrency to fresh record highs above $48,000. Crypto traders expect other corporates to follow suit, arguing Tesla has validated bitcoin's appeal as a reserve asset.      However, according to JPMorgan's strategists, a corporate portfolio's risk levels would rise significantly even with a small exposure to bitcoin, and that could keep other companies from buying in.      ""Corporate treasury portfolios are typically stuffed with bank deposits, money market funds, and short-dated bonds, meaning that annualized volatility – or the range of swings during the course of a year – hovers around 1%,"" JPMorgan wrote, adding that a 1% bitcoin exposure would cause a significant increase in a portfolio's volatility to as much as 8%.      The bank's strategists, however, acknowledged the positive impact of Tesla investment on the bitcoin market. ""There is no doubt that this week's announcement changed abruptly the near-term trajectory for bitcoin by bolstering inflows and by helping bitcoin to break out above $40k,"" they said.

42433575,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzODh,1612951034,Chainlink Supporter Deutsche Telekom Has Quietly Started Staking on Blockchains,"Deutsche Telekom AG, Europe’s largest telecommunications company by revenue, is now one of the main data providers to Chainlink – the omnipresent oracle service on which decentralized finance (DeFi) relies.      Not only that, Deutsche Telekom subsidiary T-Systems Multimedia Solutions (MMS), says it has begun staking on the Flow Network, the ultra-scalable proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain from CryptoKitties creator Dapper Labs, and has plans to begin staking on several other chains in the near future.      Yes, Deutsche Telekom is providing DeFi data support and has quietly gone beyond helping with the infrastructure of PoS blockchains and actually started custodying, staking and earning crypto rewards.      But lumbering telco giants are meant to be mired in enterprise blockchain proofs-of-concept, or stuck doing rather dull blockchain-as-a-service cloud offerings, right?      “We started roughly five years ago, like everyone else, doing all those enterprise blockchain proofs of concept,” said Andreas Dittrich, head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom. “But we gradually began to feel we were not focusing enough on public blockchains. This is where digital value will be moved in the future, and it’s really where a telco should be active.”      T-Systems announced it was going to run a Chainlink node back in summer of last year, right around the time DeFi basically exploded. Since then, it’s been “a hell of a ride,” admits Dittrich.      “We were really jumping into something new, providing public blockchain infrastructure and having a token-natured business model on top of that,” he said. “So, of course, we started really small, with few data feeds. But then scaled rapidly, and by now, I think we are among the top three data providers at the moment on the Chainlink network.”      Chainlink’s system of data feeds, known as oracles, pipes information into the blockchain world of smart contracts, eliminating reliance on any single, centralized source.      “We are providing 51 data feeds right now,” said Gleb Dudka, an analyst at T-Systems. “We don't handpick applications we provide data to, but examples would be Synthetix, a few decentralized exchanges, Nexus Mutual for insurance. The data is mostly digital asset prices, FX rates, and commodity prices like gold, silver, etc., and these mostly go to Synthetix.”      It’s only a matter of time until other big enterprise firms follow Deutsche Telekom’s example and run Chainlink nodes, said the network’s co-founder, Sergey Nazarov.      “Chainlink enables top infrastructure teams like T-Systems to monetize their globally distributed infrastructure and security expertise across the many chains already being served by Chainlink oracles,” Nazarov told CoinDesk via email.    Ethereum 2.0 staking?    Providing complex infrastructure for the internet is something Deutsche Telekom has done for decades (it’s also worth pointing out the telco has its own cloud offering and so reduces reliance on the likes of AWS). So on the surface of it, there should be nothing surprising about it providing infrastructure support for the incipient “internet of value.”      However, Dittrich acknowledges there’s an interesting blurring of the line between IT services and financial services.      The hardest part was getting this right from a legal, risk management and tax perspective, Dittrich said. T-Systems partnered with Bankhaus Scheich as a broker and Berlin-based crypto custodian Finoa, one in a slew of German firms waiting in line for a crypto custody license from regulator BaFIN.      “It’s quite a unique thing, because our business model means we need to be able to handle crypto tokens,” said Dittrich. “We need to have them on our balance sheet, various types of crypto tokens. And that's a hard thing to pull off for a company like us.”      Dittrich said his team has been busy looking at a range of other crypto staking candidates. The elephant in the room in this case has to be Ethereum 2.0 staking, the largest blockchain after Bitcoin, which is the first phase of its transformation to PoS.      See also: Deutsche Telekom, Alibaba Cloud, Citi Join Hyperledger Blockchain Project      “We are not doing Ethereum 2.0 staking yet,” said Dudka. The ETH T-Systems buys is needed for Chainlink, he said, and has to be spent in order to sign transactions on the Ethereum public mainnet.      “There are quite a few networks in the pipeline that we plan to go live on,” Dittrich added. “Obviously, the bigger proof-of-stake networks are in there, be that Tezos, Polkadot, Ethereum 2.0, you name it.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | LINK | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/10/chainlink-supporter-deutsche-telekom-has-quietly-started-staking-on-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80ef691b68e8e00be9b24d18f2f934856da1cc2a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lygon, a blockchain-based platform and joint venture involving the ANZ, Westpac and Commonwealth banks, shopping center operator Scentre Group and IBM, announced the ""milestone"" news Wednesday, saying it began trialing its technology mid-way through 2019.      The venture's objective was to bring the 200-year-old paper-based bank guarantee process ""into the digital era.""      Normally in a paper-based system, validations on bank guarantees can take anywhere from a few days to a month because the process relies on cross-checking information manually. By digitizing that process, Lygon said it has demonstrated it can reduce the verification time to as little as 24-hours.      ""Lygon is paperless, transparent, accessible and standardized, removing the inefficiencies, costs, and risks associated with a paper-based system,"" said Lygon's CEO Justin Amos. ""This is the first time blockchain has been used for a commercial banking product in Australia.""      See also: Australia’s Central Bank Says Bitcoin ‘Not Really Money,’ No Risk to Financial Stability      Amos added that the platform's technology can be ported to other types of payment guarantees and financial instruments, such as performance bonds and tenancy agreements.

EY has not yet shared details about how the domain was seemingly hijacked.      A website imitating the defunct cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX has been posted online as of Tuesday, hoping to lure unsuspecting victims.      A warning notification was sent out on Tuesday from both the exchange's law firm Miller Thomson, which represents the now-former users of Quadriga, and Ernst and Young (EY), a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee for the exchange. The website can be accessed at the same URL that the actual exchange used during its operations and which in 2019 and 2020 directed visitors to visit a portal on EY.      ""The Trustee has advised that a new website has been posted to www.quadrigacx.com which is an imitation of the original website/portal of Quadriga,"" said the law firm in its post.      It went on to say the imitation site is not authorized by EY and is not associated with the ""Big Four"" accounting firm. Miller Thomson said affected users should not attempt to access the site or provide any personal information, including previous Quadriga passwords or identification documents.      Similarly, EY is circulating a notice to affected users warning them of the fake website.      ""The Trustee [EY] believes the imitation website has been posted using backups of the Quadriga webpage publicly available on the internet,"" said EY. ""The imitation website may be being used by a person or entity to obtain personal and confidential information of affected users.""      A spokesperson for EY referred CoinDesk to its public Quadriga portal, adding, ""we’re not able to comment further outside of our public documentation.""      An attorney with Miller Thomson likewise noted that the firm had published a warning on its portal.      Neither company said who might be responsible for the site. A WHOIS search on the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) show that the domain's current owner has hidden the contact information.      See also: Trustee of Collapsed Exchange Moves to Resolve Crypto vs. Fiat Creditor Claims Tussle      Quadriga was previously Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange before it went offline in January 2019 following banking issues, stalled customer withdrawals and the reported death of CEO Gerald Cotten in December 2018.      EY has been tasked with recovering Quadriga's funds by the Canadian court system, which it's been working on since 2019. As of January 2021, it had recovered somewhere between $224 million CAD ($176 million U.S. as of press time) and $291 million CAD ($229 million U.S.), depending on how a court decides to value the cryptocurrencies recovered to date.
