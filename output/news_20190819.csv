42403163,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf9Fl,1566253364,New York Supreme Court Denies Bitfinex's Lack-of-Jurisdiction Claim,"Update (09:40 UTC, Aug. 20 2019): Bitfinex (iFinex) and Tether are appealing yesterday's decision by the New York Supreme Court, according to a notice submitted later in the day.      Bitfinex and Tether must continue turning over documents about an alleged $850 million cover-up to the New York Attorney General (NYAG), a judge ruled Monday.  As a result, the crypto exchange and stablecoin issuer will need to continue cooperating with courts to make public information about a loan the latter company made to Bitfinex, though the companies are expected to appeal the ruling.  The decision gives Bitfinex and Tether another 90 days to turn over documents amid the ongoing investigation by the New York Attorney General's office (NYAG), which filed for an injunction in April after alleging that Bitfinex was trying to cover up the loss of $850 million held by a payment processor called Crypto Capital.  Cohen said the injunction would expire on Oct. 14, adding:  ""The Court disagrees with the Petitioner that it is (or can be) premature for the Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction to issue orders impacting the rights of Respondents in this proceeding. That said, the Court finds based on the evidence and applicable law that it has jurisdiction – and a clear statutory mandate – to adjudicate this matter. Accordingly, Respondents’ motion is denied, and the temporary stay of the investigation is dissolved.""  At the time, the NYAG's office claimed that Bitfinex and Tether had negotiated a line of credit, enabling Bitfinex to borrow as much as $700 million from Tether's reserves. The line of credit would have allowed the exchange to borrow another $200 million, but an injunction imposed by Cohen in May froze any further lending.  However, Bitfinex and Tether were still required to hand over a number of documents pertaining to the companies' relationship and the deal. Attorneys for the companies filed a motion to dismiss the NYAG's case entirely, claiming that the government did not have any jurisdictional authority over the companies, which claimed to not operate in New York or serve any New York-based customers.  While oral arguments were heard in court on July 29, Cohen said he needed a bit more time to deliberate before making a final ruling.  In a letter submitted a day after the hearing, Bitfinex and Tether attorneys said the companies had already spent $500,000 just finding documents to comply with the existing injunction, putting 60 different lawyers to work to pull files from 10 different communications systems.  The firms have since appealed Monday's ruling.  The firms stated in the document:    ""The trial court lacked personal jurisdiction because service was defective and because Petitioner failed to show that the Respondents engaged in purposeful activity toward New York. The trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the cryptocurrency that is the focus of Petitioner's investigation is neither a commodity or security, as required for jurisdiction under the Martin Act.      The trial court incorrectly held that the Martin Act could be applied extraterritorially because the language of Gen. Bus. L. § 354 does not provide for extraterritorial reach. Respondents seek a reversal of the Decision and Order on Motion in its entirety.""        Nikhilesh De contributed to this report.

The Israeli Capital Market Authority is looking to change how fintech licenses are distributed in Israel according to a Monday announcement reported by Israeli daily newspaper Calcalist. Some 2,000 fintech and blockchain-businesses are currently seeking licenses from the state regulator. Due to the glut, the Authority is setting up a licensing fast track.  Per Calcalist, the fast-tracking program consists of creating small industry specific Authority teams reviewing applications.  “Business and technological innovation and the relationship with the industry are the basic principles that guide the Authority in its operations,"" said the head of the Authority Dr Moshe Barkat. “The Authority is engaged in the licensing and regulation of fintech companies on a regular basis, including digital insurance companies, P2P platforms and credit providers, digital wallets, Blockchain-based fintech ventures and other payment services providers.”  The Authority is also reviewing its current standards concerning fintech insurance.  The Authority's move is part of a greater effort by the Israeli Ministry of Finance’s work promoting financial innovation. The regulator recently joined the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN), says Calcalist. The World Bank and International Monetary Authority (IMF) are also members.

42430874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJph,1566237646,BitPay Says Crypto Spending on Real Estate to Double in 2019,"A luxury condominium complex in Orlando, Florida, is the latest firm to partner with BitPay to provide bitcoin payment processing for real estate transactions.  Announced August 6, the Grove Resort & Water Park will accept bitcoin for purchases of their 878 resort-style condo residences. Yet, the relatively small update hides a larger story – BitPay is becoming somewhat of an established name in the real estate market.  In 2017, the company processed nearly $20 million in real estate development and real estate sales. Following the bottoming out of the cryptocurrency market in 2018, this figured dropped to around $6 million, according to BitPay's chief commercial officer, Sonny Singh.  In the first two quarters of this year, however, the company says it has already processed over $5 million in real estate transactions. Singh said BitPay is in line to double its real estate business year over year, as in 2018 the company processed $2.7 million in direct real estate transactions with ""around twice as much via escrow companies and law firms acting as escrows.""  BitPay, the world’s largest processor of bitcoin with about $1 billion in yearly business, acts as a payment processor for home buyers. The firm exchanges bitcoin into U.S. dollars and transfers the funds to an escrow agent on behalf of the buyer.  Singh said the company performed its first real-estate transaction through California-based real estate agent Piper Moretti about four years ago. Since then, the company has processed “millions” in real estate transactions for corporations and individuals, with 2019 looking like its top year to date.  According to Singh, the average price of a home purchased through the exchange is around $1 million. “These are not $30,000 houses,” he said.  The company has standing relationships with a number of developers and real-estate agents including Magnum Real Estate and JetRE, which deal in Manhattan properties. It also processes real estate transactions in some of the world's most expensive housing markets, including Dubai.  About 79 percent of BitPay's real estate transactions happened abroad, though 34 percent of the dollar value came from domestic U.S. buyers.  Latest partner  For their part, Grove Resort condos sell from $330,000 to $595,000, for a property five minutes outside Disney World.  In recent months, David D’Ambrosio, a director at the resort, said there’s been an uptick in potential clients from China, Turkey and Brazil inquiring about cryptocurrency purchases.  “It was easy to determine the potential market available,” said D'Ambrosio, suggesting that “bitcoin hodlers” were looking for a way to diversify their portfolios.  D’Ambrosio said his company contacted BitPay because the firm “has done a couple of billion in transactions, and at least a few million in real estate just in Florida and Southeast U.S.""  BitPay charges a 1 percent processing fee and settles within seconds, whereas a bank wire charges around 5 percent and could take several days to come in, according to Singh. D’Ambrosio said, depending on the circumstances, Grove Resort “as developers could help contribute towards that [processing fee], we could help pay for the title fee.”  The resort currently only accepts bitcoin, but may add other currencies down the line.

42430872,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJnh,1566230415,Bank of America Seeks to Patent Crypto Wallet That Works Like Valet Car Key,"Bank of America is seeking to patent a ""partitioned"" security system for digital currency wallets that gives different users different levels of access to the stored funds.  The second-largest U.S. bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., filed an application entitled “Multi-Tiered Digital Wallet Security” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in February 2018. The USPTO published the application last week and lists Manu Kurian, senior tech manager at the bank, as the inventor.  The application describes the handling of digital currency with a multi-tiered wallet interface in a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Users would be prompted to enter one password out of several, and one password would open one tier of the wallet while another password would open a different tier. (Think of a valet key that can open a car door but not the trunk.)  Conceptually, the proposal resembles certain types of multi-signature bitcoin wallets, which have been around for years.  The background section of the application explains that there is a need for better digital wallet infrastructure since private keys can be lost and third parties don’t let users exercise complete control over their currency.  The application points to a multi-tier arrangement as one way to improve security:  “Through the digital wallet interface, a user of the user computing device may be able to partition digital currency holdings into one or more differentiated storage compartments or tiers. Each of the one or more compartments may be password secured and may only permit access to the amount of digital currency holdings specified by the user.”  To date, Bank of America has won 36 blockchain patent applications, with 31 pending.  Other recent patent applications filed by the bank include one for blockchain ""regulation architecture"" and another for blockchain architecture to optimize system performance and data storage.

42430862,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJVh,1566219654,'Youngest Bitcoin Millionaire' Willing to Stake it All on Metal Pay,"Metallicus, the startup behind the peer-to-peer payments platform Metal Pay, received an undisclosed angel investment from the youngest bitcoin millionaire, Erik Finman.  In partnership with Metal Pay CEO Marshall Hayner, the two look to develop the first “all-in-one” cryptocurrency banking platform, which includes a 17-digital-asset exchange, a digital bank and a payments application with social features similar to Venmo.  Founded in September, Metal Pay has processed approximately $11 million in total payments from nearly 130,000 registered users across 38 states. On a monthly basis, the company processes $1 million in crypto or fiat for around 30,000 active users, according to Hayner.  Finman staked a modest amount of bitcoin to finance the development of the banking and exchange ecosystem, he said, which currently holds approximately $2 million in crypto and fiat on the platform. Though Finman is willing to put in his entire “400 something” bitcoin fortune to fund Metal Pay’s growth, the 20-year-old told CoinDesk.  “We’re looking to beat bitcoin,” Finman said.  “I've been a bit back and forth in the past ('crypto is dead'/ 'resurrect Bitcoin') but have found in recent months, especially, that the bitcoin community is super fragmented. And the actual usability for bitcoin is minimal,” Finman said.  This project is an attempt to move beyond the siloed developments within the crypto industry and become a usable financial tool, he said.  Hayner agrees, and said crypto has grown to mirror “the existing financial industry,” rather than the open-source community where he found his footing in “the days when you could still mine BTC on a MacBook.”  Before Metal's founding in 2016, Hayner helped build Stellar, Dogecoin and Block.io. The company previously received $3 million in funding from G2 Ventures, Gateway and ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees.  Crypto meets conventional  The two took a “crypto-agnostic” approach when building the system and have worked actively with regulators.  Metal Pay is partnered with Arkansas-based Evolve Bank & Trust to provide FDIC-insured deposit accounts. As the platform develops, Evolve will help Metal Pay introduce a number of financial products associated with conventional banking services.  In 2018, Hayner also developed a proof of processed payment as a means of distributing MTL tokens native to the platform. The proof reaches consensus and validates transactions conducted on Metal Pay.  Instead of a mining reward, however, the counterparties receive up to 5 percent of the transaction volume in MTL, which, “for consumers, is construed as cash back,” said Hayner. These rewards, called Pop can be converted into fiat, sent to another Metal Pay user, or held as an investment.  MTL holders are rewarded in additional ways. For instance, those that “hold over 10,000 MTL on an average spot price between Binance, Kraken and Bittrex,” will not be charged fees. Further, Hayner said the company intends to offer free trading on MTL specific pairs and fee-less options for merchants following the introduction of Metal Merchant.  Metal Pay looks to gain market validation in a crowded field of payment apps like Venmo and Cash App. Hayner recognizes the difficulty in attracting non-crypto users, and is working to build an application that passes industry muster first.  He said:  “Bitcoin is flawed, but only in the way the Ford Model T was flawed, the concept of a car will live on and constantly be improved upon, hopefully it builds upon the existing model and there is always room for Ford, Toyota, Mazda, BMW, Tesla even!”  Metal Pay screenshot courtesy of Metal Pay",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/19/youngest-bitcoin-millionaire-willing-to-stake-it-all-on-metal-pay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fd2befb06e62eeec5b2adbd1432c1539e2c4022-1020x720.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a Democrat who has been outspoken in her opposition to the Libra project will lead the delegation.

42430875,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJth,1566212444,Bitcoin's Price is Up More Than $1K Since Bakkt Futures News,"View  Bitcoin has risen by $1,000 since Friday's announcement by Bakkt exchange that it will be launching physically-settled bitcoin futures on Sept. 23. The price rise has neutralized the bearish setup on the intraday charts seen last week.  The gains could be extended further to $11,000, as the hourly chart is reporting a bullish continuation pattern.  The weekly chart continues to call a deeper pullback to $9,000 with key moving averages (MAs) producing a first bearish crossover since February.  A weekly close above $12,000 is needed for a complete bullish revival.  Bitcoin (BTC) has gained $1,000 since the Bakkt exchange announced it has the green light to offer bitcoin futures, but key resistance still lies ahead.  The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid around $9,700 in the U.S. trading hours on Friday and printed highs above $10,750 earlier today, according to Bitstamp data.  Notably, the move above $10,000 happened on Friday after CoinDesk reported that the Intercontinental Exchange’s young subsidiary Bakkt has received regulatory approval to launch its much-anticipated platform for daily and monthly BTC futures.  Bitcoin futures to be launched by Bakkt will be physically settled, as opposed to the cash-settled futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Put simply, BTC futures trading on Bakkt will not rely upon unregulated spot markets for settlement prices and the party will receive delivery of bitcoins from the Bakkt Digital Asset Warehouse at the end of the contract period.  Many observers, including cryptocurrency analyst and trader Scott Melker, are of the opinion that Bakkt's physically-delivered futures product will open the floodgates for the institutional money and is a long-term bullish development for bitcoin.  Physically delivered futures require the actual purchase of bitcoins, which, according to Melker is a ""huge"" development. Also, there is general consensus that the price discovery in new physical delivery markets will contribute to building confidence in BTC prices.  That said, some observers are warning that an increased institutional volume my not necessarily translate into stronger buying pressure.  ""Volume is volume, don't express your bias toward it"", popular Cryptocurrency market analyst @CryptoNekoZ tweeted earlier today.  Meanwhile, financial analyst and tech journalist Joseph Young tweeted over the weekend that, ""Bakkt launch was priced into the market"".  So far, the markets have reacted positively to Bakkt news if the $1,000 price rise is anything to go by.  The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $10,700 on Bitstamp and could rise further to $11,000. The gains, however, could be short-lived as the odds are stacked against the bulls, according to technical charts.  Hourly chart  BTC witnessed a high-volume ascending triangle breakout earlier today. The bullish continuation pattern indicates a resumption of the rally from the last week's low of $9,467 and has created room for a rise to $11,000.  So far, however, the upside has been capped around $10,750.  Weekly chart  BTC fell 10.49 percent last week, strengthening the case for a deeper pullback put forward by the preceding week's rejection above $12,000.  The 14-week relative strength index has created a bearish lower high. Further, the 5-week moving average (MA) has crossed below the 10-week MA for the first time since February.  Currently, the 5-week MA is seen at $10,610 and the 10-week MA is located at $10,691. The bearish crossover indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The moving average convergence divergence histogram continues to produce lower highs above the zero line, a sign of weakening bullish momentum.  All-in-all, the case for a fall back to $9,000 remains intact. The outlook would turn bullish only if prices print a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000.

Announced  Monday, Rakuten Wallet has gone live for trading in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and bitcoin cash (BCH) against the Japanese yen via an Android mobile app. An iOS app is due to be released in the future, though no set timeline was provided.  The firm said customer funds held by the subsidiary will be managed separately from its own, under the eye of its trust company, Rakuten Trust, and through savings accounts at Rakuten Bank.  Rakuten further stresses that users' deposited cryptos will be held in cold, or offline, storage to minimize the risk of hacking. For added security, private keys are managed using a multisignature scheme, and two-step authentication is required when signing in and making withdrawals.  No fees are charged for making trades or deposits, which are conducted in real time, 365 days a year (excluding when maintenance is occurring), the firm says.  However, for fiat withdrawals, Rakuten Wallet will charge 300 JYN (around $2.80), and for crypto withdrawals it will charge at the (slightly arbitrary seeming) rates of: bitcoin at 0.001 BTC ($10.70), ether at 0.01 ETH ($2) and bitcoin cash at 0.01 BCH ($3.20), with conversions correct at time of writing.  The lack of fees on buying and selling cryptos should appeal to users making frequent trades.  Rakuten first revealed its exchange play in March, saying it had been awarded a license in Japan for its rebranded entity – an exchange platform called Everybody’s Bitcoin acquired for $2.4 million last August. In May, it partnered with blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace to help ensure regulatory compliance for the exchange.

42430871,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJlh,1566206116,Silvergate Bank Eyes Crypto-Backed Loans for Institutions,"Silvergate Bank, one of the cryptocurrency industry's few go-to financial service providers, is planning to become a crypto lender.  According to an updated IPO filing, Silvergate, which serves some of the cryptocurrency world's top firms like Coinbase, Bitstamp, Genesis Trading, Blocktower Capital, Polychain Capital and Xapo, has seen increased demand from the industry and is aiming to become an even more crypto-focused institution.  In particular, the bank is planning to offer fiat loans, collateralized with crypto, to institutional clients as a part of the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) – a payment system specifically designed for crypto exchanges and their big clients.  Allowing institutional clients of crypto exchanges to use fiat while not touching their crypto balances on the trading venues would be beneficial both for Silvergate and for the industry, the prospectus says:  ""This solution provides greater capital efficiency for institutional investor clients that wish to transact without needing to move liquidity on and off different exchanges. ... Offering lines of credit would also improve liquidity within the order book of our exchange clients, enabling additional trading on their platforms, potentially reducing pricing arbitrage across exchanges and improving the stability of digital currencies.""  Such loans would be funded from Silvergate's own balance sheet, and if the crypto collateral's price should fall, the bank can go to one of its exchange clients and sell the assets. The company believes the risk of issuing such loans will be ""appropriately compensated, ... earning attractive risk adjusted returns.""  Silvergate is also looking into including stablecoins in its payments infrastructure, although the bank is not directly involved with any stablecoin issuer at the moment. However, it already holds U.S. dollar deposits backing ""multiple stablecoins,"" the document says.  The bank also reported notable growth of its client base in 2019. As of June 30, Silvergate had 655 ""established and emerging digital currency industry customers,"" compared to the 542 reported in December 2018 – a 20-percent increase over six months and 55 percent over the year.  Another 228 clients are in the process of onboarding. People and companies building and supporting crypto infrastructure, such as software developers, miners, custodians and ""general industry participants"" account for 27.2 percent of Silvergate's crypto customers, the filing says.  The bank's income has been growing along with the number of crypto clients. Net income has gone up by 81.6 percent since last June, from $8 million to $14.6 million, the firm indicates. Transfers via SEN also soared to $12.7 billion-worth, compared to $8.3 billion during the entirety of 2018. That figure notably exceeds the value of transfers for non-crypto customers, which is disclosed at $11.2 billion for 2019.  Previously, Silvergate said it planned to seek New York state's ""BitLicense"" in order to launch a limited liability trust company and becoming an institutional crypto custodian.

42430873,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJrh,1566201648,Early Investors in Telegram Crypto See 400% Returns – But Buyers Risk It All,"The Takeaway:  Telegram's long-awaited blockchain, Telegram Open Network, is said to be scheduled to launch Oct. 31, but the yet-to-be-issued gram tokens are already trading in an unauthorized secondary market.  Telegram has yet to publicly or formally acknowledge the project, but investors in last year's $1.7 billion token offering, widely publicized in the press, are selling their gram allocations via OTC desks, exchanges and special-purpose vehicles.  Purchasing tokens this way might be risky, investors warn, as Telegram specifically prohibited investors from re-selling their allocations under penalty of terminating the purchase contract.  Secondary buyers may end up with nothing.      A secondary market has quietly blossomed for Telegram’s yet-to-be-issued tokens.  Between over-the-counter (OTC) desks, sales on small cryptocurrency exchanges, and at least one investment fund, opportunities to buy the tokens, known as grams, before the blockchain's Oct. 31 launch date are not hard to find.  But there's a catch: investors who bought into Telegram's $1.7 billion offering in February and March of 2018 are not allowed to sell or pledge their tokens in any way before the launch. The original purchase agreement says that if an investor disposes of his future tokens before Telegram Open Network, or TON, is live, the allocation can be canceled.  In other words, there's a risk that investors buying these tokens in secondary trades won't ever get them.  “Telegram was the first big project that legally prohibited investors from selling their allocation,"" said one of several investors who participated in the sale and spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity.  But the purchase agreement's restrictive terms didn't stop investors who wanted to exit — it only made the secondary market for grams an underground business.  ""Investors usually just share their allocations with friends, without signing documents,"" said Anna Palmina, head of investment firm and OTC desk Palmina Invest, adding that her firm didn't invest in the Telegram sale and isn't offering tokens.  All this is happening as the deadline for launching TON approaches: according to the token purchase agreement obtained by CoinDesk, the network was slated to launch no later than Oct. 31 of this year. If it doesn’t, the company, founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, will have to refund the $1.7 billion raised in the sale, minus development expenses.  Handshake deals  The purchase agreement – written for Telegram by U.S. legal powerhouse Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP according to one investor – stipulates that buyers of grams may not offer, pledge, sell, swap, encumber or dispose of their tokens, “directly and indirectly.”  Neither may investors sell “any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for the investment contract” between an investor and Telegram.  The future issuance of tokens is conditional upon the investor’s compliance with this rule. “If Telegram learns the investor broke the agreement, it can cancel the allocation,” one investor told CoinDesk.  CoinDesk reached out to Telegram's chief investment adviser John Hyman but hasn't got any response. Skadden, Arps also didn't respond.  Despite the restrictions, the secondary market for grams started even before the primary sale was finished in early 2018.  During the two secretive and highly selective original rounds, funds and individuals were let in, including the Silicon Valley-based Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Ventures. The first secondary offerings for big investors were advertised as early as February 2018, right after the first round, Quartz reported at the time.  More recently, OTC sellers have been striking confidential deals for grams based on trust, OTC trader Vladimir Cohen told CoinDesk. Often, sellers are trying to resell their tokens for a profit, having paid either $0.37 during per gram in the first round or $1.33 in the second.  ""There are more and more offerings of the gram tokens, with a price tag from $1.60 to $2,"" Cohen said of the aftermarket.  A third OTC trader, going by the handle Tush, told CoinDesk that on the OTC market, buyers and sellers only sign IOUs, or a paper saying that one side of the deal owes assets to the other.  ""It’s not given by Telegram. It’s just an agreement on trust between seller and buyer,"" he said.  Exchange sale  In June of this year, Japan-based crypto exchange Liquid announced a sale of grams in partnership with Gram Asia, reportedly one of the original investors in TON. The sale was not available to residents of the U.S. or Japan.  The sale started July 10 at $4 per token and was completed in a couple of weeks. According to Liquid’s websitehttps://www.liquid.com/gram/, tokens purchased during the sale were subject to vesting: buyers won’t get them immediately after the launch of TON, but in several tranches three, six, 12 and 18 months after the launch.  This likely means that Gram Asia, if it’s indeed an investor, is selling the tokens it purchased during the first round, since those tokens had the same vesting timeline, according to the investors CoinDesk spoke with.  Seth Melamed, global head of business development and sales at Quoine, the parent company of Liquid, refused to disclose any numbers from the sale, citing a non-disclosure agreement with Gram Asia.  He noted, however, that the gram sale made the exchange’s user base grow tremendously: about 25,000 new users signed up in July, compared to only 5,000 new users in June. Roughly half of them bought the placeholder tokes that will be swapped for grams after the network launch.  Those placeholder tokens cannot be traded, they only guarantee the future delivery of grams, Melamed said. (They don't run on any blockchain, just balances on Liquid's books, he explained.)  “This is not a futures contract. It is a delivery of Gram at a specified interval after mainnet,” Melamed said, adding that Liquid is acting as a custodian that will hold the money users paid, in a form of dollars or the USDC stablecoin, until Gram Asia delivers the grams. Then the tokens will be deposited in users’ Liquid accounts and the placeholder tokens removed.  It's not clear, however, what happens if Gram Asia loses its allocation as a result of a public re-sell campaign.  “If Gram Asia signed a purchase agreement with Telegram, this sale can be considered an encumbrance, and this might be a breach of the agreement,” an investor told CoinDesk. Under the agreement with Telegram, the investors are not supposed to publicize their involvement.  CoinDesk reached out to Gram Asia vie email addresses the entity listed on its website, and to CEO Dongbeom Kim, the only executive named on the site, via LinkedIn, but got no answer.  'Delivery is guaranteed'  Asked how Liquid will make sure Gram Asia delivers the tokens, Melamed said the two entities have a contract.  “There is another entity that acts as a guarantor to deliver Liquid Gram in the event Gram Asia fails to perform its contractual obligation,” Melamed said, refusing to identify the third-party guarantor. ""So, we have very strong legal agreements and protections in place. From a settlement standpoint, Gram Asia has to deliver Gram before they receive any USDC.""  He also wouldn't say what Liquid is planning to do in case Gram Asia loses its allocation due to the possible agreement breach.  A few small exchanges followed Liquid's lead: a Korean exchange, Upxide, announced it was selling Grams in partnership with Liquid on July 14 and Bitforex offered its users ""Gram IOUs.""  Upxide didn't respond a request for comment by press time.  Reached by CoinDesk, Bitforex's press team wrote that the exchange was helping to protect the interests of investors on the OTC market where the counterparty risk is high but people still go there as they want to trade grams.  ""We work with facilities of reputation in the market, and with sufficient deposit guarantee for physical delivery,"" Bitforex said, adding that it guarantees the delivery of grams, whatever happens to the sellers' coins:  ""We promise delivery of IOU coins within 5 days of them being listed on the market, which also allows these facilities to purchase from the market to avoid any default risk. In this model, the facilities might not even have to use their private sale allocation for physical delivery.""  Buyer beware  The secrecy in this secondary market encourages fraud: according to Cohen, many of the traders he saw advertising gram deals aren't actually investors in Telegram, and most OTC offerings are blatant scams.  ""Many of the buyers will end up with nothing when the network is launched,"" he warned.  As for the genuine sellers' motivations, Cohen noted that Telegram has already missed a previously announced launch date.  According to a presentation circulated among investors, the “deployment of the stable version of TON” was previously scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2018, along with the launch of the wallet for grams.  Cohen explained:  ""There is a lot of uncertainty. The launch has been delayed. Many funds are ready to sell big batches with minimal profit.""  However, one participant in the original sale said the abundance of OTC offerings of grams is not necessarily a sign investors are losing faith.  ""The big institutional players that normally invest long-term, like Sequoia or Lightspeed — I haven't heard they wanted to sell anything. Heard they wanted to buy more,"" this investor said.  CoinDesk reached out to several partners at Sequoia Capital but didn't get a response by press time. Upon reviewing CoinDesk’s enquiry, Lightspeed spokesperson declined to comment.  Special-purpose vehicle  Another notable offering came from a large player in Russia. ATON, an asset management and investment banking company based in Moscow, with reportedly $2.5 billion in assets under management, sent its clients an intriguing proposal in May.  In a 13-slide presentation obtained by CoinDesk, ATON presented TON as a potential rival to MasterCard and offered indirect investment in grams, in the form of shares in a specially created investment vehicle, New Technology Fund SPC Limited, registered in the British Virgin Islands.  The fund is structured as a segregated portfolio company (SPC), an entity which segregates the assets and liabilities of different classes of shares from each other and from the general assets of the fund. It’s audited by London-based Baker Tilly and denominated in U.S. dollars.  The fund offers investors access to the future grams, the presentation says, at the price of $1.33 per token. Investors will get 25 percent of their tokens in a period of three to nine months, 25 percent more in six to 12 months, the third portion of 25 percent in 12-18 months and the last tranche in 18-24 months.  It’s not specified when these periods start, but the vesting schedule resembles the one in the Telegram token sale's first round. The offering, like the one at Liquid, is not available to residents of the U.S. or Japan.  While the offering might well be a violation of the agreement with Telegram, the investors who talked to CoinDesk noted a possible loophole that can allow the participants in token sale to sell their allocation quietly.  When signing the paperwork with Telegram, investors had to disclose their beneficiaries with shares larger than 25 percent, and after the deal, notify Telegram if new shareholders of such size bought in. However, changes smaller than 25 percent don’t have to be reported, and this might be a way to hide re-selling.  It’s unclear how any deal between ATON and Telegram was structured, if one took place, or if the fund participated via a subsidiary or special-purpose vehicle. ATON declined to comment.  One of the investors said that, according to his information, ATON has already sold the shares in the gram-based fund worth $10 million. “Everyone was shocked when people got that presentation. But ATON said they got written permission from Telegram,” he added.  Another explanation might be that Telegram is too busy to react to the secondary-market frenzy.  “The team has no time to bother about this now,” another investor said. “They have to finish the protocol at the moment. The deadlines are missed badly: everybody has been waiting for it to go live last December. In February, Telegram wrote to investors that 90 percent of all work is done. Well, looks like the last 10 percent turned up the toughest.”  Telegram image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,TON,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/19/early-investors-in-telegram-crypto-see-400-returns-but-buyers-risk-it-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6f7f658f95057d90fca567b9807b7452eccddfc-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange posted an announcement last week saying that all services would be terminated on Sept. 18 at 2:50 UTC. After that date, customers will no longer be able to log in, and deposits and withdrawals will no longer be possible. CGEX added that all records would be destroyed, other than those that have to be retained by law.  Two months earlier, the exchange had announced a temporary suspension effective July 17. In that post, the company said that trading would be halted, deposits could no longer be made, active orders would be canceled and the API keys would be disabled.  Withdrawal services were still to be available and the exchange advised customers to withdrawal their holdings to avoid any potential losses. The announcement assured customers that the suspension was not a permanent end to the service and said that the exchange would be re-launching in the third quarter.  GCEX opened on Oct. 28, 2018. The Malta-based exchange was to offer only crypto-to-crypto trading, but it would be integrating with Coinone's operations in South Korea as well as those in Indonesia, where Coinone started an operation earlier in 2018.  The local press at the time said that the overseas expansion by Coinone was related to the government's crackdown on crypto and its regulation of exchanges. Other South Korean exchanges also established presences overseas, with Bithumb opening Bithumb DEX in Hong Kong and Upbit expanding in Singapore.  Coinone is the third largest exchange in South Korea and the 84th in the world by reported volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap. In recent weeks, it has taken a number of steps to improve security. The exchange announced listing rules on Aug. 8 and said earlier that it had hired CertiK to undertake a security validation.

42430870,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyJjh,1566187246,Santander to Connect Latin America to Ripple-Powered Remittance Service,"Spanish megabank Santander Group is expanding its use of Ripple's technology.  The bank is building a ""payment corridor"" that would let customers in Latin America send money to the U.S. instantly for free via One Pay FX, a mobile app that uses Ripple's xCurrent software, officials told CoinDesk.  Currently, only customers in the U.K. and Spain can send money to the U.S. over One Pay FX. While the bank would not reveal how many Latin American countries it plans to connect to the corridor, Santander serves Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.  Like Santander's DLT efforts to date, the new payment capability will not involve XRP, the cryptocurrency that Ripple periodically sells to fund operations and that powers its separate xRapid product. Last year, Santander introduced One Pay FX in four countries that account for more than half the bank's profits: Spain, the U.K., Brazil and Poland.  This offering is getting traction, the bank says.  “Customers who were not doing international transfers are now using the service, customers who were using international transfer are now doing it more, and customers who had gone to use fintech competition have come back because of the One Pay offering,” Cedric Menager, CEO of One Pay FX, told CoinDesk.  Unlike the SWIFT messaging system that banks traditionally have used to make international transfers, One Pay FX on xCurrent is instant, has no fees and gives users a view into currency exchange rates before they send money, Menager said.  Volume growth  While Santander would not reveal transaction volumes for One Pay FX, it said those volumes tripled from January 2019 to June. (The bank's total cross-border volumes for Spain, including One Pay FX and other rails, increased 120 percent year-over-year in April.)  Expanding One Pay FX will mean a bigger change for some Latin American customers, who will go from making international transfers in branches to instant online payments, than for European customers, said Menager.  “The international payment experience in the Latin American markets is even less evolved than in the European markets,"" he said. “There are even parts of the Latin American market where it’s almost impossible to do an online international payment.”  The corridor will be launched country-by-country, and the bank would not say when the first country would launch.  The bank also plans to bring One Pay FX to U.S. Santander customers for them to send money abroad but does not have a date for that launch yet. The U.S. launch will be a heavier lift for the bank because of the difference in financial regulations.  Santander is also developing Pago FX, which will be an international payment product for non-Santander customers, in an attempt to win over these customers from other banks. It hasn't said what technology this will run on.  “International payments is a way for us to acquire customers having a painful experience with traditional banking,” Manger said.  UPDATE (19, Month 13:30 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that the 120 percent year-over-year increase in April was for all Santander's Spanish cross-border transfers, not just xCurrent-powered ones, and that the bank has not said what technology it will use for the forthcoming Pago FX. Argentina was also added to the list of Latin American countries Santander serves.

In total, more than $106 million worth of cryptocurrencies has been granted to Fidelity Charitable since it first began accepting this form of donation, according to the firm's annual report published late last month.  Year over year, however, the number of crypto donations has dropped.  In 2017, cryptocurrencies represented the fastest-growing asset type accepted by the firm, with more than $69 million in donations. The pace has slowed in 2018 to $30 million in donations, according to the annual report.  “We see cryptocurrency donations rise along with increases in the value of cryptocurrencies in the marketplace,” said a company representative.  Likewise, Fidelity Charitable marketing head Amy Pirozzolo, said now that cryptos are facing a downturn people are less likely to offload them as charitable assets. This is related to the diminishing value of tax deductions charitable donors would be able to claim.  Tax advantage  In opening the charity to crypto assets four years ago, Fidelity was attempting to capitalize not only on humanity’s philanthropic impulses but also real market incentives.  According to Pirozzolo, investors who donate their assets do not have to pay capital gains on them and can write donations off against their income tax. She said the firm even “encourages” clients to “give their most appreciated assets first… because it provides the best tax advantages for the donor and charity.”  It’s in this sense, that when looking for assets to add, Pirozzolo said the company often considers top performing cryptocurrencies.  “One thing we’re committed to is helping donors choose the most tax efficient asset to give to charity,” said Pirozzolo. The firm is “trying to keep its finger on the pulse” of the crypto market.  In the release, Fidelity Charitable also formally announced its acceptance of the digital asset XRP. The firm stated on Twitter back in May that it would take donations in XRP.  “The majority of our contributions to date have been bitcoin, however we have also seen growing numbers of donations in ethereum,” a company representative said. Fidelity Charitable also accepts bitcoin cash and litecoin.  While crypto donations have fallen in recent months, Pirozzolo said most of the charitable giving happens in the second half of the year.
