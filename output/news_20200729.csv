42421264,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXkleH,1596056359,Scammers Are Forging CoinDesk Emails – Here’s How to Protect Yourself,"One of the most unfortunate aspects of the crypto space is its tendency to attract scams. The world bore witness to this in early July when one of the boldest hacks in Internet history – the hijacking of several prominent Twitter accounts, including those of presidential candidate Joe Biden as well as tech titans Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos – turned out to be a ruse to harvest some bitcoin.  CoinDesk was one of the hijacked accounts, too (our handle is all better now, thanks), and it was far from the first time our brand was exploited by crooks looking to make a quick buck. Nor has it been the last.  Previously, scammers impersonated CoinDesk reporters on Telegram and other networks, typically promising coverage in exchange for payment (something we would never do).  Now, some enterprising hoodlums have taken their tricks to a new level.  Over the past few weeks, CoinDesk has seen evidence scammers are copying our newsletters in their entirety, adding a malicious link at the top and changing the subject line to emphasize that link. They then send the email to a list of active and perhaps crypto-curious email addresses likely acquired from privacy-ignoring data brokers or the dark web, completing the phishing scheme.  This is maddening to both us and the victims, since often they never signed up for the mailings in the first place. When they attempt to unsubscribe from the email, they’re either taken to a link that doesn’t work or worse – pulled into the phisher’s trap yet again.  A telltale sign  Admittedly, it can be hard to tell the difference between one of our legit newsletters and one of these phishing copies. The fonts are wrong – but if you’ve never subscribed, how would you know?  There is a giveaway but you need to be paying attention: The malicious link is often in a short “news” item that comes right after the byline, usually touting a company you’ve never heard of.  None of our newsletters begin this way, so if you see one of these, flag it right away by forwarding the email to fraud@coindesk.com.  Compare one fake email we were forwarded...  ...to the genuine article:     Rest assured we’re working to identify these scammers so they pay for their crimes (and they are crimes) as well as upgrading our newsletter experiences to improve security.  In the meantime, be sure to practice good inbox management: Be wary of suspicious-looking links; block or filter senders instead of clicking on unsubscribe buttons; and remember, absolutely no one is going to send you back double your bitcoin. Not even your mom.  Not an exchange  CoinDesk is often confused with Coinbase, the popular cryptocurrency exchange, and in the summer of 2021 a scammer apparently tried to take advantage of this by sending emails bearing our logo to a hapless victim:  To be clear: CoinDesk is a media and events company, not a crypto exchange. No one “trades with us.”  There is no Linda Xie at CoinDesk. The phishers may have been impersonating a former Coinbase executive by that name.  The grammatical errors were a red flag. Another is that the email was sent from a Gmail address. Any legitimate email from a CoinDesk staffer would come from an “@CoinDesk.com” address.  Unfortunately, the recipient still fell for the ruse and sent the phishers $17,000, according to a subsequent email the victim received which CoinDesk reviewed. (Subject line: “Fault and bridge [sic] of contract warning.”)  If you or someone you know receives an email resembling the one above, DO NOT SEND ANY MONEY. Again, forward any suspicious messages to fraud@coindesk.com.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,236 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,844-$11,312  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Just one week ago, bitcoin’s price hit an intraday high of $9,568 in a low-volume environment. This week’s action, fueled by increased exchange volumes, has traders excited at the thought a long-term bull market may be back. As much as $446 million in trades were done on Coinbase Monday.      Read More: Bitcoin Looks Overbought but Analysts Play Down Drop Fears      “The market has clearly jumped to a bullish stance,” said Vishal Shah, and options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “Volatility is higher and we're now looking at the previous resistance of $10,550 as our new support region.”      Some analysts say the move to $11,000 is just the start of the world’s oldest currency continuing on a price tear upward. “We do not see the move to $11,000 as significant and we are anticipating far higher valuations,” said George Clayton, managing partner of Cryptanalysis Capital.      Clayton noted the European Union passed a €570 billion stimulus measure, and a U.S. package in the works that could provide $1 trillion in new spending should an agreement between President Trump and Congress be reached. “These actions amount to rampant fiat currency debasement. The move in crypto is just beginning,” he added.      The crypto derivatives market is heating up again too, Shah added. “What's most interesting to me is that CME volumes have been very strong the last two days.” Indeed, CME options volume has picked up significantly during a July that had previously been bereft of action; open interest is now well over $250 million.      Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, cautions the performance of equities plays a bigger role in the cryptocurrency markets than many might realize, especially if stocks take a dive. “A correction in traditional markets due to deteriorating fundamentals could also cause pullbacks in the crypto world,” Tu noted.

Malaev also noted Balancer’s BAL token distribution and staking returns as another factor contributing to July’s growth, even though the token's performance slipped 25% over the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko. “Balancer uses the Compound model in distributing their tokens.

42384231,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31O7,1596054872,"To Beat Online Censorship, We Need Anonymous Payments","Richard Myers is a decentralized applications engineer at goTenna's Global Mesh Labs initiative, and previously a co-founder of Bytabit AB.      Online censorship and surveillance will persist as long as local fiat currencies are the only way to pay for telecommunication services.      The risk of internet censorship and surveillance is a growing concern in many parts of the world. NetBlocks, a digital rights advocacy group, frequently detects both total and partial internet shutdowns caused by overt censorship, natural disasters and technical mishaps. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has found domestic communication surveillance is common not just in authoritarian countries like China, but also in western democracies.      See also: ‘We Need 30 Different Words for Censorship,’ Feat. Andreas M. Antonopoulos      The issue is an over-reliance on concentrated internet service providers (ISPs), which decide what communities receive internet access, how much to charge and whether to hand over personal information to authorities upon request.      Technologists have been looking to the stars to solve the issue of communications suppression. Satellite internet systems like Iridium Go are one way to reach off-grid communities or bypass local censorship, but they are not affordable for most. New low-earth-orbit satellite systems like Starlink promise to lower costs and increase internet access, but require massive investments in proprietary satellites and for consumers to purchase expensive receiver equipment.      Meanwhile, cheaper options like the Iranian Toosheh (Knapsack), which repurposes existing satellite TV receivers, is subject to content gatekeeping by the system’s operators and investors.      The most promising platform to date is Blockstream’s Blocksat Transmission service, which allows anyone on the internet to uplink data to be broadcast alongside the startup’s dedicated Bitcoin network data feed. (Full disclosure: GoTenna and Blockstream have collaborated on the open source txtenna-python project.)    To be truly censorship resistant, internet publishers must be able to accept anonymous payments from their subscribers and advertisers.    Blockstream, founded by veteran cryptographer Adam Back, solves an important problem of how to allocate scarce download bandwidth by requiring uploaders to bid for space in their broadcast on a per-byte basis. More important, content uploaders pay using the Bitcoin Lightning network without revealing their identity or even that the destination of their payment is Blockstream.      This solution reveals an important insight about how censorship can be banished. As long as telecommunications tools are being paid for in fiat, they will never be free from governmental or corporate repression.      To be truly censorship resistant, internet publishers must be able to accept anonymous payments from their subscribers and advertisers. Take Backpage as an example. In 2015, a letter sent by the Cook County [Illinois] Sheriff was sufficient for all three major credit card companies to drop Backpage, a marketplace largely for sex ads, as a customer.      Global internet providers like Blockstream or Starlink will be subject to similar censorship from payment providers in every one of the jurisdictions they serve. They will also undoubtedly receive requests to reveal the identity of their customers from some jurisdictions, many without strong human rights protections. Having this information puts them at risk of being legally compelled to reveal it, accidentally leaking it or having it taken covertly.      The Lightning Network preempts this risk by enabling private messaging and as well as private peer-to-peer payments. Applications such as Whatsat and Juggernaut demonstrate how Lightning can be used for private, onion-routed, peer-to-peer communication, similar to the Tor network. But, unlike Tor, each relay that helps to successfully forward a message also receives a bitcoin micropayment.      As the Lightning network grows it will become increasingly possible to route more than simple messages through its nodes. Like Tor, any arbitrary protocol could be routed over encrypted channels between Lightning nodes. Gateways to the internet, called exit relays on Tor, could charge higher routing fees to offset their higher bandwidth and hosting costs.    Lightning mile    Conventional telecommunication companies are responsible for building out the relay and backhaul infrastructure of their network in exchange for the right to bill for access. They often fail to do so. Internet access provided by traditional telecoms to last-mile communities is often expensive, limited and/or unreliable. Further, rural last-mile communities often have lower-speed data than cities and high metered rates relative to income.      See also: The Internet Is a Right, Not a Luxury: 30% of Americans Still Don’t Have It      Lightning nodes that specialize in providing connectivity in off-grid or last-mile locations could supply this market by charging routing fees based on demand. High-altitude balloons, cubesats, community WiFi networks, radio broadcasters and mesh relays are some communication technologies that can now be incentivized with Lightning micropayments. Using Lightning payments would allow any two devices within range of each other to negotiate a payment in exchange for data delivery.      Radio spectrum is currently auctioned off for the exclusive use of large telecom companies to provide communication services to residents in particular regions. More spectrum should be allocated for residents, small businesses and existing telecoms to cooperatively compete to provide communication services. Lightning is an important protocol for enabling more competition and communication networks that are more ubiquitous, resilient, private and affordable.      I disagree with J.P. Koning that Bitcoin, like ham radio, will remain a clunky niche hobby destined to be only occasionally useful during disasters – financial ones in the case of Bitcoin. Lightning can be used to unlock consumer facing telecom and banking solutions in places not well served by both centralized financial and telecom networks. Most of the world is already suffering from weak monetary institutions and communication infrastructure and would benefit from leap-frogging these legacy centralized systems for both",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Richard Myers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/29/to-beat-online-censorship-we-need-anonymous-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41b1eda94a5d0102cd40a9540e1db3ffb0f23b4c-2400x1741.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31YB,1596051257,Recent Bitcoin Rally Pushes 'Addresses in Profit' to 93%,"About 93% of all bitcoin address balances are estimated to be in the black, according to Glassnode, as bitcoin continues to trade above $11,000.    ""Addresses in profit"" measures balances of assets transferred into a wallet at an average price lower than the current price. In other words, their value has gone up, creating a profit, at least on paper.  Balances in profit are up 29 percentage points from the 72% mark recorded on July 20.  More than 90% of bitcoin addresses were last in profit through July and August 2019 when bitcoin traded around $11,500, a local top for the leading cryptocurrency.  The 11-month high for in-profit addresses comes amid bitcoin’s rally to $11,400 and follows steady long-term accumulation by investors at lower prices, with fewer than 40% of all bitcoins having been moved in the past year.  A high percentage of addresses ""in profit"" increases the probability of investors selling those bitcoins to realize their profit, said Josh Olszewicz, cryptocurrency trader at Techemy Capital.

42384235,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31T9,1596050734,Bitcoin Scaling Tech Could Have Saved Companies and Users $500M in Fees: Report,"A new study from Bitcoin startup Veriphi finds companies and users sending bitcoin transactions could have saved more than half a billion dollars in fees if all companies, including wallets and exchanges, had used the most up-to-date technology.      Each bitcoin transaction has an optional fee tacked on. Users have the ability to choose the amount of this fee. If the Bitcoin blockchain is particularly busy, seeing too many transactions at once, a higher fee will ensure a transaction gets picked up by miners and goes through faster.      Read more: How do Bitcoin Transactions Work?      Bitcoin fees cost an average of about $3 per transaction, according to Bitcoin statistic site bitinfocharts. Fees rise with demand. There have been times in Bitcoin's history, particularly in 2017, when fees exploded due to increasing demand. Bitcoin has limited space for transactions, so users had to pay higher fees if they wanted their transaction to go through faster.      These fees are a pain, so bitcoin developers have spent a lot of energy on carving out more Bitcoin block space to make room for new users and their transactions while keeping within the actual block-size constraint of 1 MB.    Transaction batching and SegWit    Veriphi's report concludes companies could have saved 21,131.97 BTC in fees (worth $195 million) if all transactions from January 2012 to June 2020 had used a technique called transaction batching.      Transaction batching is a way of sending multiple transactions at once in order to cut down on paying for each individual transaction. This option is more likely to be used by companies, like exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, which send several transactions at once, rather than singular users.      Plus, users could have saved 36,685.72 BTC in fees (worth $339 million) if SegWit had been used on all transactions from August 2017 to June 2020. That adds up to a total of 57,817.69 BTC, worth more than $534 million at the time the report was released.      Read more: Bitcoin Just Hit $1 Billion in All-Time Transaction Fees      SegWit, officially added to Bitcoin in 2017, is a technology that allows for more space for transactions per block.      Even though SegWit was activated nearly three years ago, each individual wallet and bitcoin service needs to individually add support for these types of transactions. In some cases, individual users still need to opt in to using SegWit-enabled addresses for their transactions.      Read more: What is SegWit?      As can be expected, wallets and other bitcoin services have so far adopted SegWit at their own pace. Adding a new way to send transactions isn't a trivial task and requires engineering bandwidth; as such, some companies have not prioritized making the necessary infrastructure changes to their platforms.      If average fees grow higher than users would like, however, users who want to save on fees may jump from these slow-to-act platforms over to a bitcoin wallet or exchange that's adopted SegWit.    Bitcoin fees and the next bull run    That said, Gustavo J. Flores, Veriphi head of product and research argued that both SegWit and transaction batching have been around for years. And users of these wallets and services could have saved a lot of money if these technologies had been used for that entire time.      ""I saw the news a couple of months ago of Coinbase integrating transaction batching into their system and I thought how late that was, given that batching has been around since 2011 or 2012. We were wondering, how big was the impact of all these companies and users that hadn't adopted batching and Segwit? And it turned out to be a pretty substantial number: half a billion dollars,"" Flores told CoinDesk.      Read more: After Years of Resistance, BitPay Adopts SegWit for Cheaper Bitcoin Transactions      Now that bitcoin's price has jumped to more than $11,000, perhaps signalling the start of the next bull run, it’s time to consider a scenario where fees might be on the rise again.      In the report, Veriphi encourages any person or entity responsible for sending many transactions to think about best practices for saving money on fees.      ""The savings potential presented is significant and those conducting large amounts of transactions should seriously consider employing these tools in order to remain competitive and save money.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/29/bitcoin-scaling-tech-could-have-saved-companies-and-users-500m-in-fees-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99c324ce0018b337ca874215d143b5f51671e5f9-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mining attacks infect a user’s computer with crypto-mining malware that allows the hacker to utilize someone else’s computing power to mine cryptos without their knowledge.    The report notes India’s encounter rate for such attacks is 4.6 times higher than the global and regional average. The crypto-hack encounter rate for India in 2019 was 0.23%, a decline of over 50% since 2018.  Users in Sri Lanka and Vietnam also face a high incidence of such attacks.  In addition to crypto-hacking, malware, ransomware and drive-by download attacks pose big cybersecurity challenges in India, according to the report.  Although the report states that drive-by download attacks have dipped overall in the region, India registered a rise of 140% in such attacks. These involve the unintentional download of malicious software when users visit a website or use an app and can be used to extract intellectual property or financial information. Singapore, India and Hong Kong are three countries that face the highest incidence of such attacks.  The security report compiled by Microsoft, using data from January to December 2019, also states that about 6% of Indian users encountered malware attacks over the last year.  The Asia-Pacific region also has a higher than average malware and ransomware encounter rate – 1.6 and 1.7 times higher than global averages respectively, according to the report.

42384239,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31ZR,1596040850,"Blockchain Bites: Ledger's Breach, Celsius' Contradictions and DeFi's Next Frontier","Ledger suffered a data breach, crypto mining in India comes with questions and a new decentralized finance (DeFi) looks to offer lending and saving opportunities for PoS token holders.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Anchor Aweigh Liquidity mining is coming to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Anchor, the new DeFi platform from Terra, Cosmos, Web3 Foundation and Solana, is designed to launch with a governance-token reward. Version 1 will go live in October, according to a Terra co-founder, offering a two-pronged platform for PoS token holders. The system offers savings accounts and a lending platform – the bread and butter that made DeFi on Ethereum a multibillion-dollar enterprise. “We’ve been looking at ways in order to earn passive income on our users, for unused balances in unused assets,” Do Kwon, a co-founder of Terra and the startup built atop it, Chai, said. CoinDesk's Brady Dale breaks down how it works.      Elevator Rides Towards Regulatory Approval ArCoin became the first cryptographically traded U.S. Treasury Fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (a so-called ‘40 Act Fund) in early July – after 605 days of attempting to appease regulators. Arca Labs and Tokensoft, the fund’s pursuer and designer, met with and overcame regulators’ misconceptions of how crypto markets function, partly through proximity: Tokensoft’s offices were 10 floors apart from the SEC’s in San Francisco's financial district. The fund does not represent an investment in the Ethereum blockchain, but it does signal a shift in the regulator’s tolerance for public blockchain investment vehicles.      Celsius' Contradictions Crypto lender Celsius is making uncollateralized loans, on a limited basis, contradicting the claims of its founder, Alex Mashinsky. “Celsius’ total uncollateralized loans are less than a fraction of 1 percent out of tens of thousands of loans issued since 2018,” a Celsius representative said. Uncollateralized lending is one of several practices that the firm has downplayed or not shared with depositors – including the rehypothecation of collateral borrowers pledge. “In its terms of use, Celsius reserves the right to re-hypothecate customers’ assets, but it’s ambiguous whether the passage refers solely to depositors’ funds or to borrowers’ pledged collateral as well,” CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reports.      Ledger Hacked Ledger suffered a data breach that may have leaked client information for over two months. In a note to clients Wednesday, CEO Pascal Gauthier said the French hardware wallet provider’s e-commerce and marketing database was accessed by an unknown third party, exposing email addresses of customers who signed up to Ledger's newsletter or receive promotional material, as well as full names, postal addresses, and phone numbers of about 9,500 customers. In total, the company estimates around one million email addresses have been stolen. Customer funds, passwords and payment info were not affected, and the hole has been patched.      Mining Muddle India’s Supreme Court has relaxed a ban on banking cryptocurrency firms but the verdict is still out on crypto mining. Recently, a rumor spread of a new government ban. ”It’s risky and bizarre to work in such an environment,” Anshul Dhir, founder of mining startup Qadcore, said. His business, and many like it, are operating under a cloud of uncertainty including whether customers will allow necessary ASICs chips into the country.    Quick bites  The Bank of Japan called a digital yen a “top priority.”  Pantera led a $2.6 million seed round for decentralized exchange Injective Protocol.  Augur, take two  Bitcoin’s rally has legs, exchange data reveals.  Overstock's blockchain arm tZERO lays off staff, cuts salaries. (The Block)  At stake    CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De spoke with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Heath Tarbert about his approach to crypto regulation. The nation’s top commodities regulator noted that many of crypto’s unique attributes – borderlessness and decentralization – require a thoughtful approach.      Economic systems are in a constant state of flux.    “Our entire financial and economic system outside the current system, the non-crypto system basically evolved since, one could argue, the Renaissance in Italy,” he said. “Whereas what people are doing in the digital asset space is effectively building within a decade or less an entire economic system based on human incentives and trust … I just find that fascinating.”  Tarbert specified that he is interested in the way developers are incorporating “hundreds of years of accumulated knowledge about human behavior and economic incentives” as well as cryptographic methods originally used in national security applications to build these digital commerce systems.    Blockchain could become the foundation of an entirely new financial system.    “When you think about the idea that at some point a large part of our financial system could very well exist in blockchain format, that’s also revolutionary,” he said.    On the duties of a regulator.    “My view is that to be a successful CFTC chairman, meaning regulating the derivatives market, you have to have [a] keen understanding of the underlying market,” he said. “And so I’ve tried to learn as much as I can about the various agricultural sectors. I’ve gone out into fields and … gone to grain elevators, I’ve gone to a feedlot to learn about cattle and wheat. I’m learning about oil but I’m also learning a lot about crypto and in many ways, because it’s so revolutionary and so cutting edge, I’m spending a lot of time just learning how it all works in the ecosystem.”    On writing the law of the land.    “I suspect some of it will be principles-based and some of it will be more specific rules … the right blend of each to allow for innovation and also flexibility both for market participants but also for ourselves because we don’t want a regulatory framework to be obsolete six months after it’s introduced, but at the same time, there may be customer protection and maybe some other issues that are so important that we want to provide very clear standards and rules to provide clarity.""  Market intel    FOMO, Greed & Crypto A popular gauge of market sentiment known as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has, in just one week, turned from “fear” to “extreme greed.” Swedish cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research found the market is now at its greediest in a year. Bitcoin is up 51% in 2020. Meanwhile, Ether has jumped about 30% just in the past seven days – a bigger gain than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index mustered in all of 2019 – and is up 142% on the year. “For bitcoin, this rally is driven largely by FOMO and a momentum play,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research for cryptocurrency prime broker BeQuant, said Tuesday in emailed comments. FOMO stands for “fear of missing out.”      Latest ETH ATH Ethereum usage is rocketing as the number of contract calls – a metric for network activity – hits an all-time high. Coin Metrics reported Tuesday more than 3.1 million daily contract calls had gone through on July 25, an all-time high. A contract call is where a user requests a specific function from a smart contract that, unlike a transaction, doesn't publish anything on the blockchain – sort of like a dry run. The bump primarily came from DeFi applications, which has more than quadrupled in size to $4 billion total value locked, year-to-date.    Tech pod    Lighten the Node MIT researchers have developed a way to make it easier to run a Bitcoin full node. The software, called Utreexo, shrinks the size of a node’s “state,” or an up-to-date account of the entire Bitcoin network, from roughly four gigabytes to less than a kilobyte. This is an important step for a continually growing network that relies on nodes to validate transactions. The code exists as a testnet; developers will have to eventually modify Bitcoin Core to make it suitable for use with real money.      Secret Contracts The community behind “secret contracts” is moving forward after months of delay. The Secret Network, an open source network that protects data for users of decentralized applications, known as “Secret Apps,” has started a token burn and is welcoming players such as Binance, Staked and Figment to its testnet of “secret contracts.” The network’s protocol lets decentralized applications use encrypted data without revealing it on a public blockchain, or even to nodes themselves, using smart contracts that use private data termed “secret contracts.”    Opinion    First Amendment Protections Justin Wales, co-chair of Carlton Fields’ national blockchain and virtual currency practice, said Bitcoin is protected under the First Amendment, including all the decentralized bits and bobs it enables. “We’ve all heard the phrase ‘Money is Speech,’ which stems from the U.S. Supreme Court’s recognition that the use of money can itself be an expressive act. One has a right to donate to a political party because we view that type of spending not as financial, but as communicative. Because of Bitcoin, money is no longer restrained to a dollar’s limitations. Accordingly, the range of expression one is capable of has been expanded because money has taken on a more useful form,” he writes.    Podcast    Why Bitcoin Boomed NLW looks at eight factors that may explain Bitcoin’s recent surge to a yearly high – ranging from banks beginning to custody crypto after a recent rules change, federal money printing and Robinhood traders getting wise to crypto.

42384223,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31GZ,1596038913,DeFi Lender Aave Rolls Out Governance Token on Path to Decentralization,"Money protocol Aave is going fully autonomous, according to documents shared with CoinDesk.      Formerly EthLend, Aave will transfer ownership of the protocol over to a “genesis governance” built and approved by token holders. The platform’s native lend (LEND) token will also swap for the new aave (AAVE) token, documents show.      Aave launched its Ethereum-based money market in January 2020 after completing a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) raising $16.2 million, according to Messari. EthLend originally launched as a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending protocol but switched to a pooled protocol that allows for more dynamic asset listings, network liquidity and variable interest rates.      The platform was one of the first to include the novel decentralized finance (DeFi) product flash loans this past spring. These financial products allow users to make outsized positions on trades without any downside.      Read more: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack    LEND tokens swapped for AAVE    The 1.3 billion LEND tokens will swap with the newly minted AAVE at 1:100 for a total of 16 million AAVE. Of the 16 million, 3 million will be issued to a new “Aave Reserve” for protocol improvements under the auspices of the community, Aave writes. The rest will be issued to current LEND holders.      Market Policies (for determining asset listings, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and interest rate modeling) and Protocol Policies (for risk, general improvements and platform incentives) will be determined by community votes, formalized in Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs).    Liquidity mining    The Aave platform will incorporate en vogue liquidity mining, a method to attract assets to the platform. The team said AAVE tokens will be accrued to users for deposits into the protocol’s backstop, the Safety Module (SM).      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Aave’s SM provides security for the platform in the case of a catastrophic failure from a major liquidation event, smart-contract bug or pricing data mistake. Aave will use Chainlink’s oracle network for pricing assets.      The SM is constructed via Balancer, another DeFi protocol called an automatic market maker (AMM). These protocols let users swap tokenized assets such as ether and dai (ETH/DAI) in a permissionless manner. Users will also gain Balancer (BAL) tokens, plus various network fees for SM depositors, Aave says.

In the announcement, CEO Changpeng Zhao said the gateway will provide a ""regulated platform"" for Australian users.

42384236,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31UP,1596028625,Why Bitcoin Is Protected by the First Amendment,"Justin Wales is a lawyer and the co-chair of Carlton Fields’ national blockchain and virtual currency practice. He is an author of ""State Regulations on Virtual Currency and Blockchain Technologies."" This article is adapted from the paper here.      Regulators tend to view virtual currencies monolithically, treating cryptocurrencies like bitcoin no differently from centralized projects that share little in common with it. As a result, the federal government and many states define “virtual currencies” in such broad terms that anyone dealing in them is required to obtain a license and keep records about their customers.      See also: Decentralization and What Section 230 Really Means for Freedom of Speech      To a hammer, everything is a nail and to many regulators every virtual currency is money. But the instinct to focus solely on the monetary functions of these technologies ignores the associational and expressive characteristics of decentralized networks. In other words, the regulators don’t know what they’re dealing with and we’re not doing a good enough job of explaining it to them.      As an industry, we should reframe the discussion about bitcoin and its progeny away from their uses solely as digital money and instead describe them as onramps to decentralized networks capable of much more. Once properly viewed as conduits to global communicative technologies, it becomes clear that participation in these networks is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.    Expression and association    The First Amendment contains several important guarantees, including the freedoms of expression and association. Since its ratification, these rights have been extended to new forms of expression made possible by technological innovations. In Packingham v. North Carolina, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the First Amendment applies to online networks and protects our rights to express and associate through them. The use of the internet for expressive and associative purposes is as protected as the use of parchment or congregating in a town hall as was envisioned by the Founders.      Like the internet itself, Bitcoin’s network enjoys broad First Amendment protections. For this article, I’ll limit the analysis to Bitcoin, but the principles discussed should apply to any network that shares Bitcoin’s open, borderless, censorship-resistant and immutable characteristics.      At its most basic level, Bitcoin is a protocol by which like-minded participants across the world maintain a public truth. Nodes maintain a record of that truth and miners work to ensure the record is accurate. Anyone can join Bitcoin’s network and the software needed to do so is freely available.    We should reframe the discussion about bitcoin and its progeny away from their uses solely as digital money.    Every participant has a right to propose improvements to the network, which are adopted by majority vote, and, as we have seen numerous times, a disagreement among participants can result in a fork of the network in which a subset of users advocates for a different form of governance.      In this sense, Bitcoin is a direct form of democracy, the protection of which is not diminished merely because the internal incentive mechanism that keeps the network running without a central authority has developed a secondary market value.    Bitcoin is a political act    Participating in the Bitcoin network, either by running a node, mining or perhaps even holding a virtual currency is for many an act of political expression as much as a financial one. This was surely the case in the technology’s earliest days when the price of bitcoin was negligible and participants joined to reject the notion that money should be controlled by central banks. For those who share this mindset, participating in the Bitcoin network is an overtly political act of association that cannot be so easily restricted.      That is not to say Bitcoin cannot be regulated, but that efforts to do so likely must meet the high standard applied to the deprivation of constitutional rights and that subordinate guarantees such as the right to associate anonymously may be implicated.      Granted, the question of whether the act of merely holding bitcoin represents enough participation in the network to trigger associational rights is debatable. But, when one considers networks that utilize a Proof-of-Stake mechanism that requires possession of a virtual currency to maintain the network, the answer is easier.      I am not suggesting that bitcoin is not money. Rather, I’m advocating for an understanding that it is much more than money. As Andreas Antonopoulos explained in his 2016 book ""The Internet of Money"": “Saying bitcoin is digital money is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone. It’s like saying that the internet is all about email. Money is just the first application.”      Decentralized networks present powerful non-monetary use cases. From Bitcoin’s first block, which contained Satoshi’s famous “Times of London” message, its ledger has been used to immutably preserve non-financial content. In the decade since its creation, Bitcoin has been used to publish political messages, artistic expressions, memes and much more. Bitcoin’s limited block size makes it an imperfect vehicle for this use, but other networks, including forks of Bitcoin, are actively experimenting with decentralized publications and social media platforms.    Finance-expression line is blurred    The ability to immutably publish content onto a globally maintained network free from political or corporate censorship may emerge as a powerful tool against oppression. And that is but one use case for a globally maintained ledger.      When one considers the authentication tools or smart contract applications proposed for Bitcoin (utilizing RSK) or made possible by Ethereum and other chains, the potential applications for these networks is vast. For regulators charged with overseeing the purchase and use of virtual currencies needed for these and other yet unknown applications to run, it may be that there are instances where the use of a virtual currency is constitutionally more analogous to a modem or fiber optic cable than a dollar.      See also: Jill Carlson - Tearing Down Monuments Isn’t Censorship – It’s Speech      We’ve all heard the phrase “Money is Speech,” which stems from the U.S. Supreme Court’s recognition that the use of money can itself be an expressive act. One has a right to donate to a political party because we view that type of spending not as financial, but as communicative.      Because of Bitcoin, money is no longer restrained to a dollar’s limitations. Accordingly, the range of expression one is capable of has been expanded because money has taken on a more useful form.      An example of this is the Lightning Trust Chain that occurred last year when Bitcoin’s Lightning Network was used to send nominal micropayments across the globe as a commitment to borderless communication. The ability to transact across borders in amounts less than a penny expands the range of expressive and associational opportunities available to us and should not be regulated in the same manner that we regulate typical financial transactions.    Bitcoin’s expressive potential    Bitcoin has forced money to outgrow its prior form and, as a result, has extended the range of expressions we can achieve. Because most people will only be able to take advantage of these new capabilities by first purchasing a cryptocurrency, there very well may be times when such transactions must be left unregulated. That is not to say bitcoin is immune from regulation, and there are clearly instances when it should be treated as a currency, but we must understand that it is not always the case.      As decentralized networks continue to expand our ability to associate and express with one another, we must remain cognizant that the First Amendment has always grown to embrace new technologies and protect the expanding expressive opportunities they create. Through this understanding, it is clear that efforts to treat all virtual currencies as the same without any consideration for the expressive benefits of associating with a global, decentralized network may be constitutionally problematic.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Justin S.

42384233,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31PN,1596027613,Carbon Credits Have a Double-Spend Problem. This Microsoft-Backed Project Is Trying to Fix It,"The InterWork Alliance (IWA), a tech-agnostic token standardization initiative that grew out of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, is working on blockchain tools to prevent the “double-spending” of carbon credits.      Carbon accounting works by allowing countries or corporate entities to pay for their carbon-emitting sins, thus creating a market mechanism to drive industry toward greener processes.      But there’s a problem.      “There’s no way right now for you to determine that a tree hasn’t been sold 100 times over,” said Microsoft blockchain architect and IWA Chairman Marley Gray.      The Microsoft-backed IWA sustainability group is stepping in with a tokenization standard that aims to bring transparency to carbon accounting.      Read more: Firm Uses Ethereum to Tokenize Sustainable Infrastructure in Fight Against Climate Change      Large companies can offset their carbon emissions by participating in and funding environmentally friendly projects. However, there is a distinct lack of verified carbon-offsetting credits, said Gray.      “There are not enough verified – verified is the key word – carbon offset credits in the world today just to satisfy Microsoft’s needs for this year,” said Gray. “That was an eye-opener. Every major corporate is coming out with these big sustainability goals, so we have to do something dramatic to improve the supply of verified offsets.”    IWA’s solution    The IWA sustainability working group includes Accenture, Climate Chain Coalition, Digital Asset, Nasdaq, Neo Global Development, R3, SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), Xpansiv and others. The group will create a standardized framework for tokenization, starting with voluntary carbon offsetting, and will then expand its focus to regulated markets in the near future.      This is not a new problem and numerous technologists have tried to come up with ways to make carbon accounting more rigorous, including using blockchains.      “You had a lot of startups go after these spaces, and everyone's sort of building these walled gardens that don’t match the buyers’ requirements,” said Gray. “So we decided to back the bus up, and get everyone to agree on what a carbon credit is, how it’s structured and how we should then tokenize that to solve our double-spend credit problem.”      Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming      The term “carbon credit” has become overloaded, said Gray. Part of the IWA’s mission is to break down the different types of carbon credit for tokenization, such as EU-issued carbon credits traded on regulated markets.      Carbon offsets, on the other hand, can be either derived from avoiding emissions by, for instance, using renewable energy, or by removing emissions via projects that plant trees. Illustrating the problem, these two variants are measured differently and priced differently, said Gray.      When it comes to verifying carbon offsetting projects, firms don’t care whether there’s a blockchain underlying the solution, they just want to be sure it’s trusted and transferable, Gray added.      “We have to be able to define a project so that buyers of carbon credits can find out the project details and see the provenance of that carbon credit and its worthiness,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/29/carbon-credits-have-a-double-spend-problem-this-microsoft-backed-project-is-trying-to-fix-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de914f208b97053c14ddd56761828f1473a2cf9a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31ah,1596026401,Bitcoin Looks Overbought but Analysts Play Down Drop Fears,"With bitcoin rising to its highest level in 11 months this week, some investors are beginning to worry that the cryptocurrency is overbought and may be due for notable price drop.      But analysts suggest that's an overreaction.    Bitcoin’s price rose to $11,319 on Monday, the highest level since August 2019, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  At time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading near $11,100, representing a 18% gain from lows near $9,400 observed a week ago.  The sudden rally has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) above 80.00.  A measurement of over 70.00 is considered overbought, meaning the bullish move is now overstretched.    Asim Ahmad, co-chief investment officer at London-based Eterna Capital, said that an above-70 RSI does not necessarily imply an impending major price slide.  More likely it indicates that the bullish move is overstretched and vulnerable to consolidation or a minor retracement at worst, Ahmad said.  Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack funds, explained the RSI can stay inflated for longer periods in a strongly trending market, adding that other indicators are showing strong buying momentum.  The RSI is based on price and remained elevated during the previous bulls runs.  Consolidation ahead?  Bitcoin remained bid and rose 160% in the second quarter of 2019 (above left) despite the RSI printing highs above 70.00 several times during the three-month period.  A similar pattern was observed during the bull market frenzy of 2017 (above right).  Back to summer 2020 and the overbought measurement on the RSI may keep the cryptocurrency hovering around $11,000 for some time. Support is seen around $10,500.  Rotation of money out of the DeFi space and traditional markets and into bitcoin would create momentum for the cryptocurrency, said Neo.  Prices could rise quickly toward $12,000 in the short-term if the U.S. Federal Reserve signals higher tolerance for inflation. That could yield another sell-off for the greenback and send gold above the $2,000 mark.  Bitcoin still remains vulnerable to a sell-off in equities, as was seen during the wider markets crash in March, according to Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital.

42384220,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1JLT,1596023150,First Mover: Crypto Traders 'Greedy' as Goldman Warns on Dollar,"During a turbulent year when cryptocurrencies have outperformed just about every other major investment category, traders in digital-asset markets are getting even greedier.      Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, sits at an 11-month high of around $11,000 after surging earlier this week. It's up 51% in 2020, nearly double the gains in gold, which generated enthusiasm in traditional markets this week when it rose to a record intraday high.      Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has jumped about 30% just in the past seven days, a bigger gain than the Standard & Poor's 500 Index mustered in all of 2019. So far in 2020, ether is up 142%.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      A popular gauge of market sentiment known as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has, in just one week, turned from ""fear"" to ""extreme greed."" According to the Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research, the market is now at its greediest in a year.      ""Although bitcoin has showed strength, Ethereum has been the real powerhouse of this bullish week in crypto,"" Arcane wrote Tuesday in a report. Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.      Bitcoin's rally this week adds to the momentum witnessed recently across digital asset markets, which have grown rapidly in 2020 despite the tumult that has whipsawed traditional assets like stocks and bonds.      ""For bitcoin, this rally is driven largely by FOMO and a momentum play,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research for cryptocurrency prime broker BeQuant, said Tuesday in emailed comments. FOMO stands for ""fear of missing out.""      While bitcoin has gained because of its perceived use as an inflation hedge, similar to gold, alternative cryptocurrencies like ether have soared due investor speculation that they might play an outsize role in the monetary systems of the future, or even serve as the building blocks for a new financial system.      ""Ethereum has shown particularly strong gains, a rational response to its improving network fundamentals,"" according to a report from the cryptocurrency data firm Coin Metrics.      Heath Tarbert, chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De in an interview published Tuesday he finds it ""fascinating"" how far the digital asset industry has come in the 11 years since bitcoin's launch.      ""What people are doing in the digital asset space is effectively building, within a decade or less, an entire economic system,"" Tarbert said. “When you think about the idea that at some point a large part of our financial system could very well exist in blockchain format, that’s also revolutionary.”      The devastating economic toll of the coronavirus has severely tested all markets this year, both in analog and digital finance. Investors of all manner are having to account for multitudinous and countervailing forces, from the deflationary impact of soaring unemployment, to the trillions of dollars of government and central-bank stimulus, to the rapidly growing ranks of bankrupt companies, to the wild gyrations in foreign-exchange rates.      The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to issue a statement at the conclusion of its two-day closed-door meeting, followed by a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell.      As highlighted in First Mover on Tuesday, policy markets aren't expected to take any major actions at the meeting, but Deutsche Bank Strategist Jim Reid says the Fed may need to inject another $12 trillion into financial markets in the next few years to help the economy heal.      The U.S. central bank already has expanded its balance sheet this year by about $3 trillion to roughly $7 trillion, fueling predictions that inflation could heat up once the economy start to recover.      ""The Fed is pivoting from 'stabilization' to 'accommodation,'"" Bank of America analysts wrote this week in a report. ""The focus will be on stage-setting for future easing, which risks lower real rates and a weaker U.S. dollar.""      Fitch, the credit-ratings firm, wrote this week that the coronavirus impact will weigh on economic growth ""for years to come.""      Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street heavyweight, warned Tuesday that U.S. policy is triggering currency ""debasement fears"" that could jeopardize the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency.      But as is always the case, the implications aren't clear-cut.      The Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which conducts financial-markets analysis on behalf of the third-biggest U.S. bank, predicted Tuesday that former Vice President Joe Biden will defeat President Donald Trump in November's election, with Democrats also winning control of both chambers of Congress. Such an outcome that could lead to more ""spending programs to potentially stimulate the economy.""      Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy for the Wells Fargo unit, told First Mover in emailed comments that inflation is ""very unlikely to mount a recovery,"" due to the sluggishness of the economic recovery.      ""While many analysts focus on the rising supply of dollars, the demand for cash in spending is very likely to remain subdued. In such an environment, we believe inflation will fail to gain traction in the coming two years, or longer,"" Christopher said.      To Coin Metrics, just the increased uncertainty might provide support for crypto bulls who think higher inflation will eventually appear.      ""The coronavirus and the monetary and fiscal response have increased the uncertainty in the future path of monetary policy, inflation, and growth, all of which are supportive to bitcoin,"" the firm wrote.      Greed begets more greed. And based on the track record so far this year in digital asset markets, greedy crypto traders haven't been disappointed.      CORRECTION (July 29, 17:14 UTC): This article has been corrected to show that Arcane Research is based in Norway. A previous version of this article said the company was based in Sweden.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,028 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,196 | 24-Hr Low: $10,743      Trend: The bitcoin market is looking indecisive after witnessing solid two-way business on Tuesday.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value clocked a high and low of $11,263 and $10,580 yesterday, before ending the day with a 1% drop at $10,940. Essentially, bitcoin charted a ""spinning top"" candle, which represents marginal gains or losses on the day following two-way price action.      The spinning top is widely considered a sign of indecision in the marketplace, with neither bulls nor bears being in a commanding position. It also validates the overbought or above-70 reading seen on the 14-day relative strength index.      In such situations, seasoned technical traders often wait on the sidelines till a strong directional move emerges. So far, bitcoin has not shown any signs of directional strength. Although the cryptocurrency is flashing green near $11,030 at press time, it is still trading well within Tuesday’s price range.      Acceptance above Tuesday’s high of $11,263 would revive the bullish bias put forward by Monday’s high-volume break above the February high of $10,500 and expose resistance at $12,000.      Alternatively, a high-volume move below $10,500 would invalidate Monday’s bullish breakout.      Exchange flows suggests the latest price breakout is here to stay, as does increased institutional participation.

42422898,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qoVh,1596020464,Why DeFi on Ethereum Is Like Algorithmic Trading in the ‘90s,"Mona El Isa would never go back to traditional finance.  The former Goldman Sachs vice president developed the Melon protocol, a vehicle for creating Ethereum-based hedge funds without having to spend the tens of thousands of dollars it would take to launch a fund in traditional markets.  “Managers who are used to a fund custodian and fund administrator are starting to experiment with automating technology,” El Isa said.  El Isa admits that not many founders in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space have her background in traditional capital markets. In the traditional world, DeFi resembles what algorithmic trading was in the 1990s, said Tarun Chitra, CEO of Gauntlet Network, a business that does stress-tests on blockchain networks and DeFi platforms.  “A lot of money was made on random equities on electronic exchanges,” Chitra said of the Clinton-era innovation. “They were people who were more technical than financial.”  Now Ethereum’s surging DeFi sector could force a similar migration.  Read more: Proof-of-Stake Chains Team Up to Prove DeFi Is Bigger Than Ethereum  Chitra said some traders are beginning to move away from over-the-counter (OTC) desks in favor of emerging DeFi platforms like automated market maker (AMM) Curve and lending protocol Compound. Why bother with an OTC middleman?  Still, while proprietary traders have taken an interest in DeFi, few hedge funds and banks have entertained it, he said.  But builders who’ve come from equities to DeFi see a lot of opportunity for growth.  New interest  For example, in the Melon protocol’s first year there were almost no users and only $250,000 on the platform, El Isa said. After Melon’s user interface was updated last February, the platform’s total assets increased to $1.2 million. Now the number of funds on Melon has tripled in the last four months, although many of them are experimental, El Isa added. Around two dozen of the funds on the platform are real funds.  “The biggest success story on our platform is now half of the whole [assets under management],” El Isa said, referring to a closed fund that only lets in whitelisted investors. “He’s got $625,000 on his network.”  For traditional funds, operation costs are normally less than $100,000 for the first year and $75,000 for every year after that, she added. On Melon, the setup cost is currently $100 for the first year and around $1,000 to $2,000 per year in gas prices after that (the cost was around a fourth of those estimates last year, before gas prices started to spike).  Read more: Soaring DeFi Usage Drives Ethereum Contract Calls to New Record  As funds build longer track records, El Isa hopes Melon will become more attractive to investors. “The track records are not long enough to make that attractive for people yet,” she said. “I think in a few months people will be like, ‘Wow, this fund has consistently been outperforming ether.’”  Even if El Isa ends up moving from building protocols to launching another fund, she said she’s determined to do so in DeFi. Melon protocol is now decentralized and El Isa has launched Avantgarde Financial, a company that plays the lead developer role for Melon. El Isa was formerly the CEO of Melonport AG.  ‘Less scary’  Barney Mannerings, CEO of Vega Protocol, which aims to allow users to spin up a market for derivatives anywhere in the world, said that while DeFi is still in an experimental phase, he sees a great deal of interest from the large investment banks – the ones he used to advise while at Capco and Accenture.  Instead of creating a new derivative over the course of a year, Vega will allow users to submit market proposals and deploy them over the course of a few hours.  In keeping with Ethereum’s ethos, the protocol was designed to cut out the middlemen: In this instance, the commercial bank or broker that consumers pay to trade and the investment bankers those middlemen pay to trade for the consumer.  Read more: One Billion, Two Billion, Three Billion, Four? DeFi’s Knocking on TradFi’s Door  “I was always thinking about the traders that I knew in London and New York and the products that they used in the real economy,” Mannerings said.  In addition to building out Vega, Mannerings said he hopes large countries like the United States develop more crypto integrations to the traditional economy.  “If I want to hedge my U.S. dollar risk on Vega and I can do it for a fifth of the cost, that’s great, but I also need to make sure that I can get U.S. dollars into an appropriate stablecoin and take that position easily,” he said. “We have to chip away at that risk and make it less and less scary.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/29/why-defi-on-ethereum-is-like-algorithmic-trading-in-the-90s,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90f7c6ff9cad8df9ec82da4a8e1226e17b2fa777-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384214,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1JFB,1596016848,How the EEA Made Ethereum Palatable to Big Business,"Ethereum has attracted the attention of large companies for almost as long as it has been around. But it wasn’t until early 2017 that a formal business-focused consortium came into being: the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA).      The EEA created a concerted effort to get large corporates and tech providers on the same page when implementing private (or “permissioned”) versions of Ethereum technology. Thereafter, the EEA became a kind of standards organization for blockchain business, with one eye on a future state when the public blockchain might morph together with private implementations.      After all, company intranets gradually became part of the internet, or so blockchain believers will tell you.      Back in February 2017 when the EEA launched, Julio Faura, who was head of blockchain at Banco Santander at the time, volunteered to become EEA founding chairman, a position he held until July 2018.      “A few of us just got together to try to make the technology a little bit more suitable for enterprise uses,” recalls Faura, now the CEO of blockchain-based payments company Adhara. “We were all doing our own rudimentary attempts to use the technology. But it wasn’t conceived for enterprise use – rather for trustless and public use – and was very far from being ready.”    Along came Quorum    Megabank JPMorgan Chase had released its open-source Ethereum-based blockchain client, Quorum, towards the end of 2016. The bank’s privacy-centric take on Ethereum became a powerful driver for enterprise adoption, said Faura.      “Quorum came along and it was a blessing,” he said, “because it made doing permissioned networks with a consensus algorithm much easier. Suddenly performance started to go up. I remember configuring networks myself with thousands of transactions per second, so it was very exciting.”    No matter what enterprise platforms look like in 15 years, there will be pieces that evolved from ‘industry coopetition’ conversations that never would have happened otherwise.    JPMorgan was one of the founding members of the EEA, a group of 30 or so companies that included Microsoft, Santander, ConsenSys, CME Group and Intel (a further 86 members were announced a couple of months later at CoinDesk’s 2017 Consensus event).      “The EEA inspired huge organizations to think about solving long-bemoaned data coordination challenges in new ways,” said Amber Baldet, CEO of Ethereum-based startup Clovyr. “No matter what enterprise platforms look like in 15 years, there will be pieces that evolved from ‘industry coopetition’ conversations that never would have happened otherwise.”      Baldet, who led the team at JPM that built Quorum, said that while there’s “still a long way to go,” enterprises are building more creative systems for decentralized data sharing than ever before.      “The EEA will continue to shape core technologies that move tons of records (and crypto assets) and most consumers will continue to know nothing about any of it – and that is success,” she said.      After the early blockchain hype, which saw almost every decent-sized bank either joining a consortium or announcing a proof-of-concept, the enterprise distributed ledger technology (DLT) space seems to have fallen into what Gartner calls the “trough of disillusionment.” Call it an inevitable phase in the lifecycle of new and potentially transformative technologies.      If you ask the banks and enterprise teams involved in blockchain work what’s happening, most will tell you it’s simply been a case of keeping their heads down and building. Behind the scenes, the EEA has been working hard on standards work, said Yorke E. Rhodes III, a program manager on Microsoft Azure’s blockchain team.      “There has been a tremendous amount of specification work going on,” said Rhodes. “We are building on a foundation of not only five years of Ethereum, but three-plus years with an enterprise focus. It’s a good spot. The things that needed to happen are really happening.”    Freedom of choice    A crucial characteristic of the enterprise Ethereum ecosystem is choice, said Adhara’s Faura.      “It’s very important whatever technology ends up being used is not controlled by a single software vendor, because that creates a huge strategic risk,” Faura said.      The choice of enterprise Ethereum clients widened considerably last year with the release of Hyperledger Besu, a high-profile cross-pollination between the two ecosystems, built by ConsenSys engineers, and designed from the ground up to incorporate the Ethereum mainnet.    Ethereum’s community was really keen to see this platform used, not just by anarchists and radicals and people who wanted to take down the banks, but by the banks themselves.    A hat-tip must go to the then-EEA lead Ron Resnick, who worked tirelessly to broker a deal between Ethereum and Hyperledger, added Faura.      In fact, a bridge between Ethereum and Hyperledger had been a long time coming. Before he became the executive director of Hyperledger, Brian Behlendorf recalls meeting Ethereum chief scientist Vitalik Buterin.      Behlendorf, a leading figure in the open-source software movement, said Ethereum and its growing community reminded him of the culture of the Apache Software Foundation and its friendly approach to corporate use cases.      “I remember being fascinated by the idea of decentralization at the heart of architecture, and something much more interesting than just a cryptocurrency play,” said Behlendorf. “This was a programmatic network for building decentralized applications, and its community was really keen to see this platform used, not just by anarchists and radicals and people who wanted to take down the banks, but by the banks themselves.”      For his part, current EEA Executive Director Daniel C. Burnett said there is a ton of stuff to be excited about, flagging up ConsenSys engineer John Wolpert’s Baseline Protocol as an interesting enterprise project in 2020.      More generally, Burnett pointed to the stability of Ethereum and the end of the frontier mindset of previous years.      “In the past couple of years, things are beginning to settle a bit,” Burnett said. “It’s certainly not boring, but we’re a little less of the Wild West.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/29/how-the-eea-made-ethereum-palatable-to-big-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/268df8fb61d548dc387354527c6bc2e6926fd555-1500x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a note to clients Wednesday, CEO Pascal Gauthier said the French hardware wallet provider fell victim to a large-scale data breach from an unauthorized third party.  The hacker, whose identity remains unknown, gained access to Ledger's e-commerce and marketing database.  Customers affected include those who signed up for Ledger's newsletter or to receive promotional material.  Information stolen included email addresses, with a smaller ""subset"" of 9,500 customers also having their full names, postal addresses and phone numbers exposed.  In total, the company estimates around one million email addresses have been stolen.  Payment information, passwords and cryptocurrency funds have not been affected.  The data breach was first detected as part of a bug bounty program on July 14.  Ledger estimates the data may have been accessed from April until the end of June.  A Ledger spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk the data breach has now been fixed.  The wallet provider has now alerted the French authorities and is filing a complaint with the public prosecutor.

42384208,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1J57,1596009619,605 Days Later: How ArCoins Got the SEC Go-Ahead as an Ethereum-Traded Treasurys Fund,"Convincing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the Ethereum blockchain is an acceptable medium to store regulated investment funds was no easy task for Mason Borda of Tokensoft.      The CEO of this Bay Area tokenization firm spent over two years crusading for a peer-to-peer tradable fund. Borda developed compliance-appeasing token standards, hired regulatory veterans to lead his transfer agent subsidiaries and even moved Tokensoft into the same San Francisco high-rise as the SEC’s West Coast enforcement wing (albeit on a different floor).      The effort paid off earlier this month: In early July, the SEC granted a notice of effectiveness to ArCoin, a cryptographically-traded U.S. Treasury Fund pursued by digital asset manager Arca Labs and designed by Tokensoft. It’s the first Ethereum blockchain-native investment fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (a so-called ‘40 Act Fund).      Read more: Arca Labs Launches Ethereum-Based SEC-Registered Fund      ArCoin’s registration marks a shift in the regulator’s tolerance for public blockchain investment vehicles, Borda said. He and Arca CEO Rayne Steinberg both said ArCoins could light the way for future offerings with similarly decentralized structures.      But regulatory filings capture just how hard-fought first that victory was.    Long road    Arca signaled its earliest interest in offering a U.S Treasury Fund in an SEC filing from November 2018. Over the next 605 days, it filed volleys of prospectus amendments as nearly 10 different evolutions of what would eventually become ArCoins repeatedly hit a regulatory wall.      Steinberg said there was no guarantee his firm’s costly regulatory campaign would ultimately prevail.      Tokensoft signed on as Arca’s tokenization specialist in July 2019, Borda told CoinDesk. Even then, a full year passed before ArCoin finally cleared that regulatory wall.      “This took a lot of backchanneling with the SEC,” Borda said.    10 floors apart    Borda said one benefit of running a compliance-focused tokenization firm from his high-rise in San Francisco's Financial District is that SEC regulators asking questions about his proposals are just an elevator ride away.      “There was a case where I received a call the night before to do a presentation in the morning because the Crypto Czar was in town,” Borda said, explaining office proximity (Tokensoft is on floor 38, the SEC is on floor 28) made “meetings a lot more accessible.”      That can be handy when meeting topics are as potentially contentious and fraught as the marriage of public blockchains and regulated investment vehicles. The SEC has been reticent to approve crypto-tied proposals before, perhaps most visibly in its ongoing denial of a bitcoin ETF.      Read more: What to Make of the SEC’s Latest Bitcoin ETF Rejection      The particulars behind one crypto project’s failure before the SEC and another’s success are not interchangeable. For example, ArCoins do not represent an investment in the Ethereum blockchain, only a product (U.S. Treasurys) whose vehicle is traded on that blockchain.      But Borda said a major obstacle in pushing through a tokenized ‘40 Act Fund were regulators' misconceptions of how crypto markets function.      “There were a lot of preconceived notions just based on how the crypto space operates that we had to overcome: that these tokens are freely tradable, that there's no way to control them,” Borda said.      He said regulators “thought these securities worked like bitcoin.” He made clear to CoinDesk that they don’t.      The SEC declined a request for comment.    Restricted transfers    Borda said Tokensoft and Arca had to prove ArCoin’s blockchain backend was far more restrictive, regulatable – and, well, permissioned – than the permissionless Ethereum mainchain this fund’s smart contract lives atop. Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform in the world.      Unlike the vast majority of Ethereum tokens (and also completely dissimilar to bitcoin and most every other crypto asset), ArCoins cannot just jump around from wallet to wallet, Borda said.      Two critical functions are executed before a transfer prevents ArCoins from flying freely between wallets: detectTransferRestriction and messageForTransferRestriction. They comprise the core of the ERC-1404 standard, a whitelist-focused derivation of the ubiquitous ERC-20 token standard.      Tokensoft spearheaded development of the open-source ERC-1404 with the express purpose of creating a token standard that could pass regulators’ muster. Its outcome, unveiled in September 2018, restricts token activity like peer-to-peer transfers and trading during lock-up periods, among other concerns.      Read more: TokenSoft Launches Wallet Allowing Investors to Self-Manage Security Tokens      Though these caveats seemingly run counter to the permissionless, borderless and stateless ideals of some corners of Crypto Twitter, Borda said they’re essential for working inside regulators’ demands – and even workable within the idealist’s framework.      “It is possible to build a token on a public blockchain and have it follow the most aggressive standards in the world,” he said.      ArCoins accomplishes this by checking intended recipients against a whitelist maintained by the fund’s transfer agent, Tokensoft subsidiary DTAC LLC, at the start of any transfer. Only investors who have passed AML and KYC protocols (and whose wallet addresses therefore appear on the whitelist) will receive their ArCoin.      Non-whitelisted addresses receive nothing – Borda said the transfer simply won’t go through.      “The cool thing about having this on a blockchain is you can now prevent unauthorized transfers, the smart contract will just reject it,” Borda said.    Appealing to Arca    Arca CEO Steinberg said his firm tapped Tokensoft only after considering at least eight different tokenization tech providers.      Steinberg said the only thing clear to Arca, a digital assets investment management firm, was that it didn’t want to build that solution in-house. Though Steinberg admitted Arca could have programmatically restricted smart contract transfers without ERC-1404, he said “that’s kind of reinventing the wheel that already exists for something like this.”      “Specialists are most likely going to do that better and come up with novel solutions like a standard than you will in building it yourself,” he said.      Steinberg sees this as a key value of utilizing standards like ERC-1404. His firm has now demonstrated that the SEC is comfortable granting effectiveness to a ‘40 Act investment vehicle that runs on ERC-1404.      ArCoin’s proving the concept may make what Steinberg described as the expensive, expansive and time-consuming procedure of bringing any investment product (and especially blockchain-based ones) past the SEC a little bit easier.      He noted that getting any product on the regulated market is never a sure thing, and recalled how “the vast majority of people” he spoke to after ArCoins’ green-light were shocked that the historically reticent SEC had allowed ArCoins to register.      “The goal of Arca is to become a multiproduct asset manager with multiple different wrappers like this,” he said.    Future groundwork    Borda chalked Tokensoft and Arca’s success in registering ArCoins to a confluence of compliance and structural factors – one major one was his tapping former SEC and CFTC regulator Alex Levine to head the legal team for Tokensoft’s affiliate transfer agent DTAC LLC.      Borda is even more bullish about ERC-1404 and the future of token-based securities in the ‘40 Act Fund mode, especially its potential appeal to regulators, who could use the built-in transfer restrictions of smart contracts to their benefit: They won’t ever have to worry about unapproved transfers or bearer instruments falling into the wrong hands.      Companies could also catch that upside, he said:      “This should prove to the companies out there that there is a path to have better compliance.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/29/605-days-later-how-arcoins-got-the-sec-go-ahead-as-an-ethereum-traded-treasurys-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17d5a258fbd7976625768cf7a81d478d46e2a924-2400x1597.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
