Debuted at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas, the ICO will be facilitated via the sale of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), a model that was previously used in token sales like the one for filecoin, which raised more than $200 million.  The tZERO token, according to statements, will trade on the alternative trading system (ATS) being developed by the firm. The Argon Group and RenGen – companies hired to advise on the development of the ATS – will also work on the SAFT offering.  Patrick Byrne, Overstock.com's CEO and the chairman of tØ, struck an ambitious tone about the planned sale and what it means for the company's efforts more broadly.  Byrne said in a statement:  ""While many doubted, the tZERO team worked hard, to be at the tip of the spear in creating and launching credible, capable and institutionally scalable blockchain technologies for crypto assets. Today those efforts are attracting interest from both the crypto community and the largest global institutional funds.""  Word about the planned token sale emerged earlier this month, when Byrne told the International Business Times that the token would be used to facilitate on-platform payments. Notably, he predicted that the sale would garner as much as $500 million, depending on the interest from accredited investors (like some past sales, the tZERO offering is being restricted).  The tØ ICO will first run as a private pre-sale from Nov. 15 to Dec. 31. The proceeds from the ICO will help the company scale its technology development and regulatory teams, as well as either build or take over a custody and clearing firm, according to the company.

The arrangement, announced today at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas, makes BitGo the first ""full KYC partner"" for Civic, according to its founder and long-time bitcoin investor, Vinny Lingham.  Civic has already been providing basic identity services, such as verifying mobile numbers and email addresses, for clients including the how-to website WikiHow. Now Lingham's firm will be scanning and verifying documents, such as passports and utility bills, provided by investors in RMG tokens, to prove their identities and ensure compliance with anti-money-laundering laws.  Once they have completed that KYC process, however, those investors would be able to reuse their Civic identities with future partners that join the company's network, rather than go through the same process again, Lingham said in an interview Monday. In this way, he said, the partnership could help create a network effect, since the more businesses that accept a digital identity, the more consumers will get one and vice versa.  ""We chose the Civic identity solution because of their innovative underlying model which protects consumers and businesses alike,"" said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, a provider of multi-signature wallets, in a press release. ""Civic is keeping user data safe in a way which provides higher accuracy for businesses at lower cost.""  A project of the derivatives giant CME Group and the U.K.'s Royal Mint, Royal Mint Gold seeks to streamline the trading of physical gold by using tokens on a blockchain.  It will initially be available only to British residents but will expand globally in the coming months, according to Civic.  Civic raised $33 million in a token sale earlier this year and aims eventually to create an ""identity marketplace"" where businesses can use its tokens to pay for identity verification by various providers.

42427975,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50Vh,1508857216,Lawsky: ICO Fever Could Bring Cryptocurrency Backlash,"The rise in popularity of the initial coin offering (ICO) funding mechanism, and potential for associated fraud, could lead regulators to come down hard on cryptocurrencies broadly.  That's according to a former regulator, one who, as the first-ever superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, the state agency that regulates financial services and products, was among the first globally to attempt to regulate bitcoin.  ""A big open question is, if ICOs get very out of control,"" it could result in ""a backlash against the entire bitcoin and crypto ecosystem,"" Benjamin Lawsky said Monday at Money2020 in Las Vegas.  Lawsky, who now runs a consulting firm and is a visiting scholar at Stanford University's Cyber Initiative, told the audience:  ""Regulators have never seen a new financial product explode with the speed and velocity at which ICOs have exploded.""  The head of the NYDFS from 2011 and 2015, it's on Lawsky's watch that the agency created and enacted what has come to be called the ""BitLicense"" regulations, a series of alterations to state money transmission laws specifically tailored to digital currencies.  Since he left office, however, the field has expanded well beyond bitcoin, to include not only a wider variety of cryptocurrencies and private blockchains for enterprises but also ICOs – a term that denotes the process by which a company or software development team seek to use a custom cryptocurrency to raise funds from the public.  According to CoinDesk's ICO tracker, token sales have raised a cumulative $2.67 billion, most of it in the last 18 months.  Yet, while many see ICOs as an engine of innovation, there is also widespread worry that a number of these projects are illegal, unregistered or outright scams.  Harsh 'reality'  Against this backdrop, the concern expressed onstage by Lawsky was not unique to his panel.  At the conference, several attendees throughout the day remarked that the ICO market's excesses could bring a regulatory hammer down on the entire industry. Still, most appeared to think this would be a natural reaction to market development.  For his part, Lawsky added that he was not casting judgment on the funding method, but ""merely pointing out the reality"" of how regulators operate when faced with practices that could put consumers at risk.  Elsewhere in remarks, Lawsky also sought to exonerate the BitLicense from criticism it has been too restrictive on businesses. (To date, less than five startups have successfully applied for and received a license under the rules.)  To drive home the point home, Lawsky emphasized that when word got out that his agency was investigating bitcoin, a banking lawyer phoned Lawsky to applaud the effort – and encouraged him to ""shut it down.""  But Lawsky said he didn't want to do that, and that he just sought to ensure there were appropriate ""guardrails"" to prevent money laundering and protect consumers.  Still, the anecdote perhaps seeks to underscore the pressure other regulators may now be under in regards to ICOs, and why he believes the U.S. market could end up producing rules that, while contentious, are less restrictive than those seen internationally.  He told the audience:  ""The Bitlicense [is] looking more reasonable in the context of China.""

The Kremlin published five orders from Putin over the weekend, representing perhaps the most direct move to date by the Russian government to oversee activities around the tech. Not only do the orders from Putin mandate new legal structures around cryptocurrency within Russia, they ambitiously establish a plan to use the technology to create a ""single payment space"" within the Eurasian Economic Union, which features Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia as members.  Notably, Russia intends to apply rules for initial public offerings to the ICO use case, through which cryptographic tokens are sold to bootstrap a new blockchain network. Putin also ordered that the government, under Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, develop a system for cryptocurrency miners to register and pay taxes on their income.  One of the decrees seems to throw its weight by existing efforts within the State Duma, Russia's national legislature, as well as the central bank to develop legislation that regulates cryptocurrency activities.  It stated:  ""The Government of the Russian Federation, in conjunction with the Bank of Russia, shall ensure that changes are made to the legislation of the Russian Federation providing for...[the] determination of the status of digital technologies used in the financial sphere and their concepts (including such as ""technology of distributed registries"", ""digital letters of credit"", ""digital mortgage"", ""crypto-currency"", ""token"", ""smart contract"" "") [b]ased on the obligation of the ruble as the only legal tender in the Russian Federation.""  The Russian government also wants to throw its weight behind efforts by startups to develop new financial services around the tech.  One of the decrees mandates the creation of a so-called regulatory ""sandbox,"" or a framework within which companies can test products in limited settings. Some countries, including the UK, have set up finance-oriented sandboxes that have attracted a number of blockchain-focused companies to date.

42427990,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL511h,1508852705,Bitcoin Price Falls to 5-Day Low Following Fork Currency Creation,"The price of bitcoin fell to a five-day low today, though the reasons why are perhaps complex to unpack.  At press time, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is $5,710, up from a daily low of $5,560. As per CoinMarketCap, week-on-week, BTC is up 3.3 percent, while on a monthly basis, it's up 55 percent.  However, if you're looking for a culprit for the dip, industry observers are so far pointing to the creation of bitcoin gold yesterday.  A new cryptocurrency cloned from bitcoin, bitcoin gold is now in the process of ""forking"" to a new blockchain (with new rules), a process by which the bitcoin blockchain is copied and new digital assets are distributed to existing bitcoin owners.  As put forward by analysts including Blockchain Capital's Spencer Bogart, a former head of research and Needham and Co., the decline could be a sign investors are moving money to alternatives now that bitcoin gold has initiated the fork. Bogart's argument is that bitcoin rallied ahead of the launch in anticipation that holders would be credited with bitcoin gold.  However, it's unclear whether this could be the case. As the new cryptocurrency was not yet distributed, investors may have simply switched out of bitcoin positions on the basis further sell pressure is ahead on the distribution.  But, while it's too early to tell, the next question is simply, is the pullback in bitcoin over?  Price action analysis suggests a potential for further losses.  Daily chart  Bitcoin gold aside, the retreat from the record highs above $6,100 can also be credited to overbought technical conditions, and in this light, considered to qualify as a healthy correction.  The chart above shows:  Bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence  Bearish price-money flow index (MFI) divergence  Rising trend line (dotted blue line) support is seen around $5,280 levels  View  The doors are open for a drop to $5,280 levels. Only a daily close below $5,280 would signal the rally from the September low of $2,980 has topped out above $6100 levels.

42427986,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50rh,1508850047,Bitcoin Gold Website Down Following DDoS Attack,"A new cryptocurrency called bitcoin gold (BTG) officially separated from the bitcoin blockchain this morning – and the project's website has been under denial-of-service attacks ever since.  Aiming to be a more egalitarian derivative of the popular cryptocurrency, one able to be mined with less specialized hardware, the first step on the bitcoin gold roadmap was to take a ""snap shot"" of the blockchain as a means of a creating a replica with new rules. As detailed in CoinDesk's explainer, BTG now plans to distribute free cryptocurrency in such a way that it is available to anyone holding bitcoin at the time of the fork.  Not long after this process initiated, however, the developer team began reporting challenges:  ""Massive DDoS attack on our cloud site. 10M requests per minute. We are working with the providers to ban all the IPs. We will be up soon!""  But hours later, it seems like the website is still being bombarded, preventing those who wish to keep track of the cryptocurrency's progress. Complicating matters is that the new blockchain is not yet public, and block explorers or other common tracking tools have yet to be released.  Still, denial-of-service attacks are a common occurrence in the launch of cryptocurrency projects, especially those that prove controversial or divisive, and bitcoin gold meets this definition. Behind the project is Hong Kong-based LightningAsic CEO Jack Liao, who is openly critical about bitcoin mining in its current form, and the companies that profit from the activity.  It's probable that his opinions could make bitcoin gold a target for attacks, but as well as this point of contention, the project has been the cause of some other criticism.  Namely, BTG uses a process by which cryptocurrency will be privately created before it is open-sourced to the public. This process has been the cause of volatile discussion on developer channels, and has caused some to distrust the cryptocurrency.  There's a few other sources of outrage – including that bitcoin gold hasn't quite solved the risk of ""replay attack"" – which refers to transaction complications that may arise when two incompatible versions of the bitcoin blockchain are unable to distinguish each other.  That said, the cryptocurrency is still under development, and there has yet to be official word from the project on the cause of the outage.

42427991,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50zh,1508839240,Perks of a Follower? HKEX Seeks Second-Mover Advantage on Blockchain,"Thanks to blockchain, the world's stock exchanges are now being reimagined from the ground up.  With fees charged by countless brokers and other middlemen, moving transactions to a shared, distributed ledger has been touted as a way to free up money to be invested in other opportunities.  But even so, according to Bernie Kennedy, a senior business advisor to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), there are advantages to being not an early adopter, but a fast follower.  During a panel at Swift's Sibos conference last week, Kennedy indicated that she's content with moving slowly toward blockchain adoption, learning first from the successes and mistakes of others.  Kennedy said:  ""I like second mover advantage in this space. I don't want to be out in front.""  As part of the HKEX's exploration of the technology, the firm plans to launch a private market for smaller companies interested in building blockchain applications and is engaging with the Australian Securities Exchange and others to explore other use cases.  ""Can we leapfrog into the future?"" she wondered aloud on the panel. ""Or do we have to take it step by step?""  For those answers, Kennedy is studying the moves of other securities exchange incumbents – which she said have significantly more advanced blockchain projects – as guidance.  The early adopters  One of the counterparts Kennedy is looking to – Sergey Putyatinskiy, CIO and board member of Russia's National Securities Depository (NSD) – shared the stage with her during the panel. Putyatinskiy contended that yes, blockchain could help stock exchanges ""leapfrog"" to state-of-the-art new systems.  The NSD's work with blockchain-based securities is among the most advanced revealed to the public so far. Since beginning its exploration of blockchain over a year ago, the NSD has published the results of an early test for a proxy voting solution using the NXT blockchain and – as revealed on stage – has sold a $10 million bond by Russian telecom MegaFon using the open-source Hyperledger Fabric platform.  The latter project, expected to mature before the end of the year, was built with input from Russia's central bank as part of the NSD's larger push to create more transparency in an effort to woo foreign investment.  Another leader represented at the event was Banca IMI, a subsidiary of Italian banking group Intesa Sanpaolo, which has been experimenting with using blockchains for the issuance of securities.  During the panel, head of interest rate and credit models at Banca IMI Massimo Morini revealed a new ethereum securities application for integrating external data.  Designed to automate the collateral management process, the project is part of a larger effort by Banca IMI to ""layer"" public blockchain functionality on top of a private blockchain.  Morini said:  ""Now that we are working with this kind of technology, we see that this can be useful both to build a market where counterparties do have privacy and a bilateral relationship when trading, but they have, at the same time, the ability to use the public blockchain when it comes to speed of execution.""  Questions remain  But none of those projects are yet live, which hints at the lingering questions that remain about how a blockchain solution would work for a securities exchange.  For instance, HSBC's global head of custody John van Verre, wondered about liability concerns on the panel.  HSBC's work in the area appears to be largely focused on supply chain trade finance and the potential issuance of fiat currencies on a blockchain. But according to van Verre, that's because the risk from corporate actions related to a company's shareholders was higher at HSBC, and there isn't a clear view of who gets blamed if something malfunctions within these blockchain ecosystems.  Hinting at why Kennedy believes her firm could benefit from taking a ""wait and see"" approach, van Verre asked the audience:  ""Ultimately, if something goes wrong, who is responsible?""

According to the company blog, the service can be applied in use cases such as digital wallets, lending platforms, marketplaces, exchanges and more, doing away with the need to build a bespoke system in each instance. Instead, the cryptographically secured product is provided as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering.  Anticipating perhaps that providers of financial services may be wary of hosting their data in the cloud, Chain emphasized the security of the product, saying:  ""While ledgers are managed as a service, all transactions must be signed by the relevant keys.

Speaking with Federal News Radio last week, Debbie Bucci, a lead IT architect for the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), discussed the department's past call for academic papers, which saw more than 70 submissions from a range of sources. She remarked that many of the submissions focused in some way on healthcare administration  Among the possible applications she discussed is using the tech as a publicly viewable layer for U.S. citizens to follow the status of their payments within programs like Medicare or Medicaid.  ""For Medicare, Medicaid, maybe the amount you're paying for – I know that for some processes people go in every quarter and they check their payment status, and so it's possible there could be a public ledger that authoritative sources may post to that everyone could collectively use as [a reference] for identifying information and possibly processing the calculations to get there,"" she told the radio service.  Elsewhere in the interview, Bucci highlighted the technology's possible benefits for record-keeping purposes, telling the Federal News:  ""The general idea of a blockchain is an authoritative ledger, so certainly anything you want to keep records of – I think it kind of aligns with more of the business processes to assist with healthcare.""  Similarly, she indicated, blockchains can be used as a more efficient method of tracking payments made into and out of both systems, either by storing that information on a public ledger, or holding some information and allowing subscribers to calculate their specific costs and benefits more easily.  The department has not yet pursued any particular blockchain research project, she clarified. At the same time, HHS is staying engaged with the developer community, and Bucci described a recent hackathon at which the winning project focused on the use of blockchain for tracking clinical trial data.

The announcement follows a similar deal between Ledger and Gemalto, which revealed a partnership earlier this month that was also focused on secure storage.  The concept centers around the idea of creating a so-called ""enclave"", within which private keys are stored and transactions are both generated and signed. For Intel, that focus on hardware has been a defining characteristic to date, including its work with startup 21 Inc on mining chips.  ""Following the launch of a line of hardware wallets based on our operating system integrated in a secure chip, working with a leading player like Intel is a unique opportunity to keep providing our growing client base with innovative solutions for cryptocurrency and blockchain applications,"" Eric Larchevêque, Ledger's CEO, said of the partnership.

42427983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50lh,1508817926,Overstock to Release Blockchain Product to Curb Naked Short Sales,"Overstock will soon release software designed to help alleviate the very problem that got its founder involved in blockchain in the first place.  After three years of development, a subsidiary of the U.S. retailer now has a tool to let short-sellers identify and borrow shares they want to trade against, instead of shares they might not actually possess. Called a Digital Locate Receipt (DLR), the technology based on the company's tZERO platform appears to be designed to curb the practices of so-called naked short selling in which investors trade on stocks they promise to borrow, but do not.  The opaque trading practice is widely credited for driving CEO Patrick Bryne to blockchain in the first place.  Multiple calls and emails to Overstock and its subsidiary Medici Ventures were not returned Monday, but according to a post on the tZERO website:  ""All DLR creations and purchases are registered to the blockchain creating a permanent order trail and accessible digital record.""  The DLRs, which are expected to be formally revealed at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas this week, are designed to be blockchain-based versions of Regulation SHO ""locates,"" which were introduced in 2005 to cut down on investors trading against other people’s stocks during off-hours trading.  The regulation was meant to give stock owners the assurance that they could reap rewards from this off-hours trading by formally lending the stock – and thus to discourage short sellers from merely promising to borrow the stocks that they wanted to bet against.  While Overstock's tZERO platform, a product of the subsidiary Medici Ventures, has seen relatively little adoption, the new application appears designed to entice companies to list their shares by making them more attractive to investors.  The idea is to ensure that actual shareholders are compensated for activities involving the assets they own during off hours and are no longer cut out.  The service will likely be available on tZERO’s Neotrader web portal and via a proprietary web portal through which users can route the trading.  Finally, when users purchase a DLR, they will be able to short the underlying stock equal to the number of receipts they’ve purchased for the day or the overnight positions they’ve acquired.  Also expected to be revealed this week are the pre-sale terms of tZERO’s initial coin offering, which is expected to start on Nov. 1 and run until Nov. 15.

42427979,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50fh,1508815989,Jeff Garzik Startup Bloq to Launch Cross-Blockchain Cryptocurrency,"""'Tis what it 'tis.""  Call it a statement on the times, but Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik isn't exactly expecting a warm reception from some circles to the news his startup is launching a new token.  Long a controversial figure at the center of the debate on how best to scale the public bitcoin blockchain, Garzik's company is today announcing what it believes will be a solution to the infighting he perceives as keeping money out of the established cryptocurrency market.  Revealed at Money2020 in Las Vegas, Bloq is unveiling metronome, a cryptocurrency that seeks to claim a series of firsts in crypto-economics, including offering users the ability to switch the same token back and forth between blockchains as desired.  ""It's sort of a best-of-all-worlds cryptocurrency,"" Garzik said, describing it as a ""boxcar"" that could ride on top of any compatible blockchain.  Garzik told CoinDesk:  ""You can run it on the etheruem, ethereum classic, quantum. That's one of the key ways that this is self-governing, for the first time, you're not tied to a single blockchain, you can run metronome contracts on any EVM compatible blockchain.""  As for how it will impact the Bloq business model, today focused on enterprise services, Garzik and co-founder Matt Roszak indicated they believe the project is consistent with the firm's ""multi-token, multi-network"" vision for blockchain development.  Launched in 2016 with the goal of bringing Red Hat-inspired services to bitcoin, Garzik echoed a familiar refrain in an interview, voicing his belief bitcoin is still destined to form the ""root of an Internet of blockchains,"" others of which may have different use cases and attributes.  In this light, Garzik framed metronome as seeking to offer a utility to those who want a more reliable store of value and foundation for distributed applications.  ""We feel that there is a consistent demand for a cross-chain option. I point to the major uncertainty of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work, where the proof-of-stake system is going to change the money supply, but [ethereum] hasn't stated how much it will change,"" he said.  That said, Garzik said metronome isn't exactly a bid to replace the prevailing public blockchains available on the market, so much as to tailor them to a different audience.  ""You can expect the bitcoin maximalists' from the ethereum maximalists' reactions, but it's building on the strength of existing blockchains, it's not trying to elbow them aside,"" he said.  No 'existential risks'  But if some of the more acrimonious debates in the cryptocurrency world seem besides the point, Garzik's involvement appears to have left him with inspiration for his latest work.  As outlined in the metronome white paper, one of the chief selling points of the token is that it boasts ""zero founder control"" after its launch, and as such, is resistant ""to the whims of individual or community discord"" by functioning as a series of smart contracts.  All told, metronome is comprised of four types of smart contracts, which allocate the distribution of new tokens, regulate supply and liquidity and move funds between accounts.  Praised as a feature by the Bloq team, Roszak believes this sophisticated automation will encourage large investors who have yet to put money into public cryptocurrencies for fear of the seemingly erratic decision-making by developer groups to do so.  ""When they analyze cryptocurrency, the analysts engineers and economists sitting at the committee, they're saying they pick the top two – bitcoin and ether. Then they say, well there's forks, 'civil wars,' 'proof of Vitalik,'"" Roszak posited. ""They're cryptographically secure but these components create surprise and risk.""  In contrast, Roszak framed the Metronome token as ""fixed and locked in stone,"" attributes he suggested should counter these concerns.  However, Roszak seemed to shirk the idea that the nascent state of blockchain technology could pose problems given the fixed nature of the distribution system of the cryptocurrency. Rather, he sought to stress that while the monetary network is set, flexibility will be provided in the ability of the token to port the system between blockchains.  ""Having that rigidity of knowing exactly what the token does and behaves, that certainty, seeing that mintage curve, is not available in any other cryptocurrency,"" he said.  Monetary network  Equally unique, however, is how the token will seek to operate on launch.  As described in its announcement materials, metronome is opening with an initial auction of 10 million MTN, with 8 million MTN being made available to the public and 2 million being set aside for Bloq as the principal development team.  Any proceeds of the sale will be sent to smart contracts that will manage the distribution of the funds, which Garzik said will distribute the proceeds ""over decades"" to metronome users.  As an example, there will be a stable allocation of new metronome tokens daily, with about 2,880 MTN created during the first 40 years.  Here, too, Garzik sees metronome as offering an innovation in a market where most cryptocurrencies are scheduled to reduce their supplies to zero.  ""That's one of the worries about the bitcoin-type supply curves, and it's assumed and hoped that that will pay to sustain the system. But, that's just a hope,"" Garzik said.  Still, it's here where metronome perhaps could run into issues similar to the ones it's seeking to avoid in its design. Noted in the white paper is how certain groups could take steps to alter the supply rate.  ""A consortium could agree to fork the MTN supply with a new MTN contract on the same or different chains, by exporting funds they control to the new fork,"" the white paper reads.  That such decisions could also form the subject of infighting is not addressed in the paper.  Sale details  Armed with this roadmap, Bloq is moving ahead on the launch of the token, setting a date for the first week of December for its token sale.  According to Roszak, the Metronome code has undergone three audits since it was first written, from Ethereum Foundation member Gustav Simonson; Demian Brener, CEO of smart contract review services provider Zeppelin; and Martin Swende, security lead at the Ethereum Foundation.  On release to the public, Bloq will aim to use a descending price auction model by which tokens become less expensive to purchase as the sale progresses.  Yet, it was the current state of the code that was perhaps the biggest selling point of a sale.  ""Today, you can raise money with a good idea, but as some of these things get pressure-tested, you'll have to launch with code, then you'll have to launch with users,"" Roszak said.  He concluded:  ""We're launching with code that's ready.""

42427980,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50jh,1508809357,Bitcoin Gold Initiates Hard Fork Split to Create New Cryptocurrency,"A new cryptocurrency has been created through a hard fork of the bitcoin blockchain.  Completing a process that began in July, the bitcoin gold technical team has taken what it calls a ""snapshot"" of the bitcoin blockchain so it could be recreated and reconfigured with new rules, ultimately creating bitcoin gold at block 491,407 on the original blockchain.  As of now, the process is underway by which the new bitcoin cryptocurrency will be completed and released to existing bitcoin users.  As profiled in our explainer, the project aims to tackle the perceived problem that miners as a group have too much influence over the direction of the bitcoin network. To lessen their control, bitcoin gold replaces bitcoin's current mining algorithm with one that cheaper graphics processing units (GPUs) are able to mine.  The idea stems from the competitive nature of bitcoin mining, which now relies solely on expensive application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In part because of this, mining has centralized into the hands of large mining companies, which bitcoin gold supporters feel works against bitcoin's key value proposition: decentralization.  Still, while the hard fork has been initiated, that doesn't mean users can yet claim their funds.  Until they can, bitcoin gold developers will operate the new blockchain in isolation, with the first round of block rewards being set aside for allocation to the development team.  According to group representatives, the new cryptocurrency network is aiming to be open to the public by November 1st.
