The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced Friday that Griffith was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on Thanksgiving Day.      “Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,"" John Demers, an assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement.      The complaint specifically cites violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The announcement said that Griffith should appear in a court in Los Angeles today.      In April, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, held the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference. According to a complaint brought against Griffith, he sought approval to attend the conference which was denied. He then traveled to the conference without permission, allegedly by way of China.      The complaint against Griffith was authored by a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation named Brandon M. Cavanaugh. He notes that on May 22, 2019, the two participated in what Cavanaugh calls a ""consensual interview.""      The complaint asserts, ""At the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, GRIFFITH and other attendees discussed how blockchain and cryptocurrency technology could be used by the DPRK to launder money and evade sanctions, and how the DPRK could use these technologies to achieve independence from the global banking system.""      The affidavit does not name any specific cryptocurrency, only asserting Griffith had expertise in what it refers to as ""cryptocurrency-1."" It alleges that ""after the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, Griffith began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of Cryptocurrency-1 between DPRK and South Korea.""      As part of the interview, Griffith showed the agent photos and documents from the gathering and said he would like to return to the conference when it happens again in 2020.      According to his LinkedIn page, he has worked for the Ethereum Foundation since October 2016. As previously reported, he has served as its head of special projects. Subsequent to publication, the foundation sent a statement to CoinDesk that noted it is aware of and following the situation, writing:    ""We can confirm that the Foundation was not represented in any capacity at the events outlined in the Justice Department’s filing, and that the Foundation neither approved nor supported any such travel, which was a personal matter.""    Griffith's attorney was not immediately reachable.      The complaint alleges that Griffith was interested in seeking citizenship in another jurisdiction. His LinkedIn page currently shows him primarily residing in Singapore. Recently, he has been working to certify ethereum as compliant with Islamic law.      The case is being handled by the Southern District's Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit, with assistance from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.      ""Because this Affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of demonstrating probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of my investigation,"" Cavanaugh wrote.

42403611,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgOd7,1575048625,Cisco Patent Would Secure 5G Networks With a Blockchain,"Network tech giant Cisco has won a patent detailing how it could leverage blockchain to secure the data in 5G telecommunication networks.      The San Jose, Calif.-based company submitted a patent application in June 2018 for a blockchain platform that can be natively integrated in wireless networks, according to a Nov. 26 filing from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).      The blockchain platform aims to manage data sessions between an equipment user, such as a phone or laptop, and a virtual network. In other words, the new technology can manage part of the data exchanges between a network and a connected device via the blockchain interface.      The company describes how a blockchain platform can be used to support network slices, referring to an architecture that allows multiple independent virtualized networks to run in the same physical infrastructure more efficiently.      “This service-oriented architecture supports network slices, which employ an isolated set of programmable resources that can implement individual network functions and/or application services through software programs within a respective network slice, without interfering with other functions and services on coexisting network slices,” the filing said.      Cisco is among a long list of information technology companies that are exploring the integration of blockchain technologies and Internet of Things (IoT). Companies, such as Bosch, BNY Mellon, Chronicled and Filament, have used Hyperledger, ethereum and Quorum to create or upgrade their products and services.

Starting Thursday, users of Huobi Russia have an option to deposit Russian rubles on their balances via bank transfers, the exchange announced Thursday at an event in Moscow.      The deposits will be processed via a bank in Uzbekistan, where Huobi Russia’s legal entity, HBRU CIS, has secured an approval letter from the country’s Justice Ministry, Huobi Russia CEO Vladimir Demin told CoinDesk.      The document, seen by CoinDesk, was issued by the Agency of State Services under the Ministry of Justice of Uzbekistan and featuring HBRU CIS as an addressee. It states that the ministry considers the operations related with digital assets, software and IT-consulting as not prohibited by the applicable law.      Uzbekistan has recently made steps to facilitate the work of crypto exchanges in the country, including via tax incentives. Huobi will be working with local institution InfinBank, Demin told CoinDesk.      CoinDesk has reached out to the Ministry of Justice and InfinBank for comment.      The Russian arm is also launching its own platform for token listings, called Huobi Russia Origin. So far, projects that wanted to conduct a token launch on Huobi could only do it via the exchange’s launchpad platform Huobi Prime, owned by Huobi Global. Now there'll be a Russia-only option.      According to Shawn Chong, business development lead at Huobi Cloud, the exchange’s franchise management branch, Huobi Russia Origin will have its own token for fees that will be launched soon.      A listing on Origin will not mean the project will also be listed on Huobi Prime, and such tokens will be available only for buyers registered on the Russian platform, Chong told CoinDesk. A separate listing service had been requested by the Huobi Russia team and Huobi Cloud decided to provide the option, he said.      “If it helps the market in a certain region and it’s not illegal, we don’t see any reason for not helping them. The main idea is, we want to grow with these new [local] projects,” Chong said.      The launch date for Origin is still to be determined, and will depend on the demand for potential listings on the new platform, he said.      The rules for listing applications will be published by Dec. 30, according to Demin. There will be no listing fee, but Huobi Russia may offer associated paid services, like a legal opinion on the project before listing, he said.

Coinbase has not agreed to acquire the crypto brokerage Tagomi.      ""There is no acquisition planned,"" Rachael Horwitz, from the Coinbase communication team told CoinDesk in an email.      ""The rumor of Coinbase acquiring Tagomi is not true,"" a Tagomi spokeswoman also confirmed.      San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase was said to have acquired prime broker Tagomi for $150 million, according to a source who claimed familiarity with the matter.      Tagomi, which has raised $28m in venture capital funding from firms like Pantera and Morgan Creek, was reported by The Block on Nov. 15 to be in acquisition talks with Coinbase.      “Tagomi and Coinbase were in talks last week – well Coinbase acquired Tagomi this morning for $150 million,” a source who claimed knowledge of the deal told CoinDesk. Both companies denied any acquisition subsequent to the story's publication. A source at Tagomi told CoinDesk that the two companies have had negotiations about doing business, not acquisitions.      Coinbase and Tagomi had not returned requests for comment by press time.      Tagomi was founded last year by ex Goldman traders and former Union Square Ventures employees.      Just days ago, the firm teamed up with Binance.US, the U.S. partner of the Malta-headquartered Binance cryptocurrency exchange, to bring extra liquidity.

42403614,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgOg4,1575026484,Bitcoin Faces Biggest Monthly Price Drop of 2019 Despite Late Upturn,"View  Bitcoin looks set to end November on a negative note. A monthly close below $8,300 could yield a deeper drop in December, according to a popular analyst.  The hourly chart continues to call a move higher to $7,800–$8,200. A bull reversal would be confirmed on the three-day chart if prices close (UTC) above $7,380 today.  Acceptance below $6,515 would invalidate the bullish hammer candle seen on the three-day chart and invite stronger selling pressure.    Bitcoin looks poised to post the biggest monthly loss of 2019, despite the recent recovery from six-month lows.      At press time, the number one cryptocurrency is priced at $7,530 on Bitstamp, representing a 17.6 percent loss from the Nov. 1 opening price of $9,586.      The percentage drop would have been over 30 percent had prices stayed at the six-month low of $6,515 hit on Nov. 25.      Bitcoin last suffered a bigger monthly loss in November 2018. Back then, prices had tanked 37 percent, reviving the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. The cryptocurrency went on to hit a low of $3,122 in December 2018.    Historical pattern fails    Bitcoin was expected to put on a good show in November with the miners' reward halving due in May 2020. Historically, the cryptocurrency has picked up a bid six months ahead of the supply-cutting event.      This time, the run-up period has begun with a price drop, possibly due to miners selling off their bitcoin, as noted by popular analyst Willy Woo.      Bitcoin dropped from $13,000 to $7,500 in the third quarter and the price slide took a toll on miners' profitability. Weak hands likely sold coins in November to recover their costs, strengthening bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency.      Looking forward, BTC may suffer a deeper drop in December if prices end the current month below $8,300, according to Woo.      Currently, a firm monthly close (Nov. 30, UTC) above $8,300 looks unlikely. That said, prices could rise to $8,000 before Saturday's UTC close, as short-term technical charts are flashing bullish signals.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin has bounced up from the former resistance-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline at $7,360, reinforcing the bullish breakout.      The moving averages (MAs) are indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side. For instance, the 50- and 200-hour MAs have produced a bullish crossover and the 100-day MA looks set to cross above the 200-hour MA soon.      Meanwhile, the relative strength index is reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 print.      Bitcoin could rise to resistance near $7,800. A violation there would expose $8,200 (inverse head-and-shoulders target).    3-day chart    With the hourly chart reporting bullish conditions, BTC's current 3-day candle looks set to end (Friday, UTC) above $7,380.      That would confirm the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the hammer candle created in the three days to Nov. 26, and possibly yielding a rise to $8,200.      Sellers will likely make a strong comeback if prices drop below the hammer candle's low of $6,515, although that looks unlikely at press time.

The exchange said in an urgent noticehttps://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037327571-Urgent-announcement-about-current-situation-of-IDAX-Global on Friday that its chief – whose name was not provided – has been missing for unknown reasons for five days.    As a result, the exchange said the access to its cold wallets that store almost all the crypto assets on IDAX has been restricted and deposits and withdrawals are not allowed. ""It is recommended that you refrain from using our all platform services,"" the exchange said.    The announcement comes just days after the exchange notified users on Nov. 24 about congestion holding up deposits and withdrawals and that it would no longer provide serviceshttps://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036736691-IDAX-no-longer-provide-services-for-users-in-China to China-based users. It's not clear what quantity of assets are in the firm's custody.    It's also not known, publicly at least, what led to the unnamed CEO's disappearance. There are signs that IDAX has close ties to a Chinese firm based in Shanghai and has a presence in the city, which has been taken tougher measures in cracking down on crypto exchanges and token sales recently.    Shanghai link    IDAX's official website states that it was founded in 2017 in Mongolia by an entity called the Global Blockchain Research Center (GBC). The GBC's website also lists IDAX exchange as one of its businesses.      However, public information also shows that the exchange is connected to a company called Nianxiang Group that is based in Shanghai, China.      Currently, the website of Nianxiang Group is not accessible. But indexed Google data shows that the firm's website, before it went down, did say that Nianxiang's overseas business unit owns the Global Blockchain Research Center.      A profile page of Nianxiang on Chinese news portal Sohu also shows it's behind the Global Blockchain Research Center.      According to Chinese business registration data, Nianxiang Group is solely owned by an individual called Lei Guorong and is registered in Shanghai. Further, of all the 43 individuals that list IDAX as their employer on LinkedIn, 26 indicate Shanghai is current location.    Token issuance  Notably, IDAX, with its presence in Shanghai, conductedhttps://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023581251-IDAX-Token-is-coming-Enjoys-Exclusive-Benefits- a sale for its ERC-20-based exchange token, called IDAX Token (IT), in February this year, during which 200 million IT were issued.    In an announcement in February, the firm said the subscription price was at $0.2 per token, but did not clearly say what portion of the 200 million IT was sold.    IT was listedhttps://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023733852-Long-expected-appearence-of-IDAX-TOKEN-IT- for trading after the issuance and has since then dropped by over 90 percent and was delistedhttps://idax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036130852-IDAX-s-solution-for-IT on Nov 21.    In February, the firm released a white paper – only found in Chinese – and stated that 60 percent of the tokens will be used as ""operation incentives,"" while the team will keep 10 percent to itself. A further 20 percent was to be reserved for the ""IDAX ecosystem"" and 10 percent to circulate on the exchange.

42403587,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgN8d,1575019806,New Law May Encourage German Banks to Offer Crypto Services From 2020,"[Updated] With the passing of new legislation, banks in Germany may soon feel more confident to offer direct sales and custody of crypto assets.      Until now, the lack of a legal framework meant banks have been reluctant to offer services around crypto assets, but a new law implementing the fourth EU Money Laundering Directive and bringing financial institutions legal clarity is likely to change that, according to local business newspaper the Handelsblatt in a report on Wednesday.      The bill has now been passed by both the Germany's parliament – the Bundestag – and the Federal Council, and will come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020.      Handelsblatt had originally suggested that banks are currently barred from offering digital assets, but has since amended the article. CoinDesk has also spoken to industry insiders in Germany who confirmed there had been no crypto ban, though one had been considered in earlier an earlier draft of the legislation.      The law goes further than had been previously planned, the Handelsblatt report says. In the previous draft of the bill, banks would have had o have relied on external custodians or dedicated subsidiaries.      Sven Hildebrandt, head of the consulting firm DLC, welcomed the news, telling the Handelsblatt: ""Germany is well on its way to becoming a crypto-heaven. The German legislator is playing a pioneering role in the regulation of [crypto assets]. ""      German banking association BdB was positive about the legislation, too. ""Credit institutions are experienced in the safekeeping of client assets and in risk management, are committed to investor protection and have always been controlled by the financial supervision,"" it said. As such, banks could ""effectively prevent money laundering and terrorist financing"" with crypto assets.      The incoming bill would further enable investors to invest in cryptos ​​via Germany-based funds and not be forced to put their money abroad, according to the BdB.      Some commentators expressed concerns over a perceived threat to consumer protections arising from the new law.      Niels Nauhauser, financial expert at the consumer center in Baden-Wuerttemberg, told the newspaper: ""If [banks] are allowed to sell cryptocurrencies and keep them for a fee, they run the risk of turning their assets at risk of total loss to their clients, without them knowing what they are getting into. ""      Edit (15:30 UTC, Dec. 3 2019): This article has been changed to correct an inaccuracy in the source article from Handelsblatt. We've also added the fact that the law has now been passed.

42403602,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgNLQ,1575015000,IBM Patents Blockchain to Stop Drones From Stealing Packages,"Amazon, DHL and FedEx are building drones that deliver packages to your door. IBM, however, envisions a future where drones steal them instead.      The computing giant won a patent on Nov. 12 for “Preventing anonymous theft by drones” with an Internet of Things (IoT) altimeter that triggers upon liftoff, tracking the package’s altitude and uploading the data to a blockchain platform.      The patent seeks to get ahead of two modern realities: people buy goods online, and people fly their own personal drones. That could be a problem, it says, if the trends combine to devious ends.      “The confluence of the increase in drone use and the increase in online shopping provides a situation in which a drone may be used with nefarious intent to anonymously take a package that is left on a doorstep after delivery,” the patent description reads.      IBM’s solution is to outfit packages with an IoT sensor that only triggers if it detects a change in altitude “exceeding the threshold … expected when the object is lifted away by a drone.” Once it does, the sensor periodically updates the blockchain, and the intended recipient, with the package’s altitude.      To be clear, there’s no indication that IBM actually plans to build an operational device. And if it does, it may well swap out a blockchain for some other “secure database,” according to the patent.      But the description does say blockchain is the patent’s “preferred embodiment,” in part because it allows disparate “trusted entities” – the merchant, the shipper, etc. – to input the package’s whereabouts.      It is unclear how prevalent drone heists are in America. At the moment, most shipping companies are focused on building delivery mechanisms.
