42397907,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWnJ,1409349608,Gallery: Chamber of Digital Commerce Holds Bitcoin Education Day in DC,"The Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) held Congressional Bitcoin Education Day today, a Washington, DC-based event aimed at fostering awareness of bitcoin and its related technology among Congressional staff members in US Congress.  The event saw more than 30 bitcoin professionals from 12 states meet with the staff of six US congressional committees, including those on Financial Services; Science, Space and Technology; Agriculture; Small Business; Energy and Commerce; and Ways and Means.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CDC president Perianne Boring framed the event as part of its ongoing effort to lay the groundwork for increasing its influence in Washington in 2015 and beyond. Further, she noted that the current Congressional recess provides the organisation with an important opportunity to correspond with those who work for members of the government body.  Boring told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin is a very transformative technology, and obviously the community has a big educational hurdle we're trying to work through. So, we came to Capitol Hill today to spend a little more time with staff members, since they're the ones who do the policy research that members of Congress rely on.""  The CDC's goal for the event was to have either personally briefed every office in the US House of Representatives on bitcoin or to have at least delivered education material on the subject to those offices. Boring said that the group secured 70 one-on-one briefings with financial services assistants.  View the gallery below:  Event in action  The day began with a closed briefing during which industry participants prepared for the day's meetings. From 10 am to 12 pm EST and 1:30 pm to 4 pm, meetings were then held with Congressional staffers. The meetings were then followed by a reception lasting until 6 pm.  While the schedule was focused, Boring acknowledged that these meetings were proceeded by substantial preparations, adding:  ""We put a significant amount of time into contacting all the congressional offices [...] It took a couple weeks to schedule all these meetings.""  Notably, US representative and noted bitcoin advocate Steve Stockman was also in attendance, serving as member sponsor for the event and flying in from Texas to welcome participants to the proceedings.  Official sponsors for the event included Banks Worst Fear, Buckley Sandler LLP, eSpend, Tally Capital and Washington DC Bitcoin Users Group.  Educational materials  As for the resources provided to Congressional staffers, Boring said the documents were basic and high-level, providing an overview of bitcoin's use as a financial tool and the wider bitcoin industry with details such as its market capitalization.  Boring told CoinDesk that, as of now, the goal is to provide as much information as possible to those working for US lawmakers, and to introduce them to the CDC and its work.  She said:  ""Right now a lot of people on Capitol hill and in the general public don't know much about the technology, so we try to teach people what it is, and then once we get over that hurdle then we can start having more advanced policy discussions, how do we appease regulators and any concerns they may have.""  Still, Boring stressed that the CDC is only just getting started, and that this is the beginning of a long-term strategy, concluding:  ""The CDC just opened a month ago, and we're here for good.""

42397912,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWsE,1409340310,Hal Finney on Bitcoin: In His Own Words,"Hal Finney  was arguably one of the earliest bitcoin pioneers, having been the second person to receive bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto himself.  Yet beyond his role in the history of digital currency, Finney was also a cryptographic master, a veteran of bitcoin mining and a voice – sometimes prophetic – within the community at large. By perusing Finney’s post history on the Bitcoin Talk forum, one can see that he foresaw the promise of bitcoin and its meteoric rise at the end of 2013 while the technology was still in its infancy.  CoinDesk collected a number of quotes from Finney’s Bitcoin Talk posts, which, combined, paint a portrait of someone passionate about both the grand and the granular aspects of bitcoin.  For example, in January 2011, Finney noted the more speculative conversation taking place in the community's early days, saying those with bitcoin should think about how they could put that potential wealth to work in a positive way.  As he explained:  “Since we're all rich with bitcoins, or we will be once they're worth a million dollars like everyone expects, we ought to put some of this unearned wealth to good use.”  Looking back, Finney's comments on a host of other subjects ring just as true today.  On mining  As one of the earliest bitcoin miners, Finney brought a unique perspective to the table when discussing the topic.  In late 2010, he discussed the relationship between the profitability of the process and the overall health of the network. He argued for a healthy balance to ensure that network participants remain as concerned about security as they are about making money, saying:  “Mining should not be too profitable (because nothing should be too profitable, the world doesn't leave free money lying around). Therefore the price of Bitcoins can't rise too much above the cost of mining (counting equipment depreciation among the costs of course).”  In January 2011, he offered additional thoughts on the topic, suggesting that the cost of bitcoin mining should be somewhat prohibitive. He voiced concern that a wealthy mining operation could theoretically take over the network, and pointed to the expenses associated with mining as a positive element of the process.  Finney noted:  “Ultimately it's good for the network for mining to be expensive. It makes it that much harder for a well financed attacker to dominate the network.”  On investment  Like many others at the time, Finney was no doubt excited about the prospect that the price of bitcoin – which at the time was a fraction of a penny – might skyrocket.  He speculated in one post from January 2011 that, compared to other investments, bitcoin seemed like a relatively safe bet. As Finney hypothesized:  “It's pretty strange really that we all see a good chance that bitcoins will hit a dollar in the relatively near future. How many investments can be expected to triple in value in that time frame? Is gold going to be $3500 any time soon? Apple stock going to triple? Maybe Facebook, if you could get some. That seems like a pretty sure thing. We are really lucky to be in at the beginning of a possibly explosive new phenomenon. Considering the odds against most money-tripling investments, Bitcoin looks like a good place for a percentage of your portfolio.”  Yet at the same time, Finney was acutely aware of the risk that a speculative bubble could form in the bitcoin market. He cautioned that investors could get whipped up into a frenzy given the returns possible, saying:  “The danger is if people are buying bitcoins in the expectation that the price will go up, and the resulting increased demand is what is driving the price up. That is the definition of a BUBBLE, and as we all know, bubbles burst.”  Finney’s later comments suggest that he saw the price climb to $1,200 in late 2013 – and the subsequent halving that took place in the weeks that followed.  On bitcoin’s future  During his active years in the bitcoin community, Finney often provided unique insights – and criticism, when appropriate – for a number of initiatives, including early generations of wallet clients. It was during those days that many in the community were unsure of where the technology might wind up in terms of utilization.  In a post from December 2010, Finney suggested that the traditional banking system might one day embrace bitcoin. He wrote:  “I see Bitcoin as ultimately becoming a reserve currency for banks, playing much the same role as gold did in the early days of banking. Banks could issue digital cash with greater anonymity and lighter weight, more efficient transactions.”  He added in a separate post from the same month that digital currency “could be used as an inexpensive timestamp service, allowing you to prove that a certain document existed on or before a certain date.” This latter statement foreshadows the use of bitcoin technology for smart contract applications.  Ultimately, Finney was a firm believer in the promise of block chain technology. And, perhaps prophetically, he knew that the market would have to expand greatly in order to function as a viable network on a global scale.  As Finney put it in March 2011:  “The computational power of the network is proportional to difficulty; and it appears that difficulty is proportional to bitcoin price. It follows that unless bitcoins become substantially more valuable than they are today, the Bitcoin network will never be substantially more resistant to attack than it is today. For Bitcoin to succeed and become secure, bitcoins must become vastly more expensive.”  Image via Wired",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/29/hal-finney-on-bitcoin-in-his-own-words,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71c25c6b0287ad0911accc6adbb837b1e1ea9857-1009x600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397913,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWtD,1409334646,Air Lituanica Shows Bitcoin's Use in Travel is Taking Flight,"Air Lituanica is now accepting bitcoin for flight tickets as part of its ongoing bid to embrace new and innovative methods of serving customers.  With the news, the two-plane, Lithuania-based airline becomes the second airline, and second in eastern Europe, to add bitcoin payments following airBaltic's July announcement.  In a blog post, Air Lituanica director of commerce Simonas Bartku illustrated the benefits bitcoin can bring to travel businesses, writing:  ""Bitcoin payments are highly beneficial for the aviation market – this currency helps to attract more buyers from abroad as bitcoins can be used anywhere in the world.""  Air Lituanica's statements provide the latest evidence that bitcoin is gaining traction beyond the airline industry in the wider global travel industry, and that a growing number of consumers and businesses in this sector are looking to tap digital currency as a solution.  Long term, digital currency proponents believe the technology can provide real convenience to travelers due to the hassles and high fees associated with currency conversion as well as the high risk of fraud international travelers face. Further, it seems a growing number of businesses are looking to help the community test its prediction.  With this in mind, CoinDesk takes a look at recent news that showcases how bitcoin is building traction in the travel industry.  Bitcoin for destination travel  In addition to appealing to existing travel companies like Air Lituanica, bitcoin is also helping savvy entrepreneurs gain a foothold in the space.  For example, just last week, Bali-based travel booking agency BitcoinTour launched with the goal of making it easier for travelers to use bitcoin to visit the popular island. Notably, Bali is part of the BitIslands initiative, a project that aims to turn the Indonesian tourist destination into a top destination for bitcoin enthusiasts.  BitcoinTour now allows bitcoin users to book flights via major airlines serving the island, including Air Asia, Citilink and Lion Air, as well as a number of area hotels.  Expedia opens doors to hotels  Another segment of the travel industry that is increasingly interested in bitcoin is the hotel sector. In recent months, the Sandman Hotel Group in Canada and at least one member of the popular Dutch easyHotel franchise have begun to accept bitcoin as payment from customers.  However, bitcoin travel has recently become significantly easier with the addition of Expedia and CheapAir to the ecosystem, the former of which nets more than $1bn in annual revenue, while the latter serves more than 200,000 hotels worldwide.  Land travel lags behind  While international travel options have proved to be more accommodating of bitcoin services, land travel alternatives have been less quick to embrace bitcoin.  Still, there have been companies exploring this as-yet untapped part of bitcoin's travel sector. For example, CheapAir announced in May that it would accept bitcoin for its Amtrak railway bookings.  Further, PassportParking, a parking solutions provider that serves lots in 35 US states revealed it would seek to implement a bitcoin payments trial in 2014.  Combined, the news events show that bitcoin is gaining ground in the travel industry, but that the idea of an easy, bitcoin-only vacation may be years away.

42397910,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWpH,1409330131,"Argentina's OmbuShop Adds Bitcoin Payment Option for 2,000 Merchants","OmbuShop has announced a new partnership that will allow 2,000 merchants in Latin America to add bitcoin as a payment option for their online stores.  Founded in 2011, the e-commerce website provider primarily caters to clothing and accessory merchants. OmbuShop is based in Argentina, but serves Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Spain.  Speaking to CoinDesk, OmbuShop CEO Ernesto Tagwerker described the service as one way his company is looking to embrace the future of online shopping while enabling its international merchants to sell more effectively in a global economy.  Tagwerker told CoinDesk:  ""We see in bitcoin a great medium to get paid from clients all over the world. Now, Argentine shops can sell to the US and all over the world without having to worry how to get paid.""  Tagwerker added that bitcoin will provide his merchants with a key advantage given that payment gateways in Argentina are less evolved than popular international options such as PayPal and Stripe. Notably, under an amendment passed in 2012, Argentinian consumers are barred from using PayPal.  OmbuShop has raised more than $40,000 in funding to date, netting the capital from Start-Up Chile, a Chilean government-backed investment fund aimed at attracting high-potential entrepreneurs to Chile.  To launch bitcoin payments, OmbuShop partnered with Argentina-based bitcoin merchant processor BitPagos.  'Argentina's Shopify'  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitPagos CEO Sebastian Serrano described OmbuShop as Argentina's homegrown version of Shopify, the online marketplace that allows merchants to set up their own websites through its service.  Like Shopify  , OmbuShop lets merchants set up online storefronts by registering with the website, uploading products and customizing their design.  OmbuShop offers a free 15-day trial of its services, while Shopify offers a 14-day no-risk trial.  Tagwerker indicated that enabling bitcoin payments on the platform will be similarly easy, saying:  ""Once you have your BitPagos account, enabling the option for your online shop only takes a few seconds.""  In addition to bitcoin, OmbuShop accepts Argentine pesos, Colombian pesos, Chilean pesos, euros, Mexican pesos and US dollars.  High adoption rates expected  Tagwerker suggests that OmbuShop isn't treating bitcoin as a novelty offering, and that it expects the new feature to be widely implemented by its customers in the coming months.  He went on to suggest that OmbuShop has been observing the bitcoin space with interest for a period of years, but that it only recently decided to integrate the payment option due to the decisions of major US-based merchants.  Tagwerker indicated that other factors were at work as well, adding:  ""Our decision was influenced by news about major players in the e-commerce industry, like WordPress and Dell, and by the current situation of the Argentine economy.""  Merchant adoption rises  Though noteworthy for Argentina's entrepreneurs and merchants, the partnership is also the latest success for BitPagos, which raised $600,000 earlier this year with the goal of enlisting new, high-profile clients in its processing service.  The partnership is the second major deal inked by BitPagos so far this August, following its agreement with major e-commerce newcomer Avalancha. The company also launched Ripio, a new service that will enable consumers to buy bitcoin at 8,000 convenience stores.  Serrano told CoinDesk that these recent successes are simply a by-product of the company's measured approach to the market.  He concluded:  ""I think a lot of ground work we have been doing in past months is starting to pay out and we hope to be able to keep the momentum high.""

42397905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWlL,1409326206,DigitalBTC Reports $4 Million Revenue in Preliminary Annual Results,"DigitalBTC has released the first set of financial results for a publicly traded bitcoin company.  The Australia-based bitcoin mining services provider has emerged as an industry leader, making history when it debuted on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) last June. As such, digitalBTC provides a unique window into the bitcoin mining industry, a sector that is only beginning to become more transparent as it attracts investor interest.  In its preliminary final report for the full financial year, the company reported estimated revenue of $4.0m and normalised earnings (EBITDA) of approximately $2.5m. The underlying net profit after tax was $600,000. The results were generated from more than three months of operations.  Despite its suite of services, digitalBTC named bitcoin mining as its business, writing:  “Bitcoin mining, the company’s core cash generator, delivered the majority of EBITDA. This trend has continued into the 2015 financial year with a further $1.3m invested in mining hardware post year end, increasing the company’s bitcoin mining capacity by approximately 90%.”  While the numbers are encouraging, digitalBTC reported a net loss after tax, caused by a one-off accounting expense related to the reverse takeover of Digital CC Limited (formerly Macro Energy). The takeover was announced last March.  The full document also sheds more light on the company’s revenue, profit and loss.  Sign of success  With the takeover taken out of the equation, the company delivered a strong performance and it expects good results in fiscal year 2015.  DigitalBTC executive chairman Zhenya Tsvetnenko said the underlying digital currency results highlight the earning capacity of the business, telling CoinDesk:  “Aside from some non-cash accounting related adjustments, I couldn’t have hoped for a better first result. We are committed to continuing to deliver results and performance against our business plan and targets in the current financial year, in order to build a track record of strong earnings for our shareholders.”  The company published its first quarterly report a month ago, reporting sales of 4,000 BTC, roughly $2.1m at the time. The company said it mined approximately 8,600 BTC since launching its mining operation.  Further, its original $4m investment in mining hardware was recovered prior to the publication of the quarterly figures, in under three months.  Industry first  Tsvetnenko added that he is pleased to announce the first financial results to be released by a bitcoin focused company on a major stock exchange.  “This is a first for our industry, and the transparency it provides into our operations and financial reporting is a new level of disclosure for our shareholders, and should help the understanding and acceptance of bitcoin in the broader investment community,” said Tsvetnenko.  Having mined 8,600 BTC in just over two months of operations, DigitalBTC accounted for roughly 3% of all bitcoins mined during the period.  However, the company is adding more hardware – it says it has almost doubled its capacity in fiscal 2015 since it reported the first figure, meaning it is difficult to estimate DigitalBTC’s growing share of the network.

42397911,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWrF,1409322615,UAE's First Bitcoin Exchange Launches in Dubai,"Multinational bitcoin exchange igot will today launch the first bitcoin exchange in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to capitalize on the unique opportunity posed by the market.  The Australia-based company's founder Rick Day told CoinDesk the new exchange will operate with a Commercial Brokerage License, approved by the local government. It has also secured local banking partners for direct deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams (AED).  Igot  has hired a small team for business development and customer support for its Dubai office.  Key features  Day added that igot will continue to offer the same flat 1% trading fee to all its customers worldwide, with no additional fees for deposits or withdrawals in either bitcoin or fiat currencies.  The exchange is aimed more at consumers than professional traders, with a simple buy-sell interface. However, it recently implemented a feature called 'Future Trade' which functions like limit orders on a more advanced exchange, giving customers the option to set their price and wait for bitcoin's value to rise or fall to that level before executing the trade.  As well as bank access, igot is also working with local payment processors to give users more options in the coming months.  Market for remittances, investment  As well as having a concentration of high net-worth individuals among its citizens, about 60% of the UAE's workforce consists of expat Indian workers, both professional and manual, who often send their money back home.  In fact, foreign citizens make up a staggering 91% of the UAE's population of 9.2 million, with 1 million Indians representing the country's largest overall group.  Day said that, given that India is currently igot's largest market outside Australia, its presence in the UAE puts the company in a very interesting position.  ""Our strategy to expand igot is based on a pairing system. India is one of our best performing markets. In terms of trade volumes, I think we're the biggest local exchange there. Indians sent $70bn home in 2012.""  Igot will also target UAE's wealthy native population, as well as its institutional investors, all of whom have a diverse investment portfolio. The UAE economy is the second largest in the Arab world.  UAE and bitcoin  For a country now famous as a world hub for capitalism and rapid development, the UAE has seen relatively little action on the bitcoin front.  So far, news has been limited to one pioneering pizzeria and a startup, Umbrellab, which offers payment solutions including bitcoin and was reportedly trying to integrate bitcoin ATM functions into Dubai's existing payment kiosk network.  Igot's Day said forming banking relationships was never easy, but the company was able to use its established banking track record in Australia, New Zealand and India to state its case with UAE bankers.  Australian multinational  Headquartered in Adelaide, Australia, igot has always had plans for expansion into the potentially lucrative markets of Asia and the Middle East.  Day said the company had processed more than $25m worth of trades in the seven months since it launched. Users executed over 10,000 trades via the Future Trades feature, a number that spiked during the bitcoin price volatility of the past few weeks.  It also has a $15 friend-referral scheme and has implemented Jumio Inc's BISON ID verification system, which has seen the company's fraud rate drop by 93.29%.  Igot uses the same homepage and interface internationally, but users can connect directly to bank accounts in Australia, India, UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand.

42397903,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWkM,1409319432,New Xapo Deposit Feature Lets Users Buy Bitcoin Via Wire Transfer,"Bitcoin service provider Xapo has launched a new feature that enables users to purchase bitcoins directly from the company.  The company announced the new service, Xapo Deposit, via its blog earlier this week. According to Xapo, users can now send euro and US dollar payments via wire transfer and receive bitcoin in return.  Going full circle  Xapo's blog post pointed to its bitcoin debit card, wallet and insured vault storage as evidence that it has “come full circle” in offering customers the ability to secure, transact and now acquire bitcoins.  Now that Xapo users can reload their accounts without much hassle, it is evident that the company is positioning itself as a one-stop service for bitcoin.  From start to finish, Xapo's buying process takes just three steps. Firstly, a user must log in to their Xapo account and click the 'deposit' button on their wallet homepage.  Next, a page will open with all the relevant details for the wire transfer, including a personalised 'Xapo reference code'. This identifier remains the same for the user's future deposits and helps Xapo identify where funds have come from in order to send them to the correct account.  Once the wire transfer has been completed, the user will receive a confirmation email. Xapo claims the funds will arrive in their bitcoin account between two and five days later.  But who is behind this new functionality? CoinDesk's tests of the service suggest that Fidor Bank has partnered with Xapo to enable the wire transfers, though Xapo representatives have been contacted to confirm this. Fidor is known for its cryptocurrency-friendly approach, recently becoming the first bank to integrate Ripple's payment protocol.  Xapo will charge a fee of 1% for this conversion and adds that banks may charge additional fees to wire these funds. With regards to the conversion rate the service uses, Xapo's website states:  ""Deposits will be converted using market rates applicable at the time of the conversion (including any third-party fees we are required to pay, which will not exceed 0.3%). Xapo does not guarantee a particular conversion rate.""  Competing bitcoin on-ramp services  Xapo is not the only company with such aspirations. Coinbase and Circle offer similar services, although the Circle service is still in private beta.  In any case, both companies have a bitcoin on-ramp, but they use a different approach. Coinbase allows instant buys, but customers have to use a card and pay a fee. Circle does not, as its beta service employs Automated Clearing House (ACH) to handle transactions. The downside here is that the process can take a couple of days.  By contrast, Shanghai-based bitcoin exchange LakeBTC is taking an unconventional approach.

42397915,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWwA,1409303394,SpectroCoin Takes on BitPay in Europe With Bitcoin Processing Solution,"SpectroCoin has launched a new bitcoin merchant processing solution for the European market, adding yet another vertical to its suite of products.  The UK and Lithuania-based company also offers a bitcoin wallet and a bitcoin brokerage, services CEO Vytautas Karalevičius believes will position SpectroCoin as an all-in-one solution comparable to Coinbase in the US.  SpectroCoin  bears other similarities to Coinbase too, as the company also aims to challenge Coinbase's main rival in the US merchant market, BitPay.  Notably, BitPay has recently made the European market a focal point of its strategy, adding 220volt, AirBaltic and Shipito to its books in the past few months.  However, Karalevičius believes his company has a crucial edge given its slew of existing services, explaining:  ""We are more flexible in our solution, because we are more looking to accommodate the specific needs of our merchants, providing full support to them. BitPay is more attractive to small clients who don't need full support.""  The company currently provides localized payments to nearly 30 countries in Europe. Using specific domestic bank accounts in each country, SpectroCoin is is able to offer bank transfers in most European countries including those in the Eurozone, as well as the Czech Republic, Poland and UK.  Unlike BitPay, SpectroCoin's merchants can choose to keep the bitcoin they receive on their SpectroCoin account or to cash out into fiat currency. BitPay merchants can choose to keep bitcoin they receive as payment, but must store that bitcoin with a compatible bitcoin wallet service.  Entering Eastern Europe  A graduate of Cambridge University and a former Bloomberg employee, Karalevičius has worked to promote bitcoin both in Lithuania through media appearances and on the global stage, running for a seat on the Bitcoin Foundation's board of directors in April.  Karalevičius said his company will aim to focus its adoption efforts on eastern and central Europe, citing the Czech Republic, Poland and the UK as key markets. More specifically, he said his company will focus on companies that sell virtual goods, such as tickets or services.  The CEO also emphasized that capitalizing on the cross-border capabilities of bitcoin will be a key part of SpectroCoin's strategy:  ""It makes sense for our client base. If you can sell something online to somebody from Australia, for example, you can expand your market size.""  Notably, Karalevičius anticipates that SpectroCoin will have the most immediate success serving markets that have not yet embraced the euro.  In particular, he noted how Latvia joined the Eurozone in 2014, and that Lithuania will do so in January, a development he suggests may affect his company's ability to influence the remittance market.  Direct dial approach  Of course, Karalevičius acknowledged that raising merchant awareness regarding bitcoin would remain a challenge.  To start with, SpectroCoin will aim to acquire clients through direct sales, seeking to win over merchants by first selling them on bitcoin and then on the company's services.  Summarizing the challenges SpectroCoin is facing, Karalevičius said:  ""The hardest part is actually trying to sell bitcoin, because when you try to sell bitcoin people still have many worries about it because of media coverage. Even if you can remove the price stability, some people don't think the market is significant.""  Still, Karalevičius expects bitcoin's low fees to be attractive to merchants.  SpectroCoin will charge merchants a 0% to 0.25% fee for each transaction, though the size of the fee will depend on the merchant. Karalevičius added: ""If a merchant is a non-profit we will charge 0%, for most merchants we charge more. But if a merchant is strategic for us we can negotiate.""  Attacking pain points  Though his company faces challenges, Karalevičius was also quick to point out that e-commerce merchants are seeking solutions to their current payment issues, and that they may be more open-minded in light of these barriers to sales.  Specifically, Karalevičius noted the popularity of cash delivery services in his target markets. The services specialize in collecting cash from e-commerce buyers and then delivering the payment and product to the respective parties.  Still, Karalevičius believes other electronic payment options don't offer much competition, adding:  ""The key thing when you talk with merchants is most people still don't like credit card payments. Most of them use direct bank deposits and that charges merchants 2%.""  Building a client base  Overall, Karalevičius framed the new service as one that will support SpectroCoin as it focuses on the main part of its service – its bitcoin buying and selling platform.  Karalevičius explained how adding merchants to SpectroCoin's customer base provides a strategic advantage, saying:  ""Why we tackled the merchant market is because from day one our goal was to have one solution for bitcoin –wallet, exchange and merchant. This lets us have economies of scale. We can have the people who like using the bitcoins for real transactions as well as the people who are buying bitcoins.""  With the formal launch complete, Karalevičius said he aims to now focus his company's attention on acquiring new clients, concluding: ""We are now announcing it with a few small ones. We will have bigger ones later on, but these will be following announcements.""  Some quotes have been edited for clarity.

42397908,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWoI,1409279267,Bitcoin Pioneer and First Bitcoin Recipient Hal Finney Passes Away,"The bitcoin world lost one of its earliest pioneers today with the legal passing of Hal Finney, the recipient of the world's first bitcoin transaction and its first identified developer after Satoshi Nakamoto. He was 58 years old.  Finney had been diagnosed with the disease ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease) in 2009 and was wheelchair-bound for the last few years of his life. Despite this, he remained as active as possible in the bitcoin community, even giving interviews as recently as March of this year.  Finney was also a key figure in the world of cryptography, having worked as the second developer after Phil Zimmermann on the popular PGP system, and was a regular contributor to the legendary 'cypherpunks' cryptographer mailing list.  Finney developed computing's first reusable proof-of-work system called RPOW, (based on Adam Back's Hashcash) with an aim to implementing it in a digital currency system.  A decentralized P2P version of RPOW, also based on Hashcash, lies at bitcoin's heart, which is the first widespread use of the system.  Bitcoin pioneer  As some of the earliest bitcoin records from the cypherpunks list of November 2008 show, Finney was the first to enter the conversation in support of Satoshi Nakamoto's ""P2P e-cash"" idea after fellow cryptographers expressed their doubts.  Finney wrote at the time:  ""Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea. I like the idea of basing security on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants outweighs that of the attacker.""  Satoshi Nakamoto sent Finney the first-ever bitcoin transaction in January 2009, and Finney continued to assist Nakamoto with the initial bitcoin code as the two interacted on Bitcoin Talk forum.  Shortly after collaborating with Nakamoto on early bitcoin code in 2009, Finney announced he was suffering from ALS. Increasing paralysis, which eventually became near-total, forced him to retire from work in early 2011.  An interview by journalist Andy Greenberg in Forbes just six months ago addressed speculation that Finney may be Satoshi Nakamoto himself, using the pseudonym as a protection against the kind of government threats Phil Zimmermann faced with PGP during the 'cryptography wars’ of the early 1990s.  Although Greenberg concluded that Finney was not Satoshi Nakamoto, the story is sprinkled with enough subtle hints to leave the question open.  Cryopreservation  Finney was a long-time member of the transhumanist/life extension organization the Extropy Institute, and had expressed a wish to be cryopreserved at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation’s facility in Scottsdale, Arizona.  News siteVoxnoted a post by Institute head Max More, which said:  ""Hal was diagnosed with ALS five years ago. He made it clear that once he lost the ability to communicate, he did not want his vital functions supported any further but should be allowed to cease functioning and promptly be cryopreserved.""  After arriving at a hospital near Alcor's facility with his wife Fran on Tuesday, Finney was administered ""drugs to ensure no consciousness and his ventilator was removed"". He was declared legally deceased at 9:00am local time on 28th August.  Finney is now undergoing initial preparation for cryopreservation before being placed into long-term storage, in the hope of being revived at some future point if or when more advanced technology makes it possible.  Finney's legacy  Finney mined many bitcoins in the early days of the project, but cashed many of them in to pay for his medical bills in 2013 after their value topped $100 each.  Another of the computing world's legendary figures whose work is far better known than his actual name, Finney's efforts in both digital currency and cryptography are bound to have far-reaching effects, with the full extent of their influence still unknown.  In his last-ever post on Bitcoin Talk, titled 'Bitcoin and Me’ and dated March 2013, Finney concludes with the following passage:  ""That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.""
