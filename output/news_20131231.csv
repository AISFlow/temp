42376787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRST,1388521126,Fortress Investment Group to Launch Bitcoin Fund,"New York City-based Fortress Investment Group, a publicly traded company, is reportedly planning to launch a bitcoin investment fund.  It’s being reported that the investment vehicle may be an unlisted Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).  It appears that there might be some association between Fortress’s effort and that of San Francisco-based Pantera Capital.  Pantera, which has as clients some Fortress executives, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) an investment advisor entity called Pantera Bitcoin Advisors, LLC.  The filing shows Pantera Capital as the owner of the LLC, with Pantera principal Dan Morehead as its CEO.  Listed as a hedge fund, it shows that its total value at the filing date of December 4 was $147m, with 26 investors contributing at least $250,000.  That would make the fund much larger than that of SecondMarket’s Bitcoin Investment Trust. As CoinDesk has reported, that fund has been able to amass over $60m from accredited investors in its first three months.  Another ETF, filed with the SEC earlier this year, was the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, started by the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame, who have been large investors in bitcoin to the point of appearing boisterous. Yet the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust has been stuck in regulatory limbo since its initial filing.  Institutional interest in bitcoin has been heating up. Wedbush Securities recently released a report that was very bullish about bitcoin’s prospects. The firm proclaimed that the price of one bitcoin could reach $98,500.  And Bank of America released its own report about bitcoin not long ago, saying that the distributed virtual currency has “clear potential for growth”.  Fortress, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is reportedly planning to announce the fund at the Bitcoin New Years Eve Bash being held tonight at 40 Broad Street in New York City.  That location is next to the NYSE. In fact, it houses something called the NYC Bitcoin Center, an effort that has been launched to educate investors about BTC.  It’s not clear whether Fortress is funding the NYC Bitcoin Center. On a Craiglist job posting for the center, it claims to be “New York's premier digital currency center”.  It’s expected that increased Wall Street interest will continue in 2014. Barry Silbert, CEO of SecondMarket, which created the Bitcoin Investment Trust, recently said as much to Entreprenuer Magazine.  ""We're three to six months away from Wall Street dollars moving into Bitcoin in a big way,"" he said.

42376782,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRKv,1388515224,Bitcoin Song Commemorates a Year of Bitcoin Fever,"Aside from “twerking” the only word that has made both the Oxford and Collins “word of the year” lists is “bitcoin”… and this is little wonder to anyone who has been following the story. In 2013 bitcoin has caused greed, debate and bafflement in the online world. It has leapt in value, been accepted in an ever increasing array of stores… and at the start of December was at the heart of the biggest online robbery of all time. Have you been caught up in bitcoin fever yet?  Click the play button below to hear the song Bitcoin Fever.  [audio mp3=""https://www.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bitcoin-Fever-Kathryn-Nick.mp3""][/audio]  Lyrics:  Coin fever,  From Bitcoins gold mined on the internet,  They’ve caused a sweat,  Have you caught coin fever?  Will online gold turn into a pile of tin?  Should you get in?    Prices jumped to thousands from nothing,  Robbers circle this virtual bling:  Online banks and brokers get caught up,  Coins are siphoned, market places shut up shop,  Bitcoins hold value, but it’s the Wild West:  Should you invest?    Fever drove the world to a Bitcoin craze,  No one’s safe in this confusing haze,  Drug dealers and shoppers chase all kinds of stashes,  It’s traded for millions: Forex for the masses,  Bitcoins hold value, but it’s the Wild West:  Should you invest?    Well that’s up to you  Up to you  There’s a baffled queue  No one has a clue  If only we knew  Only we knew  Bitcoin in 2013  The rise of Bitcoin in 2013 has been meteoric. This virtual currency based in hardcore mathematics offers the glittering promise of financial liberation from banks. It whispers of vast investment opportunities for serious individuals, and glorious anonymity for those who seek it. Yet whatever your personal viewpoint, this is more than just a new form of currency because it signifies another crucial step in the march into life online. And nothing reveals this more than the virtual “great train robbery” at Sheep Marketplace… where for the first time balaclavas and crowbars were truly replaced by savvy computer science.  It all started on October 2nd this year when the original Silk Road Market Place was shut down by the FBI and thousands of (nefarious) online customers and vendors were forced to track down a viable alternative. Enter the fledgling Sheep Marketplace, with its slicker interface, decent search function and barely any downtime during the Silk Road seizure it seemed the perfect choice over more established sites such as Black Market Reloaded.  From there things took off quickly, and this site saw some of its more illicit listings (read drugs) increase by over 400% in just two weeks following the Silk Road closure. However, this black market heyday wasn’t destined to last, because after operating a reasonably glitch free service until the start of December… Sheep Market suddenly shut up shop vanishing around $110 million in Bitcoins in the process.  Reddit Rabbit Holes and the Rise of the New Wild West  A posse was quickly formed, a virtual hunt for the bandits sprang into life – and a couple of savvy Reddit were apparently just a couple of steps behind the thieves. Meanwhile, rewards were offered for information; scammed victims posted their hard luck stories online… and desperate shoppers and vendors hunted for a new deep web market place to conduct their dealings.  Pages and topics were rapidly devoted to compiling the latest contact information for the multitudes of displaced sellers. These almost felt like wartime missing person bulletin boards from the 40s, such was the urgency. Yet the underlying message is very clear: when dealing in the black market, theft, fraud and unforeseen circumstances are a way of life and have to be factored into the risk of doing business.  The whole story had the essence of the old west meets cyberspace; complete with miners, robbers, lawmen operating outside the law, gangsters, legitimate business folk, investors, black market racketeers, traders… and people just trying to make a living. 200 years ago, people were blowing bank doors open to rob gold, 100 years ago they were doing the same thing to rob cash. Now there are computer hackers… and online currencies. It is any wonder Bitcoin fever is sweeping the globe?  Robbed by Vendor EBOOK101: Cash, Cash… Who’s got the Cash?  Sheep Marketplace itself had been operating successfully since around February 2013. And things only began to go awry during the last couple of weeks of November when users were no longer able to withdraw money from their accounts… but were still able to deposit. At first people blamed the glitch on an automated tumbler (using one is a bit like laundering your money; as whilst all Bitcoin transactions are anonymous, they are still public), but after the specified time frame for the return of funds passed, the following message was placed on Sheep:  “Sheep is down. We are sorry to say, but we were robbed on Saturday 11/21/13 by vendor EBOOK101. This vendor fund bug in system and stole 5400 BTC – your money, our provisions, all was stolen. We were trying to resolve this problem, but were not successful. We are sorry for your problems and inconvenience, all of current BTC will be distributed to users, who have filled correct BTC emergency address. I would like to thank to all SheepMarketplace moderators by this, who were helping with this problem. I am very sorry for this situation. Thank you all.”  A couple of days later Sheep Market Scam – a plain text page sprang up – with equally horrendous spelling – but with real time information about the on-going scam. It seems shortly before the robbery, a number of vendors were offering huge discounts, bulk buys and new products that they’d never sold before. It all had the air of a giant pyramid scheme, with Sheep Marketplace trying to suck as much money into their coffers as possible.  “I owe $90K to some very nasty people…”  It was around this time that the panic set in. One vendor going by the name u/FearingForMyLife wrote “I am a large vendor on Sheep Marketplace, or I was until recently. I sold hard drugs in reasonably large quantities. I have around $90k locked up in the site. I owe some money to some very nasty people. I have until Monday evening. They have already threatened me with death. I have no doubt that they have killed before…I am 26 and I don’t want to die.”  At this point, ‘Internet detectives’ from around the web were hunting for the missing coins; something made possible by the fact that all transactions are public. Two Reddit users in particular, TheNodManOut and Sheeproadreloaded2 were quick to identify a large stack of coins that had been transferred out of the Sheep Marketplace.  By attaching tiny fractions of BTC, 0.00666 onto the pile of coins, Sheeproadreloaded2 was able to track where those transactions went next. By sending another ‘666’ every time the money landed in a different wallet he was able to keep on watching the money, posting the blockchain information on various websites, along with a selection of colourful quotes:  “I hope you appreciate what i just did for us. I’m not entirely sure, but I don’t think anybody has beaten a tumbler before today. Its like running a marathon through fog, listening for the footsteps of other runners. It helps if there are 96,000 of them, though! The FBI only got 29,000 of our coins. This guy is good, but he’s on his last legs. If he can sell a single bitcoin, I’ll be surprised.”  Riding Off Into the Sunset Versus Trying to Make Honest Profits  Unfortunately for those hoping for some cash back… or at the very least, some justice, the latest Reddit hunt (not for the first time) was seemingly chasing smoke and mirrors. What they thought was a thief trying to hide a big stack of cash turned out to be a currency exchange… the very currency exchange that the thief had used to cash in the booty. Not only that, but it also appears the thief managed to unload his stash – with no fuss whatsoever – and simply disappear into the ether.  On the back of this theft – and with factors ranging from the Chinese government to some much needed market corrections – Bitcoins dropped from a high of around $1200 to a low of $530 and is currently trading at around $710. With plenty of fluctuations between the two extremes over the last couple of weeks, there has been a massive increase of fevered trading for profit… mainly by people who haven’t got a clue what they’re doing. “Buy the dips, then sell high,” combined with nothing but guesswork has bred an abundance of winners and losers. One 23-year-old novice claims to have lost $410,000 in a relatively short period of time; whilst a glut of lucky traders are happily raking in rapid 5 – 10% profits on a daily basis… when they manage to get in and out at the right time of course.  This legitimate trading is all well and good… but it sure isn’t as risk free as good old fashioned – or rather, new-fangled – theft. In fact the levels of banditry involving Bitcoins since their inception has been exceptional, hardly any of the stories make the papers and nobody has ever been charged with any Bitcoin related theft.    Historical Bitcoin Crimes: Theft, Profit and Fever        A list of major Bitcoin heists has been compiled by bitcointalk which revealed that hundreds of thousands have been stolen. Some of the more recent highlights include: a Chinese Bitcoin exchange that went down taking $4.1 million of its customers’ cash, the US exchange Bitfloor being hacked out of 24,000 coins. Along with an 18-year-old Australian who ran an exchange service called Tradefortress that was apparently relieved of $1 million of its customers Bitcoins by hackers just a few weeks ago.  Theft will always be a problem when handling large volumes of cash. The spotlight may well have increasingly turned on Bitcoin over the last 12 months, but really this has far less to do with this particular form of currency, and more to do with the way the world is gradually moving online. Still, with everything that has happened in 2013 who can blame us for our large dose of Bitcoin fever?

42376436,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZWh,1388510724,Poll: Will the Bitcoin Price Hit $10k in 2014?,"2013 saw the price of bitcoin go from $13 to $266, then to almost $1,200 on the back of strong growth in China.  There was a correction, as the Chinese government implemented policies to make bitcoin trading much more difficult, but the digital currency has since rallied and shown significant resilience in the face of adversity.  Many believe the price of bitcoin will increase in 2014, with some Wall Street analysts even predicting it could reach almost $100,000 at some point.  But what do you think will happen to the price in the coming year?  Do you think the bitcoin price will hit $10,000 in 2014?  Yes  No  WTF are you smokin ???

42376780,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRJf,1388506554,Price Discovery in the Absence of Bitcoin Exchanges,"Recently, authorities in India, China, Korea, Denmark, France, and Norway have issued stern warnings regarding the use and trade of bitcoin and other digital currencies.  As a consequence, important exchange outlets for price discovery have been slowed or shuttered following the government advisories. Furthermore, India and China represent nearly half of the globe's total population.  The world has mostly underestimated the latent demand for a free and nonpolitical currency unit. In the face of this percolating demand, the arrogance of our monetary overlords is startling.  Imagine if we were forced to use a particular brand of toothpaste in the same way that we are coerced into using the prevailing unit of legal tender. The response might not be so submissive. Contrary to the misinformation in this article, bitcoin is not illegal in any country in the world.  In two separate incidents following the Reserve Bank of India advisory warning, trading operators' premises were raided by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) citing a clear violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) rules. A top ED official said:    ""We have found that through the website 400 persons have recorded 1,000 transactions that amount to a few crores of rupees. We are gathering the data of the transactions, name of the people who have transacted in the virtual currency from Gupta’s server that is hired in the US.      At present, we believe that this is a violation of foreign exchange regulations of the country. If we are able to establish money laundering aspect then he can be arrested.""    In the days ahead, the ED will be challenged either to define bitcoin as a currency or to clarify the nature of bitcoin as an asset under Indian law.  Also, the South China Morning Post reported that China’s central bank met with payment processors on 16th December, ordering them to ""stop giving clearing services to bitcoin, litecoin, and other cryptocurrency exchanges"". The payment processors were ordered to sever their relationships with bitcoin exchanges by the end of January.  This action had a significant impact on bitcoin exchanges in China, such as BTC China.  In Korea, financial authorities announced that ""the virtual currency does not have 'intrinsic value' due to its lack of stability while there is concern at the absence of structure and indicators to measure it."" Participating government agencies discussing the impact of bitcoin included the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Bank of Korea, the Financial Services Commission, and the Financial Supervisory Service.  In Denmark, Michael Landberg, chief legal adviser at the Financial Supervisory Authority in Denmark, said the most likely outcome for bitcoin exchangers would be an ""amendment to existing financial legislation so that we have regulation covering it.""  Landberg added:  ""It is also important to have this included in money laundering acts. We’ll seek to follow the mainstream. Bitcoins are not forbidden in the US and the UK It is out there and will continue to be out there. It just needs to be regulated. The challenge for us is how to do that.""  Currently, Denmark's FSA doesn't have the legal authority to prevent trade in bitcoin rendering it unable to stop a company that exchanges real currencies for bitcoin.  A report from the Bank of France said: ""Even if bitcoin does not today meet the conditions to become a credible means for investment that could therefore threaten financial stability, it represents a clear financial risk for those that hold it.""  Warning that the use of bitcoins as an investment tool is limited because there is no underlying asset and the virtual currency is subject to high volatility, the central bank said speculators are at risk, as they would have no legal recourse if there is a loss of confidence in the cryptocurrency or if they are victims of theft from hackers.  According to the Bank of France report:  ""The system can collapse at any moment if investors want to unwind their positions but find themselves holding portfolios that have become illiquid.""    In Norway, the director general of taxation, Hans Christian Holte, said the currency ""doesn't fall under the usual definition of money."" Instead, the Norwegian government decreed bitcoin to be an asset upon which capital gains tax can be charged.  Even the European Banking Authority (EBA) weighed in with its own report on virtual currencies warning consumers that they are not protected through regulation when using virtual currencies as a means of payment and may be at risk of losing their money.  These various warnings from around the world have not yet affected the larger price discovery mechanism for bitcoin which still occurs in certain jurisdictions. But, what if exchange-based price discovery for bitcoin was impeded in the future. What would be the price setting mechanism for conversion in and out of national currencies?  [post-quote]  Just as with other restricted or 'banned' goods around the world, bitcoin trade would react by going local and going to a person-to-person model, such as LocalBitcoins.com. Additionally, small exchanges in certain countries would still cater to a local population in jurisdictions where crackdowns were not prevalent.  It might not be easy to chart aggregated price quotes from hundreds of small operators, but price discovery finds a way like water finds a way to flow downhill.  These global authorities are genuinely afraid of something like bitcoin with its limited issuance model and distributed trust architecture not requiring intermediaries.  However, they don't fear it because of the potential for money laundering, terrorist financing, or harm to unsuspecting consumers. Authorities fear bitcoin because it threatens the adherence to their fabricated monetary illusion.  The genie is out of the bottle and centralized banking institutions are no longer seen as necessary for the provision of an exchangeable monetary unit. This cuts to the core of government's power and prerogative of issuance, making bitcoin primarily a central bank concern – not a money laundering concern.  Some may attempt to harness the genie in the name of innovation and consumer protection, however the power of bitcoin will prove too difficult to contain. The best solution from authorities will be to accept the changes and to modify political behavior around a forthcoming model of decentralized currencies.

42397334,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfG7,1388498705,Bitcoin's Best Competitors: The Top Altcoins of 2013,"Bitcoin has dominated the headlines this year, with massive price fluctuations, regulatory developments, and even Senate hearings by the US government. All these factors indicate that people are beginning to take the young currency seriously.  But let's not forget about the alternative coins out there. 2013 has been a busy year for them, too. How have they fared? Though CoinDesk has covered some of these alternative coins in depth already, it is interesting to note which currencies have stood out from a market capitalization perspective this year.  Here are the six top altcoins of 2013, based on market capitalization figures from Dustcoin.  Litecoin  Market cap (BTC): 788,023  Much like bitcoin, litecoin's value has fluctuated wildly over the last few months. The altcoin spike in March and April, during the bitcoin bubble, demonstrated how closely linked litecoin is to the price of the incumbent top virtual currency. At the time, its value rocketed from approximately $0.05 to $5.00.  In November, prices spiked again – but far higher this time, reaching around $48 for a brief period, before slowly falling once more. Now, following bitcoin’s fall in value after China’s policy shifts on virtual currency, litecoin is hovering around the $22 mark.  All this interest in the currency has caused its difficulty to increase, tripling in the last two months. Litecoin's market capitalization has also skyrocketed. On 16th November, its market cap stood at around $95m. It may be on the same roller coaster ride as bitcoin, but as of now, it still stands at a very respectable $573.9m or so.  Peercoin (PPCoin)  Market cap (BTC): 126,411  Peercoin, the currency launched by the mysterious 'Sunny King', currently rests at just under one sixth the market cap of litecoin, making it the third-largest coin in existence.  Peercoin uses proof-of-stake, an alternative to the conventional proof-of-work mechanism used by bitcoin. It is designed to produce more coins automatically, based on the number of coins that a person already has in their possession.  John Manglaviti, previously the community relations leader for feathercoin, came on board earlier this year to try and breathe life into peercoin's community. Working with King (who focuses on technology development), he has recruited 120 volunteers for the currency. Most recently, Canadian exchange Vault of Satoshi announced that it would support peercoin, lending more credibility to the currency.  Namecoin  Market cap (BTC): 51,911  Namecoin is bouncing back from a nasty technical flaw it suffered late in 2013, which allowed anyone to take advantage of its domain naming system. The coin was designed to enable people to cryptographically store and transmit pairs of keys and values, in a system that enabled it to create a domain name system that was entirely decentralized. Its top-level domain is ‘.bit’, and it is effectively a form of dark web.  The currency operates on a merged mining basis with bitcoin, meaning that clients can be configured to check both the bitcoin and the namecoin block chains when solving proof-of-work problems.  Namecoin’s market capitalization stands at a little under half that of peercoin.  Worldcoin  Market cap (BTC): 31,370  Worldcoin's biggest claim to fame this year may have been its involvement with phenixcoin and feathercoin in UNOCS, the abortive attempt to create a bridge between these altcoins. While phenixcoin subsequently imploded after a prominent developer absconded with many peoples' coins, worldcoin continues to forge ahead.  Its goals are also very clear, with a stated claim to become the “cryptocurrency of choice for merchants and consumers”, with a 60-second confirmation time.  Feathercoin  Market cap (BTC): 13,045  Feathercoin, itself a relative newcomer to the market, was founded in April, and gained heavy traction as many people began mining and trading the currency.  With a market cap of just over 13,000 BTC, feathercoin is still a relative featherweight compared to bitcoin, but there's no denying that founder Peter Bushnell has done a good job of developing the coin. In turn, the community has gone from strength to strength.  Actually, that's not quite true. It went from strength to relative weakness after UNOCS collapsed, but has since gone back to strength again, regaining some of its former enthusiasm under the new community leadership of Chris Ellis.  In addition to a weekly newsletter to keep everyone abreast of events, there was also an Amsterdam conference. That itself was an interesting story, because the Amsterdam bitcoin-based event conference that feathercoin members were supposed to attend was reportedly canceled. So they just organized another onehttp://forum.feathercoin.com/index.php?topic=4307.0, with both physical and virtual attendees. And it did so in just a couple of days.  This seems to be the story of feathercoin. It is a plucky little currency, with a very dedicated following, and able to weather apparently any storm, including the 51% attack that someone threw at it earlier in the year (Bushnell simply bought peercoin’s Sunny King on board and had him help secure the block chain with a feature called advanced checkpointing, which was built into the client’s code).  Since it was launched, feathercoin has also established its own nascent eBay-style marketplace, and there is now a Local Feathercoins website, enabling people to trade coins directly with each other. Someone is developing a physical version of feathercoin, potentially with an NFC reader embedded in it, and another enthusiastic developer is working on a proposal to put metadata in the block chain, to assist with the transmission of files. There's lots going on here.  Dogecoin  Market cap (BTC): 10,421  Market capitalization figures at Dustcoin show dogecoin in seventh place overall, just behind feathercoin. It's a currency based around a meme, it's been around for about five minutes, and has already been accepted by Cryptsyhttps://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/132, which is now trading it. The price spiked at least 400% in mid-late December, and what's interesting is how this bizarre phenomenon bucked the trend and continued to rise even after bitcoin’s value fell in the wake of the China fiasco. There are few other altcoins that can make that claim. Dogecoin's value and place in this list did, however, slip after a Christmas holiday ""hacking incident"" that saw a total of 21m dogecoins disappear from users' wallets.  Dogecoins are being traded for bitcoins, which means they have a market cap which currently stands at 10,421 BTC, or a little over $7.8m at the time of writing. That’s partly because, while the value of the coins is still relatively low, there are a lot of them. At least an eighth of the coins (which a total limit of 100 billion), have already been mined. Not bad, for a currency based on a dog joke.  Bitcoin may be the incumbent top virtual currency, but there is no doubt that there are many alternative coins with a lot to offer, if nothing other than inspiring communities dedicated to their survival. It's been a busy 2013. What will the next year bring?  *All market capitalization figures accurate as of time of writing  Coin grab image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/31/bitcoins-best-competitors-the-top-altcoins-of-2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1eb9ecdfc3d9c6480c809fccc7b1f5b631e024f-1000x623.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397346,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfQw,1388493031,Clipperz Password Manager Only Accepts Bitcoin,"The open source Clipperz password manager focuses on complete user privacy and only accepts bitcoin as a form of payment.  “Bitcoin pseudonymity gives any user the option to make it very hard for everyone to create a link between his/her bitcoin payment and his/her data stored on Clipperz servers,” says Marco Barulli, who is one of the co-founders.  “It gives any user the option to make it very hard for everyone to create a link between his/her bitcoin payment and his/her data stored on Clipperz servers.”  Clipperz  is different to other password managers on the market today because it doesn’t want to know anything about its users. Barulli said:  “Clipperz doesn't require any personal data to setup an account, not even your email address. Actually not even the username you select is known. We want to learn nothing about our users.”  Barulli says that eschewing the collection of any shred of personally identifiable information by Clipperz means less chance of a security vulnerability.  “Anonymity of data is not an ideological position. Anonymity is extremely important from a security point of view. Linking your encrypted data stored with Clipperz to your real identity widens the range of potential attacks,” he said.  And while some security-minded software can be difficult to use, Clipperz is built upon open web standards, making it easy for the masses to utilize.  “Clipperz is purely web based. It runs on most browsers and on all platforms, both desktop and mobile,” Barulli said.  “We believe that convenience and ease of use is an important part of security. And the browser is ... an ideal place to run crypto-based services.”  The company made the headlines recently by moving its hosting servers over to Iceland after running into some issues with Italian authorities, which claimed some suspicious wire transfers had taken place. The complete story is posted on its official blog.  The idea is that Iceland has amenable laws that protect the existence of privacy-minded software such as Clipperz. The Icelandic Modern Media Initiative,https://immi.is/index.php/projects/immi or IMMI, is legislation that has been passed in that country to help protect certain media freedoms that may prove beneficial to Clipperz.  “Our understanding is that IMMI will require a foreign court to prove ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ that a certain server is storing data or providing services that are part of a criminal conduct,” said Barulli.  Bitcoin is the only payment option users have to support the Clipperz effort, which has been solely via donations. Barulli says that Clipperz could also accept other pseudonymous cryptocurrencies as a form of payment at some point. But it is not in the works right now.  “This is not in our current plans. Let's start with bitcoin and see what happens. We are certainly open to alternatives.”  Barulli himself first discovered bitcoin a few years ago. He has found it one of the best innovations for serving those without access to financial tools such as banks.  “I was first intrigued by bitcoin during winter 2010. I even installed the client on my old PC and did some mining for a few months.”  “I was, and still am, mostly excited by the potential of bringing payment services to the unbanked of the world,” he said.
