42397778,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6se,1405254057,"Banning, Dumping and Attacks on Mining: Could Bitcoin be Hijacked?","In a few short years, an entire economy has grown up around bitcoin. Bitcoin's current market capitalization stands at roughly $8b, a position backed by a strong and passionate community. Businesses are beginning to accept the digital currency as payment for goods and services while startups use its innovative technology to form the core of their products. Meanwhile, consumer interest and knowledge grows worldwide.  But is it possible that some type of concentrated attack on bitcoin could seriously hurt the industry and anyone with an interest in the digital currency? Unfortunately, there are a number of people and organizations that have enough influence and resources to cause significant damage.  Bitcoin's distributed technology has made it what it is today, providing vehicles for access that enable open access to financial resources. However, there are vulnerabilities which could result in investor losses, a heightened risk of failure for bitcoin companies, and a mining community left with pricey equipment rendered worthless by a seriously devalued digital currency.  As Jeff Garzik, a bitcoin core developer, summed up the essence of the digital currency's vulnerability:  “Bitcoin is just a machine. It can be bought. Or attacked. Or broken.”  But if bitcoin can be disrupted, damaged or even destroyed, how might this process play out exactly?  Dumping the price  The bitcoin order book across exchanges is relatively thin. So, while there's a high cost to buying a massive amount of coins on the market, the same is true for selling them.  Viewing bitcoin market depth charts, it's easy to see how a major sell-off of only a few thousand coins could rock prices.  “Someone could buy a bunch of bitcoins and then proceed to dump those coins on various exchanges and it would dip the price,” says Matt Young, who helps run Counterparty, a decentralized financial market that runs on an abstraction layer of bitcoin.  There was widely held apprehension that this would happen after the recent US Marshal’s auction of about 30,000 BTC. However, those fears proved unfounded, as the winning bidder, investor Tim Draper, afterwards revealed plans to use the coins to increase adoption in emerging markets.  However, Fabio Federici, whose startup Coinalytics studies block chain data, said that attacking bitcoin’s price would not be a significant blow.  It is debatable, he said, that the use of bitcoin as a currency is what holds its true worth. Instead, it is the distributed system behind bitcoin that will have the biggest impact.  Federici noted:  “The true disruptive power behind bitcoin is the decentralized trust. This technology is here to stay and will disrupt many other industries.”  Attacking the miners  With bitcoin, price and infrastructure are closely related. If the price drops as sellers unload coins onto the market, it leaves less incentive for miners to operate their energy-intensive equipment – and miners are fundamental to the bitcoin network, processing transactions and creating new coins.  At the same time, if the infrastructure of mining is attacked, investors could begin fearfully selling massive amounts of coin, further dropping the price of bitcoin.  Experts agree, though, that any sort of infrastructure-related attack on bitcoin would likely require millions of dollars to pull off, an amount that continues to increase total network power.  Dave Hudson, whose blog Hashingit and work at PeerNova are focused on bitcoin infrastructure issues, says that it would be a very expensive proposition, and would draw a lot of attention, which might be counterproductive to such an effort.  He pointed out:  “Any sort of overt attack on bitcoin would seem likely to add more legitimacy to [it] in the eyes of many observers, surely this must be really important if [someone] is prepared to spend $100m to attack it.”  But, again, what cannot be killed is the idea of value and distributed trust that these cryptographic systems now present to early adopters.  “While [a hijack of some sort] would be devastating to many bitcoin investors initially, in the end, we will be left with the protocol which is where the value is, and people will continue to rally around that,” said Counterparty's Matt Young.  Banning bitcoin  In many countries, governments have a lot of control over major economic sectors. Banking, telecommunications and energy are common industries that are state-owned in places where executive power is tightly held.  Furthermore, many countries that have a lot of government resources tied up in banking generally have a contentious relationship with cryptocurrencies.  Thailand was one of the first countries to take a hostile stance towards bitcoin after a domestic exchange owner presented the digital currency to that country's central bankers. The Bank of Thailand now says digital currencies are not illegal, but warned bitcoin has the potential to become worthless and is not a viable form of payment.  Furthermore, in June, Bolivia’s central bank banned bitcoin. These types of moves could be interpreted as hostile actions, used by government policymakers to deter citizens from thinking about using novel digital money.  The developed world is not immune to the possibility of clampdowns, either. For example, in Russia, a bitcoin conference in Moscow was canceled in April over fears that country would ban the digital currency.  More recently, a Bank of Russia deputy chairman hinted that the country would take a wait and see stance, although the country has recently used its state-owned banking system to influence the region with billions of dollars in loans for Ukraine and other former Soviet countries.  Flavien Charlon, the founder of Predictious, a bitcoin prediction market, says that bitcoin will someday be as ubiquitous as the Internet. As such, there will be deeper implications for economies in the future when governments try to take such bold steps.  Charlon said:  “[Banishment] would certainly harm bitcoin. [But it really means] some other country would become the new hub for bitcoin startups and investments.""  What a major hijack might look like  Probably one of the worst things that have happened in bitcoin's short history was the cautionary tale of the collapse of Mt. Gox. It's the closest thing to what a full-blown exchange hijack might look like.  There have been other exchanges that have run off with people's money, one of the most notable being GBL, which stole $4.1m in customer funds by simply disappearing overnight. And while Mt. Gox went through a long slow decline, people still kept money in its hosted wallet until the end believing that it wasn't a scam.  It's hard, however, to look back and not consider serious misgivings about the exchange. Mt. Gox used to have an influential role in the markets, and its foibles caused a bitcoin price crash in April 2013 as well as its complete meltdown earlier this year.  Last February, Mt. Gox allegedly lost 744,400 BTC, according to a leaked document. If true, that would mean the failed exchange had lost almost 6% of all the bitcoin in existence, based on 12,560,925 BTC in circulation at the time.  However, while investors losing sizeable chunks of bitcoin in the event was problematic for the industry as whole, it did not spell a death knell for the rise of cryptocurrencies.  The fall of Mt. Gox may have been a black mark in the eyes of mainstream press, but in order to move forward, sometimes a bit of destruction is required.  It's important to note that since the Mt. Gox implosion, bitcoin’s price has risen back to the level it was at prior to the exchange's halting of BTC withdrawals and its subsequent halt of trading activity.  Young, whose work on Counterparty is an effort to build decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent Gox-like calamities, thinks that while the drama in February was an awful event, it proved resiliency.  With so many stakeholders, a scenario where the cryptocurrency community wouldn't rally around bitcoin seems unfathomable to him. Hopefully, Young is right: Gox is the best example yet that many are driven to keep bitcoin thriving no matter how dire the situation may seem.  “The bitcoin community handled [Mt. Gox] extremely well and that incident may provide an indication of what will happen if a hostile party [has] intent of crashing the market,” he said.

42397774,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6oi,1405250146,Bitcoin's First Comic Book: The Hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto,"The world of bitcoin is about to get its first comic book, courtesy of three Spanish artists with a penchant for the geek culture.  Bitcoin: The Hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto was written by Alex Preukschat and Josep Busquet and illustrated by Jose Angel Ares Garcia, who has previously illustrated and published several novels.  As the name suggests, the plot revolves around the mysterious creator of bitcoin, but for obvious reasons the team cannot reveal too many details at this point. Preukschat told CoinDesk that he hopes the graphic novel can be a ‘Matrix’-like story that makes people interested in decentralised technologies.  The comic was previewed at CoinSummit in London and the team says it has been working on it since October 2013.  Homage to Satoshi Nakamoto  Preukschat studied business in Germany and Spain and is currently the co-editor of OroyFinanzas.com. His fascination with bitcoin began in 2011.  He said he first learned about bitcoin after seeing a video presentation by British software developer Amir Taaki. Although he did not pay much attention to bitcoin until early 2013, he said, he now believes it is one of the most important technological advances in recent history.  The comic is a reflection of that view; it offers different perspectives on bitcoin and of course Satoshi Nakamoto. In a recent interview with ElBitcoin.org, Preukschat said that an individual or a group could be behind the Nakamoto pseudonym. In any case, he believes the real Satoshi Nakamoto should remain anonymous.  Teasers and previews  Although the official release is set for October, many readers will have to wait even longer – the Spanish version is coming out in October but it is unclear when the comic book will appear in English. The team says it is looking for publishers.  It was eager to share a few sneak previews and a video at CoinSummit.  The official website of the project is still under construction, but visitors can sign up for the newsletter if they wish to receive updates.  Of course, the world’s premiere bitcoin news outlet features prominently in Bitcoin: The Hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/13/bitcoins-first-comic-book-the-hunt-for-satoshi-nakamoto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69de89f0532e4d4e4e44992c3f7ae0ab9f3ce1cf-1250x745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425879,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglTh,1405246207,5 Bitcoin Trends That Have Emerged in 2014 (So Far),"The bitcoin landscape is evolving so rapidly that it's hard to believe we're already halfway through the year.  Like any new industry, there are so many areas to explore in the bitcoin space that a week's worth of developments can sometimes feel like a month or two have gone by.  Bitcoin has certainly seen a lot of action in 2014. The collapse of Mt. Gox, hefty venture capital investments in bitcoin startups and the US government auction of 30,000 bitcoins seized from the Silk Road all generated buzz in the mainstream media.  CoinDesk's recent State of Bitcoin Q2 2014 report highlights some of the key developments that have influenced bitcoin's journey over the past few months, providing context for the digital currency's ever-changing position in society.  While only time will tell what's in store for bitcoin's future, a number of trends have emerged in the industry this year that could shape the direction and velocity of bitcoin's growth.  Here are five bitcoin trends that have emerged in the first half of 2014:  1. Big-name retailers jumping on board  The year started with a bang when Overstock became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin. News of Overstock's success with the digital currency served as a signal for other large companies to follow suit.  Electronics retailer TigerDirect integrated bitcoin as a payment option by the end of January, and other household names like the Sacramento Kings, Lord & Taylor and REEDS Jewelers got on board soon after.  By the end of June, three companies with at least $2bn in annual revenue had begun accepting bitcoin: DISH, Expedia and Newegg.  With smaller businesses also continuing to accept bitcoin at a fervent pace, we estimate that around 100,000 merchants will accept bitcoin by the end of 2014:  2. A warming regulatory climate  While it certainly hasn't been all smooth sailing between governments and bitcoin this year, it seems like tides are changing and regulators around the world are starting to take a more open-minded approach to the digital currency.  In the beginning of 2014, China's stance on bitcoin was ambiguous at best. By April, China's Central Bank Governor said that banning bitcoin was ""out of the question,"" referring to it as more of an asset than a currency.  Russia, after releasing stern warnings about bitcoin early this year, recently reconsidered its stance on the digital currency.  Gerogy Luntovsky, the deputy chairman of Bank of Russia, explained that his agency is going to take time to examine bitcoin as the industry continues to evolve:  “At this stage, we need to watch how the situation develops with these kinds of currencies. These instruments should not be rejected.”  Progress has also been made in places like California, where Governor Jerry Brown has granted bitcoin 'legal money' status, and Switzerland, where similar 'legal money' regulations are being considered.  Regulators seem increasingly willing to hold off on impulsive legislation in favor of working with the bitcoin community to find the best resolutions to prevent money laundering and fraud without stifling innovation.  3. VC firms keep betting big  Not everybody is as slow as governments to embrace bitcoin.  Serious venture capital investments in bitcoin companies were already taking place in 2013, but VCs have certainly kicked it up this year, with a total of $150m having already been invested in 2014.  With 2014's Q2 VC investments reaching $73m (up from $57m in Q1), CoinDesk estimates that by the year's end, 2014 VC investments in bitcoin companies will have surpassed 1995 VC investments in Internet companies:  The venture capital flowing into the bitcoin space supports the industry's infrastructure both explicitly and implicitly: startups gain access to resources that allow them to build much-needed products and services around the Bitcoin protocol, and the investors' confidence in the digital currency brings legitimacy to bitcoin's reputation.  4. Building on the block chain  Most people who take the time to really learn about bitcoin realize that the true genius in Satoshi Nakamoto's invention is not the coins themselves, but rather the block chain.  The term 'Bitcoin 2.0' is often used to describe applications that use the technology of the block chain to address issues like smart contracts and identity verification that were once impossible to solve in a decentralized way on the Internet.  Jeff Garzik, one of the bitcoin protocol's core developers, described the significance of the block chain beyond the scope of digital currencies:  ""As a computer scientist, and in computer science in general, when you talked about building distributed systems, there tended to be a purely theoretical view about how computers would talk to each other, how to keep them coordinated. Satoshi and the blockchain really solved that problem in an elegant and unexpected way.""  Block chain-focused startups like BlockScore and BlockCypher have already secured funding this year from investors. As 2014 rolls on, expect to see new uses of the block chain technology solving problems in a uniquely decentralized manner.  5. New emphasis on transparency  The collapse of Mt. Gox, once the biggest bitcoin exchange in the market, was a wake-up call to many in the community.  The former exchange's CEO Mark Karpeles was notoriously opaque in the months leading to its bankruptcy, causing confusion among users who held bitcoins on Gox.  Ultimately many people lost BTC through the course of Mt. Gox's downfall. Outcries from the community started pouring in, demanding other big exchanges prove their solvency with professional audits.  Exchanges like Bitstamp, Kraken and Coinbase all agreed to be audited in the aftermath of Mt. Gox's liquidation.  The demand for more transparency in the industry doesn't stop at exchange audits, though. Revered bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos recently took to Twitter to announce his departure from the Bitcoin Foundation, citing a lack of transparency as a primary concern:    I can no longer have even the smallest association with the Bitcoin Foundation, because of the complete lack of transparency      — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) July 9, 2014    If the first half of 2014 proves anything, it's that the technology underlying bitcoin is resilient even under catastrophic circumstances (Mt. Gox), and that the community is willing to rally together in bringing bitcoin to mass adoption.  There's a reason people call it the ""honey badger of money.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Tom Sharkey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/13/5-bitcoin-trends-that-have-emerged-in-2014-so-far,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ca0cbf7790ac58b7cb922db216170d76b43044e-1260x785.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
