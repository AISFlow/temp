Days later, the price of ETH went down, along with BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Did this whale know something the rest of the market didn‚Äôt? Ethereum Whale Sells $41 Million Before Market Crash In the early hours of August 18, the crypto market saw investors reacting to SpaceX selling its $373 million Bitcoin holdings, pushing down Bitcoin by more than 8% in a matter of minutes. During this period, the crypto market cap dropped to $1.1 trillion, and Ethereum also saw its value plummet by almost 6%. Related Reading: Valkyrie Taps Into Ethereum Momentum With New ETF Filing On-chain data provided by Lookonchain reveals that a smart Ethereum whale dumped 22,341 ETH worth $41 million just prior on August 14. On-chain investigation shows that the whale moved their ETH holdings to the Binance exchange and then withdrew $41 million worth of Tether USDT. While this whale still made a loss of $1.7 million in the sale, if they hadn‚Äôt moved their funds, they would have lost at least $5 million in the crash. The whale was very smart and dumped 22,341 $ETH ($41M) before the market crashed. Even though he lost ~$1.7M this time, he successfully avoided the market crash. Perhaps he will buy $ETH back at a cheaper price in the future.

This savvy Ethereum whale has shown signs of being able to predict market movements before and has had a 100% winning rate in recent months. The whale profited from the SEC and Spot Bitcoin ETFs saga. When ETH plummeted in reaction to news of the SEC rejecting spot Bitcoin applications from BlackRock and other investment companies, this whale saw this as an opportunity to buy the dip on June 30. They bought 8,188 ETH worth $15.23 million at $1,860 per ETH, and ETH would later rise to $1948.60 in the hours after. A smart whale deposited 25K $ETH ($47.24M) to #Binance and withdrew 15.9M $USDT 12 hrs ago. The whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling at high prices to make a profit. He has a 100% win rate of trading $ETH in the past 2 months.https://t.co/dT9p6jeCtr pic.twitter.com/pTuJAwL81O ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 28, 2023 Do Whales Sometimes Have Insider Knowledge?

It could be that this whale knew something was going to trigger a price crash or was just making the right trading decision at the right time. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout Nevertheless, whale moves could signal future price action due to the sheer size of their holdings.

Of this, a BNB position on the Venus lending protocol belonging to the perpetrator of the BSC bridge $560M hack was liquidated. The BSC Bridge Hack: Understanding One of Crypto‚Äôs Biggest Exploits The BSC brdige hack in October 2022 was one of the biggest exploits in crypto and DeFi history, with the hacker stealing nearly $593 million in BNB. But the story didn‚Äôt end there as the hacker tried to launder as much money as they could. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH After the attack, the hacker deposited 900,000 BNB worth $200 million on Venus as collateral to borrow $150 million worth of stablecoins. With more than $598.25 million in TVL, the Venus protocol is the second-largest DeFi protocol on the Binance Smart Chain. According to DeFi researcher Ignas, the position was the ‚Äúsingle largest potential liquidation in all #DeFi that cannot be closed.‚Äù This is because, while the BNB Chain was halted and the network upgrade after the exploit, the ecosystem was put at risk, as liquidation of such an amount could lead to a further plummet in the price of BNB. As a result, the Venus DAO voted to whitelist BNB Chain as the sole liquidator of the hacker‚Äôs address in case of a margin call. Notably, a drop in the price of BNB to $220 would see the hacker‚Äôs collateral liquidated. Now, with the price of the token experiencing a selloff in the past few days, the team has chosen to manually liquidate the position to reduce the impact of a margin call on the BSC ecosystem. On-chain data from PeckShieldAlert shows that the position has been liquidated for 5.6 million BNB tokens worth $52.3 million, a fraction of the total position. Following today‚Äôs market movement, the BNB Bridge exploiter account was made healthy as promised by @BNBCHAIN using whitelisted liquidation without any resulting shortfall or further impact to $bnb https://t.co/TGZ7nbiDPN ‚Äî Venus Protocol (@VenusProtocol) August 18, 2023 What‚Äôs Next For BNB?

Following a strong price increase in the first half of August, this spike in transactions clearly gathered traction. Following the coin‚Äôs price explosion, a notable pattern started to emerge: whales made significant volumes of crypto movement even as the meme coin‚Äôs prices saw a correction. A huge shift was recently revealed by data provided by Whale Alert, a website that tracks significant cryptocurrency transactions, and it was masterminded by a single entity that had a sizeable amount of Shiba Inu tokens. üö® üö® 4,657,881,590,632 #SHIB (40,747,148 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/g1D0dVuUjY ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 17, 2023 Related Reading: Solo Climber: The Lone Crypto Surging 11% In Top 100 Roster On A Weekend Shiba Inu Whale Moves $40 Million In Meme Coins This crypto whale carried out an unprecedented transfer of 4.65 trillion SHIB tokens, or about the equivalent of $40 million. This huge transfer occurred on August 17, precisely, during a single day. The mystery surrounding the source and recipient of these enormous sums of SHIB tokens only heightens the interest in this circumstance. This implies that the crypto whale‚Äôs goals went beyond merely selling the tokens on an exchange. The Shiba Inu community‚Äôs joyous celebration of the Shibarium Mainnet launch, a milestone for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs ecosystem, coincides with these substantial transfers. However, there were some worries that accompanied the announcement of the Shibarium Mainnet, and these had an impact on the pricing of Shiba Inu. The day before the launch-related festivities, the price of SHIB dropped by 11%. The cryptocurrency eventually recovered some of its losses, and as of the time of this publication, its price had stabilized at roughly $0.0000086. It‚Äôs interesting to note how different ‚Äúwhales‚Äù and significant holders, or those with large holdings of Shiba Inu tokens, appeared to react despite the uncertainty caused by the Shibarium launch-related worries. This shows that the various strategies and viewpoints held by these important stakeholders about the current Shiba Inu ecosystem developments. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00000845. Chart: TradingView.com Euphoria And Setback: Shibarium Mainnet Launch Meanwhile, the euphoria around the Shibarium Mainnet launch was short-lived due to an unforeseen glitch in the Bridge, which temporarily halted block production. This incident caused over $1.7 million worth of ETH to be stuck in the Shibarium cross-chain bridge, resulting in a decline in the prices of tokens within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including SHIB, BONE, and LEASH.

16229143,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548062,1692450174,Binance In Murky Waters? Analyst Explains Why BNB Must Stay Above This Price,"The last few days have been eventful for the crypto market following a major crash on Thursday that resulted in the loss of $1 billion in market cap. In another unnerving development, it appears that Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange, may be in some form of trouble as a crypto analyst shares some insight on the company. Related Reading: Binance To Delist These Three Tokens In August Due To Non-Compliance Binance To Record Heavy Losses If BNB Trades Below $212, Analyst Says According to an X post on Friday, a crypto analyst with the name MartyParty painted a rather gloomy picture for Binance and its 150 million users. The analyst began by stating there was a reason the Binance Coin (BNB) is yet to fall below $212. After Bitcoin tumbled on Thursday, BNB, like most cryptocurrencies, also plummeted in value, falling from $231.85 to $215.02. Although the token did attempt a market rebound on Friday, it soon fell again but found support at the $214 price zone. MartyParty believes there is a reason why BNB is gaining support at these levels away from the $212 price mark. According to the analyst, the Binance exchange has a BNB-backed loan set to liquidate at $212. Initially, the liquidation price for the said loan was $220, but it was later shifted in June. Although the analyst didn‚Äôt reveal the exact amount of this supposed loan, it seems massive as he stated it could lead to a ‚Äúfatal margin call‚Äù for the Binance exchange upon liquidation. According to MartyParty, Binance is presently in ‚Äúself-preservation mode‚Äù with its CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao selling BTC from a particular wallet to purchase TUSD, which in turn is invested in BNB to keep the Binance native token above $212. In addition, this crypto analyst also made another interesting theory behind Binance‚Äôs supposed problem. He stated that US financial regulators are allegedly selling crypto holdings of the US Marshals Service in order to forcibly liquidate Binance‚Äôs loan position and kick CZ out of the crypto industry. Related Reading: SEC‚Äôs Ethereum Futures ETF Approval: A Resounding Victory For ETH‚Äôs Security Status? Crypto Community Reacts To Worrying Post On Binance Following MartyParty‚Äôs post, there have been multiple reactions, with some crypto users siding with the analyst and nudging investors to dump the BNB token, saying that Binance is currently in a similar position as the FTX exchange in 2022. The FTX exchange collapsed in November 2022 due to a cascade of events triggered by reports which stated that Alameda Research ‚Äì FTX‚Äôs trading arm ‚Äì held an unusually large amount of FTT ‚Äì FTX native cryptocurrency similar to Binance‚Äôs BNB. During the hype of the debacle, an inside source revealed that Alameda Research was quietly collecting loans from FTX, which were collateralized by the FTT token. However, on the other hand, some other crypto analysts have disagreed with MartyParty‚Äôs post calling it false and only aimed at spreading FUD. A particular analyst with the handle Alice on X has described the whole report as a ‚Äúbizarre conspiracy theory‚Äù as the loan in question was not taken out by the Binance exchange but rather by Venus Protocol, a lending protocol on the BNB chain. For now, Binance, CZ, or the US government are yet to issue any statement confirming or denying the post by the analyst MartyParty. At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $215.55, with a 1.59% decline in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, the token boasts a market cap of $33.16 billion and ranks as the fourth biggest cryptocurrency in the market.

While most crypto assets experienced losses, INJ has emerged as the sole gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs price climb comes as a welcome relief to investors navigating the tumultuous waters of the market. As the cryptocurrency market grapples with a bearish start to the day, Injective (INJ) stands out with a remarkable performance. With a 10.7% rally in the past 24 hours and seven-day gains of 2.0%, INJ has managed to buck the trend and secure positive momentum.

This comes as a response to the platform‚Äôs proposed shift to an optional royalty system. On Thursday, August 17, OpenSea announced that it is changing its creator fees framework, making royalties optional for new collections after August 31, 2023. The NFT marketplace also disclosed that it would disable the Operator Filter, a feature that enforces creator royalties. According to the announcement, NFT collections that utilized the Operator Filter up until August 31 will have their creator royalties enforced till February 29, 2024, when the fees will become optional. In the blog post, OpenSea explained the rationale behind its decision, saying the Operator Filter was designed to empower creators with greater control. However, the marketplace claims that it has not received the much-needed acceptance in the web3 ecosystem. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH Yuga Labs Responds To OpenSea‚Äôs Decision On Friday, August 18, Yuga Labs published an open letter on X (formerly Twitter), subtly criticizing OpenSea‚Äôs decision to make creator fees optional on all secondary sales for all collections by February 2024. The BAYC creator also disclosed its plans to wind down support for OpenSea‚Äôs SeaPort, a marketplace protocol that enables the buying and selling of NFTs. Daniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Lab, said in the response: Yuga Labs will begin the process of sunsetting support for OpenSea‚Äôs SeaPort for all upgradable contracts and any new collections, with the aim of this being complete in February 2024 in tandem with OpenSea‚Äôs approach. Alegre noted that while the purpose of NFTs has been to revolutionize true ownership of digital assets, it has also been about empowering artists and creators. ‚ÄúYuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,‚Äù he added. Yuga Labs‚Äô stance will likely be a significant blow to OpenSea, but perhaps not one the marketplace wouldn‚Äôt have foreseen. In January, the BAYC creators blacklisted about four marketplaces ‚Äì with an optional royalty model ‚Äì from its Sewer Pass collection.

As Bitcoin (BTC) grapples with a precipitous decline, currently trading below $26,000, the impact reverberates across the broader crypto landscape. LTC, trading at $64.15 according to CoinGecko, has encountered a 1.5% drop over the last 24 hours, contributing to a week-long slump of 23.2%. Litecoin Loses Grip On The $70 Handle LTC price action on a weekend.

This decline has pushed LTC to year-to-date lows, ominously edging toward the lows witnessed in December 2022. Yet, understanding the dynamics behind LTC‚Äôs struggle requires delving into its intricate relationship with the alpha coin Litecoin Price Dependence On Bitcoin The intrinsic connection between Litecoin and Bitcoin has both bolstered and hampered LTC‚Äôs journey. Historically positioned as a complementary alternative to Bitcoin, Litecoin carved its niche by embracing faster transaction speeds and a different mining algorithm. However, the symbiotic relationship between these two cryptocurrencies also makes Litecoin susceptible to Bitcoin‚Äôs market movements. LTC market cap reached $4.7 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Litecoin‚Äôs recent setback underscores this interdependence. Analysts contend that Litecoin‚Äôs price trajectory has often mirrored Bitcoin‚Äôs, with downturns accentuated by its role as a secondary asset. While Litecoin offers distinct utility, its fate remains intertwined with the broader market sentiment and Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. This connection has led to LTC‚Äôs price behavior echoing Bitcoin‚Äôs, both in its drops and potential recoveries. Navigating The Path Ahead: Key Levels To Watch As Litecoin navigates this challenging terrain, crucial support and resistance levels come into play. Analysts are closely monitoring a potential consolidation of losses within the range of $56 to $70, contingent on Bitcoin‚Äôs further losses. The $70 mark represents a pivotal point, indicating bullish intent if breached, and an edge for the bulls only above $75. LTC seven-day price action.

Conversely, essential support levels rest at $50.5 and $42, indicating the critical junctures that could either exacerbate LTC‚Äôs downturn or potentially pave the way for resilience. As the market continues to evolve, the lessons from these fluctuations offer valuable insights into the evolving nature of digital assets and the nuanced relationships that underpin their value fluctuations.

16207319,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548005,1692403252,SEC‚Äôs Ethereum Futures ETF Approval: A Resounding Victory For ETH‚Äôs Security Status?,"According to Bloomberg, in a key development for the cryptocurrency industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly set to allow the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ethereum (ETH) futures. This move marks a significant win for numerous firms that have long sought to introduce such products. While the SEC has previously hesitated to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies, the decision to greenlight an Ethereum futures ETF could have profound implications for Ethereum‚Äôs classification as a non-security. This development also holds potential ramifications for other cryptocurrencies, as the SEC‚Äôs stance on where the line between security and non-security lies becomes a subject of litigation. Ethereum Paradigm Shift According to Bloomberg‚Äôs report, sources familiar with the matter claim the SEC is unlikely to block the ETFs based on futures contracts for Ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: More Blood Ahead? Why Bitcoin Could Crash Further If It Loses $26,000 Nearly a dozen companies, including prominent names like Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill, and ProShares, have filed applications to launch these ETFs. While it remains unclear which funds will receive approval, insiders suggest that several may be granted the green light as early as October. This anticipated approval of an Ethereum futures ETF by the SEC could have far-reaching implications for the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies. The SEC‚Äôs reluctance to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies has spurred speculation that derivative-based products would offer a potential pathway to market access. On this matter, crypto analyst Adam Cochran has highlighted that the SEC potentially approving an ETF based on Ethereum futures contracts implicitly acknowledges that Ethereum itself is not considered a security. This decision challenges the notion that Ethereum should be regulated as a traditional financial security, considering its proof-of-stake mechanism, purpose, and usage. Cochran further believes that the SEC‚Äôs approval of an Ethereum futures ETF bolsters Ethereum‚Äôs non-security status and sets a precedent that could impact other cryptocurrencies facing regulatory scrutiny. The ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Grayscale Investments over rejecting their Bitcoin trust‚Äôs conversion into an ETF highlights the agency‚Äôs concerns regarding investor protection, manipulation risks, and price volatility. However, this approval could provide a compelling argument in favor of distinguishing between the underlying asset and how it is sold, bolstering the Torres Doctrine and potentially influencing the outcome of similar cases, such as the XRP appeal. The SEC‚Äôs approval of an Ethereum futures ETF holds tremendous significance for the cryptocurrency industry. If confirmed, it would mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum‚Äôs classification as a non-security, further solidifying its position as a commodity or currency. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH The decision also highlights the regulatory challenge of defining clear boundaries between securities and non-securities in crypto. As the industry evolves, approving an Ethereum futures ETF could shape the regulatory landscape, paving the way for increased adoption and investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. However, the news is not entirely favorable for ETH as it trades at $1,660, following a downward trend similar to Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. The market has experienced a substantial outflow of liquidity, leading to a significant decline in most digital currencies. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has declined more than 4% after breaking its previously established range between $1,895 and $1,830. Additionally, it has suffered a notable loss of 10% within the seven-day timeframe.
