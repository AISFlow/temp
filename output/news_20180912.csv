Avaí president Francisco José Battistotti said in a statement that the ICO is targeting a ""global football fan base,"" adding:  ""With our ICO, we are actively ... engaging all Avaí FC in Florianópolis and Brazil, working together towards our goal – to become a stable member of Brazil's Série A and qualify for the Copa Libertadores.

42429651,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0SZh,1536769051,Ether Shorts Hit Another Record High as Price Sinks,"There seems to be no end in sight for the sell-off in ether markets, as the number of short orders placed on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit a fresh record high on Wednesday.  The ETH/USD shorts on Bitfinex exchange clocked a new high of 248,247, beating the previous record high of 247,611 set last Friday. Looking at the data from a different angle, these bearish bets have risen by more than 200 percent in the past four weeks.  ETH/USD shorts  The extreme negative positioning – as seen in the chart above – usually results in a sharp move on the opposite side, popularly known as ""short squeeze"". Further, the stage looks set for profit taking (unwinding of shorts) as the cryptocurrency is looking extremely oversold as per the relative strength index (RSI).  However, the ether market is showing no signs of bearish exhaustion. This is evident from the fact that ETH found acceptance below $200 after shorts rose to lifetime highs on Friday. Further, prices hit a 13-month low of $167 today in accordance with the rise in the bearish bets to new highs.  So, it seems safe to say that the bearish sentiment is quite strong and the unwinding of shorts will likely gather pace only if bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, picks up a bid as anticipated by technical charts.  However, if BTC dips below $6,000, then the ETH bears could continue to boost short positions to fresh record highs, accentuating the rout.  At press time, ETH is trading above $171 on Bifinex.

The world's seventh largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization sank to $47.67 at 10:34 UTC – its lowest price since September 22, 2017. LTC was last seen at $49.08, down more than 8 percent on the day, according to CoinMarketCap.  Notably, LTC is the second biggest loser among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, reporting a 22.5 percent loss week-on-week. Further, it is down 86 percent from its all-time high of $344 set last December.  Other cryptocurrencies are also reporting sharp losses today. For instance, ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and monero (XMR) are all posting 24-hour losses above 9 percent. Meanwhile, Stellar lumens (XLM) is currently the only cryptocurrency out of the top 50 showing a 24-hour gain, albeit a meager one of 0.02 percent – likely based on positive news flow in recent days.  The risk aversion is likely associated with bitcoin's (BTC) 15 percent week-on-week drop. The leading cryptocurrency's current price of $6,273 is just around $400 away from setting a new low for the year, which if surpassed, will likely drag down the rest of market with it.

According to an exclusive report from CoinDesk Korea, the probe is causing jitters among the firms over whether it could ultimately lead to some form of sanctions if firms are considered to have broken rules on token sales. Currently, ICOs are technically not allowed, since the token-based funding method was banned last September.  As revealed in a questionnaire from the Financial Services Commission – obtained by CoinDesk Korea on Wednesday – the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has already sent letters to several companies asking them to cooperate with the investigation. The FSS is a regulator that supervises financial institutions under the oversight of the FSC.  The questionnaire consists of 52 questions, requiring specific information such as shareholder status, countries where an ICO is in progress, the amount of tokens allocated to domestic residents in any ICO, and the reasons for conducting an ICO overseas.  However, rather than an effort to clamp down on token sales, an official from the FSS told CoinDesk Korea it is reaching out ""to understand what the contents of the contract, business plan, and white paper are, if it has any.""  They continued:  ""It is not for sanctions. This is to grasp the current situation. ... It is important to look at investors' ability to report on investments, and to provide a system for ICOs.""  Regarding a possible regulatory framework for ICOs, the official said, ""We are trying to figure out the real situation because we can not just [ignore the issue] as ICOs are going on in foreign countries.""  A lawyer who had advised a blockchain firm that has recently completed an ICO said they were skeptical about the intentions behind the investigation, when asked by CoinDesk Korea.

Starting Wednesday, the new ""compliant, price-stable"" coin is being made available for institutional accounts, hedge funds, traders, and exchanges. Carbon said in a press release that it is ""actively pursuing"" exchange listings for CarbonUSD.  Although CarbonUSD will launch less than a week after the Gemini dollar and Paxos Standard hit the markets, the team believes the coin's unique algorithmic model will eventually set it apart from its competitors' offerings.  If and when CarbonUSD reaches a $1 billion market cap, Carbon will transition to a hybrid algorithmic model, Miles Albert, co-founder of Carbon, told CoinDesk.  ""We've already developed our algorithmic scale model, we've already done simulations as well, to test the resilience of our model,"" he said ""We plan to whitelist our algorithmic stablecoin into the 'metatoken' structure after CarbonUSD has reached sufficient scale and liquidity.""  However, with a cloud still gathered around the current primary stablecoin, tether, over its lack of clear third-party audits and accusations of market manipulation, trust in another dollar-backed stablecoin may be hard to establish.  Albert seems unfazed, however, saying:  ""We designed CarbonUSD to be as compliant as possible and in doing so we – our partner's Prime Trust – and CarbonUSD will undergo frequent third-party attestation to verify that each token is one-to-one [dollar to token] backed. We really want to create a token that's transparent, compliant.""  The project's chief marketing officer, David Segura, explained that Carbon spent a lot of time working with Prime Trust – a blockchain-driven trust company – to make sure that the ""legal side"" was thoroughly thought out. Investors wishing to purchase CarbonUSD will need to do so via fiat currency deposits with Prime Trust, according to the release.  Back in April, Carbon was able to secure $2 million in seed funding from investors such as General Catalyst, Digital Currency Group and FirstMark Capital.  While CarbonUSD is launching on the ethereum network, the company indicated it is still interested in the energy efficient, high-throughput network hashgraph, which is yet to be released to the public.  ""An algorithmic, fiat-pegged stablecoin will help drive utility and accelerate the adoption of crypto,"" said Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group.

42429661,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0SPh,1536755431,Crypto Billionaire Di Iorio Seeks New Start for Jaxx as All-in-One Wallet,"One mobile app to rule them all. That's how Anthony Di Iorio sees the new Jaxx Liberty crypto wallet.  As one of the cryptocurrency industry's wealthiest entrepreneurs, Decentral CEO Di Iorio said he aims to attract up to 100 corporate integrations to his new wallet to make it the most versatile app in the ecosystem. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Decentral is launching Jaxx Liberty today, after several months of beta testing.  ""It's almost like an app store,"" Di Iorio told CoinDesk, speaking to how consolidation could make transactions faster and simpler. ""Our whole model is we provide a single interface so that users don't have to send money outside of a single system.""  Di Iorio said he believes the whole ecosystem flourishes when products monetize cohesively rather than competitively dividing users across platforms.  Stepping back, Decentral garnered over 1 million Jaxx downloads since January 2017 and still processes more than 3,000 support requests a month. Active users total 750,000 to 1 million a month, depending on market conditions, Di Iorio said, including 118,000 Chrome extension users.  While the original Jaxx was predominately a software wallet capable of in-app currency conversions thanks to exchange partner ShapeShift, processing roughly $2 billion worth of crypto through that integration since 2016, Jaxx Liberty now includes everything from in-app block explorers for multiple currencies to news feeds from sites like CoinDesk.  The new app is available for Android mobile devices and as a Google Chrome browser extension, with iOS and desktop versions on the way.  ""These are the things that, every day, people are looking at the pricing,"" Di Iorio said, adding that the new features were inspired by user feedback about their financial habits. ""We've put it all in one place.""  Decentral will charge up to $250,000 to add support for new assets to Jaxx Liberty and it takes a cut of the fees for integrating financial services from other startups, such as exchanges. Meanwhile, the Decentral team plans to launch a tokenized reward program in 2019, called Unity, as yet another revenue stream from Jaxx Liberty.  ""The more the user is using services that we're monetizing, the more they are earning of unity token,"" Di Iorio said. ""They're going to be able to get discounts from our services.""  However, aspirations aside, conversations with users and market observers suggest the company has a steep hill to climb in terms of realizing its vision.  Competition  For one, Jaxx Liberty won't be the first app to market itself as a comprehensive interface.  The Chinese company Cheetah Mobile has a similar all-in-one tagline for its Coin Master app, which includes crypto price trackers and portfolio management features that can link to various wallets and exchange accounts for automatic transfers.  Plus, the investing platform eToro already includes a multipurpose wallet with exchange features, portfolio management, social networking components, and customized news feeds. It remains to be seen if Jaxx Liberty will become the go-to multipurpose wallet, despite competition and philosophical conflicts with the open source community.  Fellow wallet maker Richard Burton, CEO of the ethereum-centric startup Balance, which offers a wallet with many of the same features as Jaxx Liberty, told CoinDesk he admires the diversity of assets and services incorporated in Jaxx Liberty.  On the other hand, Decentral's past security issues, ones he attributed to the wallet's closed-source design, give him pause.  Speaking of a Jaxx user who claimed in June 2017 that he lost $400,000 due to a security flaw, Burton said:  ""These are the kinds of things that, if you are open source, someone might have just waded through and found [the bug]. A big part of what makes really secure software is the ability for anyone who is curious to dive in.""  What users say  That said, for many, Jaxx's simple interface has helped it become one of their first user-friendly wallets.  ""I began using Jaxx because they had mobile and desktop, as well as supported a couple coins that I was mining at the time,"" an altcoin miner and trader, who asked to stay anonymous because his day job is in the blockchain industry, told CoinDesk.  As several others told CoinDesk, this user primarily relies on Jaxx for onboarding crypto newbies, converting niche altcoins into dominant cryptos, and transferring funds to other wallets for storage.  Like Burton, the miner and trader cited security issues as a concern, however.  ""I stopped using [Jaxx] as a wallet after I lost money due to their bugs and poor service,"" he said.  Others merely used Jaxx experimentally, a valuable use case in a field full of builders and tinkerers. For example, token aficionado Zineb Belmkaddem told CoinDesk she used Jaxx because Decentral partnered with the adtech company StormX.  Although Belmkaddem used Jaxx to cash out her StormX earnings, she said she doesn't routinely use Jaxx because some users have reported severe bugs and security issues related to Decentral's wallet.  Challenges to overcome  With today's launch, it remains to be seen if Jaxx can overcome the $400,000 theft from 2017 that attracted widespread criticism from privacy experts, or at least the lingering perception of security issues.  This may be doubly true in that serving newer consumers is challenging in an industry where consumers remain under-educated on how to use available tools.  As for the hack, Di Iorio said the user was responsible, not Decentral, because the user allegedly didn't secure the phone itself with a fingerprint lock or pin.  Despite complaints, Di Iorio said there haven't been any cases of lost funds caused by Decentral's software.  He also added:  ""We consider ourselves a hot wallet. We don't recommend keeping life-changing amounts on it.""  Indeed, one could argue that leather wallets are not meant for anyone's retirement savings, just as no one lugs around a safe when they go shopping for groceries.  ""There's always a trade-off between usability, portability, and security,"" Di Iorio said.  Shift at ShapeShift  One more challenge for Decentral – one that underscores its impetus to integrate with additional third-party services – will be responding to the recent change at its first integration partner, ShapeShift.  As reported last week, ShapeShift is reluctantly moving away from its longstanding ""no-account"" model, in which users have not been required to provide personal information. The exchange will start by offering perks to users who identify themselves, but later this year, the know-your-customer (KYC) procedures will become mandatory.  Decentral is still figuring out what this means for the Jaxx integration with ShapeShift, Di Iorio told CoinDesk. ""We're evaluating their new system right now and seeing how that's going to impact us and what our plans are going to be,"" he said, noting that his company has a few months to make any decisions before ShapeShift's new policy takes effect.  In the meantime, Decentral is looking to add integrations with similar services, so it's not wholly reliant on any single one. ""Our goal is to be the Expedia of exchange,"" Di Iorio said, referring to the popular travel aggregation site. ""We want to give our users options.""  Like ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees, who tweeted that ShapeShift changed course ""under duress,"" Di Iorio was not happy about the change, saying:  ""I like ShapeShift's model that they've got right now. I like the no account [set-up]. I don't like friction. ... It's a slippery slope when a company starts collecting user information, which is why we don't.""  But he didn't fault his partner for its decision.  ""You see the climate right now,"" Di Iorio said. ""I understand that companies have to abide by certain rules and regulations.""

In an announcement on Wednesday, Huobi said its wholly owned subsidiary Huobi Japan Holding Ltd has inked an agreement with Eric Cheng, the sole owner of BitTrade, to acquire a majority stake in the firm.  BitTrade is currently one of 16 licensed exchanges in Japan and also a member of the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association.  Huobi declined to disclose the dollar amount of the acquisition and its exact ownership stake in BitTrade when asked by CoinDesk.  A previous announcement indicated that, as recently as June, Cheng had bought 100 percent of a licensed forex trading firm, FX Trade Financial, of which BitTrade is an affiliate, for $50 million.  Huobi's chief financial officer, Chris Lee, commented on the acquisition:  ""Leveraging on BitTrade's leadership team and its Japanese government-approved license, this is just the beginning as we look to grow BitTrade into the most dominant player in the Japanese cryptocurrency market.""  The deal comes after, in 2017, Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings scrapped a partnership with Huobi that would have allowed the latter to take a stake in SBI's recently launched VCTRADE crypto exchange. The banking giant said at the time it preferred to use in-house resources to build a security system following the Coincheck hack in January.  The acquisition of a licensed exchange also follows Huobi's recent effort to buy over 60 percent of a public company listed in Hong Kong with $70 million in a move that paves the way for a possible back-door listing for the crypto exchange.

42429654,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0SXh,1536750074,Bitcoin Price Charts Hint at Recovery Rally Above $6.4K,"Bitcoin (BTC) could witness a minor corrective rally if the bulls' persistent defense of key support leads to a break above the resistance at $6,400, technical charts indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency suffered a downside break of the symmetrical triangle in the early U.S. session yesterday, signaling a revival of the sell-off from the recent highs above $7,400.  Further, the bearish pattern bolstered the already negative setup, as represented by the rising wedge breakdown and the pennant breakdown on the line chart.  As a result, BTC was looking likely to test $6,000 (February low) before the UTC close yesterday. Instead, it bounced back from $6,170 — the support of the trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low — and closed largely unchanged on the day at $6,290.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,250 on Bitfinex and the trendline support is seen slightly higher at $6,180.  Daily chart  As seen in the above chart, the lower end of the pennant pattern – the trendline sloping upwards from the June low – is proving a tough nut to crack. This could be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion, given that the crucial support is holding ground after a 16 percent drop.  That argument has merit since the cryptocurrency created a ""spinning bottom"" candle yesterday, signaling indecision in the marketplace.  A UTC close today above $6,400 (previous day's high) would validate the spinning bottom candle, opening doors to a stronger corrective rally toward $6,830 (10-week moving average).  On the other hand, acceptance below the pennant support will likely accentuate the bear case.  View  BTC's repeated defense of the key price support has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  A convincing break above yesterday's high of $6,400 would confirm a spinning bottom bullish reversal and could yield a test of supply around the resistance at $6,800 (multiple daily highs).  A UTC close below $6,180 (pennant support) would add credence to the rising wedge breakdown witnessed earlier this month and would open up downside towards the June low of $5,755.

Softbank said on Wednesday the technology was developed in partnership with blockchain startup TBCASoft, as well as Synchronoss, a Nasdaq-listed firm that delivered a SMS-replacement communications protocol called Rich Communication Service (RCS) in Japan.  Based on the announcement, the partners jointly created the blockchain-based PoC, which notably integrates RCS with a distributed network deployed across participating carriers.  The system is intended to be deployed among mobile carriers in an effort to replace the traditional SMS text messging system with a richer pool of features, such as sending multimedia content, documents and voices calls via carrier networks instead of mobile apps.  Softbank further explained that, with a distribute network as a underlying technology, users can send funds stored in their wallets within the RCS system from one carrier to another in a peer-to-peer fashion – which would be especially useful when traveling abroad.  Softbank Corp. vice president Takeshi Fukuizumi commented in the announcement:  ""This RCS and blockchain based mobile payments PoC demonstrates the value operator-led services can deliver. Not only do we foresee our new mobile payment service empowering merchants to operate digitally, and at a scale that was previously only available to big brands, but it will also give our customers more flexibility when it comes to their purchasing and traveling habits.""  The effort comes a year after Softbank, TBCASoft and several global major carriers formed a Carrier Blockchain Study Group with the goal of developing a cross-carrier blockchain payments service.

42429653,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Sbh,1536739821,Is Bitcoin Building a 2015-Style Price Bottom?,"Bitcoin's price action this year may be dismal, but it might not be without precedent.  Having hit a record high near $20,000 in December, the world's largest cryptocurrency began 2018 backed a wave of optimism. Since then, however, it hasn't translated this into gains for investors.  Rather, the price appears to be following a pattern last seen ahead of a bullish reversal from September 2015.  Why is that important for traders now? When the bull market ended last time around, we saw a violent drop in price whereby bulls were unable to produce any significant highs over the course of the year.  Comparing 2018 to 2015, there are other subtle similarities to draw on for analysts.  In both 2015 and 2018, the price experienced peaks up 36 percent from their respective troughs in July, a development only to be followed through by a poor August performance.  The difference, however, is that while 2015's trend was finally broken by a higher high on July 6, bitcoin's current bearish trend has not been breached in 2018. As such, breaking that trend at $8,500 (the previous significant high) could be key should history repeat.  September, then, could be the make or break for the comparison, as the current uptrend that began August 24, has been slow and steady resulting in a more convincing move as it edges closer to the previous monthly high.  Outlook  Over on the daily chart, we can see BTC has produced a series of lower highs in the first seven months of 2018.  Bears who have been in full control since the start of the year have defied each attempt to move higher, slapping bulls down with added sell pressure. However, the subtle differences between each drop have lessened in intensity.  More importantly, despite the lower highs, the bears have repeatedly failed to secure a weekly close below the February low of $6,000. Further, BTC's rally from the August low of $5,859 has created a first higher low of the year.  So, it seems safe to say that the stage is set for BTC to print the first higher price high of the year by moving above the July high of $8,500.  View  The bearish conditions that have gripped the greater markets appear to be weakening with a slow and steady rise in bitcoin's current trend.  Previous years (2015-16) saw a run-up during the September period, rising between 4.5-34 percent signaling a possibility for this year.  A convincing close above the previous monthly high at $8,500 would break the bear trend, producing bitcoin's first major bullish move since the year began.

Chinese business media outlet Caixin reported on Tuesday that, since the night of Sept. 10 (China time), Xu had been answering questions at the Shanghai police's Weifang Xincun precinct.  Another business news source Cailian Press further reported Tuesday night that Xu was released after 24 hours and the case had been transferred to the police department in Beijing, together with materials gathered so far.  ""Whether the Beijing department will launch a further investigation is up to them,"" a police officer from the Shanghai precinct was quoted as saying in the latter report.  According to Caixin, the dispute stemmed from complaints made by a group of investors who claimed they lost a significant amount of funds on OKEx due to a system crash they alleged the platform orchestrated.  The investors went on to allege that their bitcoin futures positions were force liquidated on Sept. 5 when the price of bitcoin saw a major drop, but OKEx's service crash in the meantime left them without enough time to clear their positions prior to the forced liquidation.  As of press time, OKEx had not published any statement on the alleged system issue. When questioned, a spokesperson told CoinDesk the company is""not aware of such a problem.""  Caixin indicated the group of investors spotted Xu's whereabouts by following his personal trainer to the hotel where he was staying on Monday, and went managed to bring about a face-to-face dispute. Xu subsequently called the police, after which officers arrived to take both Xu and the investors to the police department for further questioning, according to the report.  On Tuesday morning, more investors who allegedly suffered from the system crash arrived at the Shanghai police station to submit materials seeking to prove their accusation, Caixin said.  The Weifang Xincun precinct couldn't be reached for comment to confirm who initially called the police and whether Xu was questioned as a witness or as a suspect.  In a response to a CoinDesk enquiry, OKEx said:  ""As far as OKEx is aware, it was Xu who called the police for help when he was surrounded and intimidated by a gang during his visit in Shanghai. The Shanghai police officers arrived the scene and invited all the related parties back to the police station. ... Xu was then invited for questioning while the gang was detained. Then Xu left the police station.""  The firm further said that Xu was the founder of the OKCoin exchange but now is the head of OK Group. As such the company claimed Xu currently does not represent OKEx ""in any way"" since the exchange does not belong to the group.  Addressing reports in the crypto media yesterday suggesting Xu had been arrested, they also stated: ""It is unfortunate that the story was twisted.""

42429646,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0SLh,1536723359,Inside Bitewei: The New Bitcoin Miner Being Hailed as a Serious Bitmain Rival,"Things haven't been easy of late for Bitmain.  After CoinDesk revealed the China-based crypto mining giant was planning an initial public offering (IPO) for September, the company has faced a wave of perhaps unprecedented scrutiny. On social media, allegations emerged Bitmain was everything from insolvent to presenting a rosy outlook for its financials, all the while investors linked to the funding effort backed away from the deal.  Now it appears Bitmain is facing a new and well-capitalized competitor.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitewei, a Shenzhen-based mining chip manufacturer led by Yang Zuoxing, the former director of design at Bitmain, has raised 140 million yuan (around $20 million) to bring to market mining chips that long-time mining industry insiders believe could lead it to rival at least one area of Bitmain's business.  Tyler Xiong, COO of the bitcoin mining pool operator Bixin, which joined Bitewei's initial investment, told CoinDesk that it believes the company's Whatsminer line of mining chips to be ""a game changer.""  Founded in Shenzhen in July 2016, Bitewei is now considered by some to be the most efficient hardware manufacturer on the market.  According to test results published by Bitewei, the upcoming WhatsMiner M10 is roughly 30 percent more efficient, in terms of electricity consumption than Bitmain's most recent flagship product the AntMiner S9 Hydro.  Yang told CoinDesk Bitewei has so far received pre-orders of over 1,000 units of Whatsminer M10, a product scheduled to officially launch on September 19, but that started its pre-sale in mid August. With an average price around $1,600 depending on the shipping batch, the new product could already be generating a revenue beyond $1.6 million.  That said, Bitewei admittedly has a long way to go, as IPO materials suggest Bitmain controls 85 percent of the global cryptocurrency mining hardware market. Further, it has a well-developed software-based business, with its BTC.com and Antpool mining pools providing mining tools to 30 percent of the network's miners.  This large market share is viewed with skepticism by cryptocurrency developers, who believe it conflicts with efforts to open access to cryptocurrency protocols and the digital monetary rewards they create.  As such, the fact that hardware distributors are already selling Whatsminer products has created excitement among those who believe the rise of additional, competitive mining chip providers could benefit the industry while better ensuring its ethos.  David Vorick, CEO of Obelisk, a company that set out to challenge Bitmain with an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner for the Siacoin cryptocurrency, said he believes Bitewei proves that competition is possible, if difficult to achieve.  Vorick told CoinDesk:  ""There should be a lot more players in the bitcoin mining space and a lot more manufacturers, especially if we can figure out everything that Whatsminer is doing to get the efficiency gains that they've been getting.""  Others, however, say efficiency isn't everything, and that Bitewei must still prove it can execute, avoiding the pitfalls that have seen other mining firms go bankrupt despite competitive products.  ""It takes a lot, luck included, for a company to grow to that size and influence,"" Xiong said, comparing Bitewei to Bitmain. ""It's hard for a new hardware company to get that influence now. Besides, there are only 4 million bitcoins left to mine.""  Cutting-edge products  Still, Bitewei's test results suggest its product far exceeds the current norm.  Ahead of the Whatsminer M10's formal launch, Bitewei kicked off the pre-sale by publishing two rounds of testing results on August 10 and 25, respectively. In both cases, Bitewei claimed the machine was performing at a level that consumed 66 watts to 68 watts of electricity per 1 trillion hashes (66W/TH).  In comparison, according to the official specifics published by Bitmain about its latest AntMiner S9 Hydro, the mining giant's flagship product has a power consumption that's around 96 W/TH.  Speaking of growing competition from other bitcoin miners that recently launched products featuring 7nm chips, including Canaan Creative and GMO Internet, Yang said his next step is also to roll out a 7nm-chip bitcoin miner in 2019.  Yet, Vorick said he believes Bitewei now has a considerable edge compared to both other startups and incumbent competitors, as Yang's 50-people team combines experience with cutting-edge chip designs.  ""It seems like the majority of the design talent at Bitmain is now at Whatsminer [Bitewei],"" Vorick said.  Perhaps that's why Yang doesn't appear deterred by fierce competition during the summer's overall bearish crypto market, with bitcoin's price sliding below $7,000. ""The market always has ups and downs and 2018 is somewhat like 2014, during which the bitcoin price kept declining for a year,"" Yang told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""Nothing can stop the enthusiasm for people inside the industry. Outsiders may hesitate, like Intel or NVIDIA, but not us.""  The chipmaker  Bolstering the enthusiasm for the company is that this isn't Yang's first industry effort, as his experience with bitcoin mining started long before he joined Bitmain.  After earning a Ph.D. in engineering physics from China's Tsinghua University, Yang started in 2014 as a chip designer at ASICMiner, a bitcoin miner maker founded in 2012 by Jiang Xinyu – a.k.a Friedcat on bitcointalk.org – whose unexplained disappearance in January 2015 is still one of the bitcoin industry's unsolved mysteries.  Promptly after Friedcat's disappearance, Yang presented his full-custom chip design to Micree Zhan, co-founder and chairman of the Beijing-based Bitmain. It was the design that would soon become Bitmain's Antminer S7, as Yang joined Bitmain's team in the spring of 2015.  The full-custom methodology adopted by Yang, in layman's terms, allows a designer working with integrated circuits to completely customize the layout of each transistor and how they connect to each other.  The benefit is that, as opposed to other methods such as semi-custom which uses pre-designed layout to some extent, the full-custom method allows a designer with the right skill-set to maximize the chip's output at the lowest point of power consumption.  But, as Yang told CoinDesk, this method is also highly costly and time-consuming. That's why it is best suited to large-scale production, like Bitmain's factories.  It could have been a perfect match. However, Yang said he decided to move from Bitmain's Beijing's office back to Shanghai after just two weeks because he didn't fit in with Bitmain's ""working environment,"" adding he ""didn't feel respected."" So he continued working part-time on designing the Antminer S7, balancing that remote job with a new side project of his own.  After Bitmain officially rolled out Antminer S7 in August 2015, Yang said he had five rounds of negotiations with Bitmain about equity, all while keeping control of his designs for the Antminer S9 for the company, soon to be Bitmain's flagship product (revealed in May 2016).  Yang said while Jihan Wu – also co-founder of Bitmain – agreed to offer him 2 percent of Bitmain's equity, Zhan did not go along with that plan and made an alternative offer of 0.5 percent.  When negotiations went sour, Yang ended his Bitmain contract in June 2016 and launched Bitewei one month later.  Beyond Yang himself, Bitewei attracted several other bitcoin industry veterans.  The startup's list of early investors included notable figures in the Chinese bitcoin mining community, such as co-founders of the F2POOL Wang Chun and Mao Shixing, as well as Wu Ying, chairman of an investment firm called China Capital Group. Based on a Chinese business registration database, both Mao and Wang are now Bitewei board members.  Bad blood  Bitewei's rivalry with Bitmain intensified during the past two years as they battled over the intellectual property Yang designed.  Last year, Yang told CoinDesk Bitmain filed a patent infringement lawsuit against him over Bitewei's adoption of the so-called ""serial power circuit design"" for Whatsminer – a technology that Bitmain secured a patent for in March 2016.  In retaliation, Yang filed a claim to revoke Bitmain's patent on the grounds that serial power supply circuit designs were widely used and documented.  China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) invalidated Bitmain's patent on April 8. The SIPO's statement about revoking Bitmain's authorized patent, for lack of unique creativity in the Antminer's design, said:  ""If a technological solution sought by a patent has different characteristics than existing technologies, but such difference is public knowledge, then it is obvious the solution would incorporate this public knowledge.""  The Urumqi Intermediate Court in China's Xinjiang province, where the legal complaint was initially filed by Bitmain, then followed the SIPO's lead and dismissed the case on August 31, according to a court document Yang shared with CoinDesk.  Bitmain declined to comment.  By this point, Xiong noted that the animosity between these manufacturing teams was common knowledge in bitcoin mining circles. But the controversy surrounded Bitmain has gone far beyond this patent fight and its ongoing hardware and mining pool dominance.  Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu has long been an outspoken supporter of the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash, created by a disagreement over the technical direction of the bitcoin software, a fact which has made him a persona non grata among bitcoin's developers.  Yet as argued by the research firm Alliance Bernstein, Bitmain's strong belief in bitcoin cash may have caused it an issue of declining cash flow, and may put it in a further position to be challenged by a competitor. Analysts wrote in a recent report that Bitmain now holds about 5.7 percent of the total supply of bitcoin cash, which they said was ""likely"" purchased using its operating cash and bitcoin holdings.  ""These BCH holdings, valued at $890 million as of [Q1 2018], pose another major risk as BCH is illiquid and has depreciated nearly 20 percent since [Q1 2018],"" the report noted at the time.  Bitmain's controversy could turn out to be a boon for Bitewei, which has avoided entanglements with blockchain industry rumors and conflicts.  If Wu and Bitmain are bitcoin cash believers in their core, then Yang is simply the chip guy.  ""Full-custom methodology can be applied to literally every type of chip,"" Yang said of his vision for Bitewei, which is to become the greatest chip maker, hinting in the long-term, the firm is not limited to just making crypto miners.
