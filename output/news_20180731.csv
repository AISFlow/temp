42429445,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLysLh,1533073842,Stellar Month: July's Top Performing Crypto Asset Saw 40% Gains,"Bitcoin's 26 percent rally left many a cryptocurrency in the dust over the course of July.  Indeed, the bitcoin dominance rate, a widely used indicator that tracks the percentage of the total crypto market cap contributed by bitcoin, rose to 48 percent, up from 42 percent, to record a 7-month high over the 31-day period, a function of money shifting from alternative cryptocurrencies into bitcoin.  That said, not every alternative cryptocurrency saw gains. Ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain, and the second-largest cryptocurrency by total value, as an example, recorded a monthly loss.  A notable exception among the largest 25 cryptocurrencies reviewed by CoinDesk, however, was stellar's XLM token, which was able to defy the odds and become the top monthly performer in its class. Fueled by interest from the most influential U.S. exchange, Coinbase, the news the startup is considering an XLM listing revved up investor interest, spiking 13 percent on the news.  Still, it's arguable that this simply helped galvanize stellar's appeal after notable recent milestones.  In recent months, teams seeking to launch initial coin offerings (ICOs), including social messenger Kik, have begun to utilize stellar's technology. Also notable has been the team's technical commitments, such as its prominent support for the scaling solution, lightning network, which developers say they aim to implement this year.  Along the ride, stellar would go on to hold its gains, though, eventually displacing litecoin to become the world's sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – valued today just north of $5 billion.  Monthly winner  Stellar        Monthly performance: +40 percent  All-time high: $0.90  Closing price on June 30: $0.19  Current market price: $0.27  Rank as per market capitalization: 6  XLM began its monthly ascent on July 13 (Coinbase news), reaching its monthly high of $0.36 12 days later when it showed a 93 percent gain from the month's open of $0.19.  Still, the crypto asset cooled off during the last week of the July, dropping 11 percent, likely due to overextended technical charts and a wavering bitcoin price. When July came to a close, Stellar finalized its 40 percent month-to-month appreciation.  Daily chart    Price closed above the two-month long descending trendline (yellow) on July 14, a bullish signal seen in the chart above, and continued its journey past the 200 day exponential moving average to the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement (from May high of $0.47). Its monthly high mark of $0.36 was set shortly after on July 25.  The combination of resistances proved to be too strong as price failed to find acceptance above the levels, first hinted by bearish divergence in the daily RSI. Price consequently reversed over 24 percent to where it stands today just below $0.28.  Only a daily close below the long term trendline (blue) would return the immediate trend to bearish favor and suggest a move towards the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement located near $0.23. On the upside, a bounce off of the trendline could be seen as a successful throwback test and would add credence to the bullish trend change, setting sights back on the elusive $0.36 resistance.

Authorities are reportedly looking into Shinil Group, which claims to have found a Russian shipwreck from the early 1900s, for possible fraud charges. The company launched its own cryptocurrency, which investors bought with the promise of being able to redeem tokens for treasure from the ship, according to the report. As part of the investigation, officials have issued a travel ban on CEO Choi Yong-seok.  Seoul's Gangseo District Police are planning to interrogate Choi and others associated with the company as part of the alleged fraud case.  Shinil Group announced earlier this month that it had found the wreck of the Dmitrii Donskoi, a Russian Navy warship sunk in 1905, and that the ship might contain up to $134 billion worth of gold, as reported by Reuters. But the company later backtracked on those claims and lowered the figure to $8.6 billion in a press conference on July 26.  The company at the time announced that it intended to launch an ICO for its own token, named Shinil Gold Coin, which will be backed by the discovered ship's gold haul. The token has attracted 60 billion won in investments from around 100,000 people since it was launched this year, Korea Joongang Daily said, citing a source familiar with the matter.

The bipartisan bill is aimed at advancing research and treatments around coccidioidomycosis – commonly known as valley fever – among other endemic fungal diseases.  Part of the FORWARD Act, the measure calls for a blockchain pilot aimed at improving the ways in which medical practitioners can share information. The idea is that by improving the speed at which such data is moved, doctors are better equipped to handle potentially life-or-death situations involving infectious diseases.  Schweikert said in a statement:  ""Our design for collecting critical clinical data, while protecting patient privacy through the use of blockchain, should become the future of medical research.""

Although Trust Wallet has been acquired, its team will continue operating autonomously, the founders said.  Compatible with ethereum-based tokens, the platform is open-source, decentralized and anonymous, and is capable of storing more than 20,000 crypto assets.  ""Wallets are the most fundamental interface to the crypto economy, and a secure and easy-to-use wallet is key to proliferate the adoption of cryptocurrencies,"" Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a statement.  He further told CoinDesk in an email:  ""We want to keep Trust Wallet as an independent brand and product. It's still the team's baby. We are like a godfather. In fact, we plan to move more services to Trust Wallet, such as tight integration with our decentralized exchange Binance Chain..""  Part of the decision to acquire Trust Wallet comes from the fact that the platform does not request user data or other private information. As a result, the platform ""has built a strong reputation for security,"" the release claims.  Trust Wallet founder Viktor Radchenko said he started the project to fill a need for an open-source ethereum wallet to form part of the infrastructure helping other developers build decentralized applications going forward.  ""This is an incredible opportunity for Trust Wallet to work with the biggest and the most respected exchange in the world, but we also feel as though we are aligning with a partner that shares a similar approach towards security and user management,"" he said in a statement.

42401721,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2E1Y,1533034799,Bitcoin's Price Moves Below $8K as Bull Case Weakens,"Bitcoin's price risks deeper losses below $8,000 as the bears seem to be winning a four-day-long tug-of-war with the bulls.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,950 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent in the last 24 hours – having clocked a low of $7,930 earlier today.  The cryptocurrency has been largely restricted to a narrow range of $8,300–$8,050 since late Friday. Consequently, the Bollinger bandwidth – a volatility indicator – dropped today to the lowest level since October, as per the short duration technical chart.  Hence, we could be in for a big move, as a prolonged period of low volatility (range-bound activity) usually makes way for a big move on either side.  Further, the big move (if it does materialize) could happen to the downside as the bull case has weakened following BTC's failure to capitalize on a descending broadening channel breakout witnessed on Friday.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  The bulls failed to capitalize on the descending broadening channel breakout, leaving the doors open for the bears to make a strong comeback.  A Bollinger bands breakdown (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-candle moving average) – a bearish setup.  A downside break of the trading range – bearish pattern.  BTC has found acceptance under the support of the 50-candle moving average (MA).  The relative strength index (RSI) has adopted a bearish bias (dropped below 50.00).  Clearly, the technical chart is aligned in favor of the bears. Further, the decline could be sharp, a key volatility gauge indicates.  4-hour chart Bollinger bandwidth  The volatility, as represented by the Bollinger bandwidth (gap between the bands) on the 4-hour chart, fell today to its lowest level since October. As stated earlier, an extended period of low volatility is usually followed by a big move, which is seen happening to the downside.  As a result, BTC could suffer a deeper drop below the $8,000 mark.  View  The current 4-hour candle will likely close below the lower Bollinger band, confirming a bearish breakdown. In this case, BTC is seen falling to the ascending (bullish) 100-candle MA on the 4-hour chart, currently located at $7,609.  A daily close (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA support of $7,591 (former resistance) would signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  The bulls are seen making a comeback if BTC finds acceptance above $8,300.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42401722,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2E0Z,1533031217,NFL Players Union Strikes Deal to Help Athletes Earn Crypto,"The players' union for the National Football League (NFL) is partnering with a blockchain startup to help athletes license products on a decentralized network.  Announced Tuesday, the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) plans to encourage its members to provide commentary, livestreams and other content for the FanChain platform, thereby earning revenue for themselves outside the games they play.  To that end, the NFLPA has purchased a minority stake in blockchain startup SportsCastr, the company behind FanChain.  SportsCastr's platform allows anybody to set up streams and provide commentary on games, NFLPA vice president of business and legal affairs Casey Schwab told CoinDesk. With the new partnership, some NFL players will be able to earn revenue by providing commentary during live sporting events and otherwise creating unique content for fans to enjoy.  ""When you look at blockchain, and obviously currencies have been the most ubiquitous use of blockchain today, but when we look at tokenized assets or tokens or [non-fungible tokens], we look at the different ways we can try to create products that are going to be sustainable and long-lasting,"" he said.  Schwab added:  ""Because of the decentralized nature of the platform, anyone can get on it, players can get on it. NFL players are really interested in blockchain, in crypto … if a player calls me and asks 'how do I get involved' I'd suggest he go on SportsCastr and start generating tokens.""  To bring in revenue on the platform, athletes can either earn tokens from the system by creating content for the platform, or have fans pay them with tokens directly.  Players may even be able to launch subscription-only streams, according to Schwab.  The platform won't be limited to just football players, either. Schwab said that representatives from other sports are in discussions with the platform too, although he could not provide a timeline for any potential program launches.  Similarly, athletes will free to discuss or commentate on games from sports outside their own, he continued.  ""We're not limiting it to any sports. It's really about engaging all athletes,"" he said.  The NFLPA first started considering working with a blockchain startup several months ago, as part of its OneTeam Collective – the union's venture capital arm. Schwab explained that the wing allowed companies to offer equity rather than cash when licensing trademarks or player time.  ""I'm a big believer in blockchain and I think it will revolutionize our industry, sports, like it may have revolutionized industries like food,"" he said.  As a result, the NFLPA looked for a platform with a solid foundation, which brought it to SportsCastr.  Schwab concluded:  ""They are building an entire universe. To use an analogy, they're not just building the video game, they're building the video game, the console, the outlets [and] the television. That's a big endeavor.""

Horowitz has spent the last 12 years leading the compliance team at Pershing, a BNY Mellon company and also one of the largest providers of brokerage custody. Before that, he worked at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a self-regulatory organization. All those roles saw Horowitz managing anti-money laundering and other compliance programs.  During his career, Horowitz has also taken efforts to shape financial regulation in the U.S via his involvement with industry associations such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  Asiff Hirji, Coinbase's president and chief operating officer, wrote in the blog post:    ""His experience managing matters related to broker-dealer regulation, asset custodianship, and AML programs makes him a uniquely qualified leader for our compliance team.""            The appointment comes soon after Coinbase started offering a crypto custody service aimed at institutional investors and is taking steps to become a regulated broker-dealer in the U.S.  The company said earlier this month that FINRA had already approved its acquisition of three licensed broker-dealers, inching the firm a step closer to potentially listing crypto tokens deemed as securities.

Franklin PUD added that it also plans to propose a new rate structure for miners as a response to their high demands.  The decision marks Franklin as the latest county in the state to have restricted cryptocurrency miners, which have been increasingly drawn to the low electricity costs in the area, as well as a relatively cooler weather – all of which helps miners maximize their return on investment.  Early this year, both Chelan and Mason counties also issued similar freezes on new cryptocurrency mining operations.  In April, Chelan also cut off electricity to three ""unauthorized"" farms that local officials said posed a risk to public safety.

42401715,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Duf,1533024054,BBVA Can't Hold Cryptocurrency – And That's a Problem,"After becoming the first financial institution to combine public and private blockchains in a live transaction, Spanish multinational bank BBVA has hit something of a quandary.  Specifically, it's unsure how to take its forward-thinking work … forward.  In the process of executing what was expected to be the third in a series of blockchain-based corporate loans, the bank had to work around a lack of legal and regulatory clarity over whether it could (or should) hold the cryptocurrency needed to power a transaction on ethereum.  In short, BBVA's innovation is meant to act like a public notary service, combining private Hyperledger technology (used to negotiate the loan) with a public blockchain (in this case ethereum) in an effort to identify and store each loan agreement with auditability.  However, erring on the side of caution, BBVA chose to abide by European Banking Authority (EBA) recommendations and not use the native token of ethereum, ether, which also serves as a kind of fuel to update the ledger. Instead, the bank anchored the loans to an ethereum testnet, a blockchain which simulates the live version, but that doesn't move real value.  No big deal, you might think, but this uncertainty is hindering the hard-won innovation work.  Alicia Pertusa, managing director of corporate and investment banking at BBVA, said that according to the EBA recommendations of 2014, European banks are discouraged from owning, buying or selling cryptocurrencies. She pointed out that the process BBVA used for the loans was exactly the same as it would have been on the live ethereum, the only difference is it would need the regulator's approval before using the real ether.  While the Bank of Spain, the regulator in this case, would not go on the record, it's clear regulators understand banks may need or want to have small amounts of crypto, not as an asset or an investment, but to validate transactions.  Regulators tend to point out that the EBA 2014 recommendation is not legally binding and thus is not a formal ban. Still, the compliance department of a given bank would have to judge whether this particular use of cryptocurrencies is advisable.  Pertusa told CoinDesk:  ""We do think that regulators are evolving in the way they look at cryptocurrencies and in this case in particular we have talked with our regulators. They understand very well that the use of gas and ether in this kind of network is very different from the speculation of cryptocurrencies.""  Regulatory requirements  Still, the results are a rare, tangible example of how inconclusive guidance, combined with big-bank jitters about the possibility of plans going wrong, are having an impact on innovation.  Only in March of this year, EBA chief Andrea Enria said it would be more effective to prevent banks and other regulated financial institutions from holding cryptocurrencies, rather than regulating the tokens themselves.  In a statement to CoinDesk, the EBA said: ""The EBA has issued several warnings to consumers regarding virtual assets and has discouraged financial institutions from gaining exposures to such assets in view of their high-risk nature. However, as a matter of EU banking law, there is no prohibition on financial institutions gaining direct or indirect exposures to such assets.""  None of this lessens the irony that BBVA is doing real corporate loans – €75 million to technology company Indra in April; followed by last month's €325 million to oil and gas company Repsol; and last week €100 million to construction firm ACS – but is uncomfortable holding a few dollars worth of ether because of mixed signals from regulators.  In fact, BBVA's corporate loans platform achieves a number of regulatory goals, such as making the pre-trade negotiation of the loan – which is normally done with a mix of phone calls and messages – a single, transparent and easily audited process. And the lessons learned from the tethered loans will be taken on into BBVA's blockchain syndicated loans project, which will launch in the coming weeks.  As far as the public part is concerned, Pertusa acknowledged that while public blockchain notarization is a powerful tool for those who know how to use it (there is lots of appetite among the bank's clients for this tech, she said) there still needs to be plenty of education elsewhere.  She told CoinDesk:  ""We see this as the future of public notaries because at the end of the day it's a public record of an agreement that's been reached privately. But a lot still needs to happen in that direction in terms of regulation, admitting that this public blockchain has the same value as a public notary.""  A popular use case  Turns out public blockchains are a popular tool for anchoring data – that is, creating a timestamped proof that the data existed at a certain time – in the world of enterprise ethereum.  Kaleido, the partnership between ethereum development studio Consensys and Amazon Web Services, found that enterprises wanted to anchor private blockchain applications on the public chain more than just about any other blockchain-as-a-service feature.  Indeed, a poll of Kaleido blockchain cloud users saw this use case come out on top with some 37 percent of votes.  ""The results mirror what we are hearing in our client and partner discussions around the world,"" said Kaleido founder Sophia Lopez.  Asked what he thought of the uncertainty facing banks looking at public blockchains for this purpose, Steve Cerveny, CEO of Kaleido, said he was aware of the issue and is in discussion with customers about it, adding that a workaround is in the offing.  ""We are currently exploring how Kaleido's pinning/tether feature as-a-service could alleviate this concern,"" said Cerveny. ""For example, they pay Kaleido in fiat for this optional feature and Kaleido handles all of the technical details including ether/gas.""  Speaking on behalf of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Conor Svensson, blk.io founder and EEA standards chair, said the conundrum demonstrates why financial organizations are far more comfortable working with private blockchain deployments.  He concluded:  ""It's where they can exert a much higher degree of control over the network and are not bound by the same regulatory concerns that apply whilst working with the public blockchains.""

The bank tested the technology for the first time in one of its branches in China's Guizhou province, issuing a loan backed by a piece of agricultural land as collateral, a local news source reported on Tuesday.  To facilitate the process, the ABC said the blockchain system is deployed across various node partners, including other commercial banks, the provincial branch of the People's Bank of China and the local government's Land and Resources Bureau.  By having a distributed ledger to keep parties updated with data on borrowers and their collateral, the bank said the tamper-proof blockchain can streamline the manual process of loan approval and eliminate the problem of double spending – borrowers using the same piece of land as collateral to apply for loans from different banks.  The blockchain application is part of the bank's effort to bring wider access to loans for farmers and businesses that own agricultural land in rural China.  Following the initial test, the ABC aims to further expand the application to issuing loans that are backed by other types of assets, such as real estate in the future.  Listed in both mainland China and Hong Kong with total assets of $3 trillion as of December 2017, the ABC is one of the ""Big Four"" state-owned commercial banks in China and also the fourth largest bank in the world by total assets.  The ABC's annual filing published early this year shows the state-owned entity has also developed a decentralized network to issue small unsecured loans to agricultural e-commerce merchants via an automated process.  Currently, out of the 26 publicly listed banks from China, 12 of them have already started working on blockchain technology.

42401716,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Dwd,1533007804,Bitcoin's Second-Ever Developer Is Back (With a Big Vision for Crypto),"There are early adopters, then there are early early adopters.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the first coder to work alongside bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Martti 'Sirius' Malmi, is joining a team of developers launching a new cryptocurrency called AXE. The project, which is combining Malmi's Identifi online reputation system with decentralized database system GUN, is taking on the long-desired mission of decentralizing the Web.  And Malmi's history in the cryptocurrency space should pique the interest of plenty of enthusiasts.  An amateur college developer in 2009, Malmi played a crucial role in bitcoin's early days as the only active developer working alongside Satoshi – and even striking up a bit of a friendship. He earned Satoshi's trust enough to be given admin access to the website Bitcoin.org, and most of the changes in bitcoin's second code release are attributed to him.  But a couple years in, Malmi followed Satoshi's lead and left the project, thinking bitcoin didn't really need him anymore.  ""I felt like bitcoin had already gone from zero to one, so to say. It was already up and running with a growing community and had lots of great developers working on it,"" he told CoinDesk.  In 2014, then, he started Identifi, with a decentralized architecture that didn't include a cryptocurrency at first.  But as he built – with his eyes on reducing the control web companies like Google and Facebook have – he decided something else was needed that hadn't been tried before and that a crypto token could incentivize its use.  Malmi told CoinDesk:  ""Most of the giant online businesses, such as Google, Facebook, eBay or Airbnb are basically centralized indexes – searchable lists of stuff. If we want to disrupt them, we need decentralized indexing.""  And that's where GUN, which has been in the works since 2014 as well, comes in.  Two projects as one  To tie it all together, the decision was made to launch a new company called ERA.  ""Martti and I were discussing how governments can still blacklist bitcoin miners' IP addresses. Telecom companies, Google, Amazon or others can throttle or reroute our traffic without net neutrality,"" ERA CEO Mark Nadal (also the CEO of GUN) told CoinDesk.  ""This is a huge vulnerability that could affect everyone, thus why we're building AXE,"" he continued.  GUN, which is known for using simple stick-figure comics to explain how its tech works, scored a $1.5 million round led by Draper Associates earlier this year, and has already built a decentralized Reddit and YouTube.  While those services are a bit slower than their centralized counterparts, Nadal argues both have been taking off ""like crazy."" And according to Malmi, Identifi can help decentralize the system further by offering a censorship-resistant identity layer.  While digital reputation systems can conjure up images from the ""Black Mirror"" episode ""Nosedive,"" whereby a mobile reputation system goes awry, Malmi says he's been careful to improve on older attempts and keep these unintended consequences in mind.  In the context of ERA, Identifi provides a crucial role.  ""You could have users digitally sign all their posts and use Identifi to fetch the identity profile (name, avatar, feedback etc.) that corresponds to the public key,"" Malmi said. ""You could use your Identifi web of trust to filter out spam, trolls and other kinds of unwanted content without resorting to centralized censorship. That is useful for decentralized social media.""  But to be truly decentralized, ERA needs people from around the world running the database systems – which is where the new crypto token comes in.  Reminiscent of older blockchain storage projects like Filecoin and Storj, ERA with AXE is supposed to incentivize users on the network to transmit data. But it takes a slightly different approach by paying servers to move encrypted data around (instead of paying them to store data).  Since the data is encrypted, the data won't be readable by the servers moving it around.  Practical decentralization  Although Malmi is about to head a new cryptocurrency project, he's still skeptical of the promise of blockchain tech as it's been advertised recently.  ""Blockchain technology is overhyped and pushed for applications where it is not useful,"" he said. ""If you don't need a distributed ledger with no trusted parties, you don't need a blockchain.""  Yet, he thinks ERA is going about incorporating cryptocurrency into a decentralized web in the ""right"" way. ""Crypto should be given credit for incentivizing the decentralization of infrastructure,"" Malmi continued.  Indeed, he and Nadal make a big deal about this tech being more ""scalable"" than other tech.  ""The missing piece [to a decentralized web] was a decentralized database that could handle CryptoKitties scale traffic,"" Nadal said, pointing to the blockchain-based cat app that earlier this year clogged the ethereum network to the point users were having trouble using other decentralized apps on the network.  To create that scalable system, ERA is only using its cryptocurrency as a decentralized money, and will not be using a blockchain to store people's data.  In this way, they argue they're on a better track to building something that people might actually want to use.  Though, admittedly, the apps built using GUN today are not nearly as large as the companies they hope to replace. Yet, they have big hopes the project will go beyond that, since like so many others in the industry they believe decentralization is the way of the future.  ""One of the things I learned is that it is better to do what is meaningful, not what is expedient,"" Malmi said, adding:  ""I believe that decentralization of digital identity and other basic infrastructure of our society are the some of the most meaningful things a developer can work on these days.""

DCEX, a San Francisco-based marketplace, formally opened registration for its platform, though clients will not be able to begin trading for a few more weeks. The exchange notably uses XRP as its ""base currency,"" meaning many of its trading pairs are denominated in the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, AlphaPoint CEO Salil Donde said in a blog post.  In its announcement, DCEX says it will be able to offer a total of 15 trading pairs, including XRP, bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, ethereum classic, vechain, zcash, and stable-coin TrueUSD. The exchange further says it will add neo and ADA, among other trading pairs within months. DCEX also offers access to all 10 coins listed in the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which include monero, EOS and dash.  The exchange is based on AlphaPoint's distributed ledger, the announcement said.  DCEX uses XRP as a base in order rapidly move funds with low transaction costs, Donde wrote. Specifically, the XRP ledger is designed for high execution speeds and settlement within a few seconds, which can provide an advantage for traders.  The news comes just a month and a half after AlphaPoint announced it had successfully raised $15 million in its first round of venture capital funding. The funds were raised primarily through Galaxy Digital, the cryptocurrency merchant bank launched by billionaire investor Mike Novogratz.
