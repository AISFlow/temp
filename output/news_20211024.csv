42411892,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwCl,1635101700,Want to Buy Dogecoin? Read This First,"With so much social media hype, mainstream attention and celebrity support it’s easy to think that dogecoin is a solid investment. But is the dog-themed cryptocurrency really as innocent as it looks?  Dogecoin has come a long way since its modest beginnings as a parody cryptocurrency based on a viral internet meme of a Shiba Inu “doge.” Back when it was just a pup in December 2013 the price of doge was $0.00055878 per coin, worlds away from its all-time high in May 2021 of $0.69 (123,383.30%).  A big part of the Dogecoin project's success can be attributed to its die-hard community of followers who, in the early days, helped the project take on an entirely new life of its own. This included expanding dogecoin's utility to a tipping cryptocurrency via third-party applications and using doge to support a range of charitable causes – some of which attracted mainstream media attention.  More recently, however, the reason dogecoin's popularity has skyrocketed is not because of any new utility or function, but because memes and irony have resonance in internet tribes. That goes double for the world of cryptocurrency, which lends itself to insider language and jokes. This culture has grown significantly and become more influential over the last year (see wallstreetbets). which naturally benefits dogecoin. It has even managed to attract high-profile celebrities who have amplified the spread and effects of this social phenomenon, including Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons and the person who has arguably has the strongest pull on dogecoin's leash, Tesla co-founder Elon Musk (aka the ""dogefather"").  But while all the meme-fueled hype and extravagant price activity are exciting, it's important to know that there are a number of underlying risks associated with owning dogecoin that every new investor should know before diving into this digital asset.  1. Dogecoin has an unlimited supply ...  In February 2014, Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer decided to completely remove the cryptocurrency’s supply cap, which previously stood at 100 billion coins, in a bid to encourage the use of the coin for tipping and dissuade people from holding it.  This means dogecoin has an inflationary supply and new coins are continuously pouring into the market. By contrast, bitcoin (BTC), the original and most valuable cryptocurrency, has a hard cap of 21 million units.  Why is dogecoin’s infinite supply an issue? Supply and demand are the two fundamental drivers for determining the fair market value of goods, services and assets. It’s generally accepted that assets in high demand and scarce supply are likely to rise in price, whereas assets in poor demand and high supply are likely to fall in value.  Dogecoin, however, is a bit of an anomaly. The demand for the coin is currently higher than the number of coins entering the market so the price is rising. Even with an infinite supply, if buyers continue to purchase coins at an equal to or higher rate than they’re entering the market, the price will continue to rise or reach an equilibrium level.  Big If. In order to sustain price levels, dogecoin buyers will need to continually purchase all coins being created because there is no scarcity to support the price.  Think of it as shoveling snow off your driveway in a never-ending blizzard. Yes, you could argue, if everyone on the street helped out you could keep it clear but it’s likely the snow will eventually win.  2. ... and it gets bigger every day  At the current mining rate, 10,000 new dogecoins are released in block rewards every minute. That works out to roughly 14.4 million new dogecoins entering circulation every single day, or 5.2 billion per year.  These block rewards are fixed, meaning no more or no less than 10,000 dogecoins will be awarded to miners every minute. The only thing that will change over time is mining difficulty, which for dogecoin adjusts after every block. Difficulty rises and falls depending on how many miners are competing to discover new blocks at any given time.  Right now, dogecoin mining difficulty is climbing toward a two-year high as a result of increasing prices, which, in turn, is pushing DOGE mining profitability to record highs and attracting more miners to the network.  3. Dogecoin also lacks technical development  In 2015, Palmer walked away from Dogecoin, frustrated by the “toxic” crypto industry at the time, which he felt was becoming increasingly “like a bunch of white libertarian bros sitting around hoping to get rich and coming up with half-baked, buzzword-filled business ideas which often fail in an effort to try and do so.”  The meme-based cryptocurrency was left in the hands of a few community developers to continue where Palmer left off. However, little has been done with the code over the last six years. Prior to the recent Dogecoin Core 1.14.3 release on Feb. 28, the last major development was posted on Nov. 8, 2019. There was also a notable gap between Nov. 10, 2015, and Feb. 4, 2018, where no updates were published at all. For perspective, the Bitcoin network’s code is updated almost every day.  Dogecoin developers argue there’s little reason to post regular releases. “It has been running stable, and the rules of the network have not changed since in a way that would put it at risk,” said Maximilian Keller, one of the community developers. “The Dogecoin network does not necessarily have the same challenges as Bitcoin, so it’s less of a pressing issue for us"" to update regularly.  Nevertheless, one might expect a project that now has a market cap exceeding $50 billion (bigger than Ford’s) and a community fund that currently holds 23,532,879 coins ($9.1 million at current prices) to begin issuing more frequent code updates, even if it is still a joke cryptocurrency.  4. 10 wallets hold 44% of all dogecoin  According to data, almost half of all dogecoins in circulation are held in a handful of crypto wallet addresses, with the largest wallet accounting for 28% of the supply. Why is this a problem? Well, it means that at any given time one of these whales could exit out the market and send doge prices tanking. Not to mention, they could easily use their huge positions to manipulate the market via stop-loss hunting, creating buy and sell walls or employing other trading strategies to artificially raise or lower the price. This leaves every other dogecoin investor at the mercy of their trading activities.  See also: Dogecoin Is Not the Next Bitcoin – But Here Are the Similarities  Despite these clear downsides, dogecoin may well continue to ride high for a time on social media hype, celebrity endorsement and rapidly breeding meme culture. (Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal gleefully noted recently that, if you factor in the recent rally, doge has outperformed BTC over seven years.)

42410958,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtk63,1635090600,"As the CME’s Volume Gets Pumped, the Bitcoin ETF’s Quirky Structure Could Explain Some of It","Last week’s launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was a smash hit by any measure. Yet, it may be that at least part of its success could be the result of how the instrument is structured rather than pure demand from buyers hoping for bitcoin exposure.  In just a few hours, the futures-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) amassed $570 million in assets under management (AUM), making it one of the most successful debuts of an ETF in history. Within a few more hours, that number just about doubled.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  BITO’s assets are mostly invested on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which saw an expected increase in both open interest and volume for bitcoin futures. One question is whether some of that volume could be the result of traders positioning for profit from the way this particular ETF is structured.  Currently, for every dollar it takes in, ProShares allocates 40.2% to buying CME bitcoin futures contracts that settle in October and 31.2% for futures that settle in November. The remaining 28% or so is put in U.S. Treasury bills. Reminder: On the CME, bitcoin futures are settled in cash, meaning no actual bitcoin changes hands. It’s basically a side bet on the price of the asset.  So if by Wednesday there were $1.108 billion in AUM, $791 million of it was bitcoin futures on the CME. That’s the equivalent of 13.8% of the CME’s bitcoin open interest of $5.745 billion.  From Monday to Wednesday, open interest soared to $5.745 billion from $4 billion, an increase that was more than double the ProShares ETF’s holdings.  Meanwhile, volume was up, too, to levels never seen before on bitcoin futures: Tuesday saw $5.9 billion in futures change hands on the CME, and Wednesday’s figure was north of $7.5 billion. In the 19 trading days prior, the average was $2.5 billion per day.  Higher volumes? Higher interest? Why, of course that’s bullish, right? Perhaps, but maybe not 100%.  Here’s where it gets interesting.  Creation and redemption  BITO isn’t structured like a typical stock ETF. Rather, some of its features are more likely to be found in ETFs that own bonds and other types of financial instruments.  With a lot of stock ETFs, “authorized participants” (AP for short) accumulate and deliver a basket of shares to the ETF provider in exchange for shares in the ETF in a rather Biblical-sounding process called “creation.” APs aren’t average Joes, however. They are institutions and the like that can do this sort of thing in bulk and have the sort of relationships that allow such a trade to take place.  The APs do this kind of a trade if the value of the ETFs they get in return (which they then can sell in the market) is significantly higher than the stocks they deliver. And by “significantly higher” we’re talking just 1%. That may not sound like a lot for a retail trader hoping to win big on something she saw on Reddit, but for institutions that do trades in the millions, this starts to add up to real money.  If this sort of trade is done enough times, the price of the underlying basket of stocks will rise as they get bought up and the price of the ETF shares will fall as they get sold until the prices of the two converge.  The also-Biblical-sounding “redemption” process is the reverse of the creation process, where APs get a basket of shares in exchange for redeeming their ETF shares to the provider. (ETF.com hasa nice little primer on all of this, if you’re so inclined.)  BITO, though, does something similar to bond ETFs called “cash creation,” meaning the AP delivers cash rather than the underlying asset to the ETF provider in exchange for shares.  That could make for some quirky movements in the market, as noted in a Twitter thread by Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research for news and data sites ETF Trends and ETF Database.  Pump up the volume  If BITO were to trade well above fair value during a hot trading day – say, the day of a long-anticipated premiere for an SEC-regulated bitcoin ETF – an AP could sell shares of the ETF “naked,” effectively short without borrowing (the minimum size the AP can create is 10,000 shares or about $4 million-worth as of Thursday). Simultaneously, the AP could offset much of that risk by buying futures on the CME or even some other bitcoin-related asset (bitcoin itself or shares of MicroStrategy or whatever).  At the end of the trading day, the AP would give cash to the ETF provider (in this case, ProShares) in exchange for shares of BITO. ProShares then would take the money and buy futures contracts on the CME because that’s what it’s supposed to do when an AP gives it cash. At the same time, the AP would most probably (though it’s not a given) unwind that hedge taken in other bitcoin assets when it initiated the short earlier in the day.  Again, should this trade get done by more than a few APs, prices of BITO and bitcoin futures would theoretically start to converge, though up to a point. The maximum amount of October bitcoin contracts an entity can hold is 2,000 and up to 5,000 total for all expiries; each contract holds five bitcoin. (BITO is now just about at those limits and the CME is set to increase those limits.)  All this could do a funny thing to volume, though. “AP activity will show up in underlying [CME contracts] twice,” tweeted Nadig. “One quick hedging round trip, followed by one long position until roll/redemption.”  As it turns out, the ratio of volume to open interest in CME bitcoin futures averaged 1.3x Tuesday and Wednesday compared to a 1.0x over the previous 19 days. Thus, open interest those two days averaged $5.3 billion but volume averaged $6.7 billion.  That’s not saying $2.8 billion in above-average volume was necessarily the result of APs seeking out arbitrage opportunities. Indeed, Nadig, speaking to CoinDesk, made it clear that he didn’t know if it happened at all.  Nonetheless, the outsized spike in volume relative to open interest indicates that traders were doing at least some amount of flipping.  Thus, when looking at data price and volume data, it helps to remember that sometimes how an instrument is structured can explain some of it.  In the end, if one wants to own bitcoin, the purest play is buying bitcoin itself. Everything else comes with its own idiosyncrasies.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/24/as-the-cmes-volume-gets-pumped-the-bitcoin-etfs-quirky-structure-could-explain-some-of-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1f2e2b4ceffc724394ad112d64f22ece13a7b75-3888x2592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices for the meme token have risen by nearly 50% in the past 24 hours, extending the month-to-date gain to almost 500%.  SHIB’s latest leg higher from $0.0000270 comes amid rumors that online brokerage platform Robinhood may soon list the cryptocurrency. Prices surged over 200% in the month’s first week on the back of increased buying by whales or large investors.

The last SHIB pump observed in early May also came after bitcoin’s ascent to its then record high of $64,888 reached on April 14 and had pundits warning of excessive speculation by retail investors and potential for market-wide correction. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market crashed hard in the latter half of that month.  While SHIB has gone ballistic this month, DOGE has gained just 27% and still trades well below its August high of $0.35. DOGE hit a peak price of over $0.73 in early May.  Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, has chalked up a 37% rally this month on increased evidence of inflation and expectations that the recently launched futures-based exchange-traded funds would bring more mainstream money into the crypto market.

42376287,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4NZ,1635076800,What CBDCs Mean for the Future of DeFi and Stablecoins,"Over the last year, the narrative surrounding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has advanced considerably. From an almost entirely conceptual discussion, CBDCs are now in various stages of research and development to ascertain how they could work in practice.  China’s digital yuan is currently leading the pack. Following several pilots, the Chinese government is expected to roll out its CBDC to a population of over a billion people in 2022. While no other country has yet reached the same stage of CBDC development, there has been surprisingly rapid progress. Recently, G7 finance heads met and reached a consensus over some defining principles for CBDCs. But outside China, some of the most significant results have also been emerging from Asian countries.  Charles d’Haussy is a managing director at ConsenSys based in Hong Kong. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  The efforts of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and its collaborative endeavors are of particular note. Since 2017, the HKMA has been investigating the idea of a CBDC. In the first instance, dubbed Project LionRock, it researched the concept of a so-called “wholesale” CBDC, a digital currency for settlement between banks.  By 2019, it had joined forces with the Bank of Thailand to study CBDCs for cross-border payment. After the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) became involved, the collaboration entered a new phase to develop a multiple CBDC bridge, dubbed mBridge.  However, the newest development is the one that could have the biggest impact on the status quo. In particular, CBDCs are an existential threat for permissionless finance to which crypto has grown accustomed.  An invitation to consult on a retail CBDC  In early October, the HKMA published a CBDC white paper, calling for input regarding the prospect of an electronic Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) from experts in monetary policy, banking and distributed ledger technology.  The paper poses many questions, such as how monetary responsibility will be divided between central banks and the financial sector. But for those of us in the blockchain and cryptocurrency community, there’s plenty more to chew on.  Read more: Hong Kong Monetary Authority Releases CBDC White Paper to Study Prospect of e-HKD  While the paper is agnostic regarding the technological infrastructure needed for a CBDC, it invites consultation on seven “problem statements.” They are privacy, interoperability, scalability and performance, cybersecurity, compliance, operational robustness and resilience, and the technology-enabled functional capabilities offered by a retail CBDC.  A familiar set of conundrums  Any enterprise or organization that has considered implementing blockchain or decentralized ledger technology has been faced with some or all of these questions. Ultimately, they come down to this: Do the benefits of a permissionless, open and decentralized public network such as Ethereum outweigh the drawbacks? Or would a permissioned implementation be a better option?  In the context of CBDCs, there are far-reaching implications in deciding between permissioned and permissionless ledgers. Providing an adequate solution to one of the problem statements inevitably creates issues in another.  For instance, we could make a safe assumption that a central bank wouldn’t want a CBDC to offer the same level of pseudonymity as a cryptocurrency like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and would seize on an opportunity to build compliance-based measures into the architecture. Requiring a user to undergo know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks to open an account is one obvious example.  But, in turn, introducing identity checks generates legitimate questions around government surveillance and user privacy, which need to be balanced against the need to accommodate financial law enforcement and prevent CBDCs from being used in criminal activity.  Strength in numbers  There’s a similar trade-off in balancing operational robustness and resilience with cybersecurity. Permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin have proven over many years that they are robust against attacks, thanks to the sheer size of their networks. The permissionless nature encourages participation and creates a highly resilient architecture that’s prohibitively expensive to attack.  However, from the CBDC perspective, there are drawbacks; most significantly, a lack of control over performance and scalability. The process of upgrading public blockchain networks can also be protracted, particularly where it requires consensus from a majority of participants in a decentralized network.  There are arguments for and against on-chain governance, but it seems unlikely a central bank would want to cede full governance control of national currency to a decentralized network, even if it could somehow verify that all of the network participants were honest and the span of control was limited.  Ultimately, it seems likely that a permissioned implementation of some description may prevail. However, central banks will need to solve privacy and security challenges without compromising on their need for compliance, control and performance.  An uneasy future for stablecoins  One aspect missing from the HKMA paper, and in fact, the CBDC debate in general, is the opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi emerged and evolved due to the specific features and advantages inherent in crypto; for instance, the ability to create programmable money with automated transactions governed by smart contracts. Traders can take advantage of arbitrage in the moment and settle payments of any value almost instantaneously, 24/7, from anywhere in the world. As such, CBDCs offer truly transformative potential to the broader global asset markets.  However, this raises many difficult questions about the future of stablecoins. As the value in crypto and DeFi markets has grown and institutional interest rises by the week, regulators have become increasingly vocal in urging caution. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission head Gary Gensler recently referred to stablecoins as “poker chips” and it seems as if some kind of legislation governing dollar-like digital equivalents could be a matter of time.  See also: Fed Reserve Governor Quarles Doesn’t See Reasoning Behind CBDCs  It’s a matter that’s becoming more prominent to lawyers, analysts and consultants from across the spectrum of crypto, finance and technology. McKinsey recently issued its own view on the situation, stating that although regulated stablecoins could co-exist with CBDCs, it’s equally plausible that one will prevail over the other.  An unfair advantage?  It’s worth noting that CBDCs have two distinct advantages over stablecoins from the outset. Firstly, as outlined previously, CBDCs offer the ability to embed compliance and digital identity features from the outset. In contrast, stablecoins such as tether (USDT), issued across multiple blockchains, operate within the confines of the platform rules.  In its current format, Tether couldn’t unilaterally insist on KYC checks to use USDT. However, such a feature would lower the compliance burden and cost to financial institutions, which can swallow up to 5% of banking revenues.  Secondly, CBDCs could also automate the collection and distribution of taxes, reducing another headache for banks. In many jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, banks withhold tax from some transactions, such as those for foreign residents, at the source. In all countries, banks are compelled to comply with disclosure orders from the authorities in cases of tax evasion.  In light of these advantages, given a choice between CBDCs and regulated stablecoins, CBDCs would be a no-brainer for virtually all financial institutions.  The many dilemmas involved in launching a retail CBDC mean that it could still be several years before the true impact is clear. However, it’s already apparent that CBDCs will bring substantial opportunities for the financial system but could ultimately represent an existential threat to stablecoins and the current DeFi landscape.",NEUTRAL,USDT,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Charles d’Haussy,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/24/what-cbdcs-mean-for-the-future-of-defi-and-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0ecdbe785500694eb3479cd195f11e7355d9e0b-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376290,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4Q5,1635076800,How to Expand Blockchain Beyond Fintech and Into Factories,"Blockchain has already improved companies’ ability to track the movement of goods. But what if we use it to track how people experience work? That could unlock an entirely different perspective on global supply chain dynamics. It’s now easy to envision a more efficient future in logistics through emerging decentralized technologies that help improve procurement practices and enable businesses to increase transparency about where products were manufactured, how they were delivered and under what conditions.  Allison Price is a senior adviser to the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative at New America. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  There are potential upsides for businesses, workers and consumers. But it’s equally important to also weigh the challenges and potential impacts. A healthy balance must be struck between the creative dreamers envisioning a beautiful decentralized future and the question-asking pragmatists who are responsible for effectuating it safely. Thoughtful, inclusive debate is the key to forging a more equitable future supported by technology companies, governments and communities designing together.  Over the past two years, a coalition led by New America, Sustainability and Health Initiative for NetPositive Enterprise (SHINE) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, ConsenSys and the Levi Strauss Foundation have collaborated to develop a new approach to factory worker well-being assessments.  By integrating the SHINE Well-Being Survey into a secure blockchain platform that can be deployed in person or remotely, workers are empowered to safely share their workplace experiences. The minimum viable product (MVP), Survey Assure, aggregated survey responses from workers and protected them with the Ethereum blockchain creating an immutable record. The system used this protected aggregated data to create a visual presentation of survey results, which reflect the opinions of an entire factory workforce in close to real time.  This approach wasn’t your typical supply chain tracking pilot. The unvarnished nature of the anonymized survey data of factory workers in Poland and Mexico created tremendous potential for workers, business and human rights. It helped factory management better pinpoint where potential investments could improve worker experiences. These interventions and management’s subsequent actions have the potential to decrease turnover and absenteeism while improving sustainable and productive practices.  This solution couldn’t be more timely as organizations focus more on the health and well-being of workers in the coronavirus pandemic recovery era. And although we were meticulous in testing the concept safely and ethically, it will be far more difficult to do at scale.  This experimental pilot project was ambitious. Blockchain may be going more mainstream, but harnessing it for non-fintech applications is still nascent. We encountered challenges around costs, ease of use, data digitization and integration, engineering talent, literacy, reliable internet access, the lack of hardware needed to take a survey, and an unprecedented global pandemic that has disrupted not just supply chains but also workers’ lives.  See also: Blockchain Technology at Pivot Moment Mirrors Broadband, CMCC Global Says  But there is real and often unrealized value in identifying what complicates innovation. It allows us to explore where there is need for additional research, structure and investment. We learned a few lessons in civic tech development from our experiences that apply beyond the improvement of supply chains.  Invest in digital infrastructure. If high-bandwidth connectivity and accurate digitized records remain largely restricted to industrialized countries, the impact of blockchain technology will be significantly limited. Access to technology and data remains an issue. About 40% of the world’s population remains offline, according to Statista. Accurately converting physical data to digital form is expensive, time consuming and, most critically, must be done with care. If blockchain is to achieve its full potential as an open, democratic technology, public- and private-sector investment in interoperable but protected data is a core need in both developing and developed countries.  Develop safe and effective identity solutions. Blockchain-based platforms require an integrated identity management solution to authenticate users and maintain accountability. By providing a verifiable identity, many of the services governments and nonprofits provide, including aid distribution, land titling and financial services, could become more accessible and manageable. If developing identity solutions was simple, it would have been done by now. The development of a secure proof-of-identity that integrates with emerging systems and protects the end user could transform the lives of the one billion people worldwide without a legal identity.  Nurture inclusive technical talent and field building. Analogous to the field of computer science a generation ago, only a few programmers and tech firms understand blockchain technology, and they concentrate on applications that are immediately profitable. As the field grows, cross-sector blockchain projects, including those that are in the public interest, would benefit from public-private sector partnerships, fellowship programs, academia and open civic hackathons. Blockchain technology must attract new leaders who see that it has the potential to offer solutions to today’s toughest, most intractable challenges.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Allison Price,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/23/how-to-expand-blockchain-beyond-fintech-and-into-factories,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30bf2064dfcfe05402fcaf76df75fa59c7b83cc1-2400x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
