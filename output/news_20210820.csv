It is very important when it comes to holding to make sure that one&apos;s keys are secure. This is because once the keys are lost, there is no way to recover the lost coins. That is how secure the Bitcoin network is. This is the case of a South African man who had accidentally deleted the keys to his wallet that contained 20 BTC. A report from MyBroadband follows the story of 24-year-old Mark Michaels (name changed), an electronic engineer from Pretoria, South Africa, who had lost the key to his wallet which had 20 bitcoins in it. Michaels had mined the BTC 10 years ago when he was still a minor and at that point, BTC wasn&apos;t worth very much. Related Reading | Do COVID-19 Cases Work As A Bitcoin Trading Signal?

The fund got an initial go-ahead to chase bitcoin and ether exposure through derivative products on Aug. 11. Ether now appears to be off the table; Friday's bitcoin-only filing said it ""replaces"" the original.  While certain ETFs are now on the fund's whitelist, it still cannot invest directly in digital assets – likely because of regulatory concerns.

At the time of writing, BTC trades at $48,412 with a 3.8% profit. After weeks in the green, the general sentiment in the crypto market has flipped decisively bullish as sellers seem exhausted and unable to continue their assault. Director of Global Macroeconomics for investment firm Fidelity Jurrier Timmer believes Bitcoin could retake previous highs and go back to price discovery. In a thread published via Twitter, Timmer compared BTC&apos;s price at different historical moments. As seen below, Bitcoin&apos;s current price action is &apos;similar&apos; to the distribution phase experience during February and April. At that moment, BTC&apos;s price seemed stuck but finally moved to the upside. Timmer said: With the latest rally, bitcoin&apos;s market cap is closing in on the old highs. If we add in the rest of the crypto space, we have reclaimed a market cap of $2 trillion. This is no longer a sideshow, folks. Many experts believe the macro-economic environment has favored Bitcoin, gold, and risk assets capable of generating yield for investors. In that sense, Timmer compared BTC&apos;s performance with gold in 1970. As seen below, the cryptocurrency and the precious metal behaved similarly. Although the expert clarified that this prediction is &apos;highly subjective&apos;, it could be an indication of future appreciation as BTC takes over gold&apos;s market share.

The decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) bandwidth marketplace, which supports the Sentinel dVPN application, said the theft resulted from HitBTC exposing its mnemonic phrase, a group of words that are designed to help recover a digital wallet or cryptocurrency.  “This is completely out of our control, HitBTC had delayed the distribution of funds to users and compromised their own mnemonic,” Sentinel wrote in its tweet.  In a comment to CoinDesk, Sentinel’s Srinivas Baride, called the exposure “gross negligence” and said he hoped HitBTC refunds its users and reassesses its management of user funds.  In an email, HitBTC said it “always” does token swaps “according to our guidelines and on newly installed machines,” to prevent breaches, noting that “since day 1 we have had the highest standards in place for security.”  Sentinel Network allows anyone to be able to sell their bandwidth on its marketplace.

42376439,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZcz,1629490818,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies Ahead of $50K Resistance,"Cryptocurrencies are ending the week on a strong note as bitcoin broke above $48,000 for the first time since May. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is up about 4% over the past 24 hours and could face resistance near $50,000-$55,000 heading into the weekend.      On Thursday, Coinbase announced that it will purchase more than $500 million in cryptocurrencies to add to its holdings. The crypto exchange’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, also tweeted that Coinbase will invest 10% ""of all profit going forward in crypto.""      The Coinbase announcement encouraged bitcoin buyers to return at the $45,000 support level. Bitcoin’s price jump also coincided with stabilization in equity markets after a pullback earlier this week.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $48,634, +4.1%  Ether (ETH) $3,248. +4.2%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4441.7, +0.81%  Gold: $1782.5, +0.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.259%, compared with 1.245% on Thursday.    Several analysts noted that extreme overbought conditions have unwound since April, which is providing support for the crypto rally.      “Right now, bitcoin and other cryptos have enjoyed technical support (as they were becoming mildly oversold),” Santiago Espinosa, a strategist at MRB Partners, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      “At this juncture, some cryptos can continue to do well if policymakers neglect inflationary pressures and regulatory issues don’t become a mainstream problem,” Espinosa wrote.    Bitcoin correlations    Bitcoin’s negative correlation with gold intensified over the past few months as inflation expectations eased. Gold is down roughly 6% year to date, compared with a 65% gain in bitcoin over the same period.      The correlation between bitcoin and the iShares long-duration Treasury bond exchange-traded fund (TLT) briefly turned positive in July as the crypto selloff stabilized. Lately, bitcoin’s relief rally has coincided with a pickup in the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which stalled near the 1.40% resistance level.    Growing futures volume    The growth in bitcoin futures volume relative to spot volume could reflect greater participation from sophisticated traders. “Over the last year, futures and perpetual swaps have become the most popular financial instruments in crypto,” tweeted Delphi Digital. Futures and perpetual futures account for over 60% of total daily bitcoin volume.      Perpetuals are gaining ground relative to spot market activity and are quickly becoming the prime source of price discovery, according to Delphi.      Bitcoin perpetual swaps are a type of derivative in cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets.      Delphi also noticed a similar trend in ether, although spot markets still play a larger role than futures markets with that crypto.    Miner positioning    The bitcoin miners’ positioning index (MPI) has flattened over the past two weeks. The MPI tracks whether miners are shifting their BTC positions higher or lower.      The sideways movement in MPI suggests that “profit-taking by miners is clearly slowing along with the stagnation of the price increase,” CryptoQuant wrote in a Friday blog post.      CryptoQuant expects a downward price adjustment in BTC before a decisive move above the $50,000 price level. A breakout in price could encourage miners to build positions.    Altcoin roundup  Cardano hits all-time high: Cardano (ADA), the native cryptocurrency powering the Cardano public blockchain, has hit a fresh all-time high and has surpassed Binance’s native token in total market capitalization, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports. It would appear the Alonzo upgrade is having a significant impact on investor sentiment. The upgrade seeks to usher in smart-contract functionality and address what critics have described as one of the network’s most glaring deficiencies.  Solana’s Luna Yield goes dark: Decentralized finance protocol Luna Yield has gone offline. Luna’s website and all of its social media accounts have been taken down, according to SolPad, an initial digital offering (IDO) platform for the Solana blockchain. Some are attributing the move offline to a rug pull. A rug pull occurs when the creators of a project take off with investors’ funds. While no official confirmation has been given, the move would mark the first rug pull of its kind on Solana. An anonymous source told CoinDesk over $6.7 million in assets had been taken. The amount has been verified by CoinDesk via the SOL scan block explorer.  OKEx establishes $10 million fund for GameFi projects: Crypto exchange OKEx said it is launching a $10 million fund to help develop GameFi, or “play-to-earn,” projects. The cash will come from the exchange's $100 million OKEx BlockDream Ventures fund, which invests in blockchain projects, the company said.

Recently the hosts of the &apos;Toxic&apos; podcast Tess Barker and Barbara Gray who have been investigating the conservatorship case have come up with a claim that the popstar had used Bitcoin right in 2014 based on information and materials they have gathered. They allege that the singer was forced to use the cryptocurrency so that she could hide even small expenses from her father and conservator Jamie Spears.

The award winning pop icon had disclosed that she was &apos;afraid&apos; of her father and her entire family had literally &apos;ruined&apos; her life. During this long nightmare of abuses by her father and family, she was supposedly put on lithium against her will, she was forced to perform and was denied the right to have more children.

42376433,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZVR,1629486750,OnlyFans Stops Sex Acts and Politicizes Payments,"Yesterday, OnlyFans, an online subscription platform primarily used by performers selling adult sexual content, announced it won’t be doing that anymore. Starting on Oct. 1, OnlyFans will prohibit any graphic pornographic material, though it will continue to allow nudity.      The decision seems insane on the face of it: OnlyFans is unilaterally turning its back on a business that has helped it grow immensely and rapidly. The company’s financials are apparently bananas, with a company pitch deck from March projecting $1.2 billion in net revenue for 2021.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insight Columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    That could have made tiny OnlyFans more profitable than Tesla, but those numbers are out the window now. Though nominally the platform is “pivoting” towards non-sex content like cooking lessons, yesterday’s announcement almost certainly amounts to simply abandoning a giant, cash-spewing firehose.      They’re also screwing (pun intended) a lot of sex workers: In a statement, the Adult Performance Artists Guild said that “most content creators on Onlyfans are … adult performers who make their entire living off of the platform.” The Guild predicted the change would cause a “crisis” of “financial despair and destruction.”      The explanation for this bizarre behavior turns out to be both fairly simple and deeply disturbing. As OnlyFans spelled out in a statement to the media, “These changes are to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers.”      One of these, according to the Daily Beast, is Mastercard, which announced in April that it would impose and police content moderation policies for any adult businesses it serviced – with an implied threat to cut off those that didn’t or couldn’t comply. Banks and processors see risk because “the pornography industry is high risk for money laundering, human exploitation and illicit activities,” as one Suspicious Activity Report unearthed by Forensic News put it.      OnlyFans has also struggled to attract outside investment despite its big profits, due in part to venture capital policies barring investment in the adult industry out of fear of liability. But the looming threat of a payments cutoff is likely just as big a headwind to the OnlyFans pitch.      This isn’t a new or isolated phenomena. Pornhub has been dropped by Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. Individual adult performers have had their bank accounts closed thanks to a pressure campaign by the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2018, Patreon cracked down on adult content partly under pressure from credit card processors. In fact, a big reason OnlyFans has grown was that it was one of the few places online where performers could still get paid through conventional channels.      Now, to take a step back, there are some good reasons to wish OnlyFans didn’t exist, or at least to be very nervous about it. It has been a powerful tool for a large number of professional sex workers, but it does genuinely create risks, particularly for more marginalized users. Just as Facebook and YouTube have struggled to police harmful, abusive or false content, OnlyFans would likely have faced a daunting task in detecting and preventing human trafficking and child sexual abuse on its platform. Above all, it would seem very difficult to figure out if someone is being coerced to perform.      (Facebook, for the record, is far more widely used for sharing child sexual material than any porn site.)      But even if you’re deeply worried about this, that this shutdown is being forced by banks and credit card companies should be nothing to celebrate. Adult content, after all, is protected by the Constitution of the United States, where both Visa and Mastercard are headquartered. In withdrawing their services, they’re essentially acting as censors, without any democratic, legislative or judicial due process.      I use the word “censor” advisedly here, because this isn’t a unilateral decision by the banks: Along with anti-porn pressure groups, the U.S. government itself has helped coerce banks to adopt anti-porn policies. The clearest evidence we have of this is an Obama-era Department of Justice program called “Operation Choke Point” that pressured banks to drop clients in industries from porn to payday lending to firearms.      Bankers, to their credit, didn’t go along with this entirely quietly. The program, according to critics in the financial industry, forced bankers to act like judges and put disproportionate strain on smaller banks with fewer compliance staff. The program was formally ended in 2017 (presumably mostly thanks to the Trump administration’s deep ties to the payday lending industry), but it seems to have convinced banks that the risk of future similar actions is still live.      This politicization of the payments system seems likely to get increasingly heavy-handed, simply because it’s a lever that’s easy for the government to pull. It’s right there on the tin: The banks and processors are a single, easily pressured “choke point” with massive potential to influence the practices of, well, pretty much anyone the government lays its eyes on.    Pornhub, believe it or not, offers <a href=""/price/tether"" data-for=""autolink"" data-tip=""USDT"">tether</a> on Tron as a payout method for its contributors    That reality has helped make cryptocurrency an attractive alternative for some adult businesses. Pornhub, believe it or not, offers tether on Tron as a payout method for its contributors. More broadly, the politicization of the payments system drives home the absolute social necessity of a neutral and ungoverned payments layer, such as cryptocurrency, as the digital world grows in importance.      It’s a well-worn argument, but one that bears repeating: Even if you happen to agree with agendas like limiting porn or guns or extortionate payday loans, you must consider the end game of banking censorship. The same expedient logic that makes choking out porn platforms seem sensible could, in even more malicious hands, be applied to abortion providers or political dissidents or any number of even more obviously Orwellian targets.      A final bitter pill is that OnlyFans is almost certainly doomed to fail in its shift away from sex. It may find takers for subscription cooking lessons and home decorating tips, but it will be a much smaller and less profitable business. The obvious parallel here is to Tumblr, a pioneering social image site whose users shared a lot of porn as part of a larger subversive culture, but banned porn after being acquired by Yahoo! Predictably enough, Tumblr became a ghost town.      Investors almost certainly know the story of Tumblr, and exactly which direction OnlyFans’ revenue is going to be heading. So now they’ll have an entirely different reason not to invest.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | USDT,David Z.

13223022,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=469740,1629486035,These Ethereum Indicators Show Whales Continue To Accumulate,"According to on-chain analysis, some Ethereum indicators are showing signals that whales are continuing to accumulate the cryptocurrency. Ethereum Shows Negative Netflows As Exchange Reserves Continue The Downtrend As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, ETH indicators seem to be moving in directions that suggest whales are continuing to accumulate. There are three important metrics to consider here: the all exchanges netflow, the all the exchanges reserve, and the unique Ethereum 2.0 depositors count. The all exchanges netflow is an indicator that shows the net amount of ETH entering or exiting centralized exchanges. When the metric has a negative value, it means more coins are being transferred out of exchanges to personal wallets than the crypto entering in. Such a value could indicate a buying pressure in the market as more investors are interested in hodling or OTC deals. A positive value suggests just the opposite; exchanges are receiving more Ethereum than the amount moving outwards, and thus there could be a selling pressure in the market. Here is how the ETH all exchanges netflow chart looks like: Ethereum continues to observe negative netflows As the above graph shows, the indicator has been showing negative spikes for the cryptocurrency recently. Negative netflows are usually associated with an increase in the price, like the uptrend the crypto is experiencing right now.

The SEC said that Jeppesen acted as a liaison between Bitconnect’s leadership and promoters and appeared at conferences and promotional events to represent Bitconnect. He must pay over $3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. He must also pay a $150,000 penalty and hand over a bitcoin wallet to “satisfy his obligation” to pay back 190 bitcoins.

42424804,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWgJh,1629476792,Money Reimagined: Afghan Activist Roya Mahboob on Crypto,"The naive “bitcoin fixes this” attitude of starry-eyed bitcoiners can be quite harmful when it comes to public acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Talking about the technology as a magical panacea for the world’s most deeply entrenched problems makes it harder for outsiders to accept more reasonable arguments in its favor.      So as I launch this week’s newsletter with a column addressing how crypto can help the women of Afghanistan in a struggle against male oppression that has suddenly become horrifyingly more intense, I’m wary of overstating my case. Still, I ask you to hear me out. A unique opportunity looms for crypto to be genuinely useful in Afghanistan.      For this week’s podcast, we move two countries to the east of Afghanistan to discuss the Indian government’s controversial biometric digital identity system, known as Adhaar. Sheila Warren and I talk with renowned Indian privacy activist Usha Ramanathan, who has spent years fighting the centralized Aadhar system and who happens to be Sheila’s aunt. We are also joined by another articulate voice for digital privacy, Marta Belcher, general counsel of Protocol Labs, chairwoman of the Filecoin Foundation and special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.      Have a listen to this impassioned discussion after reading the column. I can honestly say it was one of our best.    After Afghanistan’s tragedy, a role for crypto    When Paul Vigna and I wrote “The Age of Cryptocurrency” seven years ago, its opening lines featured a tale of how the blogging platform The Film Annex had contracted some teenage women attending a digital education school in the Afghan city of Herat and was paying them in bitcoin.       Given the past week’s heart-wrenching images from Afghanistan, the story is a reminder that cryptocurrency, while no guarantee of freedom, can be an aid in the pursuit of freedom. It’s a tool for bypassing oppressive power structures and can play a small but constructive role in helping Afghan women in their religious, cultural and political struggles.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The school was part of a program led by Afghan tech entrepreneur and activist Roya Mahboob, who in 2013 had made Time Magazine’s list of the world’s 100 most influential people – at the age of 25. The Film Annex’s New York-based founder, Francesco Rulli, realized he couldn’t pay Mahboob’s students for their blogs via the legacy international financial system. In Afghanistan’s patriarchal society, a woman’s access to a bank account typically required the intermediation of a man – a father, perhaps, or a brother. So, Rulli set up bitcoin addresses for them and paid them that way.      We opened the book with that story because it seemed like a good way to highlight bitcoin’s liberating capacity to disintermediate exchanges of value between people. Banks aren’t the only intermediaries it can disrupt; it goes for anyone who exploits the existing centralized system’s dependence on trusted third parties to place themselves between the payer and the payee. In this case, the power it challenged arose from Afghanistan’s sexist socio-political context.      The Film Annex (later renamed BitLanders) was eventually disbanded, but the women’s empowerment project it helped spur went on to make waves.      Tapping her student body, Mahboob formed a team of teenage Afghan girls to compete in a U.S. robotics competition in July 2017. After they were denied visas, prompting an outcry and a congressional petition that led President Trump to intervene and clear them for the visit, they finally entered the event and won a silver medal as part of a courageous achievement award. Four months later, the same team won first prize in a competition in Estonia for a solar-powered robot that can assist poor farmers in the field. The funding for that effort was in part paid for with a bitcoin award that Mahboob had earned earlier that year at the annual Blockchain Summit on Necker Island, which is in the British Virgin Islands.      Fast forward to August 2021. Amid the Taliban’s rapid takeover of their country, fears quickly grew over the fate of the robotics team. The good news, Mahboob told me, is that after an international scramble to save them, 11 of the team had managed by Thursday to get out safely to Qatar, whose government supplied the plane to evacuate them.      Even so, with college-educated women burning their diplomas out of fear of attack from the Taliban, there are hundreds of thousands in danger. Dozens of Mahboob’s staff and educational mentors have abandoned everything they own, she said, and are trying to get access to limited seats on evacuation planes. Even if their names are added to the approved list, they still need to run the gauntlet of Taliban checkpoints seeking to block people from reaching the U.S.-controlled Kabul airport.    A role for bitcoin or stablecoins, or both?    Bitcoin does not fix this.      Still, at this moment, “Bitcoin could play a very important role,” says Mahboob.      Why? Because the imminent failure of the legacy money system is about to create a vacuum of necessity. That’s something bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins are well qualified to fill.      Many bank offices have shut down. Those that are open are seeing long lines of people trying to withdraw cash while there are reports that some branches – and their cash holdings – have been seized by Taliban insurgents. There’s also speculation that the new regime will invalidate the ousted government’s bank notes and replace the money with their own, destroying people’s wealth in the process.      People need money to carry on with their lives or to fund their escape. Foreign donors are eager to get to them, but can’t do so via the banking system. In this context, transferring funds directly to a person’s bitcoin wallet seems like a no-brainer.      If Afghans must embark on an arduous and dangerous escape, at least with cryptocurrency they would have a better way to transfer whatever wealth they have across borders. In decades past, refugees from war-torn areas would deal with this problem by sewing pieces of gold into the hems of their clothes, running the risk of having them stolen by common thieves or corrupt officials. Now, they can simply load up a bitcoin address that’s personally accessible anywhere in the world.      That these options are now even possible in Afghanistan is due in no small part to the phenomenal work of Mahboob, who dedicated a decade to building digital literacy and computer education among women, laying a knowledge foundation upon which bitcoin can now be deployed to bypass the failing legacy system.      “This is why we’ve been working in high schools all these years,” she told me Thursday night. “If young people can learn about computers, they can learn about bitcoin. And now everybody wants to learn how to access bitcoin. They need to.”      (If you’d like to donate to the cause, here’s a link to Mahboob’s Digital Citizen Fund, which is set up to accept crypto.)    It cuts both ways    Remember this, though: Bitcoin is apolitical and amoral. It doesn’t care who gets the funds.      That’s relevant because guess who else would be especially interested in using bitcoin for payments and storing wealth? The Taliban.      The U.S. moved quickly this week to block the militants’ access to $7 billion in Afghan central bank reserves on account at the Federal Reserve and is preventing the International Monetary Fund from proceeding with a $400 million aid disbursement that Afghanistan was due to receive. Given the likely restrictions from other governments in Europe and by the Bank of International Settlements, the Taliban are all but cut off.      The former acting governor of the Afghan central bank, Ajmal Ahmady, estimates that the Taliban has access to no more than 0.1-0.2% of those reserves.      It’s another case of an intermediary preventing an entity from accessing what it believes to be its funds – only this time, the “victim” is an extremist regime with a violent, medieval approach to women.      Meanwhile, the Taliban is thought to derive much of its income from the illicit drug trade, with the amount of land cultivated for opium production reportedly growing to 554,000 acres from 405,000 in 2020. With all the foreign constraints on their fiat money movements, anonymously transferred bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) may be a convenient way to monetize this crop.    Lesser of two evils    For the U.S. and other Western policymakers, this would appear to present a quandary. Should they go easy on regulating bitcoin cross-border movements into Afghanistan to help desperate people escape, or should they block crypto funds to starve the Taliban?      The question could soon be moot. The so-called “travel rule” laid down by the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) of money regulators will make it increasingly difficult to move cryptocurrencies from regulated exchanges (say, in New York) to non-custodial wallets for which there is no ID information on the user. That could pose problems for Afghan women who can’t furnish IDs to meet crypto exchanges’ know-your-customer (KYC) needs.      Yet, the desperate situation could provide an excuse for more enlightened regulators to push for a more selective approach.      Using blockchain forensic tools provided by companies like Chainalysis, law enforcement should be able to monitor high-risk, non-custodial addresses the Taliban would use. But at the same time, they can instruct regulated providers to give a green light to transfers – either in bitcoin or in stablecoins – to addresses controlled by KYC-ed not-for-profit organizations even if they can’t identify the owners of the smaller, low-risk addresses to which the funds are ultimately disbursed.      If ever there were a moment to ease the flow of digital money, it’s this one.      “We are not giving up on Afghanistan,” said Mahboob. “These are very challenging, very difficult times, but we have to go down this route. Everyone deserves access to education, to technology, to digital currency. Everyone has a right to pursue their dreams.”    Off the Charts: Inactivity    After the doldrums of the late spring and early summer, the past month’s partial recovery in the bitcoin price has been welcomed by investors.       But many of them are still sitting on the sidelines. So says this chart on active addresses based on data from Glassnode.      The recent rise in the yellow line shows the recovery in the bitcoin price, which as of press time was at $48,343, its highest level in a month. But it hasn’t been met by a significant increase in active bitcoin addresses, which remain more or less around levels from the spring of 2020.      One explanation could be that the latest rally is being driven by the return of the “whales,” large accounts whose heavy expenditures have greater influence on price, while retail investors, who jumped on the bandwagon as bitcoin went from $10,000 in December to an all-time high of $64,888.99 in April, are for now disinterested. It remains to be seen whether those who lost money in the downturn in April and May are feeling once-bitten-twice-shy or whether they’re prepared to jump in if the gains start going hockey stick again.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael J.

42424800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWgBh,1629476782,Mineros de Ethereum hacen una apuesta multimillonaria por el retraso de las actualizaciones,"Las principales empresas de minería de bitcoin y los fabricantes de equipos mineros están aumentando sus inversiones en la minería de ethereum a pesar del inminente cambio de la segunda red a proof-of-stake (POS, por las siglas en inglés de prueba de participación).      Las empresas públicas de minería de bitcoin Hut 8 y Hive están aumentando sus capacidades para minar la segunda mayor criptomoneda por capitalización de mercado. Mientras tanto, fabricantes de equipamiento de minería, como Bitmain e Innosilicon, están preparados para lanzar nuevas máquinas de minería de ethereum a finales de este año.      Esta inversión puede parecer extraña, dado que se prevé que el sistema de Ethereum migre de proof-of-work (POW) —sistema de prueba de trabajo, en español— a POS en cinco meses, y debido a que la minería POS no requiere máquinas tan avanzadas. El aumento de la demanda podría atribuirse a las expectativas de que la migración se retrase, según profesionales del sector.    Read this article in English.    ""Nos dijeron que la minería iba a terminar hace cuatro años y todavía sigue"", dijo Mark D'Aria, director general de Bitpro, una empresa de consultoría con sede en Nueva York centrada en la intermediación y la gestión del hardware de minería de Ethereum. ""Siempre ha sido una cuestión de esperar y ver: las cosas tienden a tardar más de lo que todo el mundo espera"".      Mientras que el fork de Londres de comienzos de agosto lleva a la red un paso más cerca de Ethereum 2.0, las actualizaciones significativas a lo largo de los seis años de historia de Ethereum han tenido un historial de múltiples retrasos.      Por ejemplo, la actualización de Constantinopla —un paso clave hacia Ethereum 2.0— estaba originalmente programada para lanzarse ya en julio de 2018; sin embargo, un error en su código retrasó su despliegue hasta febrero de 2019, generando más tardanzas para la migración.    Congelación de la minería    La Propuesta de Mejora de Ethereum (EIP, por sus siglas en inglés) 3554 introdujo algo conocido como la “bomba de dificultad”, que añade mineros artificiales para aumentar la complejidad de la minería y provoca que estas operaciones sean menos rentables. Este periodo se ha denominado la ""Edad de Hielo"". Los desarrolladores de Ethereum presentaron inicialmente esta EIP en 2015, pero se ha pospuesto hasta diciembre de 2021.      A medida que el precio del ether aumenta, puede ser más difícil la transición de la red a proof-of-stake, dijo Ethan Vera, director de operaciones de la empresa minera Luxor, con sede en Seattle.      ""Hemos visto que el ether sube hasta los $3.000, las finanzas descentralizadas (DeFi) se construyen sobre la red y [los tokens no fungibles] han despegado"", dijo Vera. ""Incluso aquellos que son optimistas en la transición de Ethereum a POS todavía quieren ir despacio para asegurarse de que las cosas se estén haciendo correctamente y no haya ninguna duda potencial, trampas o puntos ciegos que los desarrolladores están pasando por alto.""      Además de los retos técnicos y los problemas de seguridad de los activos en Ethereum, la posible resistencia de la comunidad minera de esta red podría ser otro factor que ralentice la migración a POS.      ""Algo que no se ha valorado realmente es cuánta resistencia va a haber ante esa migración a proof-of-stake"", dijo D'Aria. ""Pensar que simplemente van a pulsar un interruptor y apagar miles de millones de dólares de mineros es una locura; eso no va a suceder"".    Actores institucionales    La minería de Ethereum tiene más individuos y menos mineros a gran escala que la de bitcoin.      El consumo de energía relativamente bajo en comparación con los mineros de bitcoin, combinado con las pequeñas cantidades de calor y ruido de los equipos de minería de ethereum, hace posible minar ETH en unidades de procesamiento gráfico (GPU) en casa, dijo Vera.      Más del 90% de las máquinas de minería de ethereum se basan en GPU, que también es un hardware común utilizado por gamers, dijo D'Aria.      Sin embargo, los pesos pesados de la minería de criptomonedas se están moviendo para irrumpir en el sector y obtener mayores beneficios que con la minería de bitcoin.      La empresa pública de minería de criptomonedas Hive Blockchain afirmó que se ha convertido en el mayor minero público de Ethereum del mundo con 3.383 gigahashes por segundo (GH/s), lo que suponía el 1,3% del hashrate total de la red Ethereum en ese momento, según un informe financiero de Hive del 15 de octubre de 2020.      La empresa con sede en Vancouver tiene como objetivo aumentar su hashrate de minería de Ethereum a 5.500 GH/s, lo que significaría un aumento de 62,5% en comparación con ese nivel para finales de este año. Hive adquirió en febrero un centro de datos de 50 megavatios (MW) en Canadá a One, un proveedor de servicios de colocación de centros de datos GPU.      Otra empresa pública de minería de criptomonedas, Hut 8, compró en mayo equipamiento minero especializado en Ethereum por $30 millones al fabricante de GPU Nvidia. La compañía dijo que se espera que todo eso sea entregado e instalado en sus instalaciones de Alberta a finales de agosto. Tiene previsto lograr un hashrate de 1.600 GH/s con un uso de energía de 4MW.    ""Esta transacción sirve para fortalecer el objetivo de Hut 8 de aumentar la diversificación de los ingresos y para impulsar los objetivos inmediatos de crecimiento de los ingresos a corto y largo plazo en el año fiscal 2021"", dijo la compañíahttps://hut8mining.com/faq-hut-8-expands-mining-capacity-with-30-million-usd-purchase-of-nvidia-cmps.    A diferencia de las empresas de minería de bitcoin como Marathon y Riot, las empresas como Hut 8 tienen un mandato de utilizar la energía varada o infrautilizada y convertirla en potencia de cálculo y recompensa, según Vera.      ""Creo que las empresas que están entrando en la minería de Ethereum ahora mismo, a estas alturas del juego, están mirando un panorama más amplio de cómo pueden capitalizar su poder informático"", dijo Vera, quien agregó: ""Cripto es un vertical de los muchos que perseguirían"".    Pagos más rápidos    Están llegando al mercado mineros de ethereum más potentes, que acortan el periodo de recuperación de la inversión en esas operaciones y aumentan los retornos.      Los mineros especializados en Ethereum, también llamados circuitos integrados de aplicación específica (ASIC, por sus siglás en inglés), son diseñados por fabricantes de mineros como Bitmain específicamente para la minería, mientras que la mayoría de los equipamientos de minería de GPU se fabrican reutilizando tarjetas gráficas originalmente usadas para juegos.      Nvidia presentó su primer equipamiento minero de ethereum a principios de 2021, mientras que Bitmain e Innosilicon tienen previsto entregar su último modelo para minar ethereum a finales de este año.      El fabricante de equipos mineros iPollo ha logrado más de $200 millones en ingresos por pedidos anticipados de su último modelo de ASIC para ethereum, el cual se entregará en el cuarto trimestre de 2021, dijo Paul Yao, vicepresidente del departamento de desarrollo de negocios globales en la compañía. Su objetivo es aumentar su producción cuando la empresa alcance una mayor capacidad y pueda fabricar equipos durante todo el año en 2022, según Yao.      La empresa, con sede en Singapur, establecerá una oficina en Estados Unidos el año que viene y cambiará su enfoque del mercado chino al norteamericano. ""Estamos viendo una demanda creciente en esa zona y en algunos de los mercados asiáticos"", dijo Yao.      ""Con un ROI (retorno de la inversión) de ASIC/GPU de cinco a seis meses, y siendo muy probable que ETH 2.0 esté a más de seis meses de distancia, puedo entender que la mayoría acepte el riesgo, especialmente con los precios que parecen fuertes"", dijo Azam Roslan, asociado de ventas senior en Wattum, una empresa de corretaje y gestión de equipos mineros de criptomonedas con sede en Nueva York.      Vera estimó que el periodo de recuperación de la inversión en minería de Ethereum podría ser tan corto como cuatro meses si los mineros utilizan la última generación de ASICs. ""En el caso de la minería de bitcoin, dependiendo del precio que se pague por las operaciones, las empresas públicas están considerando un plazo de un año para la recuperación de la inversión"", estimó Vera.      En comparación, algunas de las tarjetas GPU existentes para la minería de ethereum, como la tarjeta GPU 3070 producida por Nvidia, todavía necesitan unos 18 meses para que los mineros cubran todos sus costos, dijo Arseni Grusha, director general de Wattum.      ""Se quiere que el periodo de amortización sea inferior a 12 meses, lo que significa que o bien el valor de ETH sube, o bien los precios de las GPU tienen que bajar"", dijo Grusha, quien agregó: ""No se espera que los precios de las GPU bajen. Incluso si ETH llega a los $4.000, tendría que mantenerse ahí para que el ROI de la minería de ETH fuera atractivo"".    Márgenes de ganancias    Un fuerte precio de mercado y unos costos operativos relativamente bajos son algunas de las principales razones por las que la minería de Ethereum ha estado generando más beneficios que la de bitcoin desde el año pasado.      Aunque el fork de Londres ha permitido a la red Ethereum quemar una parte de la tasa de gas que de otro modo se pagaría a los mineros, la minería de Ethereum parece ser aún más rentable desde la bifurcación gracias al precio de la criptomoneda.      Los ingresos diarios de los mineros en dólares estadounidenses han aumentado más bien un 7,1% y han alcanzado un máximo de dos meses, según datos de Coin Metrics. La red ha quemado alrededor del 33% del crecimiento de la oferta de nuevas monedas desde la actualización, que es de 22.708 ETH y tiene un valor de $76.1 millones      Además de las tasas de prioridad —tasa de gas menos la tasa base quemada—, las subvenciones de bloque (similares a los premios de bloque de Bitcoin) y el valor máximo extraíble (MEV, por sus siglas en inglés) son las otras dos fuentes de ingresos para los mineros. El MEV es la cantidad de dinero que un minero de Ethereum puede ganar al ayudar a traders a insertar, dejar fuera o reordenar transacciones en un bloque.      ""Después del EIP 1559, seguimos recibiendo el MEV, 2 ETH de las subvenciones de los bloques y bastante del gas que dan algunas carteras"", dijo D'Aria. ""Así que realmente no es un gran problema"".      Los mineros ya esperan que las tarifas de gas bajen a largo plazo a medida que se despliegan más soluciones de escala en Ethereum, lo que reducirá la congestión y las tarifas de transacción, dijo D'Aria.      DeFi experimentó un crecimiento explosivo el verano pasado debido a un nuevo mecanismo de recompensa para los inversores que utilizan los protocolos de DeFi, mediante el cual pueden ganar nuevos tokens más allá de los rendimientos de los depósitos. El aumento de trading a través de varios protocolos en Ethereum ha aumentado drásticamente las tarifas de transacción, que se paga a los mineros por su trabajo para validar las transacciones.      ""Obtienes dos ETH de las subvenciones de los bloques y de cinco a siete más por los fees"", dijo D'Aria sobre los altos valores de transacción durante el boom de DeFi. Sin embargo, con un menor volumen de estas transacciones, las tasas de gas han disminuido para los mineros de Ethereum. ""Eso fue una anomalía y a los mineros les apetece disfrutarlo mientras dure"", agregó.      La minería de Ethereum suele tener unos costos operativos bajos en comparación con la minería de bitcoin. Aunque las GPU para minar sean caras y el funcionamiento de las máquinas requiera más mano de obra, el bajo consumo de energía podría compensar esos costos y reducir el gasto total, incluso más que el de la minería de bitcoin, dijo Vera.      La fecha exacta de la migración histórica de Ethereum a POS es una incógnita, pero una inversión bien programada en la minería de Ethereum podría reportar grandes beneficios, afirma Vera.      ""Los mineros que apostaron contra el proof-of-stake hace dos años ganaron mucho dinero"", dijo Vera. ""Si puedes apostar contra eso, el rendimiento podría ser bastante lucrativo"".",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TRADING,"David Pan, Andrés Engler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/20/mineros-de-ethereum-hacen-una-apuesta-multimillonaria-por-el-retraso-de-las-actualizaciones,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa29c046ffdb2b11112893e1990952d798f21376-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411919,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5DY,1629473827,What Is an Automated Market Maker?,"When Uniswap launched in 2018, it became the first decentralized platform to successfully utilize an automated market maker (AMM) system.  An automated market maker (AMM) is the underlying protocol that powers all decentralized exchanges (DEXs), DEXs help users exchange cryptocurrencies by connecting users directly, without an intermediary. Simply put, automated market makers are autonomous trading mechanisms that eliminate the need for centralized exchanges and related market-making techniques. In this guide, we will explore how AMMs work.  Read More: What Is DeFi?  But first, let us take a look at what are market makers.  What is a market maker?  A market maker facilitates the process required to provide liquidity for trading pairs on centralized exchanges. A centralized exchange oversees the operations of traders and provides an automated system that ensures trading orders are matched accordingly. In other words, when Trader A decides to buy 1 BTC at $34,000, the exchange ensures that it finds a Trader B that is willing to sell 1 BTC at Trader A’s preferred exchange rate. As such, the centralized exchange is more or less the middleman between Trader A and Trader B. Its job is to make the process as seamless as possible and match users’ buy and sell orders in record time.  So, what happens if the exchange cannot find suitable matches for buy and sell orders instantaneously?  In such a scenario, we say that the liquidity of the assets in question is low.  Liquidity, in terms of trading, refers to how easily an asset can be bought and sold. High liquidity suggests the market is active and there are lots of traders buying and selling a particular asset. Conversely, low liquidity means there is less activity and it is harder to buy and sell an asset.  When liquidity is low, slippages tend to occur. In other words, the price of an asset at the point of executing a trade shifts considerably before the trade is completed. This often occurs in volatile terrains like the crypto market. Hence, exchanges must ensure that transactions are executed instantaneously to reduce price slippages.  To achieve a fluid trading system, centralized exchanges rely on professional traders or financial institutions to provide liquidity for trading pairs. These entities create multiple bid-ask orders to match the orders of retail traders. With this, the exchange can ensure that counterparties are always available for all trades. In this system, the liquidity providers take up the role of market makers. In other words, market makers facilitate the processes required to provide liquidity for trading pairs.  What is an automated market maker (AMM)?  Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs look to eradicate all intermediate processes involved in crypto trading. They do not support order matching systems or custodial infrastructures (where the exchange holds all the wallet private keys.) As such, DEXs promote autonomy such that users can initiate trades directly from non-custodial wallets (wallets where the individual controls the private key.)  Learn More: Sign Up For CoinDesk's Crypto Investing Course  Also, DEXs replace order matching systems and order books with autonomous protocols called AMMs. These protocols use smart contracts – self-executing computer programs – to define the price of digital assets and provide liquidity. Here, the protocol pools liquidity into smart contracts. In essence, users are not technically trading against counterparties – instead, they are trading against the liquidity locked inside smart contracts. These smart contracts are often called liquidity pools.  Notably, only high-net-worth individuals or companies can assume the role of a liquidity provider in traditional exchanges. As for AMMs, any entity can become liquidity providers as long as it meets the requirements hardcoded into the smart contract. Examples of AMMs include Uniswap, Balancer and Curve.  How do Automatic Market Makers (AMMs) work?  There are two important things to know first about AMMs:  Trading pairs you would normally find on a centralized exchange exist as individual “liquidity pools” in AMMs. For example, if you wanted to trade ether for tether, you would need to find an ETH/USDT liquidity pool.  Instead of using dedicated market makers, anyone can provide liquidity to these pools by depositing both assets represented in the pool. For example, if you wanted to become a liquidity provider for an ETH/USDT pool, you’d need to deposit a certain predetermined ratio of ETH and USDT.  To make sure the ratio of assets in liquidity pools remains as balanced as possible and to eliminate discrepancies in the pricing of pooled assets, AMMs use preset mathematical equations. For example, Uniswap and many other DeFi exchange protocols use a simple x*y=k equation to set the mathematical relationship between the particular assets held in the liquidity pools.  Here, x represents the value of Asset A, y denotes the value of Asset B, while k is a constant.  In essence, the liquidity pools of Uniswap always maintain a state whereby the multiplication of the price of Asset A and the price of B always equals the same number.  To understand how this works, let us use an ETH/USDT liquidity pool as a case study. When ETH is purchased by traders, they add USDT to the pool and remove ETH from it. This causes the amount of ETH in the pool to fall, which, in turn, causes the price of ETH to increase in order to fulfill the balancing effect of x*y=k. In contrast, because more USDT has been added to the pool, the price of USDT decreases. When USDT is purchased, the reverse is the case – the price of ETH falls in the pool while the price of USDT rises.  When large orders are placed in AMMs and a sizable amount of a token is removed or added to a pool, it can cause notable discrepancies to appear between the asset’s price in the pool and its market price (the price it’s trading at across multiple exchanges.) For example, the market price of ETH might be $3,000 but in a pool, it might be $2,850 because someone added a lot of ETH to a pool in order to remove another token.  This means ETH would be trading at a discount in the pool, creating an arbitrage opportunity. Arbitrage trading is the strategy of finding differences between the price of an asset on multiple exchanges, buying it on the platform where it’s slightly cheaper and selling it on the platform where it’s slightly higher.  For AMMs, arbitrage traders are financially incentivized to find assets that are trading at discounts in liquidity pools and buy them up until the asset’s price returns in line with its market price.  Read More: Crypto Arbitrage Trading: How to Make Low-Risk Gains  For instance, if the price of ETH in a liquidity pool is down, compared to its exchange rate on other markets, arbitrage traders can take advantage by buying the ETH in the pool at a lower rate and selling it at a higher price on external exchanges. With each trade, the price of the pooled ETH will gradually recover until it matches the standard market rate.  Note that Uniswap’s x*y=k is just one of the mathematical formulas used by AMMs today. For instance, Balancer uses a much more complex form of mathematical relationship that lets users combine up to 8 digital assets in a single liquidity pool. Curve, on the other hand, adopts a mathematical formula suitable for pairing stablecoins or similar assets.  The role of liquidity providers in AMMs  As discussed earlier, AMMs require liquidity to function properly. Pools that are not adequately funded are susceptible to slippages. To mitigate slippages, AMMs encourage users to deposit digital assets in liquidity pools so that other users can trade against these funds. As an incentive, the protocol rewards liquidity providers (LPs) with a fraction of the fees paid on transactions executed on the pool. In other words, if your deposit represents 1% of the liquidity locked in a pool, you will receive an LP token which represents 1% of the accrued transaction fees of that pool. When a liquidity provider wishes to exit from a pool, they redeem their LP token and receive their share of transaction fees.  In addition to this, AMMs issue governance tokens to LPs as well as traders. As its name implies, a governance token allows the holder to have voting rights on issues relating to the governance and development of the AMM protocol.  Yield farming opportunities on AMMs  Apart from the incentives highlighted above, LPs can also capitalize on yield farming opportunities that promise to increase their earnings. To enjoy this benefit, all you need to do is deposit the appropriate ratio of digital assets in a liquidity pool on an AMM protocol. Once the deposit has been confirmed, the AMM protocol will send you LP tokens. In some instances, you can then deposit – or “stake” – this token into a separate lending protocol and earn extra interest.  By doing this, you will have managed to maximize your earnings by capitalizing on the composability, or interoperability, of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Note, however, that you will need to redeem the liquidity provider token to withdraw your funds from the initial liquidity pool.  What is impermanent loss?  One of the risks associated with liquidity pools is impermanent loss. This occurs when the price ratio of pooled assets fluctuates. An LP will automatically incur losses when the price ratio of the pooled asset deviates from the price at which he deposited funds. The higher the shift in price, the higher the loss incurred. Impermanent losses commonly affect pools that contain volatile digital assets.  However, this loss is impermanent because there is a probability that the price ratio will revert.

42424782,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWfhh,1629470837,Así blockchain está empoderando a las mujeres en Medio Oriente,"En todo el mundo las mujeres han sido marginadas cuando se trata de finanzas y tecnología, y Medio Oriente no es una excepción. Por suerte las cosas están cambiando, e internet está ofreciendo nuevas oportunidades de aprendizaje e inclusión.      Blockchain ofrece una página en blanco en Medio Oriente: una nueva industria con reglas aún no definidas donde las mujeres pueden participar y hacerla suya si les son dadas las herramientas adecuadas.    La doctora Amber Ghaddar es cofundadora de AllianceBlock.    No es ningún secreto que en zonas de Medio Oriente las mujeres tienen mucha menos autonomía financiera en la sociedad que los hombres. Un informe de McKinsey de 2020 sobre ""las mujeres en el trabajo"" en esa zona descubrió que persisten grandes desigualdades, sobre todo en la protección jurídica y la inclusión financiera, con un número significativo de mujeres en la región que siguen sin estar bancarizadas.    Read this article in English.    La distribución del conocimiento es más igualitaria hoy en día, ya que cualquier persona con acceso a internet puede aprender a programar o comerciar. Las finanzas descentralizadas (DeFi) pueden ayudar a nivelar el terreno de juego cuando se trata de las finanzas de las mujeres, eliminando la necesidad de intermediarios y la dependencia de instituciones centralizadas que a menudo no salvaguardan su dinero.      Iniciativas brillantes como All Girls Code están sacudiendo el statu quo de la región al animar a mujeres a programar y estudiar materias de ciencia, tecnología, ingeniería y matemáticas —STEM, por sus siglás en inglés— en una universidad. En otros lugares, asociaciones como Arab Women In Code están liderando la tarea de dotar a las mujeres de más habilidades. En el Líbano, el país natal de mi padre, esta institución participó en la organización del primer hackathon exclusivamente femenino en 2015, y desde entonces han seguido ganando impulso eventos similares.    Lee más sobre el tema en este artículo de opinión en inglés: Crypto Adoption in Middle East Will Come From Unstable Nations    Cuando se permita, las mujeres de Medio Oriente se beneficiarán en gran manera del acceso a criptomonedas. La naturaleza descentralizada y anónima de las transacciones de los activos digitales permitirá que las mujeres no sean discriminadas por su género y puedan tomar el control de su dinero sin la participación de intermediarios.      Las monedas digitales se han ido abriendo paso en Medio Oriente, con la primera cotización en bolsa de criptomonedas en Dubai este año, así como con las pruebas del shekel digital por parte del Banco de Israel. En los mercados en desarrollo las criptomonedas ofrecen a los ciudadanos una forma de controlar su dinero sin tener que depender de la relativa dificultad o prosperidad de su economía nacional.      En muchas zonas las mujeres son desiguales tanto a los ojos de la sociedad como de la ley, lo que se ve agravado por prejuicios manifiestos en la vida cotidiana. Las conclusiones de la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE) muestran que las mujeres constituyen la mayoría de la fuerza laboral en los sectores de la salud y los servicios sociales en Medio Oriente, y que suelen desempeñar el papel de amas de casa y cuidadoras.      La pandemia, sobre todo en los mercados emergentes, ha agravado un desequilibrio de género ya existente, debido a que las mujeres tienen muchas más probabilidades de sufrir las consecuencias económicas de la crisis debido a su situación económica y sus profesiones. Son estos desequilibrios los que reflejan la necesidad de contar con fuentes de ingresos y vías educativas alternativas para ellas.      En las zonas devastadas por la guerra, como el Líbano, hay una enorme diáspora de mujeres y hombres por igual, debido a que los ciudadanos han tenido que huir de la crisis económica y una posible hambruna. Para los ciudadanos que aún permanecen las criptomonedas se han convertido en una forma de sortear un sistema financiero obsoleto, cuyo valor de la moneda local se desplomó más del 80% durante una crisis económica que alcanzó su punto álgido en marzo de 2020.    LAS MONEDAS DIGITALES OFRECEN UN MEDIO PARA QUE LAS MUJERES DE MEDIO ORIENTE TOMEN EL CONTROL DE SUS FINANZAS    Los ciudadanos han recurrido cada vez más a las criptomonedas para transferir su dinero, mientras utilizan salas de chat encriptadas en Telegram para realizar transacciones. Aquí vemos un ejemplo de la libertad que los criptoactivos pueden aportar en tiempos difíciles al proporcionar una forma segura y anónima para que la gente tome el control de sus finanzas cuando las instituciones estatales no lo hacen. Las mujeres marginadas en Medio Oriente deberían tomar nota de estas libertades y aprovechar las monedas digitales cuando sea posible y útil.      También es importante señalar que blockchain es más que DeFi: tiene la capacidad de remodelar las cadenas de suministro y redefinir la forma en que los países hacen negocios, además de ser una fuerza para el bien social. El trabajo que Cardano está realizando en Etiopía para ayudar al gobierno a hacer un seguimiento del rendimiento académico de los estudiantes en las escuelas locales es sólo uno de los muchos ejemplos de las increíbles formas en que las capacidades de seguimiento y almacenamiento de datos de blockchain pueden utilizarse para el bien social.      Viendo estos ejemplos, las mujeres de Medio Oriente deberían tomar nota de todas las industrias que pueden beneficiarse de blockchain y de cómo pueden marcar la diferencia.    Lee más: How Bitcoin Helps Afghan Girls Achieve Financial Freedom    La debilidad de los gobiernos y el éxodo de la población a causa de la guerra o la inestabilidad suelen fomentar la adopción generalizada de tecnologías emergentes como blockchain y las criptomonedas, ya que los ciudadanos buscan fuera del estado la gestión de su dinero y otros asuntos.      En la misma línea, las monedas digitales ofrecen un medio para que las mujeres de Medio Oriente tomen el control de sus finanzas en tiempos de crisis. Con una visión más a largo plazo, las mujeres de la región deberían tener en cuenta las oportunidades que ofrece la emergente esfera de blockchain. Las mujeres desarrolladoras en esta industria son muy solicitadas en todo el mundo.      Las economías que no se basan en las materias primas y que cuentan con fuertes tasas de educación superior, como Jordania, Líbano y Túnez, ofrecen oportunidades óptimas para que las mujeres con formación se introduzcan en este apasionante sector.

42424798,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWg9h,1629470507,Diem: A Dream Deferred?,"Facebook learned pretty quickly it wouldn’t be able to “move fast and break things” in the world of payments. Finance requires trust, and the company had none when it announced its stablecoin project, then called Libra, now called Diem, in 2019. The social media company was widely seen as having enabled the spread of disinformation, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal showed it losing control of user data, a factor highly relevant to discussions of Libra.      As the Diem-attached Novi digital wallet readies for market – two years later, a lifetime in crypto – it remains to be seen whether regulators and the public will be willing to accept and use this corporate-driven attempt to create a global payments medium.      “We deserve a fair shot,” David Marcus, Facebook’s head of financial services, wrote in a blog Wednesday. But even when it comes to trustless, blockchain-based services, reputation matters, as does the public’s faith.      I agree with Marcus that even a toned-down version of Diem would provide “a lot of value.” The banking system is painfully unjust, and Facebook has the reach to provide hundreds of millions of people access to financial services they never had before.      (Marcus noted the social network enabled $100 billion in payments over the past four quarters, though there wasn’t an indication where those transactions originated.)      At the very least, Diem will familiarize a new generation with the foundational technologies – wallets, QR codes, hashes – that make crypto run. And perhaps it will set a race to the bottom on fees for financial services or set the expectation that monetary systems should be built on open, interoperable protocols.      In its initial form, the would-be stablecoin libra was revolutionary in scope. Backed by an ever-changing basket of fiat currencies, developed and governed by an association of 100 companies and organizations, the novel currency would have challenged the status-quo banking and payments industry.      It almost certainly would have interfered with governments’ monetary policy, if it grew large enough, by effectively pushing locals to trade their fiat currency for libra on a huge scale. It also could have introduced data privacy or money laundering risks: In fact, one of the major concerns over libra was that Facebook itself seemed likely to harvest a lot of payments data. Regulators the world over ordered the project to halt development.      So on its second attempt, the Facebook-led Libra consortium took a different tack – it sought regulatory approval, pared down its vision, moved its headquarters from Switzerland to the U.S. and rebranded – leaving the stain of Libra behind. Diem is a radically different project, to create fiat-pegged tokens issued in partnership with a bank.      Was that the right choice? Crypto is an industry filled with brash thinkers and bold ideas – our greatest strength and weakness. Our heroes infamously “test in prod,” deploying code in live, unaudited environments. There are hacks and exploits every week, as well as innovations stacked on innovations.      Some would say scaling back was Facebook’s only choice. Consultant Richie Hecker wrote Libra’s original vision was “doomed to fail,” because it had too many moving parts. CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De called it “buzzword boogaloo.” Even its creators expressed doubts about how Libra was revealed to the world.      “To me they were selecting the path of greatest resistance – building their own blockchain rather than using an existing one, going with a complicated basket of currencies and commodities rather than something people can understand like the U.S. dollar (or some other fiat currency) plus the economics were convoluted,” Figure founder Asiff Hirji said in an email.      In “Facebook: The Inside Story,” Wired editor Steven Levy tells the story of an upstart social network with the aim of connecting the world, getting people to share more, even if that comes at the expense of their privacy.      There are numerous instances where Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, weighs growth and “sharing” over the reasonable concerns of his executives or users. There was the decision to switch the default status of posts from ""friends-only"" to ""public.” Or the Instant Personalization change in the platform API that led to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.    Read more: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline    The very mindset that enabled Facebook to become a data and advertising juggernaut cost it the public's trust. And, maybe where it mattered most: in democratizing finance. “I’ve heard multiple conversations about how this proposal would be so great if only Facebook wasn’t involved,” Marcus noted.      “The advantage of high price stability and regulatory compliance may lead some merchants and other corporate users to adopt it,” Darrell Duffie, a Stanford professor of finance who has written extensively on stablecoins, said over email. He added that diem is not Facebook, and that there appears to be a firewall around the data diem produces – though U.S. regulators and legislators might find that hard to swallow, which is the nut of Facebook’s problem.      Is diem what the world needs?  “It’s a good start,” Duffie said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/20/diem-a-dream-deferred,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48d24590675bb8aed1b5153395240e2584c21707-2400x1606.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424803,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWgHh,1629469878,Cuáles son las monedas que podrían reemplazar al dólar como principal reserva de valor,"Medio siglo atrás — el 15 de agosto de 1971, más exactamente — el presidente estadounidense Richard Nixon dio un paso trascendental.      Tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Estados Unidos había utilizado su influencia como la última economía desarrollada en pie para convertir al dólar en la base de un sistema mundial de tipos de cambio. El dólar de la posguerra estaba respaldado por las enormes reservas de oro acumuladas en parte gracias a las ventas de municiones estadounidenses a Europa durante la guerra. El sistema, conocido como Bretton Woods —por el lugar de New Hampshire donde se promulgó—, desempeñó un papel fundamental en la reconstrucción de las devastadas economías de Europa y Japón.    Read this article in English.    Pero en 1971 esas economías en recuperación se habían convertido en una amenaza para el dólar respaldado por el oro. El aumento de las exportaciones de Europa y Japón erosionó la participación de Estados Unidos en el comercio mundial, lo que redujo la demanda de su moneda. Esto, unido al exceso de gasto del país, convenció a los mercados financieros de que el dólar estaba sobrevalorado frente a los $35 por onza de oro. A partir de la década de 1960 los dólares se canjearon por oro a un ritmo cada vez más rápido, en una especie de “carrera del oro” motivada por la creencia de que la paridad del dólar podría romperse y dejar en jaque a los tenedores de esta moneda.      Cincuenta años atrás finalmente Richard Nixon suspendió el canje de dólares por oro. Aunque el proceso tardó unos años más en llevarse a cabo, esto puso fin al patrón oro y al sistema de cambio fijo de Bretton Woods que se basaba en él.      La importancia de este momento es posiblemente exagerada en el conjunto de la historia financiera: el ""patrón oro"" al que puso fin Nixon había durado menos de tres décadas, en circunstancias extremadamente inusuales. En su lugar surgieron los tipos de cambio de flotación relativamente libre que conocemos hoy en día, en los que el valor relativo de las monedas cambia en función de la influencia económica y la estabilidad política del país emisor.      A pesar del ascenso de Europa y Japón, este nuevo régimen monetario seguía favoreciendo al dólar estadounidense (ahora sin respaldo). Durante el medio siglo transcurrido desde entonces ha seguido siendo la divisa dominante en el comercio mundial y la elección mayoritaria de los bancos centrales extranjeros que buscan un depósito de valor estable. Como comentamos en la primera entrega de esta serie, esto ha dado a Estados Unidos una serie de ventajas económicas y políticas, a menudo caracterizadas como el ""privilegio exorbitante"" del dólar.      No obstante, ahora el statu quo del dominio del dólar se está erosionando. La inflación post-pandémica ha reavivado la preocupación por el declive de su estatus de reserva, aunque se trata de una tendencia a mucho más largo plazo: en mayo la proporción del dólar en las reservas de los bancos centrales, de 59%, cayó a su nivel más bajo en 25 años.      La pérdida de participación del dólar ha sido absorbida en gran parte por el crecimiento de las reservas en euros, yenes japoneses y yuanes chinos. También hay otro competidor, aunque todavía es sólo un destello en el horizonte: los defensores de las criptomonedas llevan mucho tiempo argumentando que el bitcoin u otro activo digital podría servir como moneda de reserva mundial; y recientemente figuras mucho más importantes, como el antiguo director del Banco de Inglaterra, han apoyado la idea de un instrumento de reserva digital supranacional.      El estatus de reserva no es una competición en donde hay un solo ganador. Las circunstancias que condujeron a casi un siglo de dominio del dólar fueron una anomalía, y los expertos generalmente no esperan que una sola moneda o instrumento llegue a tener un dominio similar en el siglo XXI.      Pero, ¿cuál de los candidatos tiene más posibilidades de robarle al dólar una cuota de mercado de reserva significativa, junto con una parte del poder y los privilegios que conlleva?    El euro    El euro tiene muchas y enormes ventajas como posible moneda de reserva mundial. A pesar del legado de mala gestión económica de algunos estados miembros, como Grecia y España, la eurozona está formada en general por economías sanas y bien reguladas, con un PIB total ligeramente superior al de China. Y, aunque no esté exento de defectos, el Banco Central Europeo en general es gobernado de forma estable y bastante predecible. También ha superado una crisis realmente aterradora en 2010, cuando logró reunir un paquete de rescate y evitar la disolución del euro, algo considerado como una posibilidad real en ese momento.      Así que no es de extrañar que el euro sea ya la segunda mayor moneda de reserva del mundo, con unos 2.5 billones de euros ($2.94 billones) en los bancos centrales de todo el mundo.      Pero hay obstáculos para un mayor crecimiento de las reservas en euros. El mayor de ellos no es económico, sino político. El poder sobre los tipos de interés y otros aspectos de la política monetaria del euro está en manos del Consejo de Gobierno del Banco Central Europeo, formado por un Comité Ejecutivo de seis miembros y gobernadores de los 19 bancos centrales de la zona euro. Esto significa que los conflictos importantes entre los estados miembros en materia de política monetaria podrían provocar un bloqueo o una ruptura de la gobernanza, lo que provocaría un riesgo en comparación con el perfil más unitario de la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos.      Otro problema para el potencial de moneda de reserva del euro, según el economista de Stanford Darrell Duffie, es que el Banco Central Europeo no emitió durante muchos años bonos europeos. Los bancos centrales de los estados miembros emiten bonos denominados en euros, pero éstos no reflejan los puntos fuertes y débiles de la eurozona en su conjunto. Los títulos de cada país tienen sus propios rendimientos independientes, por ejemplo, y este fenómeno aumenta la complejidad y el riesgo de utilizarlos como reservas. Los bonos, y no la moneda, constituyen la mayor parte de las reservas de los bancos centrales internacionales, por lo que la falta de verdaderos ""eurobonos"" ha limitado el rol de reserva del euro.      Sin embargo, esta situación cambió durante la pandemia de coronavirus. La Unión Europea anunció en octubre de 2020 que iniciaría la primera emisión a gran escala de deuda en toda Europa para financiar la ayuda a la pandemia. Los bonos han sido generalmente bien recibidos por los mercados y ahora la Comisión Europea planea pedir prestados 900.000 millones de euros ($1.06 billones) durante los próximos cinco años. Aunque los bonos irán a parar a diversos compradores, son suficientes para desplazar significativamente los bonos denominados en dólares de los bancos centrales, que actualmente suman cerca de $7000 billones.      Y lo más importante: la emisión sienta un precedente. ""Es difícil prever si habrá muchas más o no"", dice Duffie, quien agrega: ""Pero, como esto rompe el hielo, puede significar que habrá más en el futuro"". Eso no sólo añadiría activos al mercado de reservas: Duffie sostiene que la emisión de deuda compartida aumentaría la cohesión política europea y reforzaría la utilidad de los bonos como reservas de valor.      (Nota: A pesar de sus glorias pasadas, la libra esterlina no suele formar parte del debate sobre los cambios de reservas, en parte debido a la economía relativamente pequeña del Reino Unido, que es una quinta parte del tamaño de la de China y la mitad de la de Japón).    El yen    La situación del yen es tal vez la más contradictoria en lo que respecta al estatus de reserva y es una muestra crucial de los retos a los que se enfrenta la moneda de China, el yuan. En términos generales, a pesar de su fortaleza económica, el sistema financiero de Japón sigue teniendo ciertas tendencias aislacionistas arraigadas en su estrategia de reconstrucción de posguerra impulsada por las exportaciones. Por encima de todo, la mayor parte de la deuda japonesa se mantiene en el país, lo que limita la oferta disponible de reservas denominadas en yenes.      ""La ambición de Japón nunca ha sido tener una moneda de reserva mundial"", afirma Alicia García-Herrero, economista jefe para Asia-Pacífico del banco de inversión Natixis. ""Si tienes un superávit de cuenta corriente, como Alemania y Japón, no necesitas una moneda de reserva internacional, porque no tienes nada que financiar. Compras activos"", agrega.      En otras palabras: si una nación es exportadora neta puede permitirse no tener suficientes deudas internacionales como para que sus bonos sirvan de reservas globales. La elevada tasa de ahorro interno de Japón, que ha alcanzado una media del 30% en los últimos 40 años, también significa que hay una gran demanda de bonos del estado dentro del país.      La situación de Japón brinda una visión extraña cuando se la compara con el dólar estadounidense: una de las razones por las que esta última moneda es una de reserva dominante se debe a que los habitantes de Estados Unidos parecen no poder vivir dentro de sus posibilidades.    El yuan    El yuan es una especie de fantasma del dólar en estos días, una amenaza que se cierne fuera del escenario, más un rumor que una realidad.      China lleva al menos una década tratando de hacer que su moneda sea atractiva como instrumento de reserva y comercio mundial; y como segunda economía del mundo tiene el músculo necesario para lograr su cometido. El impulso para conseguir el estatus de reserva ha incluido la creación de mercados de bonos en Hong Kong, un intento problemático de equilibrar los flujos globales de yuanes bajo el propósito del Partido Comunista Chino (PCCh) de controlar el capital interno. Más recientemente, algunos observadores han sostenido que el proyecto del ""yuan digital"" de China es un intento de obtener una ventaja tecnológica que aumente su participación en las transacciones comerciales y, a su vez, potencie su viabilidad como reserva.      Pero estos esfuerzos se enfrentan a una serie de retos tan grandes que la mayoría de los expertos no prevén que el yuan tenga éxito como moneda de reserva a corto plazo.      Uno de los principales obstáculos es la falta de confianza mundial en la estabilidad política y el estado de derecho de China, que se puso de manifiesto recientemente con una repentina y amplia represión de la tecnología financiera por parte del PCCh en el poder. Los mineros de Bitcoin quedaron atrapados en esa emboscada, pero la represión también hizo caer grandes partes del mercado de valores chino y acciones chinas que cotizan en el extranjero. Eso incluyó a algunas empresas como Luckin Coffee, descubierta en la realización de un fraude contable a gran escala.      Esto llevó a Joseph Sullivan, economista del Consejo de Asesores Económicos de la administración de Donald Trump, a calificar al PCCh de aliado involuntario del estatus de reserva del dólar. Estas intervenciones y colapsos ponen en duda el compromiso de China con el libre mercado, su rigor regulatorio y, a su vez, la fortaleza fundamental de su economía. Las posibles consecuencias están frescas en la memoria del sector financiero: a un desplome bursátil similar en junio de 2015 le siguió rápidamente la devaluación del yuan por parte del Banco Central para impulsar la competitividad de las exportaciones.      Todo esto se deriva de un enigma probablemente irresoluble en el corazón de las ambiciones de la moneda de reserva de China: el control estricto del yuan ha sido uno de los principales pilares de su largo ascenso como potencia económica, pero es incompatible con el estatus de reserva mundial.      Aquí es donde Japón es una comparación ilustrativa. Desde las reformas de finales de la década de 1970, China en gran medida ha modelado su desarrollo tomando como ejemplo la reconstrucción de Japón después de la guerra, con un especial énfasis en la inversión interna para construir una economía basada en la exportación. Hay controles muy estrictos sobre el flujo de capital fuera de China porque el PCCh quiere que el capital nacional se invierta dentro del país, ya sea para construir fábricas para los contratistas de Apple o para financiar el desarrollo de inteligencia artificial.      Pero para convertirse en una moneda de reserva funcional el yuan tendría que ser libremente negociable. Los países necesitan que sus reservas sean bastante líquidas, en parte para estar preparados para los grandes cambios repentinos en las condiciones del mercado, como por ejemplo la pandemia del COVID-19, que desencadenó una oleada de ventas de bonos estadounidenses. Para conseguirlo, China tendría que hacer lo que se conoce como ""abrir sus cuentas de capital"" o permitir el libre flujo de capitales dentro y fuera de sus fronteras.      ""No planean abrir sus cuentas de capital a corto plazo"", dice Emily Jin, asistente de investigación del Center for a New American Security. ""Su situación de pesadilla es que abran una cuenta e inmediatamente, a la mañana siguiente, tengan salidas masivas de capital"", añade. Este escenario podría verse agravado por los recientes problemas del mercado bursátil, ya que las grandes salidas estarían impulsadas por los inversores chinos que buscan rendimientos mayores o más fiables en el extranjero.      El primer intento de China para cuadrar este círculo fue la puesta en marcha de un sistema de dos niveles a partir de 2010, con mercados extraterritoriales para los bonos en yuanes. ""China intentó crear un yuan negociable en el extranjero, y luego su propio yuan en casa"", dice García-Herrero, quien agrega: ""No funcionó. Y la razón por la que se derrumbó en 2015 fue una gigantesca corrección bursátil"".      García-Herrero ahora cree que el Banco Central de China está intentando hacer algo parecido al crear el yuan digital, una moneda electrónica controlada total y directamente por esa entidad estatal.      ""Tengo que decir que son creativos"", dice. ""Han ideado otra forma de evitar la convertibilidad obligatoria. [Con una moneda digital del banco central] conocen todas las transacciones. Así que si creen que alguien está retirando demasiado, pueden simplemente evitarlo"". Sin embargo, García-Herrero no espera que el plan funcione debido al conocimiento generalizado de este posible abuso y a la continua desconfianza en los dirigentes chinos.      Algunos han argumentado que el yuan digital también aumentaría su atractivo internacional a través de la innovación tecnológica: una moneda digital puede ofrecer velocidad u otras ventajas utilitarias en comparación con un dólar anticuado. Pero Emily Jin, del CNAS, duda de que una mejora meramente técnica tenga un impacto a largo plazo. ""Podría tener menores costes de fricción, pero esa no es la única razón por la que la gente aparca su dinero en dólares"", dice.      Esta maraña de fuerzas conflictivas ha obstaculizado gravemente los intentos de China para ser un estatus de reserva. El yuan representa actualmente el 2,3% de las reservas mundiales, seguido de cerca por el dólar canadiense, que representa el 2% de las reservas. La economía de Canadá es sólo una octava parte de la de China y no ha hecho ningún esfuerzo concertado para mejorar su estatus de reserva.    Bitcoin    Por último, ¿cuál es el potencial de bitcoin para convertirse en un instrumento de reserva mundial?      El principal argumento a favor de bitcoin como instrumento de reserva es paralelo al de la adopción personal de esta criptomoneda como depósito de valor. Así como un banco central nacional puede degradar la moneda de los ciudadanos imprimiendo dinero de forma desenfrenada, un banco central extranjero puede hacer lo mismo con los bonos de gobiernos extranjeros. Muchos defensores de bitcoin señalan los insostenibles niveles de deuda mundial y argumentan que los defaults de bonos soberanos se generalizarán durante este siglo. En este escenario, las reservas de bitcoin se convertirían en una especie de respaldo, un activo ""duro"" que seguiría en pie ante una ola de bonos impagos.      La idea pareció de repente tentadoramente real cuando El Salvador se convirtió en el primer país en decir que poseería bitcoin (aunque no como parte de una reserva formal de su banco central). Y lo que es más importante: el hecho de que una nación pequeña, pobre y políticamente inestable sin su propia moneda haya abierto el camino parece coincidir con los argumentos a favor de que los países tengan bitcoin. Al depender del dólar estadounidense como moneda principal, El Salvador está especialmente sujeto a los caprichos de los bancos centrales extranjeros y no gestiona su propia oferta monetaria. Otras naciones pequeñas e inestables podrían beneficiarse igualmente del uso de una moneda neutral.      Hay otros escenarios que podrían conducir a la adopción de reservas de bitcoin por parte de los estados. Greg Foss, director financiero de Validus Power y operador de crédito desde hace mucho tiempo, planteó recientemente que países productores de petróleo como Arabia Saudita y Rusia podrían pasar a aceptar bitcoin como medio de pago. Dado que estos países tienen en el mejor de los casos, relaciones ambivalentes con Estados Unidos, están motivados a reducir el poder y la influencia que esa nación obtiene del dólar, incluyendo, como ocurre con Rusia, el poder de imponer sanciones financieras internacionales a individuos. Dado que el petróleo es objeto de un comercio tan intenso, la adopción de bitcoin para los pagos del petróleo haría más necesaria su tenencia para ambas naciones y un gran número de otros actores.      El ejemplo del petróleo ilustra el atractivo geopolítico más profundo de bitcoin. Las naciones productoras de este producto comercian con una variedad de estados más o menos adversos, lo que hace que aceptar la propia moneda de los clientes sea menos atractivo. En la actualidad, eso deja a Estados Unidos como un tercero de confianza en la transacción a través de dólares. Pero un medio neutro de intercambio internacional como el bitcoin hace posible esos intercambios sin aumentar la influencia geopolítica de Estados Unidos al depender de él para mover el valor.      Dicho esto, sólo hay una débil relación entre el uso de una moneda para el comercio y su utilidad como instrumento de reserva, y los expertos dicen que el bitcoin tiene defectos significativos como reserva. El más obvio en este momento es la inestabilidad de su precio, con oscilaciones diarias de dos dígitos.      Un tipo de cambio estable no es la característica más importante de un instrumento de reserva: el economista Barry Eichengreen ha argumentado que incluso porcentajes significativos de inflación no serían suficientes por sí mismos para desbancar al dólar, por ejemplo. Sus defensores también sostienen que una mayor adopción estabilizará el precio de bitcoin con el tiempo. Pero por ahora esa volatilidad es simplemente insostenible para un instrumento de reserva serio.      El ecosistema de base en torno a bitcoin también puede ser un problema. ""Sabemos que [bitcoin] es un gran sistema sin confianza"", dice Yaya Funasie, un antiguo analista de la CIA que estudia esta criptomoneda y la geopolítica para el Center for a New American Security. ""Pero la confianza no está sólo en el protocolo, sino en el mundo que lo rodea. Ahora también se eleva la importancia de los mineros, de los desarrolladores... El protocolo dice X, pero si nos encontramos con un problema y los desarrolladores quieren bifurcarse, ¿cuál es el recurso legal?"".      A la inversa, bitcoin sería poco atractivo para el uso oficial en naciones que ya tienen su propia moneda nominalmente sana, porque limitaría su poder para controlar su oferta monetaria. Para bien o para mal, la intervención frecuente y activa en la política monetaria es una constante de la historia monetaria, y renunciar a ella no es una opción para países como Estados Unidos o Japón.      ""Se ha exagerado mucho la muerte del estado-nación"", bromea Fanusie.      Fanusie cree que es mucho más probable la adopción internacional de las monedas digitales de los bancos centrales —conocidas como CBDC, por sus siglás en inglés—, que además de ser digitales son totalmente distintas de las criptomonedas. Pueden ser controladas por los bancos centrales de forma más estricta que el papel moneda, lo que resulta preocupante para los críticos pero atractivo para los actuales interesados, como China y Estados Unidos. Una de las posibilidades más atractivas de los CBDC sería su utilidad para crear una moneda digital sintética compuesta por una cesta de otras monedas. Esto tiene potenciales efectos estabilizadores para el comercio y las divisas mundiales, y es la esencia de una propuesta hecha por Mark Carney, ex jefe del Banco de Inglaterra, para una ""moneda sintética hegemónica"". Las implicaciones de un sistema así serían significativas, pero, de nuevo, muy distintas de cualquier aplicación del bitcoin.    El recuento final    Así que, en última instancia, ¿cuál es el mayor rival del dólar?      Respuesta corta: el euro. Ya es un fuerte segundón del dólar y está construido sobre un legado de banca relativamente responsable. La integración política europea, aunque lenta, está en marcha, y el BCE podría emitir fácilmente más bonos de la eurozona.      Pero eso es sólo sobre la base de las condiciones actuales. Es posible, aunque improbable, que China decida abandonar su actual e impracticable acto de equilibrio y deje flotar el yuan, dejando de lado sus prioridades económicas internas. Un resurgimiento de la economía del Reino Unido podría hacer que la libra volviera a ser protagonista. La llegada de las CBDCs cambiaría el comercio y las cuentas internacionales de forma difícil de predecir.      Pero la criptomoneda es la mayor incógnita de todas. Si hace dos años me hubieran dicho que un solo país tendría bitcoin en 2021, no les habría creído, pero aquí estamos. El movimiento de El Salvador, aunque tímido, ha puesto de relieve la idea de la adopción de bitcoin para muchos otros estados en situaciones similares, y parece muy probable que al menos algunos hagan movimientos parecidos en los próximos años.      En términos más generales, el desarrollo y la adopción de las criptomonedas están ocurriendo con tanta rapidez que es simplemente imposible predecir hacia dónde nos dirigimos. Las fuerzas geopolíticas fundamentales sugieren que hay un papel para una moneda neutral no estatal. La mayor pregunta puede ser si los titulares, como China y Estados Unidos, permitirán que crezca, o la estrangularán para fortalecer sus propias posiciones.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT,"David Z.

42424801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWgDh,1629468302,Liquid Exchange Attack: Can a Crypto Wallet Ever Be 100% Safe From Hacks?,"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid Global saw close to $100 million of funds stolen in a hack on Thursday.      The firm said the attack targeted its multiparty computation (MPC) system of custody.      “This time, the MPC wallet (used for warehousing/delivery management of cryptographic assets) used by our Singapore subsidiary Quoine Pte was damaged by hacking,” the company said in a blog post on the incident, translated from Japanese by Google.      Hacks are not uncommon in the crypto world, but the Liquid attack was notable because MPC – an advanced cryptographic technique in which the private key controlling funds is generated collectively by a set of parties, none of whom can see the fragments calculated by the others – appears to be the technology of choice among banks and blue chip companies looking to get into crypto.      Deals for MPC companies show the demand for the technology. Those deals include PayPal’s acquisition of Curv in March and Gemini’s acquisition of Shard X in June. And BNY Mellon, the world’s leading custody bank, cemented a partnership with MPC provider Fireblocks earlier this year.    Read more: MPC Explained: The Bold New Vision for Securing Crypto Money    Banks eyeing the cryptocurrency sector probably see MPC as desirable because the technology can be configured to meet to their requirements and offers a more flexible, self-managed product than simply handing over keys to a third-party custodian.    MPC culpa?    However, the manner in which MPC wallets can be configured is where weakness, namely human error, can creep in, Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said.      Liquid Exchange used MPC technology provided by Israel-based Unbound Security, according to two sources familiar with the arrangement. Unbound is a highly respected cryptography company that is backed by Goldman Sachs and used by JPMorgan Chase in its Onyx blockchain-based services.      A spokeswoman for Unbound said via email that the company was “unable to comment on items that fall outside of our remit.""      According to Shaulov, Thursday’s attack on Liquid was probably related to a hack into the exchange’s system last November, when an attacker gathered data about the firm’s security setup.      “Although the attack was on their hot wallets that are based on MPC, my assumption is that this has nothing to do with MPC vulnerabilities,” Shaulov told CoinDesk.    Read more: This Crypto Custody Breakthrough Will Bring Banks Closer to Digital Assets    In Shaulov’s opinion, the exchange's security policy was likely designed in such a way that the original hacker was able to bypass its entire approval process and instruct the wallets to withdraw coins, without affecting the private key.      “In my business, nothing is zero percent,” Shaulov said. “But the chances that the hacker was able to figure something out with Unbound’s MPC protocol are very, very slim.”      Tal Be'ery, chief security officer of the MPC-powered ZenGo wallet, shared that view.      “Most likely it’s not the MPC, but some other problem,” he told CoinDesk via Telegram. “MPC enables users to effectively reduce the risk of key stealing by the factor of the different parties. So it can be 2X harder, 3X harder, etc., but not impossible.”    MPC alone is not enough    The attack on Liquid proves the thesis that MPC alone is not enough, according to Lior Lamesh, CEO and co-founder of GK8, an Israeli custody tech firm that uses MPC in combination with cold vaults, which are not connected to the internet.      Lamesh said hacking is about return on investment, and he estimates that on average a hacker would need to invest a few million dollars to compromise a few internet-connected computers. MPC means that fragments of the key, instead of being located in one internet-connected computer, are located in two or three different internet-connected computers, Lamesh said.      The more shards, the more expensive the attack, but it remains a worthwhile pursuit for a crypto hacker targeting hundreds of millions of dollars.      “MPC is more secure than a hot wallet, but is not enough by itself for banks who need to manage more than tens of millions dollars' worth of crypto,” Lamesh said in an interview. “But it’s fine to manage, say, 2% or 3% of assets, while the majority of the assets will be managed in a cold vault where they are 100% safe since they’re never connected to the internet.”      Benjamin Powers contributed reporting.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/20/liquid-exchange-attack-can-a-crypto-wallet-ever-be-100-safe-from-hacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f26ca2b6c7b9971c12939ecd95623bb3b8bb6e46-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Authorities in Sweden seized 36 BTC from the drug dealer, worth just under $150,000 at the time of his prosecution two years ago, according to a report Friday by U.K. newspaper The Telegraph.  By the time the Swedish Enforcement Authority came to auction off the bitcoin, its value had appreciated to the extent that only three needed to be sold for the original value to be recouped.  The authority must now return the remaining 33 bitcoin to the drug dealer, which prosecutor Tove Kullberg has described as ""unfortunate.""  ""The lesson to be learned from this is to keep the value in bitcoin, that the profit from the crime should be 36 bitcoin, regardless of what value bitcoin has at the time,"" Kullberg said.

42424794,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWg3h,1629456289,A Beginner’s Guide to Atomic Swaps,"Atomic swaps are automatic exchange contracts that allow two parties to trade tokens from two different blockchains. Sometimes referred to as atomic cross-chain trading, this type of mechanism completely eliminates the need for centralized third-party entities when executing trades. In a way, this system preserves the autonomy of crypto users and enables trustless transactions in which users do not need to know one another and are void of counterparty risks.      Due to the trustless, peer-to-peer nature of atomic swaps, it is widely considered one of the few truly decentralized trading techniques.    How do atomic swaps work?    “Atomic” is a terminology used to connote processes that would either finalize or would not initiate at all. In other words, an atomic swap comes with functionalities that ensure that two sides of trade fulfill all predefined conditions before the trade can be completed. This is made possible by incorporating smart contracts, which are self-initiating programs that enforce the conditions governing the success of a transaction.      To be more specific, an atomic swap uses a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC), which functions as a two-way virtual safe. As its name implies, this contract utilizes a sophisticated mathematical-based encryption mechanism called a hash function. Also, it introduces a time constraint such that transactions are reversed when either of the parties involved does not fulfill their sides of the bargain within a predefined time frame.      For example, the two parties involved may agree to set a two-hour time constraint for the atomic swap. In this scenario, the contract will return the deposited coins to their original owners when 2 hours elapses and not all of the trading conditions have been met.      Another important detail you need to know about the HTLC is that it requires two cryptography or encrypted keys. They are:    Hashlock key: This key ensures that trades are only finalized when both parties submit cryptographic proofs (more on this later) that they have fulfilled their sides of the transaction.  Timelock key: This is designed as a safety mechanism that helps traders set a deadline for atomic swaps. The mechanism ensures that deposited coins are returned to traders when the swap is not completed for one reason or the other before the deadline elapses.  How are they executed?    To best explain the procedure for initiating atomic swaps, let’s assume Bob and Alice have agreed to execute a trade involving bitcoin and ethereum. Here, Bob has decided to trade 1 BTC in exchange for Alice’s 15 ETH. The first thing Bob needs to do is create a contract address where he will send his 1 BTC. Once he’s deposited his funds, the contract automatically generates a special key that only Bob can access. Think of this key as the password that unlocks the funds Bob just sent to the smart contract.      The contract uses this key to generate a hashed representation or an encrypted form of the key. Next, Bob sends the hash to Alice. By doing so, Alice only has access to the hashed form of the passcode used to lock Bob’s 1 BTC. In essence, she can confirm that he has locked the funds in the contract, but she cannot access or withdraw the funds – at least not yet.      After receiving the hashed key, Alice uses the key to generate a contract address of her own, where she can deposit her 15 ETH. Since both parties have locked their funds on the smart contract, all that is left is for Bob to do is claim the 15 ETH. He can do this because he has access to the passcode that unlocks the key used by Alice to lock her coins on the smart contract. Interestingly, in the process of unlocking Alice’s contract address, Bob will also reveal the passcode to Alice. As such, Alice can use this passcode to claim the 1 BTC and finalize the trade.      In the end, you will notice this process all boils down to the capability of both parties to submit cryptographic proofs. Here, cryptography connotes the process of encrypting and decrypting keys. Note that Bob had to initially encrypt a key then send the encrypted key to Alice. Since he possessed the original key, he can claim the coins that Alice used the encrypted key to lock. As one of the conditions for unlocking such coins though, Bob has to submit the original key to Alice. By doing so, Alice can then access the key and use it to claim the 1 BTC.    Why are atomic swaps needed?    Atomic swap is considered a critical blockchain mechanism because it eliminates the need for intermediaries such as crypto exchanges. With this, traders can execute cross-chain trades without relying on the infrastructures of centralized trading platforms. Since intermediaries are sidelined while using atomic swaps, the transactions are fast, more affordable, and void of security incidents associated with custodial-based exchanges. All these benefits allude to the autonomy that atomic swap provides. In other words, users have more control over their assets since all trades are executed directly from their personal wallets.      Furthermore, the cross-chain trading mechanisms of atomic swaps promote a more interoperable crypto ecosystem. Thanks to atomic swaps, it is becoming easier to conduct transactions across multiple blockchains. Lastly, atomic swaps eliminate counterparty risk since trades are either completed or never happen.    The history of atomic swaps    The techniques involved were first described by Sergio Demian Lerner in 2012. Although the idea was appealing at the time, certain processes had not been fleshed out. A year later, Tier Nolan developed a more robust procedure for initiating atomic swaps. But it wasn’t until four years later when the Decred team completed an atomic swap between Decred and Litecoin that it was first successfully implemented. A few days later, Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, tweeted the process had been successfully replicated for a litecoin-to-bitcoin trade.      Note that the original design of the atomic swap required both parties involved in the transaction to download the entire blockchains of the coins they planned to trade. This is what we call an on-chain atomic swap. A month after Decred and Charlie Lee executed the first sets of atomic swaps, Komodo introduced a “light mode” version that only requires special payment channels, which are offshoots of blockchains. With this, traders do not have to download the entirety of the blockchains of their preferred coins or wait on blockchain validators to finalize transactions.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/20/a-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5faaf7b1e06d57ae04e87f4b0dfc9fae74e0ed37-2087x1436.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

GameFi introduces financial mechanisms into games, allowing users to make money by playing.

In his book Snow Crash, he described a future where humans live inside a massive 3D computer network and interact with each other using avatars. Stephenson proposed a metaverse within our own world, but they were tied together. Actions in the alternate version of the world would impact this one, and vice versa. This idea has intrigued people ever since, inspiring countless variations on the theme over the years. But most had one thing in common: They were all centralized, which means that one entity could control the metaverse and everything in it, including people&apos;s virtual identities, and even erase them. The Blockchain Metaverse That changed in 2013 when Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin published a white paper proposing what&apos;s now commonly called a &apos;world computer&apos; — with digital interactions based on distributed blockchain technology rather than conventional centralized servers. Besides enabling applications like decentralized finance and transparent voting, Ethereum enables decentralized metaverses like Next Earth. Instead of having just one server hosting simulated worlds, this new model allows anyone, anywhere to truly own their virtual assets and identity, without fear of centralized censorship or seizure.

Luna's website and all of its social media accounts have been taken down, according to SolPad, an initial digital offering (IDO) platform for the Solana blockchain.      Some are attributing the move offline to a rug pull. A rug pull occurs when the creators of a project take off with investors' funds. While no official confirmation has been given, the move would mark the first rug pull of its kind on Solana.      An anonymous source told CoinDesk over $6.7 million in assets had been taken. The amount has been verified by CoinDesk via the SOL scan block explorer. See below for a full list of the assets presumed stolen.      ""The funds are already gone, and no way to get them back,"" the source said. ""They moved all from sol to ether and then to the decentralized tornado cash service.""      Luna was SolPAD's second IDO, which went live on Tuesday. A spokesperson for Solana declined to comment.      Solana has risen to prominence as of late and has been the blockchain of choice for billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, who founded the FTX crypto exchange and who has invested heavily in Solana-based projects.      Solana Labs, the leading firm behind the network, raised $314 million in June.      In a SolPAD Telegram channel, the digital platform said it was ""collecting proof"" on Luna's rug pull, which could make an ""enormous impact on investors"" and its community.      SolPAD enables projects to raise capital on a decentralized platform, based on Solana.      It also said it was doing everything it could to provide proof for all related parties, particularly larger centralized exchanges so that the larger platforms can move to suspend and block funds.      ""SolPAD Finance has no relation to the Luna Yield team,"" the platform said. ""We only host IDO for projects that submitted qualified documents. SolPAD assumes no responsibility or liability for any activity by the projects that held a public sale on SolPAD.
