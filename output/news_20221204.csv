And that number looks like it will continue to grow.  The Financial Times recently reported that a group of customers using cryptocurrency exchange Gemini’s Earn program, which is tied to Genesis, were owed $900 million after Genesis’ lending unit halted customer withdrawals on Nov. 16.  A second group of assorted Genesis creditors, with loans also amounting to $900 million, is being represented by law firm Proskauer Rose, a second person told CoinDesk.  The Proskauer group takes the tally to $1.8 billion, with more to come in the form of a third ad hoc group being represented by Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm representing bankrupt crypto firms Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, the second person said. The amount of loans this third group is owed is not known. In addition, the Gemini customers group is being represented by law firm Latham & Watkins, the second person said.  In a letter to investors on Nov. 23, Genesis said it had “begun discussions with potential investors and our largest creditors and borrowers, including Gemini and DCG [Digital Currency Group], to agree on a solution that shores up our lending business’ overall liquidity and addresses clients’ needs.”  Genesis declined to comment on this story. Proskauer Rose, Latham & Watkins and Kirkland & Ellis did not respond to requests for comment by press time.  Genesis and CoinDesk are both owned by DCG.

Imagine the scene: There’s a teenager on the way to soccer practice absolutely in shambles because he just learned that Goldman Sachs brokered a cross-currency swap for Greece so that the latter could gain admission into the eurozone. The teenager then systematically loses his mind after each austerity package is announced in the following months and years.  That teenager was me.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Next, imagine that now-adult person, who writes about bitcoin for a living, reading a ECB blog post with the title: “Bitcoin’s last stand.”  The kid can’t catch a break. But no need to imagine because this actually happened last Wednesday. It’s critical to level-set that the published article doesn’t represent an official position of the ECB. It’s just a blog post on the ECB’s official website. But because it’s on the ECB’s official website, it is flying under a banner of authority. As such, it is worth parsing through the main points brought up in the post.  The post starts with an unsubstantiated (which was never substantiated later) point that bitcoin’s current price action is “an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.” But what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. So, let’s dismiss this point.  Bitcoin's last stand? Probably not, ECB  The next section in the ECB post is titled: “Bitcoin is rarely used for legal transactions.” Unfortunately, the body of the section doesn’t prove this point specifically (a shame, really, because it isn’t true) and instead focuses on how bitcoin’s value is based solely on speculation because a) it has no cash flow (like real estate), dividends (like equities), productivity (like commodities) or social benefits (like gold) and b) VCs are propping it up with $17.9 billion of investment in blockchain and crypto.  On a), not all real estate generates cash flow, Google has never paid a dividend, people use bitcoin so it is productive and there are clear social benefits to bitcoin. On b), the idea that $17.9 billion of VC investment in blockchain and crypto is enough to sustain $300 billion of value to bitcoin is frankly absurd, but I’ll concede that point because VCs do have vaunted reputations, so their involvement might, in fact, be propping up some of bitcoin’s market value.  Point is, there’s more than just speculation giving bitcoin value, even if speculation is part of it.  The last two sections in the ECB post are about how regulation can be misunderstood as approval, complete with a tired jab about Bitcoin energy pollution, and how promoting bitcoin bears a reputational risk for banks.  On the former point about regulation, I agree. Regulation could be misunderstood as approval, and regulation has prompted “the conventional financial industry to make it easier for customers to access bitcoin.” And yes, maybe this ease has suggested to small investors that bitcoin is a sound investment even if some other investors don’t think so. But that’s exactly how markets work: Some people think something is worth buying and some people think something is worth selling. Just because you think something is worth selling doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth buying.  As for the authors noting that the “Bitcoin system is an unprecedented polluter,” I will point you to some of the many articles and reports about this in particular (here, here, here and here). But just for the sake of a semantic argument (which are bad arguments), the energy sector is really the only “unprecedented polluter” given it’s the biggest.  On the latter, banks have enough reputational risk on their own. Two examples:  HSBC was fined $1.9 billion in 2012 for laundering money for drug cartels (by the way, HSBC still exists)  Wells Fargo was fined $3 billion in 2020 for fraudulent sales practices including opening accounts for people without their knowledge (by the way, Wells Fargo still exists)  Sure, this doesn’t mean there might not be reputational risk for banks associated with promoting bitcoin, but surely there’s a reputational merit outweighing this risk if bitcoin works out and customers make money.  In summary, I think this blog post is just that: a short blog post that isn’t meant to represent anything definitive. I look forward to a more thoughtful, wholesome report on bitcoin’s march to irrelevance by the ECB in the future.  On Bitcoin-only companies going not Bitcoin-only  Meanwhile in Bitcoin-only-land, a firm called Casa added support for the Ethereum blockchain last week and a cross-section of bitcoiners weren’t happy about it.  Casa enables customers to create digital vaults to store bitcoin and bitcoin only. Think of it as a safe, but digital and specifically for bitcoin. Now, Casa is enabling customers to also store ether (the native token of Ethereum). The reason this move kicked up dust with some bitcoiners is because there is a shared ideal that Bitcoin-only businesses are The Way and anything else is a divergence from that ideal and should be punished. A firm, company or business moving from Bitcoin-only to not Bitcoin-only is perceived as a character flaw of the proprietors at best and an attack on Bitcoin at worst.  Listen, I’m probably the last CoinDesker who would talk to you about the viability of blockchains for anything except money without a centralized mint, and I’m also probably the last CoinDesker who would tell you what you should do and how you should do it. But I think the view that Casa’s move is somehow emblematic of the poor character of its founders or an attack on Bitcoin is patently absurd.  Casa made a business decision. Customers wanted ether vaults, so Casa sold them ether vaults. If you don’t want an ether vault, don’t use an ether vault. Casa still offers bitcoin vaults, so use that. Or don’t! Use a competitor product or create your own. Casa is not forcing customers to do anything.  As with all my takes, this one will no doubt make me immensely popular, but in the words of Casa Chief Technology Officer Jameson Lopp, what makes you think I care?",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/04/a-european-central-bank-blog-decries-the-end-of-bitcoin-and-we-arent-buying-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/486becf205d0512fec28066ab1633d04caebb4bd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to data from CoinMarketCap, when last month ended, ADA’s overall valuation was at $10.7 billion, 23% lower than the $13.9 billion market cap it had towards the end of October. On a yearly basis, the crypto asset witnessed 69% decline in this category. In terms of TVL, the Cardano network tallied a total of $58.8 million in November 30. The value was lower by 16% from what was registered by the blockchain 30 days prior. Currently, the network made a slight recovery as its TVL as of press time was $59.69 million. Meanwhile, according to tracking from Coingecko, at the time of this writing, ADA was changing hands at $0.3219, relishing an increase of 2.4% over the last seven days. If ADA can maintain this consistency, it won’t be a surprised that it will have a merry Yuletide season. It currently ranks 9th among all cryptocurrencies courtesy of its overall valuation which stands at $11.27 billion. Related Reading: TRON Unfazed By Decreasing Volumes, Tallies $1 Billion In USDT Inflow Cardano Network Leads In Development Activity Santiment recently shared via Twitter that the ADA network topped other crypto assets with regards to development activity numbers last month. At the close of November, the blockchain scored 572.67 in this particular department, being 18% higher than the two projects (Polkadot and Kusama) that tied in second place with a score of 486.13. The peak of Cardano’s network activity came on November 21 shortly after the announcement for the release of the blockchain’s algorithmic stablecoin, Djed, was announced. Notably, after the development was made public, ADA’s numbers went up by 22% until November 30. Another factor powering the DeFi project’s activity numbers is the fact that as of December 1, the asset remains the top token with the highest staked ratio, registering a tally of 71.17%. However, even at pole position, the network only offers 3.43% staking rewards, significantly lower than that of tokens like ATOM that has lower staked ratio. Cosmos’s staking rewards was at 19.25. The Current Star Of The Moment Despite the current struggles of its native crypto, ADA, in climbing to higher trading prices, Cardano is undeniably the top performer in the crypto performance metrics. Given the way bad the crypto asset was hurt by the sudden implosion of FTX, only few industry analysts were able to see this development coming. In fact, some of them believe that the project has positioned itself to be considered as the most developed among all crypto assets. With over 570 projects on GitHub over the past month, ADA became the de facto most actively developed crypto token at the time of this writing.

Unfortunately for traders, investors or prospective buyers of the crypto asset, this upward movement will be temporary and the bears are expected to take control shortly after the altcoin registers an uptick in its price. XRP has already lost almost 14% of its value over the last 30 days The altcoin could jump all the way to the $0.44 level Whales have already moved over 150 million XRP tokens At the time of this writing, according to tracking from Coingecko, the digital coin is changing hands at $0.3932, down by only 1.4% during the last seven days. On its month-to-date (MTD) performance, XRP registered a decline of 13.6%. However, the pattern currently being followed by its price action is indicating a minor upward movement. Technical Indicators Slightly Favor XRP Over the past few days, the cryptocurrency has already tested its resistance trendline on two different occasions while it revisited its support trendline multiple times. Related Reading: FTX Crash Triggers Major Selloff In Solana Price – How Deep Will SOL Dive? Source: TradingView In doing so, XRP’s price action has made it caught in an inverted flag pattern which is a bearish model but offers a chance for a minor bullish breakout. Currently, the $0.39 zone is a crucial support level for the altcoin as failure to hold it would mean a continuation of the ongoing downward trend for the crypto. However, in the event that XRP manages to hold that particular line, there’s a good chance that the inverted flag pattern will provide a window of opportunity for the asset to surge all the way up to $0.443 to tally an impressive 12.5% jump. The decline in trading volume of the cryptocurrency will eventually cool it down and pull it back to a bearish state all the way to $0.36. Whales On The Move Just a few days ago, Bithomp, an XRP-focused whale tracker shared some information about an unusual transfer of large sum of the XRP token. According to the data, around 143 million units of the altcoin worth more than $56.5 million was moved by a crypto whale from Binance to Bittrex, a major U.S. exchange company. Large investors have been active recently, getting involved in movement of millions worth of XRP from an anonymous wallet to another for purposes of selling or facilitating withdrawal through a cold wallet. As of posting time, it is believed by the tracker that over 150 million of the altcoin has already been moved by whales. XRP responded with this development with a minor price increase although its gains remain temporary as it cannot sustain its upward trajectory.

The prices of almost all crypto assets declined over the past few weeks. But then, the story changed just when it seemed like the market was to witness high volatility. With the strong influence of the bears, the value of digital assets took to the south. In addition, the recent collapse of one of the world’s prominent crypto exchanges, FTX, spiked an unfavorable shift in the space. Related Reading: FTX Crash Triggers Major Selloff In Solana Price – How Deep Will SOL Dive? Following the trend in the market, the leading memecoins have shown strength in their movement. Though the entire market suffered, memecoins fared more positively than most crypto tokens. Over the last week, Dogecoin (DOGE) rose by almost 14%. On its part, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has given a tremendous upward movement. This new strength in SHIB is raising eyes if the token could make more positive progress in the coming weeks. Will SHIB Record A Price Jump Soon? Despite the prevailing bearish market trend and other negative factors, SHIB displayed an impressive record. Several top whales have had massive SHIB holdings through the thin period. As per data from Whalestats, Shiba Inu recorded up to 500 Ethereum whales that hold more than $76 billion worth of SHIB. Furthermore, it reported that the past two weeks had not significantly changed the SHIB holdings of the top 100 whales on the Ethereum chain. Shiba Inu gathered more value as Elon Musk took over Twitter. This created a spike in the value of SHIB, causing the coin to hit a new ATH in October 2022. After Musk’s acquisition, Shiba Inu was competing favorably against Dogecoin. As a result, arguments erupted online over which memecoin between SHIB and DOGE will hit $1 first. Even though the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange drained what the memecoin accrued during the period, there’s still hope for it. SHIB, One Of The Safest Crypto Coins? The crypto space has been facing growing fear and doubts with the collapse of FTX and the twists of events that followed it. As a result, investors now desire safe investment options in the crypto market to secure their funds. A report from Santiment Insights highlighted Shiba Inu as one of the safest coins for investment in the current crypto market. Related Reading: Chainlink May Rise 25% This Week As Bulls Work To Reclaim Its Pre-Crash Value On-chain, data revealed the transfer of about 1.8 trillion SHIB coins in several exchanges early this week.

According to Santiment, Shiba and Uniswap are historically within the assets group with the lowest purchasing risk. However, they are at the bottom among the top 10 tokens based on Market Cap versus Realised Cap (MVRV) calculations.

From the Terra crash and continuous interest rate hikes to FTX implosion, the market hasn’t enjoyed a whole month of positive price trend. Related Reading: FTX Crash Triggers Major Selloff In Solana Price – How Deep Will SOL Dive? As the investors cry about the loss of investment funds, the miners of Bitcoin struggle to remain afloat. As a result, BTC price has continued to plummet even with the increasing electricity costs for miners’ operations. But, surprisingly, many miners in Russia will buy mining rigs now. Why Are Russian Miners Buying Bitcoin Mining Rigs? According to Kommersant’s recent report, many miners in Russia are grabbing more Bitcoin rigs in Q4 of 2022. In addition, the researchers discovered that the sale of ASIC rigs skyrocketed at the end of the year. This is surprising given the continuous fall of crypto assets in the market. On a closer look, it became clear that Russian miners enjoy cheaper electricity costs. In addition, the country provided more affordable electricity for many regions, making it easier for households and businesses in those places to flourish. So, while other miners in countries with high power cost struggle, their Russian counterparts have it more accessible. Another reason for gathering more ASIC crypto mining rigs is because of the cheap offer for the equipment. As a result, ASIC prices fell in the country, spurring many miners into action to acquire more. More reason that led to this surge in mining rig purchases was the rising interest in crypto mining as a viable investment opportunity. According to Xive co-founder Didar Bekbauov, bitcoin mining became attractive because of lesser investment opportunities, sanctions, and the high-tech qualifications of many people in the country. The buying spree started after the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (MiFin) and the Bank of Russia (BoR) agreed to support crypto mining. But they allowed it in regions with more energy allocations, not those with scarce energy supply. Secondly, Russian regulators introduced a bill to legalize mining and the sale of mined assets in the country. This bill came up in the Russian State Duma, the lower parliament. Also, financial analyst Vladislav Antony stated that the lower ASIC mining rigs price, which is now close to the production costs, is a good encouragement for new investors. Mining revenues in Russia have increased recently, even with the BTC price recording a near two-year low. Mining Rigs Vendors Sales Report One of the distributors of mining rigs in Russia, Chikot, recorded more sales in October and November. This was different from their Q3 records. Data shows that Chikot sales in Q1 to 3 were higher than 2021 sales by 65%. By August and October 2022, the hardware price fell by nearly 20% and remained the same for the following months.
