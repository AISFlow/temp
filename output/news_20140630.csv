42397710,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzMI,1404169898,Bitcoin Price Surges as Silk Road Auction Spurs Investor Interest,"The US Marshals Service (USMS) has begun to inform participating investors as to the official results of its 27th June auction of 30,000 confiscated Silk Road bitcoins, but major institutional investors are already calling the event an overall success.  The comments come amid a near 7% increase in bitcoin price on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index that industry leaders are crediting to rising interest in bitcoin stemming from the event.  Alan Silbert, founder and CEO of online bitcoin luxury marketplace BitPremier, for example, took to Twitter to issue his belief that investors interested in the Silk Road auction may seek to buy bitcoin regardless of the outcome.    So basically at least USD$20MM of bitcoin buying demand went unsatisfied in the auction and will look elsewhere to buy bitcoins i.e. market      — Alan Silbert (@alansilbert) June 30, 2014    The news followed the USMS' informational release earlier in the day, when it revealed to CoinDesk that 45 bidders had participated in the auction and that 63 total bids were received.  A USMS spokesperson has since told CoinDesk that it won't be commenting further, adding:    ""The award process is ongoing, and we will have no further announcements today.""          Pantera sees uptick in interest  Positive post-auction sentiment was confirmed by Dan Moorehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, who indicated the auction has so far succeeded at increasing awareness of its investment products.  Moorehead told CoinDesk:    ""Says Law states that 'Supply creates its own demand'. So true when it’s the US government auctioning bitcoins. The publicity created a tremendous amount of demand. We had several large new players bid.""          Pantera was one of a number of confirmed bidders in the auction including Binary Financial, Bitcoin Shop, Circle, Pantera Capital and SecondMarket.  Bitcoin price rises  At press time, the price of bitcoin had increased nearly $50 over the course of the day, rising from an opening price of $598.60 to a high of $643.29 before settling back below this level.  A look at recent price data shows bitcoin prices have been trending upwards, since hitting a low following the news that the USMS would sell the assets, then valued at roughly $18m.  A similar price increase was seen on the CoinDesk CNY Bitcoin Price Index, which rose 6% for the day's trading.  SecondMarket shut out  As early as this afternoon, certain bidders began releasing statements regarding auction results on Twitter.  Perhaps most surprising was the initial tweet from SecondMarket and Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) CEO Barry Silbert, indicated that his syndicate, which sought to open up the auction to smaller investors, did not receive any blocks from the auction.    Announcement: The SecondMarket / Bitcoin Investment Trust bidding syndicate for the US Marshals bitcoin auction was outbid on all blocks — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) June 30, 2014          The development was seen as a boon for bitcoin by such publications as Reuters and The Wall Street Journal, both of which cited SecondMarket's results as evidence of increased interest in bitcoin among investors.

42397720,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzSC,1404163876,Australian Tax Office Delays Bitcoin Guidance,"Update (10:55 GMT, 18th December 2014): The ATO today released its final ruling on taxation of digital currencies, with the majority of the draft version's important provisions still intact. Most importantly, goods and services tax (GST) will still be imposed on bitcoin exchanges, leading to double taxation if those bitcoins are then spent on goods or services.  _______________________________________  The Australian Tax Office (ATO), the government agency dedicated to revenue collection, has decided to delay its ruling on bitcoin, pleasing some individual taxpayers but creating uncertainty for businesses and investors.  The ATO had since February promised a definitive ruling on how it would treat bitcoin in time for this year's tax return submission period, which would have started tomorrow.  Now, as ABC News reports, an ATO spokesperson has said the office is delaying its ruling to further consider the many submissions it has received, and to ensure its decision was legal:  ""To ensure our advice to the community is comprehensive and robust we have sought further advice from external legal counsel.""  The ATO will now seek that advice from Australia's Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson.  It is still hoped the office will produce a definitive ruling in time for Australia's tax return deadline for 2013-14 , on 31st October.  Playing safe  The news report suggests bitcoin-accepting businesses, traders and investors will now be left ""in limbo"", unsure of whether they will face a backdated tax bill in future years.  The Bitcoin Association of Australia (BAA), the Bitcoin Foundation's local chapter, said it was disappointed, but also glad the ATO was not rushing to a decision.  Tax lawyer Reuben Bramanathan, who co-wrote the BAA's paper detailing its recommendations to the ATO, agreed, saying it is more important for the ATO to fully understand bitcoin in Australia and the far-reaching consequences than to make a rushed decision:  ""It’s positive to see the ATO engaging in a proper consultation process with the key stakeholders, who have been able to explain how bitcoin actually works and the impact on the bitcoin industry in Australia.""  ABC News quoted the Association's Jason Williams as saying that a healthy and clearly defined operating environment for bitcoin business was more important:  ""As digital currencies such as bitcoin are now a permanent part of our financial landscape, it is important for Australian regulators and legislators to foster and nurture growth.""  Individual rulings  The ATO has, over the past year, issued a number of private binding rulings in response to individual queries. These rulings, however, are relevant legally only to the individual cases they represent.  In response to one query in June 2013 it simply said ""yes"" when asked if bitcoins would count as income for a business.  In a subsequent (undated) case, it went significantly further, saying tourists from overseas purchasing bitcoins in Australia would not be eligible for a GST (sales, or Goods and Services Tax) refund upon departure, as bitcoins were not tangible goods.  The ABC report also said Freedom of Information (FOI) requests had shown the ATO was anxious at the prospect of Australians using digital currencies to avoid paying tax.

42397729,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzc2,1404158420,MegaBigPower's Franchisee Program Could Reshape Bitcoin Network,"Industrial bitcoin mining company MegaBigPower has announced that it is starting a franchise program that could reshape the bitcoin mining network and create new pathways for industrial mines to form.  The program enables individuals or companies that want to start a mine to step around a critical roadblock: mining hardware startup costs. MegaBigPower aims to provide mine operators with the know-how to begin hashing quickly, accomplishing this by providing pre-configured hardware at no upfront cost to vetted candidates who are capable of providing facilities and power.  Washington-based MegaBigPower (MBP) is North America’s largest mining operation. The mine, which generates millions of dollars worth of bitcoin per month, began developing its franchisee network earlier this year. Now, the company is planning a broad expansion effort that could add as much as 50 PH/s in mining power per month to the network.  MBP owner Dave Carlson told CoinDesk the time is right for this kind of program because of a mining hardware glut that he sees coming ahead. This presents an opportunity to establish a broad network of decentralized mine operators under the MBP umbrella.  Carlson told CoinDesk:  “I perceive that there is going to be a large surplus of manufactured hash power. With so many teams and companies rushing into the space, they’re manufacturing more hash power than individuals can put up by building mines. What I think is going to come of that is that the new commodity won’t be access to mining equipment. It’s access to power.”  Creating a global franchisee network  Carlson explained that providing pre-configured hardware at no upfront cost incentivizes mining participation, removing a hurdle that oftentimes keeps more investment away from industrial-sized operations. It also makes the process significantly cheaper for mines to get started simply because the startup expenses are significantly lower.  He said:  “By giving them the hardware upfront they have a lot lower capital costs to get started.”  One of the key elements of the franchisee program is the ability for participating mines to begin hashing before paying their first fees. Carlson explained that this enables them to focus more on generating bitcoins and ramping up their hashing power rather than immediately worrying about paying back on the investment.  “What we want to do is build a large network presence, and if we do it through this franchise network, we’ll do it faster and easier than if we were to build this power ourselves.”  He went on to predict that, if successful, the program could constitute hundreds of megawatts worth of hashing power from around the world. Carlson added that the average franchisee will host between one and five megawatts in electrical capacity.  Carlson also noted that the program works well from an investment standpoint as well. He argued that investing in industrial space with sufficient power-generation capabilities is less of a risk without the hardware costs involved. Once you involve expensive hardware, he said, there’s a possibility that a mine could turn out to be unprofitable.  Hands-on approach  Franchisees will form a broad, interconnected network that has MBP’s central facility at its heart. The company will oversee franchisee miner performance, as each one will be mining in pools specially built for the franchisee.  In regards to actually selecting mines to join the program, Carlson explained that members will be vetted in the simplest way possible: on-site visits by himself or another representative from MBP. The purpose, Carlson said, is to make sure that a prospective mine is actually capable of delivering sufficient energy output – and bitcoins.  Carlson said:  “I actually travel out to the proposed facility and put my eyes on it, to confirm that the power is in place, that the cooling is in place most importantly, and that the potential franchisee has the resources to bring a team and get started.”  From there, he said, franchisees begin the ramp-up process that emphasizes stable – and upward – growth. Carlson said that initial onboarding may start a mine at around 100 terrahashes per second, in order to both test their deployment capabilities and make sure that a new franchisee isn’t overwhelmed by a huge increase in mining power.  The purpose of staying involved through performance oversight and site visits, Carlson said, is to make sure that those brought into the franchise network are capable of profitability. By monitoring pool performance, MBP can see which members aren’t performing as well as they should in order to intervene and correct any issues.  Building an anchor franchise  MBP has already begun building a network of industrial mines under its umbrella, most notably with California-based anchor franchisee Aquifer. Carlson described them as a “strategic partner”, with Aquifer serving as both a testing ground and foundation for future investment from MBP. The company also plans to embark on a 50MW power build with Aquifer over the next six months.  Carlson said:  ""It’s as creative as we want to get it.”  He added that, in the future, MBP may use Aquifer’s facility to host hardware for its own mine as well as the franchisee itself. As well, the utilization of the facility and its resources may evolve over time depending on the strategic needs of the company and the franchisee as a whole, with Carlson saying, “that one’s pretty flexible”.  East Coast franchise takes shape  New York-based CoinMiner, led by CEO Hayden Gill, originally began as a Scrypt mining operation prior to becoming involved with MBP. A discussion about the franchisee model in April at the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York with Carlson led Gill and his team to build a relationship that ultimately resulted in CoinMiner coming under the MBP umbrella.  Gill told CoinDesk that the startup process took only a few weeks before CoinMiner received its first 50 TH/s of mining power. The mine received a second shipment of mining racks just last week, and as Gill explained, the future is “growth, growth, growth”.  Gill said:  “I’d like to see us up in the 10 megawatt range sometime by mid-next year.”  Notably, CoinMiner is aiming to support its own business model by tapping into alternative energy sources in The Finger Lakes region in New York, where the mine is based. He cited hydropower and methane power as two possible sources, adding that these efforts, combined with local subsidies for new businesses, are giving them a boost as they ramp up.  According to Carlson, the participation of Aquifer and CoinMiner will be cruical for the development of the global franchisee network, telling CoinDesk:  “Both of the early adopter mining franchisees are good testing grounds for new concepts. We’re trying different scenarios with these guys, and they’ve been very helpful and feeding back information to us.”  Images via MegaBigPower",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/30/megabigpowers-franchisee-program-could-reshape-bitcoin-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/868d9e358d059ab9da098ff5c65f24e480a596b2-1048x752.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397718,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzTB,1404155156,Deloitte: Media 'Distracting' from Bitcoin's Disruptive Potential,"A new report by Deloitte University Press says bitcoin has great potential to disrupt payments and other industries, but that the media may be ""distracting"" governments and businesses from the technology's advantages.  The report, titled 'Bitcoin: Fact. Fiction. Future.' and authored by Tiffany Wan and Max Hoblitzell, points out that the media tends to focus on bitcoin's volatility, government crackdowns and exchange meltdowns instead of ""its potential long-term significance as a disruptive new money technology"".  In addition, Deloitte UP sees potential for bitcoin in fields that are often overlooked even by proponents of the digital currency:  “Bitcoin is more than just a new way to make purchases. It is a protocol for exchanging value over the Internet without an intermediary. Much has been written about the payment applications of bitcoin, including remittances, micropayments, and donations. However, bitcoin could soon disrupt other systems that rely on intermediaries, including transfer of property, execution of contracts, and identity management.”  Bitcoin evolution and new use cases  The report argues that new use cases will emerge as bitcoin continues to evolve, opening up a new range of opportunities, along with new challenges for governments and businesses.  Bitcoin, it says, has the potential to change the way governments regulate the market and enforce the law, while companies could continue to innovate and eventually change the way we conduct business and think about work.  “The sooner the public and private sectors understand the potential of this new technology, the better prepared they will be to mitigate its challenges and realise the benefits of bitcoin and other similar virtual currencies,” the authors concluded.  In the report, Deloitte UP explains how bitcoin, via cryptography, is used to create an open but securely authenticated system, and why it has to deal with less overhead than the traditional payments system.  However, in addition to this general optimism, a number of fairly serious challenges facing bitcoin are also mentioned.  Speculation and regulation  Deloitte UP lists volatility, regulatory uncertainty, exchange security, transaction volume and ease of use as its biggest bitcoin caveats.  Speculators rank high on the list, adding to the volatility and creating the impression of a get-rich-quick scheme. Thus, they introduce more reluctance on the part of everyday investors.  The regulatory environment still leaves much to be desired. Like speculation, regulatory moves have a big impact on the price, creating even more volatility.  “As governments begin to issue consistent guidance on bitcoin, businesses may become more willing to accept it as a form of payment,” the report says.  Security and ease of use are both seen as stumbling blocks for the emerging technology, and the authors clearly state that the system needs to be vastly improved to make bitcoin truly practical for the average consumer.  The conclusion is simple: mainstream users are unlikely to use bitcoin until wallet services develop more user-friendly and secure storage techniques. Cold (offline) storage does little to encourage users and, furthermore, goes against the basic principle behind digital currencies.  Another factor weighing down bitcoin is the relatively low transaction volume of about 60,000 transactions per day, which pales in comparison to Visa’s 150 million daily transactions. The bitcoin network would have to evolve and grow to accommodate mainstream transaction volumes, raising questions about bandwidth, storage and power efficiency.  More than money  However, unlike Visa and other credit card companies, the bitcoin block chain can be used for a range of different purposes.  Deloitte UP examines bitcoin as a payments system and as a way of transferring value across the globe at much lower fees than traditional systems. Bitcoin could thus disrupt the remittance market, valued at $514bn in 2012, according to the report.  This excerpt neatly sums up bitcoin's benefits in payments:  “Today, if someone buys a donut with a credit card, the merchant pays an interchange fee to the credit card issuer. This interchange fee is usually a small flat amount (10-20 cents) plus a percentage of 1-3 percent. For a low-margin good like a donut, a 10- to 20-cent flat fee can approach 100 percent of the cost of goods. This interchange fee is often passed on to the customer. Using bitcoin, the transaction fee could be lowered to as little as 1 percent. This could ultimately evolve into a new payment system for credit card companies and banks.”  New use cases  In addition to remittances and payments, the authors say the bitcoin protocol could be used to simplify complex asset transfers, ranging from cars to securities. Using a frictionless system to transfer assets, backed by a public ledger, could eliminate the need for brokers, lawyers, notaries and similar services.  Bitcoin could also be used for identity management and execution of various contracts. Using the bitcoin protocol to manage identities would practically eliminate the possibility of forging identification documents and it would help put confidence artists out of work. A network operated by the government, a contractor or any other entity could verify anyone’s identity simply by scanning a bitcoin key.  “This system, based on cryptography instead of paper documents, would simultaneously increase mobility and security. If bitcoin can be used for travel documents, it could also be used for other forms of identity management like social security numbers, tax identification numbers, or even driver’s licenses,” says the report.  Another offshoot of the idea is the use of block chain technology to create and execute contracts. Traditional contracts could be replaced by digital contracts, essentially lines of code that self-execute when a triggering event occurs.  This could pave the way to new financial instruments, reduce legal fees, introduce more transparency into the financial industry and eliminate some of the paperwork that in practically every industry.  Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum is mentioned as a new venture that combines registry and escrow functionality to execute the conditions of a contract automatically.  As for the future of bitcoin, Deloitte UP does not offer a clear conclusion. It outlines four possible scenarios, but indicates there are simply too many factors at play to pick any one of them.

The feature was brought about by popular demand thanks to a Coinfloor customer survey that found that the majority of Coinfloor's users (47%) would like to see faster local payments.  Coinfloor also credited its customers with helping it continue to improve its services, stating:  ""The trust, support and feedback of our users has played a significant role in our course of action and focus over the last two months.""  The news follows Coinfloor's March decision to open customer registration, and its April announcement that it would seek to make its reserves publicly auditable. Coinfloor had originally sought to open registration for its services in November, but cited technical problems as the reason for the delay.  Faster Payments on Coinfloor  The requested local payments feature has now been delivered via UK's Faster Payments Service (FPS). The new deposit method is completely free when the transfer originates with UK banks.  ""We are also waiving the GBP deposit fee for all customers depositing into our Capital Account,"" Coinfloor added.  Deposits will be processed at 2 PM on business days, but may take up to 24 hours. Users will need a copy of their UK bank details including a new reference code from Coinfloor’s deposit page. The minimum deposit amount for the Capital Account is £500.  ""Any users depositing less will be charged £20 for having their deposit rejected,"" Coinfloor added.  Debit cards, margin trading and more  Coinfloor indicated the announcement is part of a broader effort that could find it integrating more offerings suggested by customers.  For example, the survey also revealed that almost one-third of Coinfloor’s users would like to use a bitcoin debit card, and according to the company’s survey chart, work on the card is already in progress. Ten percent of Coinfloor users would add margin trading and short selling functionality, while another 5% are interested in rebates for market makers.  Coinfloor did not indicate whether all these features and services will be eventually become a part of its platform.

42397715,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzRD,1404147815,MasterCard Patent Would Add Bitcoin to Global Shopping Cart,"UPDATE (30th June 23:00 BST): Updated with comment from Mastercard.  UPDATE (2nd July 21:00 BST): Updated with comment from the Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation.      Global financial services giant MasterCard has filed a patent that would seek to incorporate bitcoin into its design for a planned global online shopping cart.  Entitled 'Payment Interchange for Use With Global Shopping Cart', the filing was submitted by the New York company to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in March 2013.  The patent application is part of a series of filings related to MasterCard's effort to build a global online shopping cart catering to online shoppers.  This global shopping cart would be based on each store offering its own individual cart, thereby making it easier for consumers to dedicate carts to larger projects, such as weddings or home renovations.  A representative from MasterCard told CoinDesk:  ""Every day, we look for ways to bring additional convenience to consumers when they shop. This application is just one example of that – exploring how to create flexibility in how a consumer would fund a shopping cart purchase.""  Still, MasterCard added that the patent doesn't suggest any particular support for bitcoin:    ""The application was filed to protect our intellectual property and does not indicate a commitment to one idea or concept.""            The patent, published on 19th June, has not yet been approved by the USPTO.  Non-traditional payments  The filing notes that a global shopping cart would require a payment interchange that supports a variety of payment methods.  As such, MasterCard includes bitcoin in the filing under the broader term of ""non-traditional modes or sources of payment"", stating:  ""The payment interchange of claim 1, wherein the one or more payment modes or sources comprise cloud payment schemes, digital wallets, point of sale (POS) and non-traditional modes or sources of payment.""  The patent later expands on the definition of barter payments, listing ""virtual currency, bitcoin, social media credits, automated clearing house (ACH) and coupons"".  Support for bitcoin wallets  MasterCard also details how it will aim to support a broad range of payments through a ""flexible API framework sufficient to support the payment of interchange"".  Under the claim, the API would also be able to interface with bitcoin as well as other digital wallets such as its own MasterPass, Google Wallet, PayPal and potentially those offered by bitcoin companies.  The filing includes bitcoin among a number of other offerings, reading:  ""The API can also support an interface to accept non-traditional modes or sources of payment such as Amazon virtual currency, paying with rewards points, bitcoin, virtual card numbers and the like.""  Bitcoin's patent battles  With the news of the MasterCard filing, the credit card issuer adds its name to a list of other traditional financial companies that have sought to claim patent protection for various digital currency uses, including Gemalto, Visa and Western Union.  However, while potentially worrying to observers in the bitcoin community, there remains disagreement regarding just what kind of threat, if any, digital currency companies would face from the patent filings.  Reed Jessen, of the Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation, for example, called the patent ""the perfect example of MasterCard attempting to control the future of the bitcoin economy"".  Further, he told CoinDesk he believes that this could be just the start of a wave of similar announcements, saying:  ""I suspect that nearly all future patents from MasterCard covering electronic money exchanges will identify bitcoin as a possible payment option. It costs them nothing to include the 'bitcoin' phrasing in their patent applications and may increase the scope of their claims to cover the cryptoeconomy. I think we will see increasing inclusion of bitcoin-related language in patent drafting in coming months and years. It's the rational thing to do for traditional electronic transaction companies.""

The agency told CoinDesk that 45 registered bidders participated in the event, and that 63 bids were received over the course of the auction, which ran from 6am EST to 6pm EST on 27th June.  The USMS suggests that more information about the auction could be forthcoming, though the agency was vague about what it would ultimately release.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""The award process is ongoing, so we do not have the final number of winning bidders yet.""  The number of confirmed bidders in the auction, however, continued to grow today, with The Wall Street Journal indicating that Boston-based bitcoin financial services company Circle had participated.  With the news, Circle joins other notable names in the bitcoin industry as confirmed bidders including Barry Silbert's investment vehicles SecondMarket and Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), BitFury investor Binary Financial, bitcoin-based hedge fund Pantera Capital and online retailer Bitcoin Shop.  The data release follows a similar announcement from SecondMarket and BIT CEO Barry Silbert, who indicated this weekend that 42 bidders participated in his investment syndicate.  The syndicate model allowed SecondMarket and BIT to place bids on behalf of foreign investors, as well as those who wanted to place smaller bids between $25,000 and $50,000 through its offering. As such, it is unlikely that such data has been incorporated into the latest US Marshals data release.  As recently as 26th June, the agency told CoinDesk that it was still deliberating how much information it would release about the auction, and whether such official announcements would include the names of any winning bidder or bidders.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

Speaking in his place will be OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao.      The North American Bitcoin Conference is set for its Chicago debut on 19th and 20th July, bringing a host of regular event speakers, including BitPay senior software engineer Jeff Garzik, litecoin founder Charlie Lee and venture capitalist Roger Ver to the famed 'Windy City'.  Most notable among the speaker selections, perhaps, may be the addition of two prominent international community members – OKCoin CEO Star Xu and Huobi CEO Leon Li – who will be making their US conference debuts.  Even with these big names in attendance, however, event organiser Moe Levin believes that what will ultimately set the next North American Bitcoin Conference apart from other industry gatherings is its emphasis on community.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's a community-driven effort. There's other conferences that cost a lot of money and are exclusive events. [The North American Bitcoin Conference] goes back to what bitcoin used to be, the community, and we like to stress that.""  To Levin, this means both educating and entertaining attendees, and the indications are that he intends to accomplish both in Chicago. Levin noted that the conference's kickoff party will be held at the House of Blues Chicago, a popular local concert venue.  Billed as the 'second annual' North American Bitcoin Conference, the event follows the franchise's Miami conference earlier this year. That event saw the debut of as-yet unreleased cryptocurrency platform Ethereum, among other highlights.  Asian influence  When addressing the announcement of notable Chinese community members Li and Xu, Levin was also quick to stress how these speakers represent the event's focus on catering to the broader bitcoin ecosystem.  Levin said that he believes US companies can learn from the two exchange CEOs, particularly because they've faced some of the more severe operational difficulties seen globally, and persevered:  ""It's important to learn from every single person that's been trying to make it in this space, and one of the hardest countries to make it in is China. [...] The lessons learned by Huobi and OKCoin can inform future decisions of every US company, and it will be a real asset to have them at the North American Bitcoin Conference.""  Major Chinese exchange leaders have overcome a litany of difficulties this year, owing to the decision by the People's Bank of China to more strictly enforce past rulings that aim to separate bitcoin businesses from the traditional financial system.  This pressure resulted in major exchanges, including Huobi, losing key banking partnerships, events that had global impact on the price of bitcoin.  Hot topics  Given the scheduling of the event, Levin said that he expects the US government's sale of 30,000 BTC confiscated from now-defunct online black market Silk Road to be just one of the talking points that will be addressed by attendees.  However, Levin believes that the broader regulatory implications of bitcoin, as well as the ecosystem's increasing maturity, will also come into focus at the event.  ""Generally, we're getting more mature as a community, so we're going to be talking about best practices,"" Levin said. ""Many companies are doing a similar thing, so we can look at this. We can start a dialogue about how we're going to move forward together.""  Although the North American Bitcoin Conference has released a preliminary agenda, topics have not yet been finalized. Levin, however, indicated that whatever is discussed, these conversations will be front and center in how the event is run – in a manner similar to the popular TED Talks series. He said:  ""We're not turning somebody off and saying 'next speaker'. Speakers are available to talk throughout.""  Building on success  Of course, Levin also suggested that the North American Bitcoin Conference will seek to expand bitcoin's community through attractions that cater to those who may just be learning about the technology.  Levin says the event will play host to a 'Bitcoin for Beginners' workshop that he expects to draw as many as 400-500 new community members from the Chicago public.  As for the event itself, Levin suggested that those who are interested in attending should act fast. He noted that the event's official partner hotel, The Hotel Chicago, is now fully booked, a milestone that brings both feelings of accomplishment and new challenges.  Levin added: ""We're looking for another hotel now. I have to put out an email saying, 'Sorry guys, we sold out of the hotel in a few hours.' I guess it's a good problem to have.""

42425842,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRRh,1404140227,Huobi and LakeBTC Added to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index,"CoinDesk has added two exchanges, LakeBTC and Huobi, to its US dollar Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) and Chinese yuan BPI, respectively.  These additions will be live as of 16:00 BST today, the 30th June.  The move reflects the significant volumes traded by the exchanges and the importance of the Chinese market in terms of USD/BTC trading.  LakeBTC cracks the top four USD-exchanges  CoinDesk has been closely monitoring Shanghai-based LakeBTC in recent weeks. LakeBTC reports an even split between domestic and international customers, and it offers bitcoin trading in both USD and CNY, with the latter being commission free.  The company's self-reported total USD trading volume has grown to represent a significant portion of the global total. Over the last 30 days, LakeBTC exchanged 101,229 bitcoins (units), placing it in the number four position in the total USD volume league table, behind Bitfinex, Bitstamp, and BTC-e (Table 1).

Huobi added to Chinese yuan Bitcoin Price Index  In March 2014, in recognition of the growing importance of the Chinese bitcoin trading volume, CoinDesk launched a new Chinese yuan Bitcoin Price Index.  The Chinese yuan BPI is calculated independently from the widely referenced CoinDesk US dollar (USD) BPI, and is based solely on yuan-denominated bitcoin trading volume.  At the time of the launch, our Chinese yuan BPI included two exchanges – OKCoin and BTCChina.  However, one other well-known Chinese exchange, Huobi, had self-reported trading volume in March which supported its inclusion in the CoinDesk BPI, and its reported trading volume continues to be quite significant compared to its peers (Figure 1).  Figure 1: Trading Volume Share – CNY BPI Component Exchanges  Back in March, CoinDesk felt more time was needed to obtain additional information about Huobi’s business before we were comfortable including it in the BPI. Since then, Huobi has been much more open about its business operations and we are pleased to now add the exchange to our Chinese yuan BPI.  With the addition of Huobi and LakeBTC, there are now a total of seven exchanges across both the USD and CNY BPIs (Table 2 and Figure 2).

Our last change to the USD BPI was the addition of Hong Kong-based Bitfinex on the 13th of March, 2014, which has now surpassed Europe-based Bitstamp in total USD trading volume over the last 30 days (Table 1).  Coupled with Shanghai-based LakeBTC’s rise in USD trading, a very significant portion of total USD bitcoin trading is now taking place inside China.  Further, 90% of the combined CNY and USD BPI volume is occurring at China-based exchanges (Figure 3).  Figure 3: CNY and USD BPI Trading Volume Share at China and Rest of World (ROW) Based Exchanges  Why is such a large share of bitcoin trading volume taking place at China-based exchanges, and will this continue in the coming months? Are these bitcoin exchanges being used to avert Chinese capital control rules? Given the ease with which servers can be relocated does the notion of a ‘China-based’ bitcoin exchange make sense? Share your thoughts in the comments below.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/30/huobi-and-lakebtc-added-to-coindesk-bitcoin-price-index,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00b9e49651de071c7a652d844530b52b1c1ed608-900x500.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425830,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgR3h,1404135252,Financial Watchdog FATF Examines Risks of Digital Currencies,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has published a paper looking into the money laundering and terrorism financing risks involved with digital currencies.  FATF is an independent intergovernmental organisation tasked with developing policies to combat money laundering (AML) and terrorism financing (CTF). The organisation further maintains a blacklist, which highlights jurisdictions that refuse to address these issues. In addition, the FATF issues recommendations for AML and CFT, which must be followed in order to stay off the blacklist.  The FATF paper, titled ‘Virtual Currencies – Key Definitions and Potential AML/CFT Risks’, offers a quick summary of the digital currency system, but, as implied by the title, also looks into the risks that could arise from the technology (see the full report at the bottom of this article).  Coincidentally, the paper was published just days after the OECD published a working paper on bitcoin, and was referenced by Russian officials earlier this month. The FATF secretariat is located in Paris, at the OECD headquarters.  Legitimate uses, ample potential  The paper points out that digital currency has legitimate uses, with prominent venture capital firms investing in start-ups, and clearly recognises the potential in the emerging technology:  “Virtual currency has the potential to improve payment efficiency and reduce transaction costs for payments and fund transfers. For example, Bitcoin functions as a global currency that can avoid exchange fees, is currently processed with lower fees/charges than traditional credit and debit cards, and may potentially provide benefit to existing online payment systems, like PayPal.”  FATF also points out that digital currencies could pave the way for viable microtransactions, allowing businesses and individuals to monetise very low-cost goods or services sold online.  It further states that digital currency could support financial inclusion in other ways, by offering services in under-banked and unbanked regions of the world. Remittances are discussed, too.  Overall, the FATF summary can be described as relatively optimistic, focusing as it does on real-world applications of the technology.  Not without risk  On the risk side, FATF concludes digital currencies are “potentially vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist finance abuse” for a number of reasons.  “First, they may allow greater anonymity than traditional non-cash payment methods. Virtual currency systems can be traded on the internet, are generally characterised by non-face-to-face customer relationships and may permit anonymous funding,” the paper states. “They may also permit anonymous transfers, if sender and recipient are not adequately identified.”  FATF points out that decentralised systems can be particularly vulnerable to anonymity risks, explaining:  “For example, by design, Bitcoin addresses, which function as accounts, have no names or other customer identification attached, and the system has no central server or service provider. The Bitcoin protocol does not require or provide identification and verification of participants or generate historical records of transactions that are necessarily associated with real world identity. There is no central oversight body, and no AML software currently available to monitor and identify suspicious transaction patterns. Law enforcement cannot target one central location or entity (administrator) for investigative or asset seizure purposes (although authorities can target individual exchangers for client information that the exchanger may collect). It thus offers a level of potential anonymity impossible with traditional credit and debit cards or older online payment systems, such as PayPal.”  Global reach  The global reach of digital currencies also increases their AML/CFT potential, facilitating international transfers and relying on a complex infrastructure spread across the globe.  This segmentation adds another layer of problems for law enforcement and compliance authorities, as responsibility for AML/CFT may be unclear and transaction records could be held by different entities in different jurisdictions.  “This problem is exacerbated by the rapidly evolving nature of decentralised virtual currency technology and business models, including the changing number and types/roles of participants providing services in virtual currency payments systems. And importantly, components of a virtual currency system may be located in jurisdictions that do not have adequate AML/CFT controls,” FATF concludes.  FATF warns that centralised virtual currency systems could be complicit in money laundering and could deliberately seek out jurisdictions with weak AML/CFT regimes. Decentralised convertible virtual currencies allowing anonymous person-to-person transactions can exist in a digital universe entirely outside the reach of any particular country.  Essentially FATF believes nefarious actors could use digital currency technology to effectively set up shop somewhere beyond the reach of law enforcement and regulators, all in an effort to elude law enforcement, international financial regulations or potentially even circumvent financial sanctions. That risk is merely hypothetical at this point.  Early days for law enforcement  FATF points out that law enforcement is already starting to see major criminal cases involving the use of digital currency.  In the report the organisation examines the Liberty Reserve money laundering case, the rise and fall of online drug bazaar Silk Road and the demise of Western Express International.  Of course, the latter had nothing to do with bitcoin, or cryptocurrencies inspired by bitcoin, as it involved e-gold and WebMoney.

42425823,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgQzh,1404129831,Bitmain Releases Energy Efficient 478GH/s AntMiner S3,"Bitcoin mining hardware designer Bitmain has released the AntMiner S3, the latest member of its AntMiner family based on 28nm silicon.  The AntMiner S3 claims to deliver up to 478GH/s while consuming 366W of electricity, making power efficiency one of Bitmain’s biggest selling points. It is priced at 0.75 BTC.  AntMiner S3 spec and efficiency  Since the S3 churns out 478GH/s (±5%) and consumes 366W, Bitmain says its power efficiency is 0.77J/GH at the wall. It uses a standard ATX PSU, which is not provided by Bitmain.  Due to the relatively low overall consumption, customers can opt for an affordable mainstream power supply unit, although a PSU with a good efficiency rating is advisable. The whole unit measures 331 mm x 137 mm x 160 mm and it is cooled by two standard 140mm server fans, placed at the front and back.  The AntMiner S3 is the company’s third generation bitcoin miner and it is based on the new BM1382 ASIC, which is a 28nm part. The BM1382 should offer a 20% power saving compared to the company’s old 55nm chips.  This is Bitmain’s official spec for the new ASIC, which underwent testing earlier this month:  “BM1382 has achieved 15.75 Gh/s in hash performance, consuming less than 9.33W on chip level at 0.75V. This means 0.59 J/GH on chip. If the core voltage is at 0.63V, the efficiency will be 0.40 J/GH on chip.”  Shipping soon  The company says the AntMiner S3 should start shipping from 10th July. The miner does not need a proxy server and Bitmain says it has gone to great lengths to reduce the unit's noise levels.  AntMiner S3 should produce significantly less heat than its predecessors and with customised heat sinks mounted to all hash boards, the fans do not have to run too fast to keep the miner cool.  Due to its relatively low unit price, limited requirements and the fact that users can reuse off the shelf PSUs, the AntMiner S3 should appeal to smaller mining outfits or individual miners.

42425838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRPh,1404124151,"Huobi Brings Margin Trading, Interest Accounts to Bitcoin and Litecoin","Chinese 'big three' exchange Huobi is bringing margin trading and interest accounts to bitcoin, in a bold and possibly industry-first move designed to make more 'traditional' financial products available to serious digital currency traders.  The company's new platform, BitVC, is a Hong Kong-listed subsidiary company with a margin trading platform for both bitcoin and litecoin. Users may borrow up to 200% of the net value of all assets in their accounts; that is, BTC, LTC, CNY values combined.  Bitcoin interest  To accompany the move, Huobi is launching another new brand called Yubibao to work in conjunction with BitVC. Yubibao is a novel addition and a rare thing in the bitcoin world: a savings account that provides users with daily interest payments.  The idea is that BitVC users deposit funds into their Yubibao accounts, where those balances are made available for traders to borrow. Deposits and withdrawals can be made instantly.  Platforms like Bitfinex offer person-to-person lending for similar purposes, but users must wait in a queue of loan offers.  Yubibao's system pools the resources available for lending for anyone to dip into; the advantage for lenders being that they can start receiving interest immediately.  Users can also deposit money into a Yubibao account and not think about it, rather than having to monitor operations and issue new loans. The current daily interest rate is hovering around the 0.02-03% mark.  Deposits guaranteed  Huobi's  Robert Kuhne said Yubibao functions more like a traditional bank account, which would appeal more to users looking to generate a passive return on their investment.  It is also safe for investors, he said:  ""Users do not bear any risk of loss in leveraged transactions because the BitVC system manages the loans to borrowers and automatically issues margin calls when necessary to ensure that the borrower's assets can cover the loans.""  BitVC actually guarantees all user funds deposited in Yubibao, saying it holds a large reserve of bitcoins ready to backstop any losses from leveraged transactions. Furthermore, the company will bear all liquidity risk.  Kuhne added that there were plans for a comprehensive future audit of BitVC's finances and security by an external third party.  Margin trading is just BitVC's first feature, and there are plans to support various digital currency derivatives and other ""innovative financial products"", all based on Huobi's API.  BitVC is currently an invitation-only beta, but is scheduled to open up for public registration at the end of July. Interested users can request an invitation via Huobi's official accounts on either twitter or reddit.  Chinese regulation  Under an unofficial 'agreement' with the authorities, Chinese exchanges are not allowed to engage in speculation or otherwise risky investment behaviour.  For this reason, Huobi itself will remain registered in China and will continue to operate as a ""standard BTC/LTC spot trading exchange"".  Hong Kong-registered BitVC will be the more financially adventurous platform, and is intended to have a more international customer base.  Huobi's rise  Far from folding in the face of government pressure as many predicted, major Chinese exchanges have increased efforts to look for overseas customers and investigate new areas of digital currency development.  Huobi indicates it is more than satisfied with its growth over the past year, despite the tribulations. In fact, its cumulative volumes since 1st September 2013 stand at 16.6m BTC – more than any other exchange in the world, according to Bitcoinity.  The company also recently received investment from ZhenFund, a Chinese seed fund that works in collaboration with Sequoia Capital China.
