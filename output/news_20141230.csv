42377913,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCTx,1419971713,Microsoft: Bitcoin Regulation Will Influence Expansion Plans,"Global tech giant and Internet pioneer Microsoft ignited a new wave of interest in both bitcoin and its brand with its surprise December announcement that it had integrated the digital currency as a payment option for digital goods.  While widely lauded by the bitcoin community as a small but forward-thinking step, optimism about the move arguably reached fever pitch when just a day later its partner BitPay suggested Microsoft was already considering ways to expand the payment option globally.  Speaking to CoinDesk, however, Microsoft offered a somewhat different take on its internal conversation regarding bitcoin. While the company did not deny that discussions about the technology were ongoing, the company sought to frame such conversation as typical for any of its products and services.  The spokesperson said:  “We are a global company, and we always think about our markets globally, be it for bitcoin or for all of our services and products.”  Notably, Microsoft went on to suggest that, while it has no new announcements to make at this time, it may be looking for further assurances of bitcoin’s legal status before making any additional movements in the space.  “Whatever we might do, we will do it in a smart way to ensure we meet our customers’ needs while respecting local laws and regulations,” the company added.  The comments come as regulation for bitcoin businesses is maturing in the US, although ongoing debate on the subject continues globally.  Flexibility at the forefront  In statements, Microsoft went on to paint its initial interest in bitcoin as part of its overall drive toward offering more flexible spending solutions to its customers, particularly ones that garner sufficient consumer demand.  ""Microsoft continually investigates new technologies and that means providing our customers with personalized and frictionless buying experiences,” the company said.  Microsoft cited its recent support for digital gift cards via a dedicated website and mobile app as yet another example of how it is seeking to more widely embrace payments innovation.  With this in mind, the company framed digital goods as a “logical first place” to add bitcoin, although it did not indicate that other products were considered during the planning process, or if it is attempting to reach any specific demographics with the option.  Interest in bitcoin tech  Though not providing detail, Microsoft did corroborate BitPay’s statements that it sees potential for bitcoin beyond the world of payments.  “The technology behind bitcoin also represents an interesting set of new technologies to explore in the world of distributed, connected devices,” Microsoft stated, hinting at bitcoin's potential to impact the developing 'Internet of Things' economy.  For now, however, even those who seek to spend bitcoin through their Microsoft accounts will be somewhat limited. The company imposes a $1,000 daily spending cap for those who load their accounts with bitcoin, and a $5,000 maximum per account.  Overall, despite such restrictions, the company is pleased with the results, concluding that customers have ""responded positively"" to the decision.

42377909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCOv,1419954685,"India's Central Bank Could One Day Use Digital Currency, Chief Says","Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan spoke out on bitcoin at a televised event organised by the NDTV network late last week.  During the discussion, which looked at aspects of the Indian economy, the governor was asked for his opinion on bitcoin. He responded by saying that the digital currency is “fascinating”.  However, Rajan was also cautious about the risks of the new technology.  “I think we are still watching the evolution of these kinds of currencies,"" he said. ""One of the problems that we envisage with bitcoin is security issues. You’ve seen that it is not as secure as people thought they were and there have been stolen bitcoins and so on.""  He continued:  ""But the second issue is the fluctuation in value. For money you require a stable store of value. Something that fluctuates so much is less effective for use as money.”  Evolution of the technology  Rajan proceeded to conclude that there are some lessons to be learned from technologies employed in bitcoin.  “Some of them are useful, some of them are worrisome and we have to see how we take on such technologies,” he said. “I have no doubt that down the line we will be moving towards primarily a cashless society and we will have some kinds of currencies like this which will be at work.”  He argued that digital currencies will evolve to become better and safer in the future:  “Over time they will be a form of transaction, that’s for sure.”  Reserve bank acceptance?  Rajan also addressed another issue – the future of central banks in the era of digital money. When Dr Roy asked whether or not India will adopt digital currency at some, Rajan said digital currency will not be ruled out.  “We will never reject them out of hand,” said Rajan. “You know, in a sense credit cards are already performing some of that role.”  Rajan went on to say that the amount of cash used by consumers is far smaller than it was before the introduction of credit cards.  Intriguingly, he did not rule out the idea that a digital currency system could one day be embraced by central banks:  “For us as a reserve bank, this may happen maybe 10, 15 years from now, but we’ll have to figure out how we will make money. Because, you know, the way we generate most of our revenue is through forms of seigniorage.”  Rajan added that the bank wants to permit and promote development of new payment services and technologies such as Near Field Communications (NFC) and 'tap-and-go' transactions enabled by such technologies.  Cautious over bitcoin  In the past, Rajan has expressed scepticism and concern over the use and regulation of digital currency.  In February, he said the use of digital currency raised questions about how its value would be governed. He advised investors to exercise caution before using bitcoin as a means of exchange.  While he pointed out that digital currencies still need to evolve, Rajan argued that technology capable of reducing transaction costs is key to enabling local transactions that are at the heart of financial inclusion.  Rajan made these comments the same week the RBI was tasked with examining the legal and security ramifications of digital currencies. Previously, in December 2013, the bank issued a warning, outlining a number of risks associated with digital currency.

42377914,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCVD,1419948028,Chain Reflects on the Growing Role of Bitcoin APIs  in 2014,"Eric Rykwalder is a software engineer and a co-founder of Chain.com, a bitcoin API for developers. In this article, he examines how bitcoin APIs have made life easier for cryptocurrency startups over the last year, and looks ahead to what 2015 might bring.  Toward the end of last year, in November 2013, speculation shot the price of bitcoin from just under $200 to more than a $1,000.  This meteoric rise couldn’t be sustained at that time, but it served an important purpose. It drew the attention of the world, and made people wonder what bitcoin could become and how they could be a part of it. Thousands of developers began to sink their teeth into the blockchain.  As developers and entrepreneurs began to explore bitcoin, they found the landscape required tilling.  Before they could even think about their innovation, all the groundwork had to be done. Seemingly simple tasks, like checking the balance of an arbitrary address, required spinning up and maintaining servers, indexing all of the data, and parsing a new scripting system. These formidable tasks are hindrances to the creation of new products and services.  Problems like these, in the broader developer world, have been solved by companies like Amazon, Github, and Stripe. They created developer tools that gave people a strong foundation to build upon.  By relying on Amazon Web Services, Netflix has been able to avoid setting up data centers and instead focuses on its video-streaming service. In a similar vein, bitcoin APIs have emerged to remove the legwork of creating blockchain applications.  Providing access  So far, bitcoin API services, like Chain, have focused on providing access to the primitive data structures, such as transactions and addresses. This alone has served to eliminate the problems, mentioned above, of managing servers and indexing data.  Consider the size of the blockchain, which is now over 25GB. That’s just the size of the raw blocks and their transactions. To make this data easily searchable requires it to be catalogued and indexed, further increasing its size.  Instead of simply treating all this indexed data as just a store to be queried, APIs have created push services to speed up the app development process.  Chain Notifications, for example, uses 'webhooks' and 'websockets', enabling developers to tap into the events on the blockchain, and learn about updates as soon as they are propagated in the network. This allows them to simplify otherwise complex data workflows.  This year, APIs developed preliminary services aimed at providing confidence around zero-confirmation transactions.  This work will definitely continue to progress in the following year, with more tools for risk analysis and fraud prevention being created. Exposing and analyzing the metadata around the blockchain will allow developers to enhance the end-user experience of bitcoin.  Looking ahead  As the blockchain evolves, with advancements like Counterparty, Ethereum, sidechains and others increasing the possibilities, the need for better tools and developer experience will only grow.  Each new currency and chain added represents additional data to manage and new primitives to learn. Developers will require easy mechanisms for operating across multiple chains, empowering them to harness all the progress being made.  More than anything, API advancements next year will focus on increasing levels of abstraction around the blockchain.  So far, most progress has been on the necessary step of exposing the core data of bitcoin. The fewer of these core data structures that developers have to concern themselves with, the more time they can dedicate to their own product. Although there will always be use cases for this data, the majority of applications will be able to ignore most of it.  Overall, 2015 will be a very exciting time. As APIs mature, well established businesses will begin integrating bitcoin into their operations and, as the level of abstraction provided by APIs grows, more and more developers will be enabled to create innovative applications. As a result, the marketplace will continue to grow and continue to push the entire community forward.

42377919,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCcl,1419938294,Bitcoin Donations Can Now Fund Mine-Detecting 'Super Rats',"Belgian NGO and social enterprise Apopo is now accepting bitcoin donations to fund innovative humanitarian projects in eight countries across Africa and Asia.  With the announcement, it joins an increasing number of non-profits and charities that use bitcoin to tap into new global sources of revenue. The donations are being made through a partnership with payments processor BitPay.  Notably, Apopo uses giant pouched African rats for humanitarian purposes. Nicknamed 'HeroRATs', the rodents are trained to detect land mines and tuberculosis using their extraordinary sense of smell.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Christophe Cox emphasised the common vision of Apopo and bitcoin to empower and support people in developing economies through the means of modern technology.  He said:  ""We see bitcoin as a young, unique technology that matches with our overall vision, and this is our way of giving recognition to other innovators we believe in.""  “Although there are some risks with bitcoin, such as if its legality will be challenged, we also know that early adopters of such technology tend to be at the cutting edge when it becomes an industry standard,” he added.  Why rats?  Since 1998, Apopo’s trained rats have found more than 37,000 unexploded land mines and bombs in six countries, and identified over 7,000 tuberculosis sufferers in Tanzania and Mozambique.  Giant pouched African rats grow up to 0.9 metres (3 ft) long including their tail. Their poor eyesight means they have evolved a very keen sense of smell. This, combined with their intelligence, placid nature and long lifespan (up to eight years), means they are ideal for training as cheap, reliable detectors of explosives or disease.  The organisation says it costs an average of $7,300 to train one rat over nine months. This compares favourably with the use of mine detection dogs, which generally cost $25,000 to train.  Apopo receives donations from around the globe, predominantly the US, UK, Germany and Belgium.  According to Cox, bitcoin is an obvious tool to make it easier for supporters to get involved wherever they are, and he expects bitcoin will be one of Apopo’s mainstream donation channels in the future.  He said:  “There are clear advantages to receiving bitcoin donations over traditional methods, such as lower or no transaction fees, and as a way of reaching a younger online audience who are aware of global issues and savvy with new technology.”  As payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase do not charge fees for non-profits, the entire donation goes to charity.  Apopo is not the only non-profit organisation seeing the potential in bitcoin. Last month, the Ghana start-up Bitcoin Against Ebola was launched, alongside charities such as Save the Children, American Red Cross and Greenpeace, which have all joined the bitcoin community.

42377918,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCaF,1419905634,OKCoin Now Offers P2P Lending to International Users,"OKCoin.com, the international arm of China's OKCoin, has introduced a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending system it says will increase liquidity on its spot market and provide low-risk interest returns for users willing to loan their coins to traders.  It is the first time all OKCoin's users around the world will have the opportunity to access the lending feature. Traders can choose loans at their preferred interest rates, and are offered 2.2x to 3x leverage depending on their 'VIP level'.  OKCoin has previously deployed the lending system on its Chinese OKCoin.cn site, and says there has been a waiting list for loans. It hopes P2P lending will, as well as build USD spot market liquidity, encourage yet more bitcoin trading on the already high-volume exchange.  The service is similar to those available on other exchanges in the region, such as BitVC and Quoine, although BitVC's system works with fixed interest rates.  User-set conditions  The lending market automatically matches borrowers to the most suitable loan conditions, satisfying both parties. Users have the ability to set and choose their own interest rates and a loan duration of three to 360 days.  All funds available for lending are provided by other users; the company does not make any of its own funds available, and it does not provide a guarantee against default.  An OKCoin spokesperson told CoinDesk that, while defaults on such loans are ""exceedingly rare"", there is an option for lenders to take out insurance against this possibility at a charge of 10% of interest earned.  New Futures trading interface  In addition to the new lending features on the spot-price market, OKCoin has added a full-screen trading interface to its BTC and LTC Futures platforms. The new design has 'click-to-populate' orders and displays complete trading-position and market information without having to leave the page.  The fully interactive interface also offers a suite of drawing tools and numerous indicators for in-depth market analysis, as well as a choice of light/dark themes and various chart styles.  OKCoin says both the P2P lending features and interface upgrades are part of its ""aim to develop a seamless trading experience, with a strong focus on transparency and visibility of information for all traders"".  Launched  in July 2014, OKCoin.com is the company's Singapore-registered USD exchange. OKCoin itself is China's largest exchange by trade volumes, and has received over $10m in venture funding from such investors as Ceyuan Capital, Venture Labs and Tim Draper.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/30/okcoin-now-offers-p2p-lending-to-international-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7601fe9c68bcd187b6d92c6f0b11363708d3368a-1456x964.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
