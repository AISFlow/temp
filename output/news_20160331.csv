42398956,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhmtT,1459463106,Bank of Canada Researcher: Bitcoin Monetary Standard Would Fail,"A research consultant for Canada's central bank has published a new research paper that envisions a world that has established a monetary standard based on bitcoin.  The outcome, speculates author Warren Weber, would be a mix of good and bad in terms of impact on monetary policy.  Weber writes:  ""A bitcoin standard would have two major benefits over current fiat money standards. One is that there would be greater price-level predictability due to the known, deterministic rate at which new bitcoins are created. A second is that the resources currently devoted to hedging against fluctuations in exchange rates would be freed up to be used in more productive ways.""  Yet, there would be costs, according to the paper (which, as its author states, does not reflect and opinion or policy position of the Bank of Canada), namely a loss in control of central banks, which would have fewer policy levers to pull without the aid of a fiat currency like the US dollar.  This, argues Weber, is why central banks and governments would prevent such an outcome from occurring in the first place.  “One [reason] is to protect the seigniorage revenues that they obtain from the ability to almost costlessly create money,"" Weber writes. ""The second is to retain the ability to implement interest policies to affect their domestic economies. Governments would lose the ability to do either or both of these under the bitcoin standard.”  Read Weber's full paper here.

42398976,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhnCA,1459451749,Gallery: ConsenSys Plots Ethereum’s Future from Hipster Haven,"ConsenSys announced yesterday it had collaborated with Microsoft to implement its tools for building Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dapps) directly into the software giant's Visual Studio programming platform, a service that boasts more than 3 million registered users.  During a tour of ConsenSys' Brooklyn, New York-based headquarters earlier this month CoinDesk was given a behind-the-scenes look at where the company's 30 New York City employees are helping mount a global push into both the financial and digital sectors with their distributed ledger technology.    Outside, the ConsenSys headquarters don't look like your typical finance industry offices, with more hipsters than bankers passing by at a given moment. The walls are covered in graffiti – even if, in typical Brooklyn fashion, some of the work is commissioned.    ConsenSys co-founder Joe Lubin is also the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain upon which his new company is built. Previously, Lubin was vice-president of technology at Goldman Sachs division of private wealth management.  Based in a neighborhood known as East Williamsburg, 30 employees work out of ConsenSys' Brooklyn office.  Founded in mid-2014 ConsenSys is a completely bootstrapped startup – but that hasn't kept it from boasting its own version of the obligatory startup mini-bar.  In a conversation with CoinDesk, early employee Andrew Keys said the company was generating revenue but isn't yet disclosing the names of its clientele.  Keys said the company didn't want to be profitable quite yet. Instead, hoping to more-than double the number of employees to 150 people by the end of 2016. Above, the ConsenSys logo is emblazoned on a refrigerator in the small employee kitchen.  Lubin, who is also the CEO, works in a corner on the floor with the rest of the New York City-based employees.

42398962,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhn0M,1459447961,US Bank Regulator to Examine Distributed Ledgers in FinTech Framework Push,"The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has released a new white paper on financial technology innovation, proposing an approach to handling how banking institutions experiment with new technologies like the blockchain.  The agency, which oversees banking activity in the US, promoted the idea of what it called ""responsible innovation"" in the paper.  Citing the 2008 financial panic, the OCC said that responsible innovation means the use of new technology ""that is consistent with sound risk management and is aligned with the bank’s overall business strategy"".  Among the FinTech applications it cited is blockchain technology, which is mentioned alongside peer-to-peer lending and mobile payments. The OCC says that blockchain technology ""has the potential to transform how transactions are processed and settled"".  Comptroller Thomas J Curry said in a speech today that the OCC is creating a framework for examining FinTech innovations, and that it may seek to create an internal office dedicated to monitoring developments in this sector.  In the past, the OCC has called for a “balanced” approach to regulating bitcoin and other digital currencies. During a 2014 speech, Curry called the technology ""potentially revolutionary"".  The office said today that it wants to push all banks to take a measured, risk-based approach to new financial technologies, and further indicated that it will seek a culture change within its ranks through education and outreach programs.

42398970,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhn5H,1459441890,"Eyeing Volume, Asian Exchanges Add Support for Ether Trading","Following Ethereum’s production-ready software release earlier this month, digital currency exchanges are now adding support for the native token that powers its blockchain, ether (ETH).  In recent weeks, the majority of announcements have come from Asia, where exchanges in China, Japan and South Korea have all added support for ETH trading. Such actions follow the news that Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest digital currency exchanges, had added support for the digital currency on 12th March.  Regional exchanges that have since announced support for ETH trading including Coincheck, CHBTC, Korbit and Quoine – exchanges that have raised upwards of $5m in combined venture funding.  Quoine CEO Mario Gomez Lozada reported that his Singapore-based exchange has already seen an influx of trading activity for ether, telling CoinDesk:  ""We did a few thousand ether on launch day, most of it from Japanese traders, and we reached over 1,000 BTC trading volume in ETH/BTC shortly after. Our Japanese traders immediately embraced ether.""  The announcements coincide with escalating interest in ether trading after its market capitalization rose above $1bn earlier this month. At press time, its market cap had subsided, declining to roughly $937m after a period of price volatility.  The price of ether at press time was under $12 across exchanges, a figure buoyed by trader interest in the digital currency.  High hopes  Exchange representatives voiced enthusiasm for Ethereum, as well as their hope that it could extend the market for digital currencies by making headway on use cases where bitcoin startups have yet to find success.  ""Bitcoin was all about money. We hope Ethereum will be everything other than money. Therefore, it's natural for us to support ether,"" Coincheck business development lead Kagayaki Kawabata told CoinDesk.  Coincheck has since added support for leveraged ether trading, allowing traders to borrow up to five times leverage on ether trades.  Kawabata indicated that interest in Ethereum remains low, but he suggested that corporate interest, on the level of a regional Microsoft lending support, could boost awareness.  Further, Gomez Lozada said that he believes Ethereum is attracting new traders to his exchange and fostering interest in digital currencies and blockchain tech.  ""We have seen new traders joining the platform and exclusively trading ETH,"" he said.  Still, not all of the region’s exchanges are ready to embrace Ethereum. Xu Qing, a spokesperson for Huobi, said it is interested in the technology developments but that it has no plans to add support for ether.  Qing said:  ""We still keep an open mind to outstanding [digital currencies]. Any new digital currency needs time for market validation and acceptance ranging from issuing mechanisms to market liquidity.""

42398967,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhn6G,1459434629,Interpol War Game Models Chase for Bitcoin Blackmailers,"International law enforcement organisation Interpol conducted a war game scenario last week that centered on discovering the identity of a blackmailer demanding a more than $4m ransom in bitcoin.  Sixty-four participants from 26 countries took part in the event, according to Interpol, which was held over four days between 21st and 24th March. Teams received scores during the war game, earning points when completing certain objectives and losing points when making errors or asking for help.  According to Interpol, the war game centered on a fictional oil company that is being blackmailed by some unknown entity threatening to release corporate secrets unless bitcoin is paid.  The organization explained:  ""The investigation began after ‘Cracker10000’ published a page from a blueprint stolen from the fictional Petro oil refinery company on the 'Webspace' social media platform, and threatened to post other sensitive information unless a 10,000 bitcoin ransom demand was met.""  Interpol said that the teams involved gathered clues through fictional interviews and forensic analysis of electronic devices. A number of private-sector startups and technology vendors, some of which provided the tools used in the exercise, also took part.  The event was organized by Interpol’s Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI), a research office within the organization that has been working on digital currency issues for some time.  Early last year, the IGCI announced that it had created its own digital currency, a move it said would help Interpol learn more about the technology.  Further Interpol has used bitcoin and the blockchain as fodder for training sessions in the past. Last year, game participants used blockchain data to trace payments in and out of a fictional dark market.  Beyond research, Interpol has held events that focus in part on digital currencies, and last fall inked a deal to work with Europol, the law enforcement arm of the European Union, on investigations involving the technology.

42398958,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhmwQ,1459432020,Don't Blame Bitcoin for the Madness of Men,"Dr Philippa Ryan is a lecturer in civil practice and commercial equity at the University of Technology Sydney. Dr Ryan's area of expertise is commercial equity, in particular the liability of third parties to a breach of trust.  In this opinion piece, Ryan discusses the relationship between perceptions of bitcoin as a technology and activity in its historically turbulent global markets.  The virtual currency bitcoin is much-maligned, partly due to its shady history and its treatment as a trading commodity. However, with the dismantling of Silk Road and the collapse of Mt Gox, bitcoin is no longer a mere plaything for drug dealers and fantasy gamers.  It has real potential as a means to conduct seamless and secure online transactions. Its role as a key player in our FinTech future should be assured.  But in order to achieve this status, its price needs to stop fluctuating so wildly. The main cause of the bitcoin rollercoaster has been speculation. Speculation has consequences.  In 1720, when the South Sea Company collapsed, Sir Isaac Newton famously quipped, ""I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men"". Newton was referring to the frenzied trade in South Sea Stock that had gripped England and her neighbors. The collapse of the South Sea Company was the first global financial crisis. When the bubble burst, Newton himself lost the equivalent of almost $5m.  In the months leading up to the scheme’s demise, Daniel Defoe published a pamphlet warning against too much speculation. What would these learned gentlemen make of our recent interest in bitcoin? Newton would be fascinated by the ingenuity of our modern technology and Defoe (himself a tradesmen and very interested in finance) would likely be enchanted by the invention of an unregulated nationless currency.  But what would they think of all the speculation? I think neither would approve.  In 2013, the price of bitcoin soared from $15 in January to over $1,000 by the end of November. Bitcoin’s increasing value was loosely tied to its emerging legitimacy, but the biggest surge in price was driven by Chinese investors hoarding bitcoin and stashing it offshore.  For the first time, bitcoin was serving as both a digital currency and as an investment product in its own right. Whether bitcoin’s performance in 2013 meets the definition of a speculative bubble deserves a closer look.  Irrational exuberance  Bubbles begin by stealth.  The price of any commodity will only take off when smart institutional investors notice the product's potential value and step in. They buy while the price is still low and sell when it has made a gain over a short period of time. The first sell-off is followed by a dip in price, known as a ""bear trap"".  Once the investment has the media’s attention, public enthusiasm follows. Demand pushes the price up and then the madness sets in: namely, greed, delusion, fear, panic and finally despair.  In bitcoin’s early years, its price was even-tempered. In July 2010, one Bitcoin cost 9 cents. For the next 10 months, it hovered around this mark. Nothing remarkable happened until April 2011, when the price of bitcoin suddenly climbed steeply, spiked at $29.60 and then steadily dipped back to $13.00, which became the new normal.  This lasted almost two years. Then on 9th April, 2013, the price soared to $230, followed by a rapid sell-off and another dip in price.  An article in CNN Money published on 12th April of that year reported that the bitcoin bubble may have burst. In fact, this was just the bear trap. Frenzied trading ensued and on 4th December, 2013, it peaked at $1,047.25. It has not been back there since.  For the past two years, the closing price for bitcoin has fluctuated between $250 and $450.  The events of 2013 have all the hallmarks of a speculative bubble. What is the problem? All this volatility is giving bitcoin a bad name.  As we know, economic bubbles are driven by greed, delusion and fear. These emotions impair judgement. Greed lures us to believe in schemes and promises that are just too good to be true.  In bitcoin’s brief and turbulent history, fortunes have been made and lost. Some investors have been unlucky, but most were duped. In December last year, 10,000 investors lost $19 million in a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme. A number of exchanges have also completely imploded.  Some have fallen foul of hackers, while others have been shut down by regulators for running sham operations or laundering the ill-gotten gains of a black market.  Notwithstanding all these shocks and crashes, I would argue that we should not be put off bitcoin. Our negative impressions are borne of the way it has been used so far, but this will change.  The technology that drives bitcoin enables almost riskless storage and transfer of value and data. In an increasingly digitized world, this is a really useful innovation.  Once the regulators step in and (for example) curb the influence of speculative trading in bitcoin, its role as a legitimate currency will prevail and the madness will stop.

42398963,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhmvR,1459429808,Financial Stability Board Weighs Distributed Ledger Risks,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body aimed at improving the global financial system, reviewed distributed ledger technology as part of a meeting to set its 2016 priorities this week in Tokyo.  The FSB said it proposed a framework for categorizing financial technologies, including distributed ledgers, and assessing their impact on global financial stability. The topic was reviewed along other, broader priorities for the organization, which included promoting a more robust financial infrastructure and addressing new vulnerabilities in the financial system.  The official release noted:  ""Plenary members discussed the issues raised for public authorities by these technologies, possible steps to address potential risks and opportunities for cooperation in the FSB and with the standard-setting bodies to deepen analysis and develop regulatory perspectives.""  The statements follow indications from the group that it would seek to better understand the technology alongside its mandate of helping to mitigate another global financial crisis.  Notably, the FSB is chaired by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, whose agency has been vocal on the subject of blockchain and distributed ledgers.  The UK central bank announced in January it intends to explore applications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology, potentially for its own use.
