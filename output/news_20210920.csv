Antoni Trenchev said that while U.S. regulators have pressured U.S.-based lending platforms first (BlockFi and Celsius), any company with a presence in the U.S. will have to “cross the same bridge” eventually, including London-based Nexo. Trenchev did not respond to a question about whether or not regulators have already approached Nexo.  “We’re following the situations very closely,” Trenchev said. “When I say we, I mean both the legal team internally at Nexo and also the law firms we retain in the United States.”  First, Nexo is pursuing an acquisition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) licensed broker dealer through which it could offer “a modified version” of Nexo products. Second, the lender is talking with nationally chartered banks that might be willing to partner with Nexo and let Nexo offer its products under a bank charter. Third, Nexo would apply for an exemption to offer securities to non-accredited investors.  “We haven’t quite decided on the particular variations of the exemptions and exactly how we’re going to structure this,” Trenchev said.  Celsius, BlockFi, Nexo and Ledn offer both a lending product and a depository yield-earning product that is powered by the interest rates that each firm charges on the lending side of the house. Ledn did not respond to a request for comment.  Crypto lender Unchained Capital, for instance, told CoinDesk that it does not offer depository accounts and therefore no yield on deposits. Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, said on Friday that it no longer plans to offer a lending product that would have powered a savings account for customers with a 4% annual percentage yield.

Following the launch of smart contracts on the network, it has moved on to other projects to make sure that the network meets all of the needs of its developers. This has shone through in the latest release from the developer, called Hydra. The Cardano hard fork brought to the forefront the possibilities for more development. Even as developers outside of the main Cardano project develop their own solutions and protocols that run on the network, IOHK is continuing its work in making the network more scalable and safe for its users. This is why the release of the Hydra Layer 2 solution is important to the ecosystem. Layering Hydra On Top Of Existing Layer 1 Blockchain Hydra is a Layer 2 blockchain solution built to run on top of the existing Layer 1 blockchain on Cardano. Hydra uses isomorphic state channels which basically will use the same ledger representation over and over again to provide uniform, off-chain ledger siblings. These are referred to as Heads by the developers. This puts things like NFTs, native assets, and Plutus scripting directly into a Hydra Head, which acts basically as an extension of the current existing system.

The letter signed by Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, the Consumer Federation of America and others specified stablecoins, crypto lending and exchanges as key areas in need of more regulation.  ”Without significant regulatory guidance, the digital asset marketplace has been born and grown into a Wild West,” the groups wrote in their letter. “It is urgent for the Commission and other federal financial regulators to enforce the law to better protect investors and improve the integrity and stability of the digital asset markets.”  The groups wrote that rules governing securities had been in place for decades and urged the SEC not to undermine such regulations and their investor protections by creating “carve-outs” for certain crypto assets.  They also singled out stablecoins USDC and tether as assets that appeared to be securities similar to money market funds, and which could pose significant risks to investors.  The letter reiterates many of the same positions Gensler himself has espoused in testimony before Congress and in other settings, and arrives as the SEC and other regulators have started to pursue more actions against the crypto industry.

42394425,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdEJL,1632174381,"With Evergrande on the Brink, the ‘China Hustle’ Comes Home to Roost","The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped as much as 2.4% today – which, as a reminder to crypto traders, is in fact a whole lot in equities markets. One major narrative explaining the drop is centered on Evergrande, a hugely indebted Chinese real estate developer that appears to be on the brink of collapse.  Because its debt is held widely in China (and elsewhere), Evergrande could trigger much broader financial fallout if it defaults as the depth of its obvious insolvency becomes clearer. The final curtain, more or less, could come as soon as tomorrow, Sept. 21, when two major notes come due. One of those, according to Fortune, is currently trading at just 30% of its face value, reflecting a consensus heavily weighted towards default.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk’s chief insight columnist.  The situation has implications for the crypto ecosystem, both thanks to worries about Tether’s holdings of Chinese debt, and because crypto is clearly vulnerable to downturns in the broader market. In the 24 hours preceding this morning’s NYSE rout, bitcoin dropped 8% (which, as a reminder to equity traders, is a moderate swing in crypto terms. Store of value!).  Evergrande’s troubles are also part of a much bigger set of issues with the Chinese equity market, and particularly with the sale of Chinese equities in international markets. Very broadly, Chinese stocks are often treated the same as American equity by investors, but it is still unclear that Chinese accounting, due diligence and regulatory practices are anywhere close to being on par with those in the United States. That means Chinese investments can look sound on paper while being far riskier in reality.  The most egregious fallout from this was a wave of outright frauds between 2008 and 2016 detailed in the 2018 documentary “The China Hustle.” Perhaps hundreds of Chinese companies misrepresented themselves to international investors, with help (knowing or otherwise) from major global investment banks and respected public figures. Most of these were eventually delisted from Western markets, wiping out billions of dollars invested by average Americans – money that wound up in the pockets of the Westerners who engineered the deals and the Chinese CEOs willing to lie.  Read More: China’s Anti-Crypto Crackdown Is Different This Time | David Z. Morris  “The China Hustle” has a sterling pedigree. It was co-produced by Alex Gibney, who directed the 2005 documentary on Enron, “The Smartest Guys in the Room.” The second producer was none other than Mark Cuban. Yet, I somehow remained unaware of it until the past week or so, and I think others may have been as well. We all had a lot going on in 2018, I guess – which is a shame, because “The China Hustle” was a warning about a broader problem that still seems unresolved, and may be about to blow up in our faces.  The basic structure of the scam ran like this. Step One: A Chinese company, usually some heavy industrial operation like a mine or a paper mill, would acquire a defunct but still-registered U.S. company, then undertake a public listing on the U.S. stock market using the shell of the old company. Then it would hire a U.S. investment bank – usually a fairly minor one – to hype its offering with big promises of innovation and growth. Then, basically, the company would keep faking its financial results until the lie is discovered. The culprits would keep the money.  So it’s essentially a fraudulent initial public offering (IPO), except that it’s apparently completely legal thanks to the nuances of the setup. Listing a Chinese company in the U.S. via a shell company is known as a reverse merger, which is neither uncommon nor inherently deceptive. However, the reporting requirements for a stock listed using a reverse merger are substantially lower than those for a traditional IPO.  Chinese companies took full advantage of this, sometimes exaggerating company earnings by 10 times ahead of a public listing. It’s unclear how involved the American investment bankers who ran the stock listings were in the deception, but at the very least they didn’t look too hard – and they had no legal obligation to do so. (The risk of reverse-merger listings was also recently highlighted by the specialty purpose acquisition company (SPAC) wave, which used some similar legal loopholes to reduce transparency and have generally underperformed.)  “The China Hustle” focuses on the exposure of these scams by short-sale researchers, particularly Carson Block of Muddy Waters and Dan David, who has since founded Wolfpack Research. The heads of big companies and Wall Street sell-side banks love to castigate short-sellers as some breed of demon, but David and Block come across in the film as righteous crusaders, deeply offended by the legal grift they’ve uncovered.  David, Block and other researchers in the film are old-fashioned gumshoes, who not only ripped into balance sheets looking for clues but also traveled or sent agents to inspect the companies in question. What they uncovered is staggering. In one particularly memorable episode, an investigator visited a paper mill that was supposedly doing tens of millions in business and rapidly expanding. What they found was a nearly abandoned paper factory using antiquated manual production methods, half-flooded and at the end of a gravel road that couldn’t support the heavy trucks needed to transport the paper that wasn’t being produced.  Perhaps the most damning thing discovered in these investigations, though, was the active collaboration of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the fraud. One short-sale investigator, a Chinese national, spent a staggering two years in Chinese prison in conditions bordering on torture, simply for his role in trying to uncover the truth.  One by one, despite such headwinds, the shorts investigated the reverse-merger firms and found a huge proportion of the hundreds of listings to be Potemkin companies. They placed their short bets, then released reports that exposed the frauds – and made money as the stocks cratered. What’s not to love?  Read More: Evergrande and China’s Looming Risk to Tether | David Z. Morris  Well, there is the matter of the billions in losses suffered by retirees and grandmas taken in by these frauds, who have yet to receive justice. Some of their heartbreaking stores are featured in “The China Hustle,” a reminder that “white collar crime” is just as brutal, violent and traumatizing as a gun-thug stickup. Dan David, for all that he’s a hero for his role exposing the frauds, also clearly struggles with being on the opposite side of the trade from these victims.  But the truly shocking takeaway from the film is that nobody else is doing this kind of due diligence. That includes the investment banks, lawyers and respectable talking heads who signed off on these offerings and shilled them to a trusting public, collecting fat fees along the way. It also includes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which only verifies data provided by companies, and doesn’t investigate whether those numbers are accurate until after a fraud is uncovered by other means.  Enemy Number One in the “China Hustle,” though, is General Wesley Clark. That name probably has a familiar ring if you’re over 35 or so: Clark was a prominent candidate for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2004. After that, he went big into investment banking, becoming chairman of the board of the investment banking firm Rodman & Renshaw by 2007.  Under Clark’s chairmanship, Rodman & Renshaw became a primary conduit for Chinese stock frauds. Clark, who made himself available for on-camera interviews for the documentary, takes a standard line for folks in his position, essentially claiming that he wasn’t responsible for what went on while he was nominally in charge. Pressed on these questions, Clark eventually walks out of the interview (President Harry “The Buck Stops Here” Truman must have been rolling over in his grave).  There’s shocking stuff happening on the Chinese side of the equation, too – the imprisonment of that short investigator is just the tip of a much deeper iceberg. “The China Hustle” includes a conversation with an anonymous Chinese journalist who claims that Chinese regulators have no power to punish companies for misrepresenting themselves abroad. As we’ve discussed before in these pages, “the law” in China isn’t so much a fixed set of rules as a constant attempt to conform to the ruling CCP’s agenda, so such a policy would effectively mean global financial fraud is the official policy of the Party.  This remains the story behind the story of Evergrande, and why it matters for crypto investors. There’s little public discussion of the possibility that Evergrande itself is fraudulent, and the reverse-merger scam seems to have been scaled back. But even somewhat less egregious misrepresentations can and often will bring a company down, as was the case with Luckin Coffee.  This is particularly key to remember when discussing Tether’s holding of short-term debt. Tether recently denied that it holds Evergrande paper, but it has not denied that it holds Chinese paper more broadly. Even if Evergrande were the only patient in the intensive care unit, its debt could still trigger a default-driven unwind resembling the 2008 financial crisis, potentially destabilizing even completely above-board Chinese companies. Those debts are looking more and more like lottery tickets. So until Tether decides to actually implement some transparency, smart money might want to find a slightly more convincing safe haven.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,David Z.

In September, the exchange’s CEO Brian Armstrong announced the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had told Coinbase that it would sue the exchange if it launched the product, dubbed “Lend.” Coinbase later quietly updated a June blog post to announce “we are not launching the USDC APY program announced.”  The lending product was supposed to power a crypto savings account that would earn customers a 4% annual percentage yield (APY), a return that’s multiples higher than most savings accounts at traditional banks.  The SEC said Lend would violate long-standing securities regulations, pointing to U.S. Supreme Court cases including Howey and Reves, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote in a blog post.  Coinbase’s decision also comes on the heels of state securities regulators issuing warnings to crypto lending platforms BlockFi and Celsius, claiming these companies’ products violate state securities laws.  A Coinbase spokesperson referred CoinDesk to the June blog post when reached for comment.  Coinbase shares were trading down almost 5% to $233.32 on Monday afternoon, with the wider slump in crypto prices – bitcoin and ether are both down roughly 8% over the last 24 hours – likely pressuring shares.

42396908,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT747h,1632172824,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Sell-Off Deepens as Equity Volatility Rises,"Cryptocurrencies sold off on Monday as stocks suffered their steepest decline in weeks. Signs of stress in China’s credit markets over the weekend contributed to bearish sentiment across global markets and triggered a rise in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) to levels last seen in May.  Bitcoin dipped below its 200-day moving average and was trading at around $44,000 at press time. The cryptocurrency is down about 7% over the past 24 hours. Initial support is at the $40,000-$42,000 breakout level that was achieved on Aug. 6.  Roughly $1 billion in BTC liquidations occurred Monday morning, and more than 7,000 BTC left exchanges during the same period, according to data from CryptoQuant.  “Some have attributed the sudden dip to the ongoing Evergrande situation in China, which has already caused turmoil in traditional markets,” Jonas Luethy, a trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in email to CoinDesk, referring to the cash-strapped property company in China.  “Analysts have suggested a choppy week is ahead, with a potential bitcoin pullback to as low as $41,000, although a key support remains at $44,000,” Luethy wrote.  Some analysts expect equities to perform poorly, as well. “We think the mid-cycle transition will end with the rolling correction finally hitting the S&P 500,” Morgan Stanley research analysts wrote in a Monday report. The firm raised the possibility of a 10%-20% correction in the S&P 500 Index driven by deteriorating economic growth and valuation contraction.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $43,913, -7.3%  Ether (ETH), $3,070, -7.9%  S&P 500: -1.7%  Gold: $1,764, +0.6%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.311%  Bitcoin miner accumulation  Bitcoin miners have been in accumulation mode over the past six months, according to blockchain data compiled by Glassnode. The amount of unspent miner supply has climbed by roughly 13,000 BTC since January, which followed a period of miner distribution at the end of last year.  “After a small spend of around 1,360 BTC in late August, it appears miner balances are increasing once again,” Glassnode wrote in a Telegram post.  Further, “at a market cap of $900B, bitcoin is worth 29.7x more than its total input cost,” Glassnode wrote, which means miners have an incentive to accumulate BTC in hopes of a profit.  For now, crypto mining-related stocks are under pressure as the crypto sell-off deepens. Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) is down about 19% over the past month, while Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) is down 4%, compared with a 9% decline in BTC over the same period.  Fund flows rise on low volume  Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling $42 million last week, signaling another week of improved sentiment among investors. This marks the fifth consecutive week of inflows.  “This improved sentiment could be a seasonal phenomenon, but we are not seeing a commensurate rise in volumes in investment products,” CoinShares wrote in a report published Monday. “This suggests that some investors are taking advantage of recent price weaknesses and the continued rise in alt-coin popularity.”  Despite inflows of $15 million over the last week, bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, has suffered the most from negative investor sentiment with inflows in only three of the last 16 weeks.  Solana, which suffered a network outage that lasted nearly 20 hours last week, saw inflows of $4.8 million. Ethereum and multi-asset investment products saw inflows of $6.6 and $3.7 respectively.  DeFi correlations  Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens had an impressive run since July, although bullish sentiment is starting to wane. Some analysts point to the nearly 15% decline in Solana’s SOL token over the past week as a sign of profit-taking in the DeFi market.  The chart below shows DeFi tokens are fairly correlated with each other, but the correlation with ETH is relatively weak. “ETH had its monster rally earlier this year while DeFi lagged, which explains this phenomenon,” Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm, wrote in a blog post.  DeFi tends to move in and out of favor, albeit with short-term opportunities for investors to diversify their core BTC and ETH holdings given the weak correlations.  But over the long term, “the ultimate point still remains true: Most investors were better off holding ETH and BTC rather than playing the passive allocation game in DeFi,” Delphi Digital wrote.  Altcoin roundup  Christie’s will sell some of the earliest NFTs in its first ETH-only auction: The international auction house is listing the Curio Cards, Art Blocks Curated and VeeFriends non-fungible token projects in a live auction on Oct. 1. The full set of 31 Curio Cards, including the misprinted #17b, is estimated to fetch between 250 and 350 ETH, or between $870,000 and $1.3 million. The auction also marks the first time Christie’s live bidding will be denominated in ETH instead of the usual local currency.  Cross-chain protocol PNetwork loses $12M in hack: PNetwork, a DeFi system that allows different blockchains to communicate with each other, said it lost 277 bitcoins ($12 million) after an attacker found a bug in its code, reported CoinDesk’s Sheldon Reback. The attack targeted its pBTC token on the Binance Smart Chain, pNetwork said in a tweet.  Europe’s largest stock exchange to list TRON exchange-traded notes (ETNs): TRON, the cryptocurrency created by Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun, has arrived on the Deutsche Boerse, Europe’s largest stock exchange, in the form of a VanEck-issued exchange-traded note (ETN), reported CoinDesk’s Ian Allison.

The initial obligation is for $455,000 but can go up to a total of $1.37 million by 2024.  The contract with ICE is the latest in a series of contracts between Coinbase and the U.S. government, as tracked by Tech Inquiry. Coinbase’s latest contract has the highest overall ceiling of all its government deals, however.  In August, Coinbase signed a similar but smaller contract with ICE worth $29,000 to provide the border enforcement agency with licenses for its analytics software.  The exchange also signed contracts in April 2021 and May 2020 and with the U.S. Secret Service to provide access to its analytics software. Both of these contracts were initially under $50,000 in value, but had maximum values of $183,750.  Coinbase Analytics, the branch of the exchange behind its analytics software, emerged from Coinbase’s controversial 2019 acquisition of blockchain intelligence firm Neutrino.

They are backed by blockchain technology. The NFTs are sold online, frequently for crypto coins, and are encoded. Although NFTs use the same blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies, they&apos;re not a currency. In the digital and crypto world, NFTs are seen as the digital answer to collectibles, or are &apos;one-of-a-kind&apos; digital assets that have no tangible form, but can be bought and sold like any other asset. Or they can also represent real-world objects but fractional ownership can be shared by many using the Ethereum network and smart contracts.

Although Bitcoin mining has gained fame in recent years, the truth is a significant demerit is the amount of e-waste it generates. BTC mining causes thousands of computers and processors to be destroyed in a short time. BTC mining generates a large amount of money for the people who practice it, consuming a great amount of energy. Figures from the Netherlands and Asia state that BTC mining is potentially harmful.

The group placed three sets of non-fungible tokens up for sale Monday on Fanaply, a platform that bills itself as environmentally friendly, an ironic choice for artists whose albums include “This Toilet Earth” and “We Kill Everything.”  Perhaps reflecting the frenzied state of the NFT market, the first two collections – the 10 “Scumdog Legionnaires,” priced at $250 each, and 50 “Slaves of Gwar,” at $40 – sold out within hours. The cheapest set, Bohabs 4 Lyfe (named after Gwar’s nickname for die-hard fans), is priced at $20, with 250 tokens issued.  While those prices may sound cheap considering NFTs for artworks have sold for tens of millions of dollars, metal heads will have to pay a little extra to take possession of these digital collectibles. That’s because the tokens are issued on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, where high transaction volumes have driven up the price of “gas,” or fees for performing computations. Fanaply takes payment by credit card, and holds the tokens in a “managed wallet” until the buyer exports them to a personal wallet. (Disclosure: I know this because I purchased a Bohab Monday and found that transferring it to my MetaMask wallet would cost $125, six times as much as the token itself.)  In the bigger picture, Gwar is one of many musical artists experimenting with NFTs to make a few extra bucks and, if all goes well, promote a sense of community and ownership among its fans. A diverse range of performers from pop warbler Katy Perry to thrash icons Megadeth have issued these tokens, which are analogous to autographed posters or guitar picks thrown into the crowd. While anyone can download or look at a copy of a digital image, the “special” version is controlled by whoever holds the NFT in a crypto wallet.  Gwar, which has been putting on its cartoonishly gory stage shows since the 1980s, seemed a bit befuddled by the whole thing, with lead singer Berserker Blóthar saying in a statement: “Our manager, Sleazy P. Martini, tells me that with these NFTs our fans will get some cool, original, never-before-seen GWAR art, and they can own a little piece of the GWAR universe.

42394415,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdDU3,1632168483,OpenSea Scandal Shows Need for More NFT Regulation,"There’s a lot you can do with a non-fungible token. Digital collectibles can work as passports to online communities, or ways for artists to interact with their fans. Bands have turned NFTs into backstage passes, and the writer Emily Segal used an NFT as a fundraising mechanism for an upcoming novel.  But an insider trading scandal at OpenSea, now one of the most important marketplaces for NFTs, serves as a reminder that – for all their potential – NFTs are still very much a speculative asset. In a world where everything becomes an NFT, casual collectors will need to be assured that the system isn’t rigged in favor of insiders.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Last week, Nate Chastain, OpenSea’s head of product, resigned after being accused of front-running NFTs in the way a broker might front-run a stock.  If front-running doesn’t immediately feel like a useful rubric for understanding an NFT trade, consider what Chastain is accused of doing: in a Twitter thread, an account called @ZuwuTV explained how a group of Ethereum addresses would buy up NFTs just before they appeared on OpenSea’s homepage and then sell them once the prices went up.  Receipts from Etherscan.io – a record of transactions on Ethereum – appeared to connect these addresses to Chastain.  Collectors are constantly on the hunt for what they call “alpha” – any sort of special insight that might make them early to the next hot NFT project. And OpenSea, with a daily trading volume of around $77 million and big-name backing, is at the heart of the NFT ecosystem.  When an NFT is featured on the site’s homepage, there’s a good chance it’s about to get more valuable. Chastain, @ZuwuTV inferred, was using non-public information about the platform’s curatorial strategy to make a profit flipping NFTs. Think of these trades as capitalizing on a non-public form of “alpha,” over and over again.  After a swift “third-party review” early last week, Chastain was out at OpenSea.  It’s somewhat disingenuous to argue, as one prominent influencer did this weekend, that NFTs are a “non-speculative on-ramp to get started” in crypto. An NFT is very clearly an asset with a resale value that rises and falls. It can be many things – an artwork, a fundraising vehicle, a digital VIP pass – but more often than not, it’s something you can resell. Whatever an NFT is, it’s also a trading card. To buy one is to buy into the crypto market, which is to engage with those whiplash ups and downs.  The inherently speculative aspect of crypto is something that tends to get lost in the rhetoric surrounding digital assets. NFTs and decentralized applications built on Ethereum are always going to involve an element of risk. It’s something that’s built into the technology itself – the double-edged sword of blockchain tech, a blessing and a curse.  And as long as investments go up and down, there will be insiders trying to get ahead. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies to disclose executives’ stock trades for exactly this reason.  NFTs aren’t considered securities in the U.S., and regulators aren’t nearly as aggressive toward crypto as they are toward equities (at least not yet). @ZuwuTV has said he’s against further oversight, and that Chastain’s resignation is “the best we can ask for” in an unregulated market.  Read more: Has the Biden Administration Lost the Plot on Crypto Regulation? | Opinion  OpenSea has said it now explicitly prohibits employees from “using confidential information to purchase or sell any NFTs, whether available on the OpenSea platform or not.”  Community-backed enforcement is a tricky prospect – although Twitter has become a hub for self-appointed blockchain watch dogs, things can still fall through the cracks.  Crypto purists may bristle at the idea, but the path to establishing more trust in the market may involve ceding some ground to regulators. Say Instagram suddenly turned “likes” into NFTs and the first “like” on an iconic image came with the promise of monetary value down the line. It’s not hard to see how company employees could abuse inside information to get in early on, say, the first post from a celebrity new to the platform.  How would it look for companies to fight this on their own? Would it involve dedicated enforcement teams and periodic surveillance of employee wallets?  The crypto industry has a notoriously antagonistic relationship with regulation, but if NFTs are going to take off in a more mainstream way, buyers need to know they’ve got a fair shot.

42421213,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrgT,1632164166,Central Banks vs. Private Currencies: ‘The Future of Money’ With Economist Eswar Prasad,"The history of money is filled with conflict and competition. In some cases, bloodshed. In 13th-century China, for instance, Kublai Khan instituted what some consider to be the world’s first fiat paper money. It was forced legal tender for all debts under his domain, backed by the Grand Khan’s decree, and the punishment of death.  “Is this true for all fiat currencies?” Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, asks in his latest book, “The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance.” If it was before, it likely isn’t now.  Money is changing, Prasad notes. Cash is slowly being phased out. Digital representations of dollars are on the rise. Cryptocurrencies are laying down roots. Money, in short, is becoming more voluntary. There are more choices in how to spend money – there are credit cards and mobile payments – and even more choices about what money to spend.  “We’ve certainly come to an era now where private currencies are in real competition with central bank currencies,” Prasad told CoinDesk in a video interview.  A large part of Prasad’s book considers how central banks will deal with this monetary revolution. The major trendlines, of private companies creating their own money, the rise of open-source crypto projects, the fintech stack, have not even begun to play themselves out.  To stay relevant, governments around the world will likely issue their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This might be the most significant monetary event of all, which will have far-reaching consequences at every level of society.  Money will never have been more transparent, more programmable, more technocratic. In his evenhanded account, Prasad notes how CBDCs might give banks a run for their money as well as improve market access for the financially underserved. But they won’t solve every issue – like the perennial debate between security and privacy (more on that later).  Read more: CBDCs Can Stop Aid Falling Into Terrorist Hands | Netta Korin  It’s an ambitious book, covering the diverse landscape of digital money, and one that will remain relevant for years to come. That’s quite a feat considering the quickly changing nature of this field. Who can fault Prasad’s attention on Facebook’s proposed digital currency, libra (now renamed diem)? Indeed, the world is undergoing a monetary revolution, where kings rise and fall in a matter of days. Let’s be happy it’s less severe than Kublai Khan’s fiat.  CoinDesk caught up with the author to discuss Bitcoin’s legacy, the problems with CBDCs and more recent events that might make the history books. The interview has been lightly edited and condensed.  You wrote a book called “The Future of Money.” Just to start, in a decade will there be more or fewer currencies?  I suspect there is going to be a winnowing out of currencies. When money first came into being, it was largely private currencies circulating. With the establishment of central banks, private currencies were essentially driven out of business by government-issued currencies. We’ve certainly come to an era now where private currencies are in real competition with central bank currencies.  But in the world of decentralized and centralized cryptocurrencies, I think we are going to see a winnowing, which will leave a few decentralized ones and, more importantly, some centralized ones to continue competing with central bank currencies, at least as mediums of exchange.  Do you expect something like the digital euro or yuan would cause consolidation among state-backed currencies?  In countries that are small, or where the central banks themselves are not that credible, and where their currencies suffer from a lot of volatility or possibly inflation or hyperinflation, the easy availability of digital versions of major currencies such as the dollar, the euro or even the Chinese renminbi, or even stablecoins issued by corporations such as Facebook, could lead to the decimation of some of the smaller currencies.  Many of these currencies already live in the margins of viability, because their central banks are not seen as very trusted. So if you have these digital currencies, either government-issued or private, easily available for the citizens of some of these countries, you can well see them displacing their local currency.  Libra, now diem, features prominently in your book. The original vision was battered beyond belief, but the project isn’t necessarily dead on arrival. Will another private company ever attempt to do something of that scope?  Diem was noble in its objectives. It’s a more efficient fiat currency that could bring low-cost digital payments to the masses and create a low-cost efficient payment system for cross-border transactions that are cheaper, quicker and easier to track. I think those are very worthy objectives.  Read more: Diem: A Dream Deferred? | Opinion  And certainly there is a fundamental need even in advanced economies, such as the U.S., that diem is addressed to meet among people who lack easy access to low-cost digital payments. In the U.S., for instance, you need either a debit card or a credit card or a bank account to have access to most forms of digital payments.  In many emerging-market countries mobile payments are becoming the norm, but still there are many people left out of the formal financial system.  There is a question about whether one really trusts a corporation like Facebook to not end up monetizing the payment services it provides.  And there are also some financial stability considerations. You know, diem is supposed to be a stablecoin backed by reserves of dollars or other hard currencies. But the Diem Association indicates that the diem units will be issued against the backing of $1 cash or cash-like instruments. One thing the global financial crisis taught us is that cash-like instruments that may seem very liquid in normal times may end up not being liquid in abnormal times. You could end up actually with something like diem becoming an unregulated, money-market mutual fund, which creates all sorts of financial stability risks.  And furthermore, if you have central bank digital currencies, that undercuts the user case for diem, because the central bank is providing a low-cost digital payment system. Why do you need Facebook to be able to do this? So I think they are facing some real, technical, conceptual and also policy challenges.  Over the past two years, two extreme economic views gained prominence. MMT, the idea that central banks can print without limit and something like “the Bitcoin mind” that the fiat system is teetering on collapse. Is it possible to square those views?  The aftermath of the global financial crisis was a very fertile time for Bitcoin to emerge. After all, that was a time when trust in government institutions, including central banks, and trust in traditional financial institutions, such as commercial banks, was breaking down. So the notion of being able to conduct financial transactions without the intermediation of a central or commercial bank was a very attractive proposition.  One thing we have learned in the years since the financial crisis is that central banks still have a great deal of power to create money and provide liquidity to the financial system.  You might expect this sort of money creation to lead to a decrease in the value of the money, the dollar in particular, but other major reserve currencies have also held their value quite well. That makes people more willing to retain central bank money because they know, when the chips are down, the central bank will provide liquidity. That’s why fiat currencies retain their value.  This is a proposition limited to a very small number of reserve currency-issuing economies, including the United States, the eurozone, Japan, Britain and a handful of others. Smaller economies, developing countries certainly couldn’t get away with this lack of monetary discipline.  I think this raises the larger question about whether fiat currencies will be given a serious degree of competition by cryptocurrencies, especially ones that have restricted supply. That seems to be one of the key value propositions or something like bitcoin; they cannot be created at will.  Will bitcoin force governments to be more fiscally responsible?  The irony of bitcoin is it was supposed to serve as a medium of exchange without a trusted party intermediating that transaction. But it has not worked that well as a medium of exchange. It has a very volatile value relative to the unit of account in most economies. And, as we know, bitcoin is quite expensive to use, transactions are rather slow, and it is quite cumbersome.  Bitcoin has not delivered on its initial promise, but somewhat paradoxically, it has become a store of value, with people holding on to it as a speculative investment.  Bitcoins legacy is going to be a very rich one. The [generic] blockchain technology underpinning the network has enabled the creation of a vast array of new financial products and services. And I think it has shown a path towards more decentralized finance, which will bring many benefits.  The other ironic part of Bitcoin’s legacy is that bitcoin was meant to take the place of central bank money, while crypto might in fact spur central banks to create digital versions of their money to remain relevant at the retail level. But certainly, as mediums of exchange, I think offshoots of bitcoin, especially stablecoins, but also more centralized cryptocurrencies, perhaps including ethereum, will start giving fiat currencies some degree of competition.  There’s an idea that currencies can’t be both decentralized and non-volatile [without a peg]. Some bitcoiners think money has to pass through several phases as a store of value, as a global unit of account before it becomes a medium of exchange. Is that something that you’ve seen in the history of money?  In monetary history, it has actually worked the other way. Currencies that serve as mediums of exchange, because they’re effective in that function, start having intrinsic value that then allows them to be held as stores of value.  So it is not often the case that you have a store of value, that then starts playing a medium-of-exchange function. We do have other stores of value where the value seems to come from scarcity, like gold.  There are questions about whether something like ether – if Ethereum does adopt proof-of-stake – could serve as a more efficient medium of exchange, because it would then have lower latency and higher throughput. So maybe that might be a route to stability.  But it’s hard to see proof-of-work protocols successfully supporting mediums of exchange. Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade is supposed to provide smart contract functionality, which might actually increase the value of bitcoin, and improve its case as a medium of exchange, by improving its utility. But we don’t know yet how effectively that upgrade will be implemented.  What do you think the legacy of El Salvador will be?  El Salvador is trying to do what many other countries with very poor policies and ineffective central banks have tried to do: export their domestic monetary policy to some foreign party. (They did it before, when adopting the U.S. dollar as their national currency.) The notion of using bitcoin seems to be twofold. First, to escape the hegemony of the U.S. dollar and second, to ride on the bitcoin wave.  After all, if El Salvador can accumulate bitcoin, and contributes to making bitcoin even more valuable by convincing other countries to also adopt it as a medium of exchange, then El Salvador could gain some advantages as an early adopter.  But I think this is the Salvadoran living in a bit of a fool’s paradise. As I said, bitcoin doesn’t seem to have the ability to serve effectively in day-to-day transactions. And, ultimately, if you think about its ability to pay for imports, to meet its debt obligations, the reality is that El Salvador is still going to require real money. Bitcoin isn’t quite going to do the trick.  Read more: Bitcoin in El Salvador: Why Is It Worth the Effort? | Rodolfo Andragnes  The broader aspect is that the government is trying to make up for its weak central bank and economic policies by adopting a foreign payments system. Crypto, unfortunately, is not going to solve any of the fundamental problems the country is beset by. A quick fix like this is not going to succeed in the long run, not even in the short term.  Do you support strong privacy rights for CBDCs?  This is a fundamental question that central banks that are contemplating the issuance of CBDCs are going to have to grapple with. No central bank wants its retail money to be used for nefarious purposes, such as money laundering, terrorism, financing or other illicit activities. And the good thing about a digital form of your currency is it allows for auditability and traceability of transactions.  But if you have auditability, that means the public will have to compromise on its privacy and confidentiality in basic transactions.  I happen to think we should preserve privacy and other basic human rights in modern societies, and that is going to factor into the design of CBDCs. It looks like the technology will allow for some of these compromises to be stuck.  So, for instance, if you think about what China is doing in its digital currency trials, it is setting up low-grade digital wallets. These wallets provide a greater degree of privacy and confidentiality and transactions, but you can use them for low-value transactions. For high-value transactions, you have to meet your customer requirements and so on.  We may end up in a world where there are these different possibilities with CDBCs, some of which give you not cash-like anonymity, but at least some degree of transaction privacy and other forms of CBDCs that are fully traceable and auditable so that a central bank can be assured it is not losing control over how its money is used.  The elimination of cash will be a consequence of digital payment systems proliferating. The reality is, you’re going to live in a world where every transaction will leave a digital trace, such that the transaction is either [viewable] by a private payments provider or by the central bank or some government agency.  There is a question whether we want to live in such a world. This is not just a purely technocratic matter. It’s not just a matter of economic policy. These conversations are going to have to happen at the level of society.  For instance, the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, has made it very clear that while it can come up with the technical design for an e-kroner, the decision about whether or not to issue it will involve a decision by the country’s parliament. There’s urgency in every economy to have these discussions, because the reality is the use of cash is withering away fast.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday the Joe Biden administration is planning an array of actions to mitigate ransomware attacks, with a focus on payments. The Treasury Department will announce these actions next week, CoinDesk confirmed.  The Journal report did not specify how sanctions might be used to preempt future ransomware attacks or payments. A Treasury Department spokesperson declined to comment.  The report said these sanctions will “single out specific targets” rather than the overall crypto industry. The Journal also reported that additional anti-money laundering regulations may take effect that will bar crypto payments for illegal uses, such as paying ransoms.  These actions would align with recommendations from industry experts. Michael Daniel, the president and CEO of the Cyber Threat Alliance, a group of cybersecurity experts, told CoinDesk in June that trying to ban cryptocurrencies in general may not work.  “What seems to me is we have to find the right balance, policy balance between allowing the innovation that cryptocurrencies bring, the benefits they can provide and [bring] the protections we’ve built into the financial system to deal with criminal activity, to deal with money laundering,” he said at the time.  Read more: State of Crypto: Ransomware Is a Crypto Problem  The Cyber Threat Alliance was one of the groups that formed a Ransomware Task Force and published a report this spring arguing that strengthened know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules would be more effective than banning crypto outright.

Announced at Messari’s Mainnet event in New York City, the Polymesh network was designed to iron out the wrinkles encountered when shares in private companies are tokenized on Ethereum, for example. The Polymesh mainnet launch follows about a year of testing, including the last five months on an incentivized testnet with some 4,300 users, the company said.  Polymesh, a standalone blockchain built using Substrate, the same framework Polkadot is built on, will launch with 14 financially regulated entities acting as operators running validator nodes, including the likes of Entoro Capital, Tokenise and the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX).  Stock tokens 2.0  Issuing tokenized assets on blockchains opens up a super-efficient realm of new possibilities. But Ethereum and its ERC-20 token standard weren’t really designed with regulated players in mind, said Graeme Moore, head of tokenization at Polymath. (Back in 2019, Polymath helped spearhead the security token-focused ERC-1400 standard with mechanisms to restrict its usage based on identity, jurisdiction and asset category.)  There are a number of non-starters on Ethereum for regulated companies looking to issue and trade tokenized assets, according to Moore, such as the risk of forks, the need for know-your-customer (KYC) checks, the headache for institutions caused by probabilistic settlement and also the current cost of using the Ethereum mainnet.  “Polymesh has a forkless architecture and also a concept of identity at the base layer, so you have to go through a KYC process,” Moore said in an interview, adding:  “It becomes computationally expensive on Ethereum to do something like restrict Party A from transacting with Party B over a period of time, or just simple transactions like updating a whitelist can cost $100 a day.”  As well as the public launch of the proof-of-stake Polymesh network with its native POLYX token, the startup is also announcing the launch of the Polymesh Association, a non-profit based in Switzerland. The Polymesh Association will be equipped with $8 million and 250 million POLYX to offer for grants and incentives, according to a press release.  Setting up in Switzerland also involved a nod from the country’s markets regulator FINMA, said Moore.  “In Swiss law, I believe you can either be a payment token, a utility token or an asset token,” said Moore. “So we went through FINMA’s whole regulatory regime, and they’ve determined that POLYX is a utility token.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/20/polymath-to-launch-blockchain-built-for-tokenized-stocks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05db124431d64e2d9f0117e9f320d7a3e3b4a4d7-2129x1415.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round was led by blockchain investment firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) and included two other previous investors, Tim Draper and San Mateo incubator Boost VC. DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.  The funds will be primarily earmarked to open Ripio operations in Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay in 2021, Chief Brand Officer Juan José Mendez told CoinDesk, adding that the company will start operating in Spain in the first quarter of 2022.  Expansions into new markets will be done both organically and through acquisitions, Mendez said. In the coming weeks, the company plans to announce the acquisition of an exchange in Colombia, Mendez added.  In January, Ripio acquired BitcoinTrade, the second-largest crypto exchange in Brazil.  Ripio currently operates in Argentina and Brazil, where it has collectively reached two million users, according to the company.  The Series B funding round included new investors such as Amplo VC; Marcos Galperin, founder and CEO of Latin American marketplace MercadoLibre; and Martín Migoya, founder and CEO of software company Globant.  “This round is a natural step forward that allows us to continue building and expanding our products in the region, with the mission of broadening access to the crypto world, creating simple tools and offering quality educational resources for getting to know the crypto space,” Sebastián Serrano, co-founder and CEO of Ripio, said in a statement.  Ripio’s last round was a $2.25 million Series A in 2017, according to Mendez.  Ripio owns an app, an exchange and an over-the-counter (OTC) desk. The company is working on launching a business-to-business vertical with blockchain solutions for companies, a payments vertical and a decentralized finance (DeFi) vertical, Mendez said, without specifying details.

42396899,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT742m,1632150100,"S&P 500 Chart Signals More Trouble for Bitcoin, Risk Assets","Bitcoin dropped to one and a half-month lows Monday, alongside sharp losses in global equity markets and other growth-sensitive risk assets such as industrial metals, oil and commodity-dependent currencies.  The broad-based risk aversion may have just begun as futures tied to the S&P 500 Index have convincingly breached the long-held 50-day moving average support, or area of buying interest.  The futures are trading 1.8% lower at $4,341, below the former 50-day MA support-turned-resistance at $4,429.  The previous downside break through the average, seen on March 4, trapped sellers on the wrong side of the market. Since then, the widely tracked level has consistently reversed price pullbacks, serving as a point of entry for so-called dip buyers.  That means the latest downside break could be a harbinger of a deeper drop for bitcoin and other risk assets. And the pain may grow as macroeconomic risks are piling up.  “Bitcoin, falling nearly 10% today, is suffering from the broader market pessimism fueled by reports of a debt crisis at China’s Evergrande Group,” Hunain Naseer, senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “We’re also witnessing the negative sentiment permeate U.S. and European markets, and gold appears to be doing marginally well today along with the dollar index.”  Contrary to the widespread narrative that bitcoin is a safe haven similar to gold, the cryptocurrency behaves pretty much like a risk asset. “Almost every bitcoin correction in 2021 has correlated with an S&P500 correction of -2% or more,” Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, tweeted.  The S&P 500 has pulled back more than 4% from its recent high of $4,540. Analysts at investment banking giant Morgan Stanley foresee an even deeper correction. “The typical mid-cycle ‘fire’ outcome would lead to a modest and healthy 10% correction in the S&P 500. However, the ‘ice’ scenario is starting to look more likely, and could result in a more destructive outcome – i.e. a 20%+ correction,” Morgan Stanley’s research team said in the U.S. Equity Strategy note published Monday.  The market may bounce back, restoring the risk appetite, if the Federal Reserve pushes plans to scale back its stimulus out to 2022.  Several Fed officials have recently said they would like to begin tapering the stimulus before the end of this year. Some observers are worried Wednesday’s statement from the Fed’s Open Markets Committee may announce that the Fed will begin to taper its stimulus in October or November.  “The 22 September FOMC will likely signal a tapering decision at the next meeting, providing few details. The [interest rate] dots will likely signal one 2022 hike, and two added hikes in both 2023 and 2024. The risk skew is for more rather than less hikes; the added hawkish lean in not fully priced, in our view,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts noted, according to efxnews.com.  The dot plot is a graphical representation of each Fed official’s forecast for the central bank’s key short-term interest rate, which currently sits at a record low of 0-0.25%.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/20/sp-500-chart-signals-more-trouble-for-bitcoin-risk-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee927ba8995be197e78357a5ee1bd901c256efaa-1500x814.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since joining the firm in July 2019 (when it was still called Amun), Kssis helped to launch a number of crypto ETPs across several European stock exchanges.  The products provide exposure to BTC, ETH, BCH, ADA, XLM, DOT and S, allowing investors to ride the market without holding the underlying crypto asset.  According to a person with knowledge of the situation who wished to remain anonymous, when Kssis joined the company, assets under management (AUM) were at $30 million. The firm’s AUM surpassed $100 million last year, and have since skyrocketed to more than $1.85 billion.  The source said the whopping growth can be attributed to the range of products offered and bitcoin’s price rally.  Kssis has held a number of roles across the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector in his 18-year career. He has worked at Standard & Poor’s, State Street and XBT Provider, a CoinShares subsidiary.

He made his comments as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) discuss stricter regulations and frameworks around crypto exchanges.  Controls on lending products “if done properly, these programs can be great for consumers; if done properly, they can give consumers way higher returns on their assets,” Bankman-Fried said in an interview with Bloomberg.  Bankman-Fried said a ban on stablecoins would be “sad” given how useful they are. “There’s other sorts of regulatory interventions, which I think would be healthy.”  FTX is also looking to increase its presence in the non-fungible token (NFT) market, with exchange executives revealing plans to build their own marketplace to compete with OpenSea, the market leader.  Brett Harrison, president of FTX.US, told Bloomberg the company is in a good position to launch its platform, with the infrastructure already built out.

The company’s most recent shareholder letter said institutional trading accounted for 69% of Coinbase’s $462 billion in second-quarter trading volume.  In a blog post Monday, Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s vice president of institutional products, pointed to clients Meitu, MicroStrategy and One River as using the exchange’s “comprehensive platform to execute some of the largest trades in the industry.”  Tesla CEO Elon Musk, PNC Bank, SpaceX, Tesla, Third Point LLC and WisdomTree Investments were also singled out as clients in a shareholder letter last month.

As well as a TRON ETN (VTRX), global fund manager VanEck also launched SOL and DOT ETNs. The products are being listed on Deutsche Börse Xetra on Monday, with trading to commence on Tuesday, according to VanEck Director of Digital Asset Strategy Gabor Gurbacs.  “We are excited to launch a Tron, Solana and Polkadot [exchange-traded product] on the heels of growing network usage and adoption. ETPs provide high-quality market access, transparency and robust regulatory frameworks to access digital assets,” said Gurbacs in an emailed statement.  The listing of VTRX lends some credibility to TRON, a blockchain that uses a consensus system called delegated proof-of-stake, and which in the past has been branded a more or less centralized system, masquerading as decentralized.  Following German approval, VTRX is expected to be available in European Union countries, paving the way for access to additional markets such as London, Paris and Amsterdam Euronext to further broaden the investor base across European markets, according to a press release.  ETPs that track the performance of cryptocurrencies have become a popular way for institutions to gain exposure to the digital asset economy in a familiar setting.  Deutsche Börse’s Xetra trading venue became the first exchange worldwide to launch trading in centrally cleared crypto products back in June 2020, while VanEck was among the first asset managers to submit a bitcoin ETF application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

A positive value implies relatively greater demand for puts, a sign that investors are seeking protection against falling prices.  The gauge rose to 2%, the highest level since July 21, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy.  The one-week put-call skew has also jumped to a two-month high, touching 12%, alongside an uptick in the one-month gauge. Meanwhile, one-month implied volatility, or investors’ expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks, has risen slightly to an annualized 92% from 88%.  Sentiment has soured, with ether falling 8% to $3,070 in the past 24 hours amid broad-based risk aversion in crypto and traditional markets. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is also nursing an 8% loss. Other alternative cryptocurrencies trading in the red today include the native tokens of Cardano, Polkadot and Solana, which are all down about 10%.  Crypto and traditional markets have been hurt by the debt crisis at China’s cash-strapped property giant Evergrande and by the possibility that the Federal Reserve will begin to scale back its monthly bond purchases.  “I would not be surprised if there are liquidations [forced unwinding of long positions] on ether nearing that could trigger a further drop,” said Laurent Kssis director of CEC Capital, an independent crypto financial services firm. “This downward movement was anticipated last week and may continue for a few more days, if not a week.”  Still, some analysts remain bullish for the long term. Simon Peters, a market analyst at eToro, said in a daily note that with the burning of ether, scarcity of the token will grow and theoretically raise prices for the crypto asset.  Since Ethereum’s London upgrade on Aug. 5, more than 300,000 ether tokens have been burned. That amounts to roughly $1 billion worth of the token.",NEGATIVE,없음,ADA | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/20/ether-options-market-shows-bias-for-price-weakness-over-3-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c25a8a87b7eb982bdf56078a8f9a5425aa9b915d-2560x1632.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speculation that the U.S. government may declare stablecoins as a risk to the financial system could be adding to uncertainty in the crypto market.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently priced at $44,800, down 5% on the day. The broader market is a sea of red with cardano, ether and solana nursing losses of as much as 7%, CoinDesk 20 data show.  Futures tied to the S&P 500 Index, Wall Street’s main equity index and the global benchmark for risk assets, are trading 1% lower alongside similarly sized losses in European stock indexes and shares in Hong Kong and Japan.  “Investors look to be taking risk off the table on fears that [a] crisis at China Evergrande Group may become a systemic problem to global markets,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, said. “Markets will also be looking at the Fed commentary later this week to make sure that there are no changes in liquidity from the central bank.”  Evergrande fell more than 10% in Hong Kong early today, taking the year-to-date drop to 85% on concerns the cash-strapped property giant might default on $83.5 million in interest payments due this Thursday. Chinese authorities have already told major lenders that the company is likely to miss payments. While some observers have called the Evergrande crisis China’s “Lehman moment,” Messari’s Mira Christanto says such fears are overblown. (In 2008, investment bank Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, a move that triggered a big sell-off in stocks.)  The two-day Fed meeting, which concludes on Wednesday, will be keenly watched by investors for clarity on the central bank’s plans to scale back, or taper, the liquidity-boosting stimulus program.  Communications from the Fed members have been hawkish in recent weeks, with many calling for a beginning of the taper before the year’s end. Bitcoin and other asset prices, in general, could face selling pressure if this week’s meeting confirms that tapering will begin in October or November.  The greenback is rising ahead of the Fed meeting, reflecting a flight to safety and speculation the central bank will signal an October or November taper. The dollar index, which tracks the currency’s value against major fiat currencies, has jumped to a one-month high of 93.34, extending a two-day winning streak, according to TradingView.  Aside from macro factors, impending regulatory action on stablecoins – the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies that promise stability and act as a gateway to crypto markets – could be adding to selling pressure around bitcoin.  A New York Times article on Sunday said U.S. regulators are concerned that stablecoins may become a source of volatility and may bring the dollar-pegged currencies under regulatory purview by declaring them as a risk to the financial system, or treat them as securities, money market mutual funds or as banks. While Washington’s discomfort with stablecoins is not new, the fact that a mainstream media outlet ran a cover story suggests regulation is coming soon.  A recent Bloomberg report said officials are considering launching a formal review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council into whether stablecoins pose an economic threat, a process that could bring more severe oversight on the rapidly expanding industry. The total market capitalization of all stablecoins, including tether, has seen a nearly 10-fold rise to $115 billion over the past 12 months. A regulatory crackdown may bring short-term pain to crypto markets.  These issues, coupled with the quarterly bitcoin options expiry due this Friday, may keep the cryptocurrency volatile this week. Balani said, however, the underlying trend will remain bullish while bitcoin holds above $40,000.  Past data shows September dips pave the way for larger bull runs, particularly those seen after a halving year. Bitcoin underwent its third mining-reward halving in May last year. The first and the second halvings took place in 2012 and 2016.  Bitcoin dipped 1.37% in September 2013, only to rally from $100 to $1,100 in the following two months. It staged a similar rally after the September 2017 dip of 8%.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/20/bitcoin-slips-below-45k-as-sp-500-futures-drop-stablecoin-regulation-fears-resurface,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e632ffb04dd7a7a22f39a16d12afe7ccf4c8bcc7-1300x929.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
