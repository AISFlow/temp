42382748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sngl,1569609908,A Dangerous Bug in Bitcoin's Lightning Network Has Been Fixed,"A popular payments network running atop the bitcoin blockchain suffered from a long-standing code vulnerability – one where attackers could drain users’ of their money.  While initially flagged to the public on Aug. 30 by bitcoin developer Rusty Russell, the full disclosure detailing how this vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker was released Friday.  “An attacker can claim to open a [lighting payments] channel but either not pay to the peer, or not pay the full amount,” Russell wrote in the full disclosure.  The lightning network is a Layer 2 payments protocol enabling ultra-fast and nearly costless transactions atop the bitcoin blockchain. In order for users to send transactions across the lightning network, they must open what are called “payments channels” to send and receive funds from other lightning users.  Without the proper checks, an attacker could pretend to open a new payments channel and send fake transactions. Being duped, an honest user could then send back real money to the attacker not knowing the previous transactions had been completely artificial. It’s unclear how many users fell victim to such attacks.  Already, all major lightning software clients have been upgraded to fix this vulnerability, according to Russell.  When asked why it took three months for the vulnerability to be disclosed to users, Pierre-Marie Padiou – the CEO of a company maintaining one of the three most popular lightning implementations – said developers had to err on the side of caution.  “The problem with this vulnerability is that once you know about it, it seems so obvious,” said Padiou. “Three months is not a long time. It’s a pretty short time because you have to give users the amount of time needed to update. … A lot of users don’t do it.”  Lightning developers, he added, did not want to risk revealing the vulnerability until absolutely sure no users were at risk.  “There are always problems. Even on the bitcoin protocol, there have been bugs,” Padiou said, adding:  “There will always be bugs. What matters the most is how to handle this in the best way to protect users.”  Acinq software developer Bastien Teinturier image via Twitter",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/27/a-dangerous-bug-in-bitcoins-lightning-network-has-been-fixed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b778b12d15e7c4fd65afb060e35abb5cdadc0590-1500x1109.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9snaT,1569603606,"Iranian Bitcoiners Risk Fines, Jail Time as Government Regulates Mining","The Iranian government has been cracking down on cryptocurrency mining operations over the past three months, pending new legislation for formal mining licenses.  Since authorities have not officially approved a mining license process, several sources told CoinDesk that bitcoin miners are now operating in a climate of perpetual fear.  In rare cases, they can be jailed for continuing to operate. More often, they face exorbitant fines or have their equipment sealed off.  “If the government learns about my equipment, they’ll seal it and turn it off,” one small-scale bitcoin miner, operating just 15 machines in Tehran, told CoinDesk, adding:  “I’d be arrested. … After six months of waiting [for licensing regulations], they still want to make miners seem like criminals.”  Another professional bitcoin miner estimated the government has confiscated 80,000 mining devices over the past four months. It’s hard to say what the real numbers are, since they are not publicized. But this second bitcoiner alone lost access to thousands of machines, as he was operating an industrial farm connected directly to a power plant. He said 30 households lost their income when the government shut down his operation.  Plus, he says he personally knows more than 15 bitcoiners who were jailed.  “We have to wait for the Ministry of Energy, and the [new] regulations, to make a protocol with tariffs for our business,” he said.  An anonymous bitcoin developer in Tehran, who often works with miners, told CoinDesk many bitcoiners surrender the deeds to their homes to get out of jail, because the fines themselves can be worth more than their annual salaries. He said the fines range from $2,000-5,000 per machine, which is several times their retail value.  “There are also fines on the price for electricity,” he added, explaining that the electricity fines are often four times the annual cost of power for the machines. For example, if the mining farm paid $5,000 for a whole year of electricity, the fine for using a subsidized electricity source could be $20,000.  In Iran, the state-controlled electricity prices vary according to use-cases and the category for bitcoin mining has yet to be formally established.  As for the second miner who lost access to his industrial-sized operation, he told CoinDesk his company has an “open case” in court over a fine. He expected to be charged twice the market value for thousands of machines. But he’s unsure how he will be able to pay.  Smuggled equipment  These bitcoin miners face compliance hurdles from multiple agencies, related to both smuggled equipment and subsidized electricity fees.  The anonymous developer said most computer equipment and luxury goods are technically smuggled, from air conditioners to televisions sets. He said foreign grey market products are usually cheaper and higher quality than those sold through official retailers.  “If [the government] really wanted to fine all the people in the country using or selling smuggled merchandise, they’d have to fine everyone in this country,” he said, adding:  “Yet in just one area in the southern part of Tehran, a dozen [mining] farms were [recently] closed.”  As reported by a Tehran-based journalist for Bitcoin Magazine, the acute focus on finding bitcoin miners is wreaking havoc on the Iranian crypto community.  A survey of 600 Iranian bitcoiners, conducted over the past two weeks by the market research firm Gate Trade, found that 40 percent of respondents said the lack of regulatory clarity was their ""biggest challenge related to bitcoin.""  Another miner operating near Tehran, also tapping into an industrial power plant, said up to at least 30 people associated with his farm haven’t had income for over a month. Plus, he said people with smaller, personal miners are afraid to move their equipment these days.  “If you were caught by the police having mining equipment in your car, your equipment would be seized and you would be charged with a penalty for handling or moving illegally imported machines,” the third miner said.  Indeed, local news outlet Fars News reported in July that several unnamed individuals were arrested in the southwestern city of Saveh for transporting smuggled mining equipment.  Power battles  Given this context, the growth of Iran’s bitcoin mining sector is screeching to a halt, with some bitcoiners taking small operations deeper into the proverbial underground and others halting completely.  Just like the second miner, the third mining farm operator’s machines are now sealed under government control, as he too has a pending court case.  Both this third miner and the developer said there is no evidence to suggest the government is mining bitcoin with confiscated equipment, and they hope it will remain that way.  To be fair, the third miner also said many people steal electricity for bitcoin mining, though he said his operation had a contract with a power plant. He personally doesn’t know anyone who went to jail over the summer. Most of his associates either lost access to their equipment or had to stop working.  “All we want, as people living in Iran, is for our government to understand the importance of this opportunity,” the third miner said, speaking to the hope that Iran will become a hub for bitcoin mining operations.  The second miner agreed. Imagining a worst-case scenario, he added:  “Otherwise, we’d have to sell [our equipment] like garbage.”  Iran image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/09/27/iranian-bitcoiners-risk-fines-jail-time-as-government-regulates-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0acd51017f6936c67c05b5814d2be551dd45e9fd-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With its acquisition of decentralized payments platform Logos Network, Ripple’s investment arm, Xpring, will add nine New York-based engineers. Logos founder and CEO Michael Zochowski will become Xpring’s “Head of DeFi Products.” Xpring did not disclose the price of the deal.  Before joining Xpring, Logos was working to build a payments network inspired by the bitcoin blockchain, with a focus on a scalable, rapid network that still maintains high levels of security.  The Logos acqui-hires will now help Ripple build XRP derivatives, loans, futures and forwards, said Ethan Beard, senior vice president of Xpring.  “We’re still at the early stage of figuring this out,” Beard said, adding:  “We’ve made investments in DeFi companies in the past. We invested in Securitize and Dharma, but it’s now an area where we’re building.”  Part of Xpring’s focus is to identify use-cases outside of the company’s payments network, RippleNet, to build a network of companies around XRP. So far, the company has committed $500 million to 20 companies, including both equity investments and XRP grants, like the $265 million deal brokered with content platform Coil.  With the Logos acquisition, Xpring now has a team of 32 employees, having grown from a team of just two last May. Beard hopes the same financial institutions that take advantage of RippleNet to achieve real-time payments and real-time fiat settlements will be interested in XRP-based DeFi products.  “In particular, I’m interested in debt and lending and what that looks like,” Beard said, adding:  “It didn’t take long after the first creation of fiat for someone to go to a person who had some and say, ‘Hey, can I borrow that?’”  Ripple CTO David Schwartz via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | XRP,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/27/ripples-xpring-looks-to-build-xrp-defi-products-with-new-acquisition,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc632c4d72a02bdf6b6d47495c6ac9e8da89a0a5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mark Cliffemight, speaking in an ING video published Friday, argued that the Facebook-led Libra cryptocurrency project is putting pressure on monetary authorities. With Libra slated for launch in 2020, central banks ""would have"" to make a move in that timeline.  ""I think we've already got some sense of urgency amongst the policy community,"" he added.  Addressing the benefits for central banks, Cliffemight explained that a digital currency would allow banks to replace physical cash and therefore ""move even further into negative territory with interest rates.""  It would ""open up a whole range of policy options,"" the economist said, as well as providing other ways to support economic activity in a future downturn.  There are already hints that Libra is prompting central banks to more seriously consider the digital currency path.  At the same time as French economy and finance minister Bruno Le Maire said he planned to block Libra in the EU in mid September, he also revealed he'd discussed the creation of a “public digital currency” with outgoing European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde, who will take over his position later this year.

42382762,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9snx7,1569583535,Bitcoin Approaching Biggest Weekly Price Loss of 2019,"View  BTC looks set to register its biggest weekly loss of 2019, having fallen by 20 percent since Monday.  The cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the key 200-day moving average and risks extending the drop to support near $7,500 over the next few days.  A 4-hour chart indicator is calling a corrective bounce, but it will likely be short-lived.      Bitcoin is on track to post its biggest weekly loss of 2019, having found acceptance below key support for the first time in nearly six months.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $8,030 on Bitstamp, representing a 20 percent drop from this week's (Monday's) opening price of $10,022. That is the biggest weekly loss of 2019 assuming prices remain at similar levels until Sunday's UTC close.    The biggest loss of 2019 so far was a 13 percent fall back in the second week of January, so any greater loss this week would be the most severe of the year to date.    As seen above:  Bitcoin looks set to confirm its 16th weekly loss of 2019.  The cryptocurrency has registered double-digit weekly losses only twice in the first six months.  Prices have registered double-digit weekly losses four times in the third quarter.  The 13 percent drop seen in the second week of January turned out to be a bear trap:s prices bottomed out around $3,300 over the next five weeks before breaking into a bull market in April.  The latest two-figure drop, though, indicates the bull market from April's lows near $4,000 has ended and the sellers have regained control.  It's worth mentioning that the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the 200-day MA for the first time since April 2. The breakdown of the long-term support has further confirmed a bullish-to-bearish trend change. The average is currently located at $8,352.  All-in-all, a corrective bounce, if any, over the weekend will likely be short lived and the cryptocurrency could close below $8,719 on Sunday, confirming the biggest weekly loss of 2019.  Weekly chart  BTC has dived out a narrowing price on the weekly chart, confirming a bearish reversal.  The 14-week RSI has dipped below 50 for the first time since the end of March. A reading below 50 indicates bearish conditions.  The MACD histogram is producing deeper bars below the zero line, also indicating a strengthening of bearish momentum.  4-hour and daily charts  On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has produced higher lows, indicating scope for a corrective bounce. Further, the 14-day RSI is reporting oversold conditions with a sub-50 print.  Hence, a minor bounce, possibly to levels above the 200-day MA at $8,352 cannot be ruled out.  The daily chart, however, is biased bearish. For instance, the MACD is indicating strong bearish momentum, and the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending south. These averages currently located at $8,553 and $9,337 could offer strong resistance.  Recovery rallies, if any, could be reversed, possibly leading to a deeper drop to $7,500. The bearish setup would be neutralized only if prices rise above $9,097, as discussed yesterday.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9snZD,1569580264,Harbor's Regulatory Wait Ends as FINRA Awards Broker-Dealer License,"Harbor Square Investments, a subsidiary of tokenized securities platform Harbor, has received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), company executives told CoinDesk on Friday.  The move breaks a lengthy standoff between aspiring crypto broker-dealers and the U.S. regulators who approve them. For more than a year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and FINRA slow-walked Harbor's and roughly 40 other crypto firms' applications, voicing concerns that the digital assets they trade causes investors undue risk.  Broker-dealers can buy and sell securities on their own and on their clients' behalves. In the crypto space, a broker-dealer who treats digital assets as securities could bring market them to institutional investors. But they face strict requirements from the SEC and FINRA.  An array of crypto dilemmas – private key access, record-keeping, asset custodianship – stymied the regulators' processing of applications.  “It took the regulators a long time to get a handle on the space and understand it and its implications,"" Harbor CEO Josh Stein told CoinDesk. “This was very new for the SEC and FINRA, and they wanted to do it right.""  FINRA's BrokerCheck web service confirms the news, showing four listings for Harbor Square as of this morning.  Overcoming the blockade  Though financial a newcomer, Harbor adopted a conservative mindset more closely associated with Wall Street banks than Bay Area startups to overcome regulators’ concerns.  Stein said:  “People, processes, and tech. We concentrated on institutional-grade people, institutional-grade processes, and institutional grade tech from the beginning.”  Over a year ago, Harbor’s compliance officers prepared reams of in-the-weeds documents for regulators, who went through the 500-odd pages “with a fine-tooth comb.”  “It’s like writing the War and Peace” of compliance, Stein said. Every process, from the on-boarding of new hires to the documentation of instant messages, and countless others, can be wrapped up in these required filings, called Written Supervisory Procedure.  Harbor also chose familiar faces for its compliance team. The firm’s chief compliance officer, Steve Longo, has worked as a compliance czar for Citigroup and JPMorgan, and sits on FINRA’s continuing education council, according to Stein.  Full-stack services  With its broker-dealer license secured, Harbor plans to become a “one-stop shop” for digital asset issuers.  “We're going to provide the technology platform to manage the fundraising, the technology to manage investors, the technology to tokenize and enable liquidity,” Stein said.  This streamlined process had been impossible before Harbor’s licensure, largely because the firm could only make introductions to partner broker-dealers then.  The firm had been prohibited from handling other key processes, such as performing due diligence, which Stein said issuers want. Broker-dealer status changes that.  Now, “we’ll assemble the BDs, do some interviews, put together all the paperwork, all the due diligence,” Stein said. “All the things that are so difficult today is now a seamless, easy experience.”  The shape of things to come  Harbor’s licensing may carve a path for other digitally native broker-dealers to gain approval, perhaps ending U.S. regulators’ lengthy blockade.  Stein suggested that it's a sign of the maturing industry – and of the SEC and FINRA taking this less-than-a-decade-old asset class more seriously.  “The regulators are saying: ‘Hey, this is a regulated activity that a broker-dealer should go do. They should go sell these digital securities, because that’s perfectly legitimate, appropriate and within the regulations.'”  After Harbor's licensing, Stein said more crypto broker-dealers may break through – “That’s a big deal for the whole industry.”  Josh Stein image via Harbor",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/27/harbors-regulatory-wait-ends-as-finra-awards-broker-dealer-license,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f9062a891da33cfd8d39292716c4d20ea54fd10-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Talking at a blockchain event hosted at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva – where the non-profit association is incorporated – managing director Bertrand Perez said the cryptocurrency could help the intergovernmental organization achieve its sustainable development goals (SDGs) in areas such as eliminating poverty and achieving gender equality.  Libra is planned as a stablecoin backed by a reserve of fiat currencies and government bonds. It is slated for launch in mid-to-late 2020, although Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg yesterday appeared to suggest that timeline is not set in stone.  Perez also addressed concerns from regulators that Libra could be a threat to national monetary policy, saying it is not creating money with the project.  France has said it would seek to block Libra in the EU due to the threat to its ""monetary sovereignty,"" while Germany and the U.S. have also expressed similar fears.  Perez stressed:  “We are not in the area of implementing any monetary policy with the [Libra] Reserve.”  Forbes also reports that, during the 73rd United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) this week in New York, that blockchain is increasingly being viewed as a tech that could help the organization achieve its SDGs.

In a blog post on Thursday, Binance chief compliance officer Samuel Lim said that the exchange had worked with the Metropolitan Police Service's Cyber Crime Unit in the investigation of a Bulgarian individual who was suspected of developing and selling scripts for phishing campaigns that targeted users of over 50 services.  The scripts allowed other criminals to obtain personal details from users of those services, which was in turn said to be sold on the dark web.  All in all, Lim said around 500,000 people were targeted, a majority by email, with the criminals raking in £41.6 million (over $51 million) from their victims.  However, according to the post, the Bulgarian was recently extradited to the UK. He stood trial at Southwark Crown Court in London and, after pleading guilty to five counts of fraud, he was handed nine years in prison.  While Li doesn't identify the individual, a report in The Register on Sept. 20 names him as Svetoslav Donchev, 37, from the city of Pleven.  The piece further details that the phishing scripts were embedded in clone websites of 53 legitimate U.K. companies and sent gathered data on users to a server controlled by the criminals. They would then target the potential victims with phishing emails.

42382759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sntL,1569571219,"Lightning Sucks, But It Could Help Build a Bitcoin Economy","“Profit is a bug.”  That’s according to Lightning Network co-creator and Lightning Labs co-founder Tadge Dryja, who spoke earlier this month at Scaling Bitcoin in Tel Aviv. (Dryja left Lightning Labs in 2016.)  However, 18 months after the namesake startup released the beta version of LND, Dryja’s sentiment is not stopping nearly a dozen lightning-related firms from pushing toward monetization.  Such is the case with Roy Sheinfeld, CEO of the mobile wallet startup Breez.  Since launching in June, the mobile app’s 11,000 monthly users have conducted 7,367 transactions worth 4.23 bitcoin (roughly $35,000 at today’s price), Sheinfeld told CoinDesk. The app already offers direct integration with Bitrefill and Moonpay, which allows users to pay certain bills and purchase crypto.  Plus, Sheinfeld said he plans to expand the startup to follow the Internet Service Provider (ISP) model, operating channel connectivity for users as a Lightning Service Provider (LSP). Breez currently dedicates 10 bitcoin to managing channels for users, and Sheinfeld hopes to encourage more startups to do the same.  “I need to form a coalition, to bring more players and to bring more liquidity. You choose a provider, and you can choose multiple providers, so you can choose who you connect to,” Sheinfeld said at the D&DD conference in Tel Aviv earlier this month, adding:  “I think we can make money by providing channels as a free service then provide premium services for more reliability, more capacity, stuff like that.”  On one hand, lightning-centric payment startups like Bottle Pay continue to attract interest from venture capitalists. Likewise, the lightning payments app Fold just raised $2.5 million to give bitcoiners a chance to spend their crypto at retailers like Target, Macy’s and Domino’s.  But on the other, merchants are still cashing out in fiat and Fold is handling channels on behalf of users. It’s unclear how the economics of such services will play out as usage increases. After all, keeping channels open locks up precious bitcoin.  As such, the jury is still out on whether Sheinfeld’s vision of building a “lightning economy” over the next five years is remotely probable.  Competing visions  Although some hobbyist node operators currently make a few dollars a month in bitcoin, via routing fees, Lightning co-creator Dryja told CoinDesk that providing such services probably won’t be a profitable business model, even if adoption increases.  Dryja stopped working on the open-source technology last year, because he felt the current development process, spearheaded by Lightning Labs and Blockstream, diverged from his vision for the bitcoin scaling solution.  From his perspective, micropayments of just a few cents can’t scale in a secure way. Yet some advocates suggest the network could do this, rather than offering a cheaper way to do a few dollars worth of payments when bitcoin network fees rise.  Regardless of technical disagreements, Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun told CoinDesk he imagines a “closed economy” with people both paying and receiving money through lightning, especially payments like hourly wages.  While Breez aims to convince other startups to also become LSPs, Lightning Labs is focused on providing software management services to businesses across the bitcoin economy.  “We are an infrastructure provider,” Osuntokun said. “[We build] the tooling, things to run nodes … ways to manage your capital or coins on lightning more effectively, things like that.”  While Lightning Labs has a wallet of its own, Osuntokun said he would encourage others to fork the open-source software and focus on wallets for different use cases. As Osuntokun said:  “In other industries, you have companies like Google that do work on open protocols. … I think it’s good that there are different wallets because maybe some will be for power users, others for tipping. We are doing some user testing ourselves and others are as well.”  User expectations  Speaking of user testing, Dryja said he’s worried developers are focused on “cool, fancy features” without focusing on making a stable network that addresses user needs.  “I totally understand. It’s way more fun to work on cool new cryptography than something boring,” he said. “But I worry the lightning network has been overpromised, like bitcoin.”  Back in 2017, the community feuded over how to scale the network because some users expected bitcoin payments to be practically free and instantaneous. While bitcoin can be cheaper and faster than traditional providers, it is still a real network with real tradeoffs. When activity spiked during the token boom, fees increased and velocity slowed. Although some applications now allow microtipping, Dryja believes it is unrealistic to advertise that as an inherent capacity without security tradeoffs.  “I’m worried about that type of social thing happening again with lightning,” he said, speaking of the community divide and subsequent [bitcoin cash] fork. “That’s one of the reasons I don’t work at Lightning Labs anymore.”  There's a long way to go until LSPs could serve merchants outside the tech industry. Lightning invoices generally expire after an hour, which requires the buyer and seller to coordinate, and don't offer simplified information about the transaction itself for tax records. That means premium services may need to include both channel and invoice management. So far, such considerations generally take a backseat to stable connections with two-way liquidity, a challenge in itself.  In the meantime, Sheinfeld said Breez is working on a lightning-friendly point of sale device for merchants.  “I’m thinking ahead,” he said. “Lightning is like your checking account. The reason I call [the buttons in Breez] ‘add funds’ or ‘remove funds’ is because users are moving funds from their checking account to their savings account, a hardware wallet or whatever. There’s a bit of education that has to take place.”  Breez CEO Roy Sheinfeld at DeFi Dapps Day (D&DD) via Israel Hadari",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/09/27/lightning-sucks-but-it-could-help-build-a-bitcoin-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a4314113b0ae6f891c039722d68305045dd76bb-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sncz,1569545168,Why Bitcoin Tumbled Below $8K,"Bitcoin's price briefly slipped below $8,000 on Thursday for the first time in three months, though the cryptocurrency is still more than double its level at the start of 2019.  What do these bold – and volatile – moves mean for the ecosystem?  David Nage  , principal at the Los Angeles-based money manager Arca Funds, discusses his views on this week's price drop and whether price volatility in cryptocurrencies might turn off big investors.  https://youtu.be/k-6a7odVuzg  Nage, who saw bitcoin's price to be artificially range-bound until this correction, stated:  With bitcoin, where there's potentially a drop, obviously you can see it as a potential to buy.  Nage believes that as an asset, bitcoin is akin to future-pointing equities like Netflix and Amazon. With the caveat that ""we're not in the business of price predictions,"" Nage said:  If supply continues to get cut in half and the demand continues to rise, classical economics shows the price increases.    Catalysts for price action    And while the next halving – a periodic reduction in bitcoin mining rewards, expected to occur around May 15, 2020 – is potentially bullish, both the technical and fundamental views point toward uncertain times ahead for BTC's direction after its recent sell-off threw into question the long-term trend.  Soravis Srinawakoon, co-founder and CEO of decentralized data governance project Band Protocol, said:  Looking at the technical chart of Bitcoin, we've been seeing a squeeze in a descending triangle of the bitcoin price in the past few days. Combined with the recent disappointing launch of Bakkt, it is clear there is an overall negative macro sentiment in the market.

42382758,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9snub,1569544244,Top 10 Alternative Cryptocurrencies Hit 6-Month Lows,"Nearly all top 10 alternative cryptocurrencies by Market Capitalization have hit their respective 6-month lows after bitcoin's rapid price slide dragged the rest of the markets into the red on Tuesday.  Litecoin (LTC), EOS (EOS), Binance Coin (BNB), and Stellar (XLM) dropped to their lowest point in over 6-months shortly after BTC's major sell-off forced traders to exit the market in quick succession.  XRP (XRP) stands as the outlier on the week after hitting a 658-day low of $0.22 on Sept. 24, marking it as the biggest loser and single-day loss amongst the top 10 by market value.  As seen above XRP leads by a large margin after reaching its lowest point in almost 2 years, while bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin SV (BSV) and Ether (ETH) suffered the least after hitting only 4-month lows.  Still, the event marks a period where the primary trend for all cryptocurrencies has been thrown into contention after the majority passed below their respective 200-day moving average, a sign of long-term market health, in July.  Further, a total of $16 billion has been siphoned out of the alternative cryptocurrency market since Sept. 24, measured by its total market capitalization excluding bitcoin.  The onus now resides with the bulls to begin appearing in larger numbers to drive values higher, lest the downward pressure forces another major sell-off with an expected target of around $6,200 from bitcoin's measured move from its latest descending triangle breakdown.
