The stock is oversold and has the potential to bounce back. Selling puts to earn yield and mitigate risk while getting some crypto exposure seems like the best course of action. Since going public, Coinbase ( COIN ), the leading regulated exchange in the crypto space, has suffered a prolonged drawdown in its stock price. The day of the IPO was the company’s all-time high, and since then shares have sunk in basically a straight line. While the fundamentals of the company leave something to be desired, the firm remains a bedrock crypto institution and household name. We believe that management is taking the right steps to diversify the company’s revenue base and cut bloat, which improves the fundamental side of the equation considerably. On the price action front, technical indicators suggest that the stock is oversold and poised for a rebound. This setup presents an attractive opportunity for income-seeking investors. By employing a short put strategy, we can capitalize on this situation while minimizing risk and generating a solid chunk of income. With an extremely high probability of success, the trade idea we’ll outline is not only compelling, but also - we think! - the best risk adjusted way for everyday investors to potentially profit off of exposure to the crypto markets. Financial Results As we just mentioned, Coinbase has a rocky financial track record; it’s good to know that up front. While the company remains capable of producing tremendous revenues and profits in bull/active crypto markets, cash flow dries up and the company dips into the red when interest in crypto dies down: SeekingAlpha At its peak in Q4 2021, COIN produced almost $1.4B in operating income, which is more than triple what Nasdaq ( NDAQ ) earned that same period. However, since that peak, operating results have been mostly lackluster. Revenue declined 75% over the next 12 months from $2.4B to $604 million, and operating profits went into deep into the red. The culprit here is Coinbase’s business model, which is mostly based around transaction revenue: 10K COIN calls this “Net Revenue”. “Other Revenue” is stuff like Coinbase One (COIN’s subscription plan), Coinbase Cloud fees, Interest income, Custodial fees, and Blockchain Staking Rewards. As you can see, as the crypto bear market took hold, transaction volume went down, and digital assets had their prices slashed in kind. This proved to be a 1-2 punch in terms of revenue impact, which caused the recent operating losses. However, Brian Armstrong and management have shown keen awareness of this problem and continue to move towards diversifying the business away from pure maker/taker fees. To this end, Coinbase is making serious moves. It has been reported that the firm is looking into starting an offshore futures exchange , and the company just announced the launch of Base , its own Ethereum L2 rollup chain. These initiatives and others should begin to shift the profile of Coinbase’s revenue in the future, which is beneficial for shareholders that have been on a bumpy ride so far. Revenue is just half of the equation, though. Management also have a keen eye on expenses within the organization. In the most recent quarter, Coinbase actually produced an operating profit for the first time since Q4 2021. With revenues still down more than 60% from highs, this recent profit is a consequence of management taking a serious axe to the company's cost structure. And, given than revenue has begun to rebound over the last two quarters, it's clear that this reduction in headcount and other spend is not having an impact on the success of the product. As users ourselves, we can also say anecdotally that it seems that the company is moving faster to release better products, like the company's recent TradingView integration into its PRO offering, and simplified / improved UI and UX. Between the revenue mix strategy and cost structure agility, Coinbase has proven through the recent volatility that it has tremendous operating leverage, which is an excellent quality in a long-term investment. Now that management has also ""taken the hint"" when it comes to profitability, it seems unlikely that costs will balloon again any time soon. All in all, we think it's a good time to get involved in the unfolding fundamental story. Technicals As we stated at the start, Coinbase shareholders have had a rough ride since IPO day: TradingView Shares have not only underperformed the market (which is obvious), but they have also underperformed the crypto market as a whole: TradingView Bitcoin and Ethereum have actually held up much better in the bear market for digital assets, which may surprise some investors. Conversely, COIN stock outperformed considerably in the first three months of this year when Bitcoin and Ethereum caught a bid: TradingView Taken together, COIN shares throughout history should be viewed as a leveraged proxy to mainstream crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, given how much the underlying business model has relied on trading interest and fees. In addition to the underperformance, COIN stock is also currently oversold on various timeframes. The Weekly RSI shows a reading of 49, which is relatively weak In fact, on the weekly timeframe, COIN has never printed a value higher than 62: TradingView This means that for the entirety of Coinbase’s history as a public company, the stock has never been “overbought” on higher time frames. We don’t expect this to be the case forever. The Trade While we like the risk/reward in owning the shares from these levels, COIN is an inherently volatile stock in an inherently volatile market. Buying the stock may be the right move for some volatility junkies, but for folks with a more moderate risk tolerance, the best way to get involved in the stock is by selling out-of-the-money put options. Selling put options can be an effective way to generate income and mitigate risk while expressing a bullish view on an oversold stock like Coinbase. When you sell a put option, you collect a premium upfront and agree to buy the underlying stock at the strike price if the option is exercised by the expiration date. For this situation, we like the July 21st, $35 strike puts. Strike & Expiry (TradingView) They currently pay $125 per contract, which is a 3.7% cash on cash return over the next 71 days. This annualizes to a healthy 19% yield. The options markets also estimate that these contracts also have 92% probability of expiring at max profit, which is VERY high. In return for this income, you take the risk of needing to buy COIN shares at $35 per share sometime between now and mid-July. $35 is a great point of support in the stock, and it also represents a 45% discount from the current price as of writing. In other words, it’s a huge potential discount on this bedrock company. All in all, either earning the yield or being assigned shares looks like a win-win to us. Risks While the trade idea presents a high probability of success, it's crucial to be aware of the potential risks associated with the trade. Here are some key ones to consider: Business Execution : Coinbase’s ability to effectively manage its costs will be crucial in improving profitability and growth. The company needs to do more with less, and if it appears management is letting bloat slip again, then that will be negative for earnings and the stock. Permanent Loss : If the stock goes to zero, then these contracts would still require you to purchase the stock at $35 per share. The loss profile here is no different than simply holding the stock outright, and you could still exit the option position at any time, but it is a remote possibility that this extremely adverse situation could occur. Competitors : Coinbase is a big player, but tiny in comparison to Binance, its biggest competitor. Coinbase effectively has the U.S. market cornered, but expansion to other territories may be harder given the increased competition offshore. Regulatory : This is the biggest risk with owning COIN. Gary Gensler has provided effectively zero useful or actionable information for the industry, regulating instead with blog posts and wells notices. This poor approach to industry regulation has created a highly uncertain environment that could get worse or begin to materially harm COIN’s business. Technical Sentiment : Despite the oversold condition of COIN stock, there's always a risk that negative sentiment or downward momentum could persist longer than anticipated, impacting the trade's success. Summary In conclusion, Coinbase presents an attractive opportunity for income-seeking investors looking to capitalize on the stock's oversold condition, competent management, and high operating leverage. By employing a short put strategy, we can generate income, mitigate risk, and take advantage of a potential rebound in the stock. While recent financial results have been less than stellar, the company's strong brand equity and recent tactical moves have the potential to overcome current market challenges. With a high probability of success, the trade idea we outlined offers a compelling way to participate in COIN’s future, while minimizing downside risk.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4604783-coinbase-diversifying-revenue-cutting-costs-well-positioned-for-next-bull-market?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12667447.jpeg
12667415,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532973,1684193711,Why Ethereum’s Yield Farming May Be The Most Exciting Thing In Crypto Right Now,"As the world of cryptocurrencies evolves, Ethereum (ETH) investors are beginning to take notice of the power of yields and their potential impact on the crypto space. Yields, in essence, are the payments investors receive for holding cryptocurrencies, and they can come in many shapes and forms. How ETH Yields Could Revolutionize The Space One of the most important things to understand about yields is that they exist on a risk curve. This means that the percentage of yield paid out to investors is a function of supply and demand, as well as the perceived risk associated with the cryptocurrency in question. Related Reading: Only 1,032 Addresses Control Over 60% Of All Litecoin (LTC) In Circulation For example, a cryptocurrency with a limited supply and high demand is likely to have a higher yield than one with a larger supply and lower demand. Similarly, a cryptocurrency that is perceived as less risky is likely to have a higher yield than one that is perceived as more risky. According to the crypto analyst and researcher Adam Cochran, this is where the potential of cryptocurrencies really shines through. By creating non-dilutive yields through the use of fees, cryptocurrencies can offer investors a way to earn passive income without the risk of inflation. This is particularly important in a world where traditional investments like savings accounts and bonds offer little to no yield. One cryptocurrency that is particularly well-positioned to take advantage of the power of yields is Ethereum. With its growing ecosystem of decentralized applications and smart contracts, ETH has the potential to generate significant fees for investors through its use as a platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, according to Cochran. For example, ETH staking currently offers yields in the 5%-7% range, while Synthtetix (SNX) staking can generate yields of up to 24% in external fees. Similarly, Curve (CRV) staking can generate yields of up to 15% in crvUSD fees. This means that billions of dollars in capital are now able to generate yields of more than 3% annual percentage yield (APY), which is a significant opportunity for investors. This is particularly important in a world where traditional investment opportunities like savings accounts and bonds offer little to no yield. As more investors become aware of the potential of cryptocurrencies to generate high yields with acceptable levels of risk, this can likely drive more interest and investment in the space. From HODLing To Yielding In its recent post, Adam Cochran emphasized the importance of focusing on asset productivity and real yield in the cryptocurrency space. Despite the current narrative that fundamentals don’t matter and memes and rhetoric dominate the market, Cochran believes that one day, the true value of assets will become apparent. According to Cochran, those who already possess assets have the advantage, as they stand to gain significant capital gains in addition to the 2% APY on the face value of the asset. This is particularly relevant in the cryptocurrency space, where prices can be extremely volatile and subject to sudden fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Continue To Sell, Bearish Sign? Furthermore, Cochran predicts that as funds of increasing size start to realize the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency space, they will begin to invest heavily. This influx of capital will fundamentally change the finance industry, and those who have acquired a significant number of coins before this shift will reap the benefits.

What corrections have arrived have been minimal, and are shockingly similar in both time and price. This fractal behavior could be a sign of an important Elliott Wave signal, that not only says that BTCUSD is about to go parabolic, but that the rally should be “extended” in its price movement. Bitcoin Price And Time Fractal Discovered After a small recovery from the November 2022 bottom in crypto markets, Bitcoin corrected sharply. The correction was short-lived, due to a sudden banking crisis emerging. BTCUSD then made another run higher to above $30,000 per coin, and is once again correcting after a second, roughly 50% upward move. Related Reading: Check Out This Shocking Pepe Coin Versus Bitcoin Comparison The two similar sized moves took placed in approximately the same amount of time. Superimposing a fractal of one above or below the other demonstrates just how similar they are in time and price.

Will BTC double after this double fractal? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com All About The 1-2 1-2 Elliott Wave Setup The 1-2/1-2 is a phenomenon when a smaller degree wave 1 and 2 take on a similar shape and length of the previous, larger degree wave 1 and 2. Much like the first 1-2 is a larger degree wave, and the second 1-2 is a smaller degree wave, their appearance suggests an even larger degree wave will be extended. According to a description, a “1-2/1-2 structure is an indication that the larger degree impulse wave in development is extending.” “The 2nd wave 1-2 structure needs to be similar in proportions to that of the first 1-2 structure, not taking much more, if any more, time than the first. Remember, you are actually seeing the development of a smaller degree impulse wave, so expect it to be a bit smaller than the larger degree structure.” “An extension suggests a massive elongation of the impulse pattern,” a website further reads. Related Reading: Has Bitcoin Completed The Perfect Pullback After a completed wave 2 correction, wave 3 should begin. However, if price stops short of expectations and forms a similar sized pattern as the first waves 1 and 2, it suggests a second set of waves 1 and 2 that help increase the size of the overall wave 3 that was first anticipated. This type of behavior has been spotted in not only Bitcoin. It is also evident in Chainlink, Litecoin, and the Total Crypto Market Cap chart.

12666656,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532991,1684191645,"SEC Reduces LBRY’s Fine From $22 Million To $111,000 After Revision of Punishment","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revised the initial punishment against a blockchain-based content provider, LBRY. It has significantly reduced the penalty from the previous $22 million to a revised amount of approximately $111,000. SEC Revises Initial Penalty On LBRY The decentralized content-sharing platform that utilizes blockchain technology found itself in legal trouble when the SEC alleged it conducted an unregistered securities offering. The SEC filed a suit against the firm in March 2021, as the agency alleged that LBRY’s sale of digital tokens, LBC, qualified as the sale of unregistered securities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tweets Surpass Dogecoin Despite Meme Coin Craze The case sparked a legal battle between LBRY and the SEC. The company contested this, arguing that their tokens were not securities and did not fall under the regulatory framework of traditional securities offerings. However, the case turned out in favor of the SEC in November 2022, with the previous Judge ruling that the tokens were securities. The regulatory body demanded a fine of $22 million as a penalty for the alleged violation and instructed the company to cease such offerings. But LBRY stated in a December 2022 filing that the SEC’s request for $22 million was unrealistic given that the firm has not made such huge expenses in all its business dealings. It noted that the agency’s deduction of the sum was simply rough math, and the record does not support the amount. Related Reading: PEPE Outperforms Bitcoin In Social Media Buzz, Triggers Bullish Run For Frog Coin Furthermore, the agency realized the firm lacks adequate funds and may likely shut down its operations if it must pay such an amount. These became the major reasons for revising the initial punishment, according to information that came from a May 12 New Hampshire District Court filing. SEC’s Crackdown On Cryptocurrencies The SEC’s stance on digital assets can impact investors differently. If the SEC determines that certain digital assets fall under its definition of securities, it may impose trading restrictions on them. This means that investors may face hurdles in trading their favorite digital currencies as they must comply with additional regulatory requirements, such as using SEC-approved assets and platforms. These restrictions can limit the liquidity and accessibility of certain digital assets, making it more challenging for investors to engage in the market. This was evidenced in the Ripple case, as the SEC mandated all the crypto platforms in the US to delist XRP. However, the SEC’s regulatory approach also aims to protect investors. The regulator helps safeguard investors from fraudulent activities, scams, and market manipulations by enforcing regulations and scrutinizing digital asset offerings. featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/sec-reduces-lbrys-fine-from-22-million-to-111000-after-revision-of-punishment/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12666656.jpeg

Users can now unstake their stETH and receive ETH at a 1:1 ratio, which takes about a day for most users if the exit queue on the Beacon chain is empty, according to a blog post. The maximum time that it might take for a validator to exit and withdraw from the staking queue stands at 5 days and 14 hours, data from network explorer Rated.  Users will also receive an NFT as an intermediate step between requesting to unstake and claiming one’s ETH. When a user requests to unstake, they will receive a Lido-issued NFT representing their withdrawal request. Afterwards, the user uses the NFT to claim their ETH rewards and the NFT is burned. Even though the NFT could be listed for trading on Blur and Opensea, according to Lido marketing lead Kasper Rasmussen, “secondary market activity does not play a role in the withdrawal process.”  Commanding about nearly 80% market share of liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum, per blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Lido has already withdrawn more than 278,000 ETH at press time, making the staking giant the fourth largest entity by ETH withdrawals, trailing crypto exchanges - Kraken, Coinbase and Binance.  Lido said the new V2 received nine total audits from several firms, such as Statemind and MixBytes. All have been completed except for one by Oxorio which is expected to finish at the end of May.

12664912,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532980,1684186831,"Fantom (FTM) Price Surge Hints At Bullish Trend, What’s Ahead?","Fantom (FTM) has been on a bearish movement since April 19, 2023, resulting in a loss of about 30%. The price decline contributed to the negative market sentiment around the asset, making it hard for any possible retracement. However, these days, some minor green candles indicate a potential bullish trend. This is because the price of Fantom experienced rapid price action recently as the bulls took back control and increased buying pressure. Examining The Bullish Trend of Fantom (FTM) The recent bullish momentum has triggered a significant price action resulting in a price increase in the general FTM market. The price of FTM has increased by 5.09% in the last 24 hours trading session, taking the token to a high of $0.3885. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tweets Surpass Dogecoin Despite Meme Coin Craze Also, with an increase of 57.26% in the 24-hour trading volume, the overall market cap is currently up by 5.09%. This data confirm the bullish momentum present in the asset. Furthermore, the current significant buying and selling activities suggest a surge in market participation, likely leading to heightened price volatility. The current market sentiment of Fantom (FTM) is Neutral, while the Fear & Greed Index is showing 50, meaning Neutral. This indicates that the market is stable, with no pressure from bears or bulls. The recent development and partnerships with SUPA Foundation also contribute to the bullish sentiment among investors and traders. As more individuals and institutions recognize the potential and value of the Fantom ecosystem, it’ll drive up buying pressure and support an upward price movement. Fantom (FTM) Technical Analysis Fantom currently trades above the 200-Day Simple Moving Average but below the 50-Day Simple Moving Average. This may indicate a mixed or transitional phase in Fantom’s price action. The asset trading below the 50-Day SMA suggests a short-term weakness or a corrective phase in the price of FTM. Traders may use the 50-Day SMA as a resistance level preventing the FTM from moving higher. The asset is trading above the 200-Day Simple Moving Average, indicating a potential long-term bullish price movement. Related Reading: PEPE Outperforms Bitcoin In Social Media Buzz, Triggers Bullish Run For Frog Coin In general, the asset trading above the 200-Day SMA but below the 50-Day SMA suggests a phase where there’s a conflict between buyers and sellers. The Relative Strength Index confirms the present market indecision as Fantom is currently at the 44.53 region, which signifies neutral pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is slightly below the signal line, indicating a low pressure from the bears. FTM trades between its support level of $0.3585 and resistance level of $0.4498, respectively. With increased bullish sentiment and buying pressure, FTM might hit the next significant resistance level of $0.5499. Conversely, if the bears increase selling pressure and the bulls fail to hold their positions, FTM might change the trend and drop sharply to the next support level of $0.3034.

The week commencing May 7 saw DEX volume on BNB reach $5.11 billion, a level not seen since early May 2022, though volume did rise to just above $5 billion in the week following crypto exchange FTX’s November collapse.  This comes as DEXs witness an uptick in popularity, perhaps as a result of U.S. regulators clamping down on centralized exchanges. In April, DEX Uniswap topped centralized exchange Coinbase in trading volume for the fourth consecutive month.  There are a few reasons behind the yearly high. Lower fees on the BNB Chain might mean users are more likely to trade there, said Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, trying to explain the surge in volume. Another reason, she suggested, could be due to Binance’s popularity in the world of centralized exchanges. “It makes sense that users get routed to BNB Chain after using Binance,” she said.  “The opportunity to list on Binance and marketing support from the Binance ecosystem explains this,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, echoing Talati’s comments. “Projects that gain traction get a Binance listing, an unspoken benefit but often happens,” he added. “We're seeing a ton of projects look to leverage the Binance relationship.”  There’s also Uniswap – the largest decentralized exchange by volume – which in March, expanded to the BNB Chain.  “Uniswap being deployed onto BNB Chain a few months ago alongside Binance being the largest crypto exchange has brought more trading volume to the chain,” said Talati.  BNB Chain was launched by crypto exchange Binance (previously Binance Smart Chain) and is now a community-driven decentralized ecosystem, according to Binance’s website.",POSITIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/15/weekly-dex-volume-on-bnb-chain-hits-highest-in-a-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0a545f4c8ac585afc66a678f4c8007ca2865e6e-1694x843.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410753,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgp5M,1684183542,"Bitcoin Rebounds Above $27K as Investors Weigh Debt Ceiling Debate, Liquidity Concerns","Bitcoin (BTC) kicked off the U.S. trading week with gains, moving above $27,000 from as low as $25,800 late on Friday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $27,350, up roughly 1.6% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. After dipping below $26,000 on Friday, bitcoin had hovered below the $27,000 mark until late Sunday.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, suggested in a Monday note that upcoming debt ceiling talks will “tell us a lot if investors believe bitcoin can behave more of a safe-haven despite all the regulatory uncertainty.""  “Bitcoin seems poised to stay in a range, but if risk aversion triggers a de-risking moment, we could see selling pressure extend below last week’s low,” Moya wrote.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose more than 1% to hover around $1,830 Monday afternoon. Among other digital assets, LDO, the governance token for the liquid staking platform Lido, surged 11% to trade at $2.15, while indexing protocol The Graph's GRT token jumped more than 12% to trade at $0.12.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures overall crypto market performance, was up roughly 1.8% for the day.  Investors have been weighing the low liquidity of late in crypto markets, with market makers Jane Street and Jump Crypto last week retreating from crypto trading in the U.S. due to regulatory uncertainty. Crypto data firm Kaiko’s report on Monday showed that BTC’s 1% market depth – a gauge that measures liquidity conditions – dropped 4% over the past month, while ETH’s slid 2%. Altcoin liquidity suffered even worse, down roughly 17% on a monthly basis.  “Due to the dire state of the stock market, institutional and professional investors no longer have access to the excess liquidity they would usually allocate to invest in the crypto market,” Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at blockchain consultancy Storm Partners, told CoinDesk.  Equity markets turned green on Monday, with the S&P 500 closing higher by 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq up just shy of 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) edged ahead by 0.1%.  In bond markets, the note on the 2-year Treasury yield remained little changed at 4.00% Monday, while the 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 3.50%. Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at bitcoin-focused investment firm NYDIG, pointed out in a Friday research note that yield curve inversions similar to the current one have more often than not indicated a recession in the next 12 months.  Investors this week across the board will be eyeing several economic readings for indications of a slowdown, including U.S. monthly retail sales and housing data.  “Recessions are inevitabilities of the economic cycle, and while predicting them is no easy feat, how markets and asset prices respond will likely be determined by the fiscal and monetary response to the slowdown,” Cipolaro wrote. “Risk assets are already well off their highs, so there is reason to believe that a recession might not be as deleterious to financial markets given that we have already come through a significant correction,” he added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/15/bitcoin-rebounds-above-27k-as-investors-weigh-debt-ceiling-debate-liquidity-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed7eb37f74c7af50076d90f9d4766985dd1f4a1-3684x2072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410742,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgoYI,1684182147,DeFi Project Hector Network Mulls Legal Wrapper to Shield DAO,"The future of Hector Network is in flux with leaders holding a vote on a plan to wrap the OlympusDAO fork in an offshore legal cocoon and – according to critics – dilute token holders' rights.  Hector Improvement Proposal 40 (HIP 40) would clear up the myriad legal uncertainties that Hector faces as a “decentralized autonomous organization,” or DAO, according to a vote ending May 20. Other DAOs including SushiSwap have also endeavored to change their legal formation in response to growing regulatory scrutiny of purportedly decentralized crypto projects.  Alongside clearing legal liabilities, however, the new structure would give broad powers over the levers of governance to employees of Hector Network itself, according to a CoinDesk review of the proposed changes.  A fork of Olympus DAO  Built on the Fantom blockchain, Hector is one of the many derivatives of Olympus DAO that use complicated tokenomics to prop up value; these so-called “Ohm forks” built massive treasuries in late 2021, with Hector’s swelling past $100 million.  With much of that money long spent on various endeavors and project bloat, the remaining team members have tightened Hector’s belt and pledge to clean up the DeFi project’s act. But the legal clean-up job proposed in HIP 40 caught immediate ire Monday for allegedly undercutting Hectors status as a community-run DAO.  “This HIP essentially creates a worthless governance token instead of a true DAO, said the pseudonymous Lazer, a member of Hector Network’s influential proposal-writing committee.  New legal structure  The structure would supplant Hector’s existing DAO – its community of token-holders who vote with their HEC on project direction – in favor of a lawyer-approved setup rooted in the Cayman Islands to administer treasury and voting, and own DAO assets. Tokenholders would have no ownership claim to the DAO’s assets according to a constitution proposed in HIP 40 as well as screenshots of internal discussions shared with CoinDesk.  DAO members criticized the proposal in Hector’s Discord server Monday, with some arguing the legal structure would dilute their powers over the entity. One point of criticism focused on a clause in the DAO charter that would give broad powers to an 11-person “steering committee” staffed almost exclusively by employees of Hector Network.  That setup would ensure Hector’s own employees would have final say over all proposals considered by the DAO. The only non-employee, the pseudonymous Sonoro, is currently the chief of a group of “oracles,” community members who currently have the power to write HIPs but under the new setup have the right to review and comment on proposals.  Lazer, a pseudonymous member of Hector’s oracle committee, said HIP 40 would give Hector “team complete power over the composition of their so called “oracle group” and therefore unilateral power to propose HIPs and further distance the community from governance.”  Zeus, the pseudonymous operational lead of Hector, did not immediately comment on the setup of the steering committee. In a private message on Discord he said “nothing will change to the token holders governance btw, it's just more legal protection in corporations, taxes and possible regulatories.”  Zeus said a community AMA will occur in the coming days.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/15/defi-project-hector-mulls-legal-wrapper-to-shield-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23ad105d409c584f9a62b7e7fdba7413c37c740b-1160x653.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

( NASDAQ: BITF ) accelerated the timeframe of its hashrate target after posting first-quarter loss per share that narrowed from the prior quarter and came in lower than the average analyst estimate. Shares of the bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner gained 10.7% as bitcoin bounced 1.6% to $27.39K as of shortly before 4:30 p.m. ET. Q1 GAAP loss per share of $0.01, vs. the -$0.0.6 consensus, improved from $0.08 in Q4 2022 and fell from EPS of $0.02 in the year-ago quarter. Revenue of $30.1M, falling short of the $30.8M, rose from $27M in Q4 2022 and fell 25% from a year earlier. The Q/Q increase reflected higher average bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices, partially offset by a decrease in total BTC produced. The company now expects to reach six exahash per second (EH/s) of computing power by the end of Q3, compared with end-2023 in the prior goal. As of April 27, its hashrate stood at 5.0 EH/s. Q1 gross mining margin advanced to 42% from 33% in the previous quarter and dropped from 76% in Q1 2022. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $6.33M, up from $1M in Q4 2022 and down from $21.4M in Q1 2022.

This follows last week’s incredible bearish movement which saw the digital asset drop below the $26,000 mark for the first time in over a month. However, the bulls are beginning to pick up steam once more, but what could be driving it? Bitcoin Accumulation Continues Now, while the decline in prices may have been a deterrent for some, others had taken the opportunity to fill up their bags. The ‘Wholecoiner’ movement consists of Bitcoin supporters who aim to get their holdings to at least 1 BTC, making a whole coin.

Addresses holding at least 1 BTC cross 1 million | Source: Glassnode The new milestone was reached at a time when cryptocurrencies in the space were bleeding, presenting a unique opportunity for investors to get in at lower prices. The expectation of better prices from here on out, as well as the uncertainty in the banking industry, has also been a driver in this accumulation trend. Naturally, when investors are accumulating coins as they are now, it reduces the supply in the market. A reduced supply creates scarcity and this scarcity can lead to higher prices. So such as scenario could be what played out during the weekend. BTC price recovers above $27,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com BTC Investor Sentiment Is On The Rise As the price of Bitcoin declined over the last week, investor sentiment went down with it, causing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to fall below the 50 level once more. While the index still remained in neutral territory, it was bearish given that just a couple of weeks ago, the index was sitting at high greed. Related Reading: Does The Bitcoin Price Dump Signal The Start Of Another Bear Market? However, as BTC’s price has bounced back, sentiment has followed suit. The index is now sitting at a neutral score of 50. This puts the bears and the bulls at a stalemate, meaning each side would have to show higher strength than the other to swing it in their favor. Despite not being back in green, it is an improvement from yesterday’s score of 48, which was dangerously close to plunging the investor sentiment back into the fear territory. If BTC manages to maintain its current recovery trend, then investor sentiment will grow increasingly positive. However, support at $27,000 is still quite shaky and this means bears could easily take over the market, especially if momentum falls.

42410756,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgpIa,1684180700,Crypto Markets Look to Recapture Momentum Following Down Week,"Bitcoin and ether started the week positively, increasing 2.6% and 2.5% respectively in early Monday trading.  Bitcoin (BTC) is trading 3% below its 20-day moving average of $28,300 while ether (ETH) is trading 1.9% below its respective 20-day average. Investors will likely be watching to see if both assets can recapture their average, following a breach of the lower end of their Bollinger Bands in the prior week.  Volume will be key to watch, as the sentiment behind any directional move will be amplified or muted by the level of trading volume. While volume across all spot markets spiked 34% and 35% for bitcoin and ether respectively on Monday, activity for both trails their 30-day moving averages.  The steady decline in trading volume for the two assets implies a reluctance for new market participants to take on risk, and existing market participants to add more. As an illustration of such, CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Trend Indicator remains within the “neutral” range that it signaled on May 10.  The relative strength index (RSI) readings for both are nestled in a neutral range as well, with bitcoin’s at 44.17 and ether’s at 46.25. The RSI indicator ranges from 0 to 100, and is often used as a proxy for momentum; readings above 70 imply that an asset may be overbought, while readings below 30 indicate that an asset may be oversold.  Since 2015, BTC and ETH’s 30-day performance following similar RSI readings has been relatively mild, with bitcoin historically finishing 4.1% higher, and ETH finishing 2% lower.  Absent an external catalyst, investors may read the direction of stablecoins as an indication of where prices are going next. The stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) is a bitcoin-specific metric, measuring BTC’s market cap versus the market cap of a basket of stablecoins.  Lower volumes indicate greater buying power while higher values indicate the opposite. In this regard, the 11% decline in the SSR since May 5, implies that additional buying strength exists within BTC markets.  The aggregate supply of stablecoins on exchanges measures the total supply of stablecoins held on exchange addresses. Increases in aggregate supply are an indication of additional capital available for deployment across all cryptocurrencies.  Stablecoin exchange balance is down 47% year to date, despite BTC and ETH trading 65% and 53% higher on the year. An increase in stablecoins supplied to exchanges however, could serve as a signal that prices are poised to move higher.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/15/crypto-markets-look-to-recapture-momentum-following-down-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf3cae27d285092a2caea063e4d23800e590194f-5120x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As part of a broader budget deal with House Republicans, about a dozen tax plans were laid out by White House officials, some measures of which targeted cryptocurrency transactions and large real estate investors, two of the people said. Time is running out for an agreement to be reached between the Biden administration and the GOP. At the beginning of May, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the Treasury could run out of cash and extraordinary measures to pay the government's bills as early as June 1. Biden wants Congress to raise the borrowing limit, but House Republicans have said they will not do so if spending cuts are not agreed upon. The proposed crypto rule would prohibit investors from claiming a loss on an asset that they then repurchase shortly thereafter. Likewise, the real estate proposal would stop investors from deferring taxes on swaps of property. All in, both rule changes would raise tax revenue to the tune of $40B, the Washington Post noted , significantly trailing the $4.8T in spending cuts that Republicans want to take effect for the deficit to close.

42410750,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgovR,1684180246,BRC-20 Explained: How Tokens on Bitcoin Work and Why They Are Controversial,"On the weekend of May 6, 2023 the Bitcoin blockchain ground to a temporary halt, when the number of unconfirmed transactions hit a record high. Fees were spiking, and leading crypto exchange Binance had to pause withdrawals – twice.  How did that happen?  The BRC-20 protocol.  BRC-20 Explained  BRC-20, or Bitcoin Request for Comment 20, is modeled after the Ethereum protocol called ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comment 20) and was introduced in March 2023 by an anonymous developer known as Domo. BRC-20s are basically (with some major caveats like a lack of smart contracts) Bitcoin’s version of ERC-20s.  That said, there haven't been other “BRC” numbers as Bitcoin changes actually go through a process called BIP, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. So there hasn’t been a BRC-1 or BRC-2 and so on.  ERC-20 is an Ethereum token standard that enables developers to create tokens that are compatible with the broader Ethereum network and have built-in smart contracts. These tokens can embody a broad spectrum of transferable assets or rights, such as ownership interests, access rights or even different cryptocurrencies – many cryptocurrencies such as Tether and Shibu Inu coin are ERC-20 tokens under the hood.  Read More: How Do Ethereum Smart Contracts Work?  BRC-20 takes a page out of this book, made possible because of Bitcoin’s November 2021 Taproot upgrade, which enabled ordinal inscriptions, the behind-the-scenes tech plumbing that make BRC-20 tokens work.  Ordinals inscribe a serial number onto a satoshi, the smallest currency unit of bitcoin. This serial number, along with the ordinal’s data, are inserted into a part of the bitcoin transaction called the witness signature field. This data verifies the legitimate ownership of the funds being utilized and ensures they are not double spent.  BRC-20 tokens use ordinals, but not all ordinals are BRC-20 tokens. This is why there are millions of ordinals but just over 14,000 BRC-20 tokens.  BRC-20 tokens employ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) ordinals inscriptions to initiate token contracts (which are still simplistic as smart contract functionality has yet to be developed), create new tokens and move tokens around.  Currently, the BRC-20 protocol has very limited functionality compared to ERC-20. Right now users are limited to only minting, deploying and transferring tokens.  It’s also important to note some other differences from ERC-20. Unlike ERC-20, BRC-20 is not an approved standard but still in the proposal phase, and unlike ERC-20 tokens, BRC-20 tokens are not easily traded on exchanges at this time.  Why are BRC-20 tokens impacting Bitcoin fees and transactions?  Compared to simple peer-to-peer transactions, creating and transferring BRC-20 tokens is complex and requires more space on the blockchain. A conventional bitcoin transaction might be measured in kilobytes, while an ordinal inscription – on which a BRC-20 token is layered – can be up to 4MB in size.  One of the reasons an ordinal inscription is different from traditional non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum or other blockchains is that with ordinals, all the data is stored directly on-chain, so whatever picture or token instructions are added to the inscription is part of the transaction. With traditional NFTs, the token usually just contains a link or data that points to an external service where the art is stored.

All of this escalates competition for block space and potentially leads to higher transaction fees for users seeking faster confirmation times. All the while, the mempool (short for memory + pool), a collective storage space where unconfirmed transactions are stored before they are processed, grows larger and larger. At the peak in early May, some traders were forced to use a method called replace-by-fee, where they bid to replace one version of an unconfirmed transaction with a new version which pays nodes a higher transaction fee.  Binance’s two withdrawal pauses amidst that peak were a result of a mismatch between the transaction fees the exchange usually pays out to facilitate transactions and the transaction fee required to get picked up by the blockchain.  These transaction fees go to the nodes on the blockchain, usually miners, to facilitate the transaction. This is a supply-and-demand issue; as nodes are a fixed resource and demand for their time is fluctuating, fees will rise alongside demand. The nodes are essential for keeping Bitcoin’s blockchain running, and they are incentivized by block rewards and transaction fees to do their work.  Why are BRC-20s controversial?  BRC-20 tokens and ordinals have stirred some controversy for two main reasons: One, for clogging up the network and raising fees. The second objection raised by some is that BRC-20 tokens and ordinals ""pollute"" the blockchain with data that is not aligned with Satoshi’s mission of a peer-to-peer system of money transfer. For bitcoin maximalists, anything other than this is an inappropriate use of the bitcoin blockchain.     As mentioned earlier, unlike NFTs on Ethereum that store files on an outside server, Bitcoin's ordinal NFTs contain the entire data file within the witness signature field of Bitcoin transactions, ensuring all information resides on the blockchain.  This means they are more immutable than other NFTs, which enhances the integrity of the asset, but on the other hand it means that they are large. Very large.  Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr, told CoinDesk that ordinals represent an “attack” on Bitcoin because of this congestion from the large file sizes.  At the same time, others have pointed out that the miners – facing challenges on multiple fronts stemming from the bear market, including high-profile bankruptcies – have been huge beneficiaries of the BRC-20 boom.  “Ordinals = NFTs on Bitcoin. This is good for Bitcoin,” ex-Kraken executive and long time bitcoiner, Dan Held, tweeted.  Meanwhile, for the first time since 2017, some Bitcoin miners are earning more from processing transactions on the blockchain than from mining new BTC, with the shift attributed in part to BRC-20 tokens and ordinals.  Analysts CoinDesk spoke with say that this development could potentially offset the decreasing profitability of Bitcoin mining due to the designed halving of mining rewards.  “What happened with ordinals and NFTs is we crossed this chasm from what was a bearish scenario to a bullish scenario. If I were a miner I would be ecstatic,” MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor recently said in an interview.  Nic Carter, a noted bitcoiner, had a similar view in an op-ed for CoinDesk, writing that he was “heartened” by the new demand for blockspace that ordinals have unlocked. “Miners need to be paid somehow, and as the miner subsidy further decays, fees will have to compensate for the lost revenue.”  Read More: If Bitcoin Can’t Handle a Few JPEGs, How Can It Handle the World?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/brc-20-explained-how-tokens-on-bitcoin-work-and-why-they-are-controversial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb01306fdb8a45bfc79247e86c023413946553ff-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new memo pointing towards a hearing on digital assets regulation circulated among the Democrat committee, sparking reactions among top crypto leaders. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Labels BEN Coin As Scam, Bitboy Reacts In a May 14 tweet, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson condemned the memo, urging Americans to consider it a top priority issue in the next presidential election. Hoskinson advised US citizens to become single-issue voters and support pro-digital asset candidates in the next election cycle. Democrat Lawmakers And Their Anti-Crypto Position The Cardano founder believes the memo suggests the US Democrats and the government are planning a major crackdown on digital assets. In his tweet, Charles Hoskinson noted that the only way to prevent the government’s “regulatory madness on crypto is to prioritize it during the elections.” He urged crypto enthusiasts to vote for candidates who support pro-digital asset legislation. His message comes in response to Eleanor Terrett’s tweet. According to Terrett, the memo urged Democrats of the House Committee on Financial Services to stick behind the SEC during the hearing. This move implies that the SEC could gain full authority over digital asset oversight, expanding its “regulation by enforcement policy” on digital assets. The memo further noted that nearly all cryptocurrencies are securities, and the problem of crypto regulation isn’t its ambiguity but “mass noncompliance.” In addition, the memo called attention to Republican committee members advocating to slash the budget to financial regulators. Related Reading: Ripple CLO Exposes How SEC Ignores Law And Brags About It Also, the notice suggested that such Republicans are not “interested in protecting investor interests.” It recommended that the Democrats focus on approving a clean debt ceiling bill “instead of supporting pro-crypto legislation.” The memo’s content sparked reactions among the crypto community, with over 900,000 people commenting on Eleanor Terrett’s tweet. Several crypto experts and industry leaders expressed concerns regarding the potential regulatory direction. A respondent Jeff Beach frowned at the meme, noting that the move could drive the innovation away from the US. Are There Still Pro-Digital Asset Democrat Lawmakers In The U.S? Although most US Democrats are anti-crypto, the nascent industry still found a supporter among them. In March 2022, a prominent Democrat Senator, Ron Wyden, expressed his support for the industry. The Senator told his colleagues to be careful while regulating cryptocurrencies, noting that crypto innovations have presented several opportunities for settling payments. As a former pioneer of the US internet regulation, Wyden likened crypto to the early days of the internet. At the time, the government established legal protections to guard online platforms against lawsuits for public content published on them. The Senator emphasized the need for legal protections similar to Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act for digital asset platforms.

12661900,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532863,1684178422,Has Bitcoin Rally Already Hit Top? Here’s What Puell Multiple Says,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has hit pretty high levels recently. Here’s what this may mean for the current rally. Bitcoin Puell Multiple Has Risen To High Levels In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the Puell Multiple is currently at even higher levels than those seen during the 2021 bull run top. The “Puell Multiple” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the daily revenue of the Bitcoin miners and the 365-day average value of the same. The mining revenue here is calculated by multiplying the spot price by the total number of coins that the miners are issuing (that is, receiving their block rewards) every day. This metric tries to judge whether the current price of the cryptocurrency is fair or not by comparing the current revenue of the miners against the yearly average. When this metric has a value above 1, it means the miners are making higher revenues than the average for the past year right now. The asset’s value may be said to be overpriced during such times as the miners gain more motive to sell the more profits they are making. Related Reading: Stablecoins Interest Spikes As Traders Look To Exit Market On the other hand, values of the indicator below 1 imply these chain validators are making less than the norm currently. The lower the indicator’s value goes, the more trouble the miners may have in supporting their operations. Thus, the coin could be assumed to be undervalued during such conditions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant Historically, major bottoms in the cryptocurrency’s price have formed whenever the Puell Multiple has dipped below the 0.5 mark. Below this value, miners’ daily revenues are less than 50% of the yearly average, meaning that this cohort comes under some intense pressure inside this zone. Tops, however, haven’t been so simple; the value at which they occur seems to have been decreasing with each Bitcoin bull run. But in general, they have naturally occurred at values significantly above the 1 mark (that is, during periods when the miners are raking in large amounts of revenues). During the last couple of months, the Puell Multiple has once again been above the 1 level, and recently, it has observed a further surge towards a value of 2. This value is interestingly even higher than what was observed during the November 2021 all-time high price, but not near the levels of the first half of 2021 top. Related Reading: PEPE Outperforms Bitcoin In Social Media Buzz, Triggers Bullish Run For Frog Coin The current levels of the metric are also only slightly lesser than what the April 2019 rally, a rally that bears many similarities with the current one, saw during its top. Obviously, it’s hard to say anything about the top based on these observations alone, as tops have historically not followed any set pattern of the indicator, unlike the bottoms. However, the current values still likely imply that the price has become quite overheated recently, which may mean that even if a top isn’t in yet, it may be close nonetheless.

42410757,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgwes,1684178069,U.S. Prosecutors Drop Extortion Charges Against Early Adviser to Ethereum Network,"Criminal extortion charges against Steven Nerayoff, an early adviser to the Ethereum network, were dismissed by a New York judge on May 5, ending a three-and-a-half year legal battle that included explosive allegations he made against U.S. investigators.  The dismissal, entered by U.S. District Court Judge Margo Brodie, chief judge of the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), comes six weeks after federal prosecutors moved to drop their case against Nerayoff, admitting in a March 20 court filing that they had obtained material exculpatory evidence and were otherwise “unable to prove the charges in the Indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Nerayoff and his employee, Michael Hlady, were initially accused of extorting an unnamed Seattle-based crypto startup that Nerayoff had been hired to guide through its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. Prosecutors said the pair made threats to “destroy” the company if they were not paid millions of dollars.  Hlady pleaded guilty to extortion in April 2021, and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He has not yet been sentenced.  Nerayoff, however, has maintained his innocence from the beginning. In their motion to dismiss filed in February, Nerayoff’s lawyers said their client was the victim of an elaborate setup by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which they say knowingly pursued false charges against Nerayoff in order to get him to turn over incriminating evidence on his contacts in the crypto industry.  The allegations made in Nerayoff’s motion to dismiss are explosive.  Seeking dirt on senior crypto officials?  His lawyers say their client was put in a van on the day of his arrest and given a clipboard with a list of names of hundreds of the top players in the crypto industry, from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin to Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, and instructed to give the FBI dirt that would help them make “dozens of convictions” in exchange for a lighter sentence. (To be clear, neither Buterin nor Long have actually faced any public allegations from the government. They're just a couple names plucked from the list Nerayoff's team mentioned.) They also claim that Hlady, Nerayoff’s employee, was an FBI informant who exchanged 100 texts and 45 phone calls with the investigating FBI agent ahead of the pair’s arrest.  On their face, Nerayoff’s claims sound like something out of a techno-thriller novel. Even his lawyers concede in their motion that the allegations sound like “tin-foil hat material.” But the claims do resonate in early 2023 as the U.S. government aggressively goes after the crypto industry.  The credibility of Nerayoff’s story isn’t helped by his own reputation for stretching the truth: In the past, he has styled himself as a co-founder of Ethereum, which has been labeled an exaggeration by other early Ethereum contributors.  The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has denied many of Nerayoff’s claims. In their own motion to dismiss, they repeatedly denied Nerayoff’s speculation that Hlady was a government informant, though they acknowledged that he did, in fact, communicate repeatedly with the investigating FBI agent. The DOJ’s motion to dismiss does not address Nerayoff’s claim that he was put in a van and given a list of names.  In dismissing the case, Judge Brodie denied Nerayoff’s motion to compel the government to turn over more evidence and records, including the minutes of the grand jury proceedings and Hlady’s communications with the investigating agent, making it unlikely that the public will ever see the evidence that could back up Nerayoff’s claims that he was set up.  U.S. government's crypto crackdown  But, even without evidence to back up Nerayoff’s claims, the fact that the government dropped their case against him after his explosive allegations certainly invites speculation. And his claim that he was set up in order to take down bigger fish in the crypto industry could ring true for some this year, as the intensity of the U.S. government’s clampdown on crypto leads to unproven suspicions and conspiracy theories that Washington is out to kill the industry.  Anthony Sabino, a professor of law at St. John’s University, told CoinDesk that it’s uncommon for prosecutors to drop a case after obtaining an indictment.  “Securing an indictment in the first place is difficult enough,” Sabino said. “So, the government is fairly confident it can win. To drop a case post-indictment means some change in circumstances that dissuades the prosecution from continuing.”  And while there is no proof that Nerayoff was put in a van and told to start talking, Sabino said it’s “not fiction” that such things happen. It is “a typical government tactic, but usually not so melodramatic,” he said.  However, in the absence of evidence, Sabino said people should not necessarily assume that it’s true – but it’s not out of the realm of possibility.  “He could have been brought in for routine questioning, and maybe they made him quite comfortable. What matters is that the government is always looking for cooperation, i.e. making a deal to obtain testimony and get someone higher up in the organization,” Sabino said. “The best real-life example by far [is] Sammy ‘The Bull’ Gravano turning on John Gotti, which was also in the Eastern District [of New York].”",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/15/us-prosecutors-drop-extortion-charges-against-early-adviser-to-ethereum-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8524e860085e53902a998b3545d3aa7e9f9192c9-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As a result, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe recorded huge success selling its gold-backed digital assets worth 14 billion in its native currency or 39 million in United States dollars. Zimbabwe’s Sale Of Gold-Backed Digital Tokens Attracts Mass Interest According to an announcement, Zimbabwe’s central bank acknowledged receiving 135 applications for buying its gold-backed crypto assets. While the cumulative application for the newly launched tokens is about 14.07 billion Zimbabwean dollars. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tweets Surpass Dogecoin Despite Meme Coin Craze The Zimbabwean apex bank launched the asset in April and made it available for purchase from May 8 to May 12. The digital tokens were backed by 139.57 kilograms of gold, and investors can store them on e-gold cards or electronic gold wallets. Further, the bank set the token’s minimum vesting period of 180 days. Also, it set minimum purchasing amount levels of $10 and $5,000 for individuals and companies, respectively. According to XE.com, the official exchange rate for the Zimbabwean dollar is 362 ZWD to 1 USD. However, the actual value is higher on the street. The Zimbabwean central bank made this bold step with its gold-backed digital as part of its plans to stabilize the country’s economy. It plans to reverse the declining value of its fiat currency against the USD. Following the success of the initial sales of the digital token, the central bank is gearing toward another sale round. The bank requested that interested investors submit applications by May 18 for settlement. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor, Dr. John Mangudya, explained the importance of the newly launched tokens through a local news outlet. Mangudya mentioned that issuing gold-backed assets will expand the availability of value-preserving instruments in the economy. Also, the tokens will improve the public’s access to and use of investment products. IMF Warned Zimbabwe Against Gold-Backed Crypto Tokens The move to sell its gold-back crypto tokens came shortly after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cautioned it. According to a report from Bloomberg, the IMF warned Zimbabwe against its plan with gold-backed crypto assets. An IMF spokesperson stated that the country should carefully assess to ascertain that the token’s benefits outweigh the potential risks. Some highlighted risks include legal and operational risks, macroeconomic and financial stability risks, and governance risks. Related Reading: This Week In Bitcoin And Crypto: Key Dates That Will Impact Prices The IMF also advised Zimbabwe to take alternative measures to stabilize its economy, such as advancing its foreign exchange market. Also, it suggested that the country could explore tight monetary policies and the removal of exchange rates on transactions for banks, authorized financial dealers, and businesses. However, time will tell if IMF’s caution against risks will become a reality.

42410779,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgxcO,1684175297,Payroll Startup Rise Wins CoinDesk's 2023 Pitchfest Contest,"Getting your paycheck in crypto? The younger the employees are, the more likely they are to favor this idea, research shows. Rise, a Ohio-based startup, targets companies that want to give their workers flexibility between fiat and crypto salary payouts. The project won CoinDesk’s PitchFest contest during the 2023 Consensus conference.  According to a 2021 survey by the financial advisor company deVere, over a third millennials and half of Gen Z employees would like to receive 50% of their paychecks in crypto. There is already a range of startups, like Bitwage, that help companies process their payroll in crypto, but Rise adds a new twist: it allows both companies and workers to choose whether they want to work with crypto or fiat and use smart contracts for instant payments.  More than 600 crypto, blockchain, and Web 3 startups applied to CoinDesk’s PitchFest. A selection team, made up of investors from Electric Capital, CapitalG and CoinFund and others picked 12 finalists, who flew to Consensus in Austin to duke it out on-stage. Through three semi-finals and a closely-contested final, the judges picked Rise as the winner.  Rise started as a marketplace for companies and contractors in crypto in Jan. 2021, but soon it was clear that this audience needs not a new LinkedIn but rather, tools for compliant crypto payments, Rise co-founder and CEO Hugo Finkelstein told CoinDesk in an interview.  “They already knew their workers and did not need new connections, they needed payment infrastructure and compliance component that would make their life easier,” he said.  In June 2021, Rise pivoted to a paycheck service, and in Oct. 2021, the company raised pre-seed funding with investors including JAM Fund by the Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen.  In April 2022, Rise launched the current version of its platform. It has recently closed a $3.8 million seed round led by Sino Global Capital and Polymorphic Capital, with participation from Draper Associates, Hashkey Capital, Paradigm Shift Capital, WW Ventures, P2P and Cosmo Capital, the company said in a press release.  The company claims it can facilitate contractor fees payments in 90 fiat currencies and 100 cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and Ethereum compatible blockchains Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism and Avalanche. The platform is built on the Arbitrum blockchain and currently supports 15 smart contracts that interact with each other and facilitate processes like approving new users, distributing payments, etc. Bitcoin is not currently supported but is on the roadmap, Finkelstein said.  It works this way: a company enrolls with Rise and funds an account with either fiat or crypto, whatever it prefers to use for payroll. The contractors it hires, in turn, can choose whether they want to receive a transfer to their bank account or some crypto to their account, or both, in a certain proportion.  For now, the service is only available for contractors, but in the coming months, Rise is planning to launch an employer of record service, which would allow companies to use for full-time staff salaries, by outsourcing their HR and payroll work to it.  Rise has already onboarded 500 contractors and 70 companies, which have sent over $10 million in payments via the platform so far. The project is aiming to grow tenfold by the end of this year, Finkelstein said. After registering as a money service business, the team of 14 people is now working on getting money transmitting licenses in some U.S. states, as well as local licenses in Europe, Finkelstein added.  At the moment, the service is available in 190 countries, he said. In the U.S., Rise also provides clients with tax documentation needed to report to the IRS, and similar functionality is being planned for other jurisdictions, too.  To be sure, there is a fair amount of competition in the field Rise is building its business in, with companies like Bitwage, DEEL, Request, Remote, ADP and Utopia, offering fiat and crypto payroll services through U.S.-based exchanges, mostly Coinbase (Rise is not disclosing their crypto broker for now). Some of these services have already onboarded thousands of users, but Finkelstein believes the market is big enough for everyone as more and more companies are getting interested in using crypto for payroll. Current clients of Rise include the Ethereum staking protocol Lido.  Rise hopes to compete by the breadth of cryptocurrency options and some other features designed to make it easier for companies to pay workers in crypto. For example, each contractor on Rise gets a Rise ID – an ERC-725 non-fungible token (NFT) containing information on this contractor’s KYC status, work and payments history. Users can authorize the use of this token with various crypto wallets and other services.  Rise is also planning to expand its services into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, offering what it calls “High Yield” accounts to allow users take advantage of the DeFi interest-generating products. This feature is not live yet as the team has been focused on other tasks, Finkelstein said, admitting that the current regulatory environment also has not been conducive for yield generating products on blockchain.  Prior to co-founding Rise in 2019 with Andrew Maurer, Finkelstein worked as a head of marketing at the institutional crypto exchange LGO (before it was acquired by Voyager in 2020) and also as a venture growth analyst at SeedInvest.  CoinDesk plans to continue its PitchFest at Consensus 2024, spotlighting promising early-stage startups from across the global industry.  UPDATE (May 15, 2023, 19:31 UTC): Corrects the number of live smart contracts Rise has with its customers; Rise has 14 employees, not 30; the company launched in 2021 not 2022; and the current Rise payroll product began in 2022, not 2023.

12660162,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532893,1684173644,"Analyst: VeChain Enters Buy Zone, Should You Jump In?","On the weekly timeframe, a crypto analyst named Egrag explained on Twitter that VeChain (VET) is currently in a buy zone. He further explained the details of its possible price behavior using trading charts and noting recurring patterns. VET is in the green today, holding onto its gains from yesterday’s closing price. Egrag’s Analysis on VeChain (VET) Egrag mentioned VET’s attempt to exit the descending channel and move into an uptrend in his analysis. The asset has remained in a descending channel since it fell below its all-time high value of $0.2782 in April 2021. According to Egrag, VET attempted a breakout from this descending channel five times previously. He noted that the more VET attempts, the closer it will break upwards from its current channel. Also, the analyst stated that VET would likely form a double bottom. A double bottom is a technical chart pattern where the price of an asset touches a low point twice, with a slight recovery in between. Related Reading: Ripple CLO Exposes How SEC Ignores Law And Brags About It A double bottom is often associated with a trend reversal, accompanied by a potential break to the upside for an asset. The analyst believes this pattern could occur at the $0.015 price level or the $0.007 zone if the asset’s price declines further. Historical data shows that the last time VET reached this price level was in June 2020. Egrag set up three targets for the asset as pivot points to exit the descending channel. His price targets are $0.0648, $0.11649, and $1.66. He believes that VET will repeat its past price action in 2018 as it remained in a descending channel until it broke out in 2020. This breakout climaxed in its all-time high value of $0.2782 on April 17, 2021. In conclusion, the analyst stated that VET is currently in a buy zone which presents traders with an attractive buy opportunity. VET’s weekly chart shows that the buy zone is between $0.012 and $0.025. The asset entered this zone in December 2022 and traded there until January 2023. Analyzing VET’s Price Action VET is currently in a sideways trend on the weekly chart, but if the analysis is right, the token might see some action in the short term. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Labels BEN Coin As Scam, Bitboy Reacts VET’s sideways trend from December 2022 ushered in an uptrend in March 2023. Therefore, the token’s price current sideway trend will likely break upward in the coming weeks if history repeats itself and VET can break from the descending channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 41.89 in the neutral zone, reflecting the trend on the weekly chart. However, it will move to the upside if the bulls prevail. But VET is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bearish signal for the asset. Combined with the descending channel and price consolidation, this fact could hint at a fresh decline. If VET cannot target and reach higher levels, bears could re-take control and send the token back into critical support. VET is currently trading at the $0.01943 price level and may increase to $0.06 in the coming weeks as it recovers.

Fold partnered with Visa in 2020 to offer a prepaid debit card that rewards users with up to 1% cash back paid in bitcoin (BTC). Earlier in the year, the company announced plans to expand that partnership globally.  The choice to establish a base in Latin America comes at a time where Bitcoin transaction fees have become prohibitively expensive for some Salvadorans due to a sudden explosion in transactions precipitated by the on-chain minting of BRC-20 tokens.  But the flurry in on-chain activity is showing signs of slowing down as congestion in the Bitcoin mempool – a database of unconfirmed transactions – has eased from nearly 500,000 unconfirmed transactions to roughly 250,000 at the time of reporting. That number generally stayed under 50,000 last year. Bitcoin is popular in El Salvador, a country known for being the first nation state to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender in 2021.  “We're thrilled to be establishing an office and local team in El Salvador,” Fold CEO Will Reeves said in a press release. “As a country that has embraced bitcoin and has been a pioneer in adopting new monetary technology, we believe that El Salvador is the perfect place for Fold to expand its presence in Latin America.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/15/bitcoin-rewards-company-fold-expands-to-el-salvador-brushing-off-jump-in-on-chain-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65d64926eef0df0d7f8d1e8f633fcfb31572e03e-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410759,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgwlU,1684170551,"GREED Token Is Not a Crypto Scam, but a Lesson on How to Get Scammed Amid Meme Coin Mania","In S**tcoin Spring, any pointless cryptocurrency with a Twitter account can enchant thousands of traders into playing meme coin musical chairs. Throwing money at the wall and reason out the window, they let greed get the best of them. Sometimes literally.  This past week a social experiment called GREED got the best of would-be speculators on the Solana blockchain. Instead of wealth they’re getting bupkis – with a side of public shaming to boot.  It’s a story that showcases the dark psyche encouraged by those one-off tales of meme coin riches. For every lucky speculator up 5,000,000% on pepecoin (PEPE), there are thousands of gamblers losing money to insiders and trading bots. Some fall for malicious tokens designed to steal all the money in their wallets, not just the poker chips they’d anted up.  An experiment in GREED  GREED could have been one of those. To get GREED, over 43,000 Twitter accounts this week authorized one man in Croatia to tweet on their behalf. A further 55,306 wallets signed an intentionally sussy-looking transaction that, in theory, might have let him drain their wallets.  But the creator of the GREED experiment doesn’t plan to steal their money (nor can he; his developers never built that code). Even so, Ivor Ivosevic, better known as Voshy to the Solana community, very much will shitpost from those Twitter accounts.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Voshy said he wants to teach crypto traders a lesson, one that focuses on internet security – with maybe a dash of morality and sensibility, too. The thing’s called GREED, after all.  Voshy didn’t set out to write a parable of crypto’s dark side.  For five days he watched in crypto chat rooms as people conjured up complete garbage tokens – “dollar sign in front of fruit name” garbage – sold it to their friends and released it, at which point “everybody apes in and the token goes to zero.”  A week ago, disenchanted by this parade, he wrote an ironic tweet.  He went to bed that morning (Voshy’s first tweet was a light-on-sleep 6 a.m. s**tpost) planning to post a follow-up calling out the handful of people dumb enough to buy his nonsense.  “I woke up with 2,000 more followers,” he said of a Twitter account that previously had only 2,700. One person had told him “nice joke,” but the rest seemed eager to invest. “I'm like, f**k, this didn't go as I had planned.”  Disturbed but unfazed, Voshy leaned in. He told his growing flock to spread his gospel and tweet the message “doing it because of $GREED” to get the token. He went back to sleep; his tweet went viral.  Voshy woke up to hundreds of direct messages from Twitter friends asking to buy GREED before he released his nonexistent coin to the public.  The allure of meme coin presales  The so-called “presale” is one way speculators try to make money on meme coins. By buying a token before it goes into wide circulation, they hope to ride its initial pump high and dump it for profit. They’re willing to pay big money for their GREED; Voshy said he got offers for his nonexistent token that added up into the seven figures.  “Nobody asked me what the token was or what it was going to be. Everybody just f**king threw out a number that they were ready to send me right away,” Voshy said. He wasn’t going to take their money, but he decided to make GREED real.  Over the following days Voshy dropped occasional hints on Twitter about a token unlike any other. GREED would have no insider allocations or presales. It would be bot-proof. It would be free. Meme coin traders began paying attention and adding GREED to the hot lists of tokens to watch.  As the hype grew for GREED, so did Voshy’s Twitter following; it topped out at nearly 33,000. He fed them declarations of how greed was driving people to do stupid things.  “I started retweeting and writing things along the lines of, ‘The only people getting rich from tokers are founders.’ ‘Be careful of your greed; Greed can consume you,’” he said. It didn’t work.  “People became way more bullish the more I s**t on it.”  A costly airdrop  Behind the scenes, Voshy began building GREED. Critically, it would have a freeze mechanism to prohibit holders from ever moving it out of their wallets, making speculation impossible. He worked with developers Marcos Collado Martín and Petar Podbreznicki, an employee of Voshy’s crypto consulting business, BlastCtrl.  It worked perhaps too smoothly, so he asked them to “make it look more red flaggy” in an attempt to dissuade people. Indeed, some became concerned with the questionable security concessions they’d need to make to get their GREED, like handing over their Twitter.  Voshy said he was asked, “Why would I give you all these permissions? Would you give those permissions?’” His answer: “No, never.” but his warnings were not enough.  “If you have the FOMO in your head then doing something that would put your Twitter account in danger is less of your worries since you want to be part of something that is going to be big without even researching it,” said a GREED owner who goes by Abyss on Twitter.  The crescendo came with the Greed airdrop on Friday. When speculators pressed the claim, two things happened: They got airdropped 8,007,320,330 GREED, and their Twitter account automatically tweeted an embarrassing warning to others.  Voshy’s Twitter API dragnet caught some wild accounts, including that of Slope Finance, the Solana mobile wallet service whose social media went silent last August after leaking critical user data to hackers. Whoever runs that Twitter account apparently used it to try and claim their GREED. The result: They spread Voshy’s message (and later deleted it).  Voshy plans to continue tweeting warnings about being greedy from the accounts of people who have authorized him to do so. (He’s also circulating information about how to revoke permissions, and encourages people to do so).  “I always feel like if I have the chance to teach them about something, maybe at least few people benefit and I tend to think it's worth it. And people were telling me that I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, and that people are never going to forgive me. So far, so good. Everybody f**king loves it.”  Everyone who is a human, that is. While Voshy’s “social experiment” cost next to nothing for regular users, the bots who tried to game the system lost more, and contributed to the 120 SOL that will be forever lost because of it.  Part of the lesson is knowing how to react. That number (just over 8 billion) of tokens people seem to get? It’s the phone number for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  “So GREED actually has more utility as a token than most others,” Voshy said.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SOL | TRADING | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/15/greed-token-is-not-a-crypto-scam-but-a-lesson-on-how-to-get-scammed-amid-meme-coin-mania,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbf228e1cb8b1a192f9fc619aa7c2c549e9fade3-1684x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12658918,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532887,1684170055,"Avalanche Nearing Key Support, Is It Expecting Recovery Anytime Soon?","Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a bearish week with several price floors being lost. However, in the last 24 hours, AVAX has moved up by 1.5%, suggesting a sideways trading session. The technical analysis indicates that bears still have control over AVAX, with decreased demand and accumulation. Buyers have lost interest due to previous bearish influence. Bitcoin’s price has been indecisive, losing the $27,000 price zone. Major altcoins have followed this trend. Although BTC has shown some recovery, overall market weakness has impacted buyer sentiment in the altcoin market. Related Reading: Stablecoins Interest Spikes As Traders Look To Exit Market AVAX is currently trading near a crucial support level, and further selling pressure could lead to significant value loss in upcoming trading sessions. Buyers need to intervene for the price to initiate a recovery. The market capitalization of AVAX has also declined, indicating increased selling strength on the chart. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, AVAX was priced at $15.40. Following a modest recovery, AVAX has surpassed the $15 threshold and is now positioned near its critical support level of $14. The altcoin faces resistance at the $16 mark, and if it manages to surpass this level, it could potentially reach $18 and subsequently $20. Crossing $16 would signal increased strength for the bulls. Conversely, a decline from the current level would push the coin below $15 and eventually toward $14, strengthening the bears. With a slight uptick in demand, AVAX may make an attempt to breach the $16 threshold. The trading volume for AVAX in the previous session was relatively low, indicating a reduced presence of buyers in the market. Technical Analysis Throughout this month, AVAX has lacked significant buying strength. Currently, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is slightly above the 40-mark but below the half-line. Although there has been a slight increase in the RSI, sellers have been the driving force behind the price momentum in the market. This aligns with the observation that the price of AVAX has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating that sellers continue to drive the price momentum in the market. Despite a slight price increase in the past 24 hours, AVAX still shows sell signals on the chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), an indicator of price momentum and reversals, has formed red histograms, indicating sell signals for the altcoin. This suggests a potential price decline before a recovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Clone Doge CEO Skyrockets Nearly 200% As Meme Coin Mania Rages On The Bollinger Bands, which represent price volatility and potential fluctuations, have remained wide, indicating that AVAX can anticipate price changes in upcoming trading sessions.

The outflows coincided with sizable declines in crypto prices last week, including bitcoin’s tumble from above $28,000 at its high on Wednesday to below $26,000 by late in the day on Friday.  “The outflows were broad from a regional perspective, suggesting negative sentiment is not concentrated on just a few investors,” CoinShares said.  Of the $54 million in money exiting, bitcoin-related products accounted for $38 million, according to the report. Bitcoin outflows over the past four weeks have now reached $160 million, or 80% of the total for all crypto over that period.

42410775,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgxLr,1684168104,Tokenization Is the Way to Realize Biden’s Electric Vehicle Overhaul,"All eyes are on electric vehicles.  The Biden administration last month announced a historic overhaul to ramp up adoption of EVs. Under new regulations put forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at least 54% of all new vehicles made in the United States must be electric by 2030, essentially mandating a new North American supply chain, assembly lines, and manufacturing facilities.  A blockchain solution isn’t just a necessity for realizing this supply chain: It is the only way to have transparency and ensure human rights as the United States transitions off fossil fuels.  Dr. Qichao Hu is the founder and CEO of SES AI, a Boston-based, Li-Metal EV battery manufacturer that is building the world’s first transparent and intelligent EV battery supply chain.  There are currently few reliable methods for ascertaining whether car makers and battery companies are taking the necessary steps to source properly. Battery and car parts are often obtained and assembled over several continents before reaching their final destination, from a mine in Africa to a cell factory in Asia to automobile lines in Europe.  Before their vehicles hit pavement in the United States, companies eligible for federal benefits could use dirty energy at numerous points in the production process, while obscuring the origin of their materials. The complex and opaque supply chain presents a significant challenge for regulators seeking to ensure sustainable practices, and establish end-to-end infrastructure in the United States and our FTA countries.  Blockchain creates data-backed trust, which is crucial for an industry spanning multiple continents and currently lacking transparency  Blockchain addresses many of these challenges by providing a transparent and secure platform for tracking and verifying the origin, and production. Each transaction, from mining to manufacturing, can be recorded and verified by multiple parties, ensuring that the information is accurate and trustworthy. This transparency can help curb smuggling and dirty mining, making it more difficult for companies to embrace unethical sources. It also creates safety for consumers, as some electric vehicles have recently caught on fire due to quality control issues.  Integrating blockchain into supply chain systems is no longer theoretical. Organizations have embraced the technology to track certain aspects of the manufacturing process: Global jewelry corporation De Beers announced it was applying blockchain to its operations, with the intention of bringing much-needed transparency to the diamond trade. The World Economic Forum has even introduced an entire mandate on this front with over 100 partnered organizations. Titled “Redesigning Trust with Blockchain in the Supply Chain,” the project aims to “co-design an open-source toolkit which will streamline the deployment of blockchain throughout a broad and diverse sector.”  Projects like these serve as inspiration for companies on the frontlines of developing EV supply chains. Did a company receiving U.S. subsidies generate electricity to crush rocks, and use clean, renewable energy? Or did it use dirty energy, and source from a less friendly country? Did a manufacturer cut corners on certain safety features?  Read more: Paul Brody - The Age of Autonomous Supply Chains  Blockchain creates data-backed trust, which is crucial for an industry spanning multiple continents and currently lacking transparency. A tokenization process enabling trust also contains the seeds for spinning off new markets, as stakeholders can own new digital assets. If the real estate industry can adopt smart contracts for purchasing properties and tokenizing property deeds, then why can’t the emerging EV sector capitalize on ethical sources within the supply chain process?  Blockchain is moving away from speculative cryptocurrencies to digital assets backed by real-world commodities. A number of stablecoin projects, such as Paxos, are backed by precious metals like gold, and more raw materials like lithium are likely to follow this trend.

Officials said they are currently investigating whether Kim used insider information to acquire his massive digital assets worth around $4.5 million and to find out their origin. As part of the probe, prosecutors raided Upbit and Bithumb earlier today and seized transaction records and other materials. Opposition Lawmaker’s Scandal The investigation has caused a stir, with many questioning the source of Kim’s digital assets. And how he managed to accumulate such a significant amount of money. Accusers have alleged that Kim, a first-term lawmaker, owns around 800,000 Wemix coins. Related Reading: This Week In Bitcoin And Crypto: Key Dates That Will Impact Prices The report deemed this amount inconsistent with his frugal image. Additionally, Kim faces accusations of trading cryptocurrency assets while attending at least two meetings of the judiciary committee of the National Assembly in May and November of last year. Notably, Upbit and Bithumb are two major South Korea’s largest crypto exchanges. But this is not the first time they have come under scrutiny. In 2018, Upbit was investigated over allegations of fraud after it was accused of inflating its balance sheets. However, the exchange was later cleared of any wrongdoing. Bithumb, on the other hand, was hacked twice in 2018. The hack resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of crypto. South Korea Stance On Crypto South Korea has since been a major player in the world of crypto. However, the country has been taking a more cautious approach toward the regulation of digital assets in recent years. In February, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced new rules for cryptocurrencies. The rules required all virtual asset service providers to register with the agency and comply with strict anti-money laundering regulations. The move was seen as a step toward greater regulatory clarity and oversight in the crypto industry. Despite the tighter regulations, South Korea remains a hub for cryptocurrency activity, with some of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, such as Bithumb and Upbit, based in the country. However, the government has also been cracking down on illegal crypto-related activities, including fraud and money laundering. It is worth noting the recent investigation into Upbit and Bithumb is likely to have an impact on the country’s cryptocurrency industry. This is because the two exchanges account for a significant portion of the country’s trading volume. Related Reading: These Top 5 Cryptos Drop As US Debt Ceiling Fears Worsen Market Conditions The outcome of the investigation could also serve as a warning to other exchanges to be vigilant and comply with regulations to prevent fraudulent activities. In addition to regulatory efforts, South Korea is also exploring the potential of blockchain technology to improve various sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and logistics. The country has launched several blockchain initiatives and projects, including a government-backed pilot program to track beef exports using blockchain technology. While South Korea remains a key player in the global crypto landscape, it is also taking a measured and cautious approach to regulating the industry to ensure investor protection and prevent illicit activities. Regardless of the increased regulations in the crypto industry, the global crypto market has maintained composure. Over the past 24 hours, the global crypto market capitalization has surged nearly 2% with a value looking to reclaim the previously recorded $1.2 trillion.

42410771,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgxIY,1684166400,Crypto Startup Hourglass Starts Unique Marketplace to Trade Locked Up DeFi Assets,"Crypto startup Hourglass released the first-ever marketplace to trade Time-Bound Tokens (TBTs) – a unique concept that tokenizes a user's staked assets in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol based on its lock-up time period.  The idea behind the marketplace is to allow users to trade their place in line for their locked up assets - essentially transferring a user's ownership of an asset that has been locked in a protocol to another buyer. ""You can basically take a time bound token and then you can easily transfer ownership of it,"" said Charlie Pyle, founder of Hourglass.  Hourglass' marketplace launch comes as Lido's Version 2 deployment takes place this week. The startup will tokenize the Lido's withdrawal queue, which otherwise could ""clog the exit path for weeks or even months,"" the company said in a press release. This will allow users to ""trade their place in line"" for withdrawal of their staked ether and gain liquidity in the meantime.  Lido currently holds the lead as the largest liquid staking platform in the DeFi space, with more than $12 billion in total value locked (TVL) across the Ethereum ecosystem, per DefiLlama.  How it works  In simple terms, through TBTs the marketplace will allow users to gain liquidity of their locked up assets by selling the rights of the time duration in a secondary market. ""TBTs are a growing class of tokens that represent staked assets in DeFi protocols that are committed for a period of time,"" Hourglass said in a press release.  ""Hourglass will support everything from the trading of locked frxETH [Frax ether token] to early exits from Lido’s withdrawal queue,"" the statement added.  As an example, if a user holds 10 Frax ether and stakes them into the Frax protocol for a month, the user will receive 10 TBTs - along with any staking rewards - that can be traded in the marketplace.  Like any secondary market, the platform will allow for a discount on the TBTs based on the duration of the locked-up asset. For example, a trader could bid for 3% discount on ether (ETH), that has a 10-month lock up period and the discount could change based on the time the asset is locked up for, said Pyle.  The TBTs will be issued by ""Hourglass custodian smart contracts,"" and are semi-fungible tokens based on ERC1155s standard, Pyle said. Although the smart contracts are called custodian, the TBTs are non-custodial, so the founding team will have no control over the assets being deposited, Pyle noted.  Read more: What Is a 'Semi-Fungible' Crypto Token?  The locked assets – to which a TBT represents ownership – will be held through the custodian smart contracts, and at the end of a lock-up period, users can redeem their matured TBT for the asset, Pyle added.  Currently, Hourglass won't be charging any fees for trading on the platform.  Hourglass raised $4.2 million in a seed round led by Electric Capital, and includes investors such as Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Tribe Capital, hack.vc and other angel investors.

The Pepe the Frog-themed meme coin became prominent immediately after launch, rallying 1,000% within the first two days. Pepe’s performance and increasing popularity secured it a listing on Binance, further pushing its price by over 200%. However, some investors were uncomfortable with the sudden price surge and have been asking questions. Deaton Suggests PEPE Is A Calculated Scam Pepe coin’s explosive price actions moved the crypto industry. Bullish investors leveraged the coin’s growing popularity to accumulate more, while others appear to seek opinions from industry figureheads. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Coin Holders Hit Hard As 80% Of Addresses Smothered In Red In a tweet, John Deaton revealed that he received several DMs and emails from people requesting his thoughts on PEPE. Deaton retweeted DeFi analyst Chris Blec’s opinion on Pepe. In Blec’s tweet, the analyst warned people that Pepe is a carefully planned scam in which the creators use investors as pawns in a much bigger game. In his words, such games have consumed the lives of many. He, however, advised investors to wise up. Deaton retweeting Chris Blec’s comment regarding Pepe as his response to people raised some questions. Did the lawyer investigate before arriving at this conclusion, or did he trust Blec’s words for what it is? The crypto community reacted to Deaton’s opinion, some in support while others disagreed. A Twitter user @StanzaErick said he doesn’t understand why people should ask a lawyer for investment guidance. Another respondent Mark Hawkes, a pro-XRP crypto enthusiast, agreed with Deaton that projects like Pepe could wreck retail investors. The Current Price Outlook Meanwhile, the meme coin isn’t doing well at the moment. The token’s price has gone the opposite of the bullish performances recorded two weeks ago. It has lost most of its 7-day price gain over the past few days. The data shows the meme coin is down 38.46% over the past seven days. That’s not all. Pepe favored the bears for most of last week, with a 31.3% price decline on May 9. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Grip On $1,800: Will The Bulls Barge In To Save The Day? On May 12, it registered a 26.9% price decline before adding a 22.9% price gain on the 13th and 9.1% on the 14th. Staying true to form, Pepe’s price has declined by a further 10.4% in the last 24 hours, with the technical indicators, including the Oscillators and Moving Averages, flagging strong sell signals. Pepe is currently trading below the 10-day exponential and simple moving averages, an indicator that the bears are in control. The possibility of the meme coin rebounding from the dump depends on the bulls’ ability to overturn the situation.

Nailwal is pledging his own money toward the $500,000 cohort of 10 builders selected each year.  The bear market has slowed investments in crypto startups to a near halt and created a riskier environment for potential builders to move into Web3. Those builders are the target of the Nailwal fellowship, which focuses on individuals rather than teams.  “It's not about funding a startup,"" Nailwal said during an interview with CoinDesk. ""It's not a fund or anything. It's a fellowship, which will back individuals who are at a very, very early stage. Some of them might not even have an idea, and they just want to explore.”  Nailwal Fellows will each receive $50,000 in grant money and mentorship through Symbolic Capital, including access to their founder and investor networks. If a builder happens to found a company within one year after their cohort ends, Nailwal and Symbolic Capital will request a $50,000 Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) and token warrant, which essentially ensure the investors can get equity on the most favorable terms, according to the website.  The program is open to all Web3 builders, regardless of age or geography. There will be optional in-person coworking and networking opportunities in New York, San Francisco, Dubai, and India for those who want to participate. The Nailwal Fellowship will accept applications from May into early June each year. Interviews will be conducted in late June to find the 10 participants for that year’s cohort, which will run from August through January, according to the website where builders can apply.  Symbolic Capital launched last year and announced a $50 million fund in August for backing early-stage Web3 projects.

42410761,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgws6,1684162914,Bitcoin Has a 'Real Problem' in U.S.: Paul Tudor Jones,"Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said that bitcoin (BTC) has become less attractive thanks to what's become an unfriendly regulatory picture in the U.S. and what he expects will be lower inflation going forward.  ""Bitcoin has a real problem because in the United States, you have the entire regulatory apparatus against it,"" Jones said on CNBC's Squawk Box.  Jones – who previously lauded bitcoin's appeal as an inflationary hedge – added that he believes inflation will continue to come down, adding to the less-bullish scenario for the crypto.  Following the events of 2022, coming to a head with the dramatic collapse of FTX in November, U.S. regulatory bodies have become rather more hawkish toward the crypto industry, exemplified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) threat of legal action against publicly-traded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN).  The hedge fund manager's comments suggest his sentiment toward bitcoin has cooled somewhat since saying in 2020 that he could see himself allocating as much as 5% of his assets to BTC in the face of monetary debasement by the Fed.  Last October, however, Jones described his allocation to bitcoin as ""minor,"" saying that cash is the place to be as long as the Fed can be trusted to get a handle on inflation.

12658211,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532814,1684162848,Why Are Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today?,"The price of Bitcoin has risen by 2% over the past 24 hours. After nine consecutive red daily candlesticks, the price of BTC finally posted a green daily candlestick yesterday (Sunday). However, analysts are divided as to whether Bitcoin will now climb back towards $30,000 or whether it will head lower again. Why Are Bitcoin And Crypto Are Up Today Today’s rise in Bitcoin can, as always, be attributed to several reasons, all of which are interrelated. However, a major focus for the Bitcoin and crypto market at the moment is the US Dollar Index (DXY) – because of its inverse correlation. The DXY is (also) facing a major pivotal decision right now. As technical analyst Gert van Lagen explains, the DXY could be facing a head-and-shoulders (H&S) reversal, similar to what happened in 2020/2021. However, this time it is signaling a downtrend rather than an uptrend. More than two years ago, the DXY showed an H&S bottom under red downtrend, the right shoulder was above the SMA 200, and a final pullback marked the start of a rally. Currently, the DXY is facing an H&S top above green uptrend. The right shoulder is below the SMA 200, while the current rise may be a last bounce before a bear phase. So why is Bitcoin and crypto up today? The DXY has been rejected at resistance at 102.8 after rising over the last five days. The DXY saw a slight pullback (for now) to 102.5 at press time. The move could give crypto traders hope that the head-and-shoulders (H&S) reversal is being confirmed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Restarts Increase But This Resistance Is The Key On the other hand, Bitcoin itself is currently facing a hotly debated head-and-shoulders pattern in the 1-day chart. While some analysts are clamoring for another Bitcoin crash towards $25,200 or even lower, other analysts see BTC on a very good path towards invalidating the chart pattern. Similar to 10 March, the long wick candle May 12 (last Friday) may have marked the local bottom for Bitcoin. However, to confirm this, BTC needs to rise above the trendline (black) at $27,500 in the near future. #Bitcoin needs to confirm invalidation of the head & shoulders pattern (1D chart). Then, local bottom is probably in. 🎯A breakout above $27,500 is the target. pic.twitter.com/vjqAAcScH3 — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) May 15, 2023 On the other hand, today’s price movement can once again be attributed to the futures market. As analyst @52Skew reported, Bitcoin shorts on Binance were squeezed at the start of the Asian trading session, totalling -2.2K BTC. Despite this, the funding rate remained in negative territory. Related Reading: This Week In Bitcoin And Crypto: Key Dates That Will Impact Prices This is an indicator that the futures market remains bearish.

12655837,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532804,1684161034,"Bitcoin Miners Continue To Sell, Bearish Sign?","On-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners have continued to sell recently, something that could be bearish for the cryptocurrency’s price. Bitcoin Miners Have Been Shedding Their Reserves Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there has been some intense pressure from miners in recent days. The relevant indicator here is the “miner reserve,” which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all miners. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the miners are depositing a net amount of coins into their addresses right now. Such a trend can be a sign that these chain validators are accumulating currently, and hence, can have bullish consequences for the asset’s value. On the other hand, the indicator’s value going down implies that these investors are transferring some BTC out of their wallets at the moment. As the miners generally only withdraw their coins whenever they want to sell them, this kind of trend can be bearish for the price of the cryptocurrency. Now, in the context of the current discussion, the actual metric of interest is the 14-day rate of change (ROC) of the Bitcoin miner reserve, which tells us about the pace at which the indicator is registering fluctuations, as well as the direction these fluctuations are in (negative or positive). Related Reading: Bitcoin Tweets Surpass Dogecoin Despite Meme Coin Craze Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 14-day ROC BTC miner reserves over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite red in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the 14-day ROC of the Bitcoin miner reserve has had a negative value during the last few days. This means that the holdings of these chain validators have been decreasing in this period. Not too long ago, though, the indicator had some positive values, implying that these chain validators had been buying. Things changed once the asset’s price started to slip below the $30,000 level, however. When the price hit around $28,000, the turn towards red values came for the indicator, implying that the miners may have possibly joined in on the market-wide selloff. Following the selling spree from the miners, the asset’s value continued its decline and dropped all the way to the low $26,000 level. Since then, however, the decline has stopped, possibly suggesting that those levels may have offered the local bottom for the asset. The selling pressure from the miners has also started slowing down recently, as the latest negative spike of the metric has been lesser in scale than the previous ones, which can be seen in the chart. During the past day, the asset’s price has also bounced back above the $27,000 level again, implying that the market may now be able to absorb the current levels of selling pressure from this cohort. Related Reading: PEPE Outperforms Bitcoin In Social Media Buzz, Triggers Bullish Run For Frog Coin This kind of trend had also been seen during the selloff back in March, where the price formed a bottom and then rebounded up as the selling pressure died out from the miners. It now remains to be seen whether the miners will decrease their selling in the next few days (like back in March), or if they will continue to sell, possibly causing more bearish price action for the asset.

In its wind-down plan filed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, BlockFi said that ""the success or failure"" of litigation supporting these claims ""will make a difference of in excess of $1 billion"" to clients waiting for their money back.  The plan also set out a list of projected recoveries, including liquidation of around $1.06 billion in BlockFi Inc.

Litecoin Under Siege? Records from the “Top 100 Litecoin Rich List” show that 7,355,585 LTC in circulation worth $639,814,097 are controlled by 8.78% of all registered addresses. At the same time, 26,526,499 LTC worth over $2.3 billion is managed by 111 addresses, while 17,993,930 LTC exceeding $1.5 billion are held by 918 addresses. As of May 15, there were 72,924,127 LTC in circulation. So this concentration alone means over 60% of all LTC in circulation are controlled by 1,032 addresses. Furthermore, the network will only dispense 84,000 LTC to miners as block rewards. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Records Spike In Active Addresses Following Launch of LTC-20: Santiment Litecoin is a proof-of-work network like Bitcoin. It relies on a community of special nodes called miners to validate on-chain transactions and add them to the longest chain. For their participation, the lucky miner is rewarded 12.5 LTC per block every 2.5 minutes. Based on the above statistics, what’s notable is that the $2.3 billion of LTC at spot rates owned by 111 addresses represents the biggest concentration compared to any other range by address count. To illustrate, 794,934 addresses holding between 0.01 and 0.1 LTC cumulatively own 29,508 LTC. With 794,934 addresses in this range, they are the highest number of LTC owners by wallet address count. However, considering their total holdings, these addresses are a minority since whales currently hold over 60% of the total circulating supply. Specifically, there are three whales with over 2 million LTC as of writing on May 15. The largest LTC whale holds 2,504,667 LTC worth over $217 million. This address is active and constantly accumulates. Of note, the largest LTC whales began accumulating within the last five years from 2018. According to on-chain data by BitInfoCharts, the last time this address deposited LTC was on May 10, 2023. Meanwhile, the last withdrawal was in early January 2023. For instance, the second largest LTC whale, with over 2.47 million coins, started depositing coins in mid-June 2022. He withdrew a portion of LTC on February 10, 2023. Based on the frequency of deposits and withdrawals, it is also highly likely that these addresses don’t belong to centralized crypto exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. Will LTC Rally Ahead of Halving? Crypto whales controlling a disproportionately large amount of coins can manipulate prices and influence trends. Still, whether this will change ahead of the Litecoin halving event is yet to be seen. The Litecoin network will slash miner rewards by half to 6.25 LTC in less than three months. Related Reading: Litecoin Price Prediction: LTC Recovery at Clear Risk on Two Factors Based on historical performances, halving events, even in Litecoin, tend to support price increases. Therefore, ahead of this event estimated to be in early August 2023, LTC prices might recover as the coin becomes scarcer.

12654376,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532776,1684157111,Stablecoins Interest Spikes As Traders Look To Exit Market,"Data shows there has been a large spike in interest around stablecoins recently, a sign that investors of Bitcoin and other assets may be looking to exit. Stablecoins Have Observed A Sharp Rise In Social Volume Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, there has been a major uptick in the social volume of the stablecoins recently. The “social volume” refers to an indicator that measures the total number of social media text documents that are talking about a certain topic or term. The social media text documents here have been collected by Santiment and include a variety of sources like Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and other internet forums. Something to note about the metric is that it only tells us about the unique number of such posts that are mentioning the given term at least once. This means that even if a thread includes several mentions of the topic, its contribution towards the social volume will still remain only one unit. The social volume can provide insight into the degree of attention any particular coin is getting on social media platforms. Whenever this indicator’s value goes up, it means that the general interest in the asset among investors is rising currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the 7-day change in the social volume for the various assets in the cryptocurrency sector (including the stablecoins): How the metric's value has changed for the different coins in the market during the past week | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the social volume of a lot of the volatile assets has registered a negative 7-day change, implying that there is a lesser amount of discussion happening related to them right now as compared to a week ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tweets Surpass Dogecoin Despite Meme Coin Craze Some of the assets like Bitcoin have seen a positive 7-day change in the metric, but the increase has only been minuscule for them, implying that their social volume is relatively unchanged. Interestingly, while the volatile assets may have seen decreasing or sideways-moving social volumes, the stablecoins have seen a completely different trend with the metric; their social volumes have sharply surged in the past week. USD Coin (USDC), which is the stablecoin second only to Tether (USDT) in terms of market cap, has seen an extraordinary rise of more than 300% in terms of this metric. This suggests that discussions around the coin have increased by more than 300% during the past week. Tether itself has observed a positive 7-day change in the social volume of more than 30%, which, while much lesser than USDC’s, is still quite significant nonetheless. Related Reading: This Week In Bitcoin And Crypto: Key Dates That Will Impact Prices Generally, investors use stables whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with the other coins in the sector. So, since the interest around these tokens has surged recently while the volatile cryptocurrencies have been seeing a red period, it would appear that holders may once again be seeking the safety of this stable form of digital assets.

XRP Transactions Crashing As of May 14, 2023, 852,000 transactions were processed by the XRPL, a decentralized blockchain network by Ripple Labs curated for fast value transfer. This represents a 65% drop from March 19 peak when the total number of transactions on the XRPL stood at over 2.5 million. Notably, there has been no solid technical reason, such as blockchain or node vulnerability in the XRPL, during this period to explain the contraction in transaction count. Related Reading: Ripple CLO Exposes How SEC Ignores Law And Brags About It However, what’s evident is that the crypto market has been under pressure in the last two months from March to May 2023. This might have contributed to the drop in the number of on-chain transactions. On March 29, XRP prices peaked at around $0.58. This was 10 days after the XRP transaction count surged to the highest level on March 19. From the second half of March, however, transaction count and XRP prices have been falling. XRP prices are down 27% to $0.42 as of writing on mid-May, down from $0.58 registered on March 29. However, whether XRP prices will continue to track lower, mirroring the number of XRPL transaction count, remains uncertain. Overall, the number of on-chain transactions can directly influence transaction fees and prices. Moreover, it can provide insight into the level of demand for the cryptocurrency and the blockchain network. The more demand for the underlying network’s token, the higher the trading volumes, and this upsurge can influence prices. On the XRPL, users pay fees using XRP. Therefore, the higher the demand for XRP in transaction settlement, the more upward pressure there will be for the native currency. The contraction in the number of XRP transactions is at the back of declining prices. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the drop in XRP prices wasn’t an isolated event. Like the other crypto prices, XRP and top coins, including BTC and ETH, have been retracing from recent peaks registered in March and April 2023. As an illustration, after surging to as high as $31,000, BTC prices have since dropped, falling to as low as $25,800 on May 12. Meanwhile, XRP is currently trading at $0.41, down from $0.58 posted in late March 2023. The SEC-Ripple Case The drop in XRP transaction count can also be due to market sentiment as the community monitors the ongoing SEC-Ripple case which might end this year. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple’s executives in December 2020 for conducting an illegal initial coin offering and using XRP to raise funds, breaking federal security laws. In their assessment, the regulator says XRP is an unregistered security.

According to data by crypto intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence, Celsius – via fourteen transactions between May 10 and May 12 – transferred some 40,928 ETH to an aggregation smart contract labeled as Figment ETH2 Beacon Depositor 1 by blockchain explorer Etherscan. It then forwarded to Ethereum's proof-of-stake Beacon chain's deposit contract.  Figment is a non-custodial service, meaning that Celsius still holds the keys to deposited digital assets, a company representative said in an email.  The manuever represents one of the largest movements of funds for the crypto lender since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July.  Celsius was one of the crypto firms that became insolvent after the sudden implosion of blockchain project Terra and the subsequent meltdown of crypto markets a year ago, forcing the company to freeze user withdrawals. As part of the restructuring process, the bankruptcy court is holding an auction to sell the firm and its assets to interested investors including digital asset investment firm NovaWulf and private equity giant Apollo Global Management.  Read more: Celsius Seeks to Merge UK, U.S. Entities Amid Allegations Distinction Was a ‘Sham’  Depositing to a staking service allows Celsius to earn rewards on its digital asset holdings during the restructuring efforts. According to Figment's website, Ethereum staking offers an average of 5.6% annualized staking reward.  Celsius move comes as a surprise because it also operates one of the largest ETH staking pools with some $290 million of assets under management.  “The interesting part is that they decided to stake with Figment instead of their own staking pool,” Tom Wan, analyst at digital asset investment product firm 21Shares, said in a note.  The last deposit into the lender’s own staking pool happened in April last year, according to Arkham blockchain data, well before the withdrawal freeze and bankruptcy filing. Celsius also holds some $750 million worth of Lido Finance’s liquid staking derivative token stETH, earning rewards.  Update (12:33 UTC, May 15, 2023): Adds additional detail.

The EU Council, which represents 27 member states, unanimously approved the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), making the bloc set to be the first major jurisdiction in the world with a crypto licensing regime. It also agreed to new anti-money laundering measures on crypto funds transfers. “I am very pleased that today we are delivering on our promise to start regulating the crypto-assets sector,” said Elisabeth Svantesson, minister of finance for Sweden. “Recent events have confirmed the urgent need for imposing rules which will better protect Europeans who have invested in these assets, and prevent the misuse of crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism.""  Individual wallets holding at least one bitcoin set a milestone figure earlier this week, suggesting long-term sentiment for the tokens remains intact even as broader markets weigh down prices. Data from the on-chain analytics tool Glassnode show bitcoin wallets holding more than one token crossed the one million mark on Monday, up 20% since February 2022. Bitcoin wallets holding one token grew by 79,000 in the three months following November’s collapse of crypto exchange FTX and alongside tumbling bitcoin prices which hit multiyear lows below $16,000.  Weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on Binance’s BNB Chain has reached its highest level in a year, according to data from DefiLlama. The week commencing May 7 saw DEX volume on BNB reach $5.11 billion, a level not seen since early May 2022, though volume did rise to just above $5 billion in the week following FTX’s November implosion. This comes as DEXs witness an uptick in popularity, perhaps as a result of U.S. regulators clamping down on centralized exchanges. In April, DEX Uniswap topped centralized exchange Coinbase in trading volume for the fourth consecutive month. Lower fees on the BNB Chain might mean users are more likely to trade there, said Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, explaining one of a number of possible reasons for the surge in volume.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily changes in bitcoin's realized price or the aggregate cost basis for the market and the realized price of short-term holders or wallets with coins younger than 155 days.  In the past, the short-term holder (STH) realized price was strong support during bull markets.  At press time, the STH realized price was $25,300.

The leading cryptocurrency, however, held on to key support in a positive sign for the market.  The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's performance against fiat currencies, rose by over 1.3%, registering the biggest single-week percentage gain since February, data from charting platform TradingView show.  Bitcoin fell by 5.8%, living up to its reputation of being negatively correlated to the greenback. However, sellers failed to establish a foothold under the 200-week simple moving average, a widely-tracked technical line that capped the upside in February.  ""By defending this key average, the bulls have convinced the market of the sustainability of the long-term bullish trend,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at the FX Pro, said in an email.  Per Kuptsikevich, the cryptocurrency must top $28,500 to bring in cautious buyers waiting on the sidelines for stronger evidence of an end of the price pullback. At press time, bitcoin changed hands near $27,400, up 1.4% on the day, having hit a high above $31,000 last month.  Some observers expect the dollar to continue moving higher, keeping gains in cryptocurrencies under check.  ""I think the dollar is due for a bounce as markets take back some FED easing implied in the futures curve. My fundamental FX framework: currencies are driven by real growth differentials and political considerations over longer cycles, but in the short term, it’s all about playing relative central bank policy (changes in nominal rates). Depending on how violent the dollar upswing gets, it could cause some short-term damage to assets like commodities and crypto,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets, derivatives engine at Marex, said in an email.  Analysts at Swissblock Insights voiced a similar opinion in a note to subscribers on Friday.  ""The DXY could hit anywhere from 104 to 107 considering it crossed over the 102 level since mid-March,"" analysts said, adding that renewed dollar strength could continue to pressure BTC as its ties to TradFi are strengthening.  Per Swissblock Technologies, the impending dollar bounce will likely pave the way for a deeper decline that would bode well for cryptocurrencies.  ""This month-long structure will eventually break, and both assets will experience price discovery – bitcoin to the upside, and DXY to the downside,"" Swissblock Insights said.

The number of transactions that the Dogecoin blockchain has had to process in the last few days have risen to an all-time high, mainly due to the new DRC20 token standard. DRC20 tokens on Dogecoin are an experimental token standard that works similarly to the minting and transfer of fungible tokens via the Ordinals protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain. Technically, this is possible because Dogecoin was created by inventor Billy Markus forking Lucky Coin, which is itself a fork of Bitcoin. Dogecoin Transactions Surpass All-Time High By 3x In the last 7 days, the number of transactions recorded on the Dogecoin blockchain have skyrocketed. Before the DRC20 token standard was created, the Dogecoin network recorded no more than 23,754 transactions per day throughout May, according to data from BitInfoCharts. Last Saturday, May 13, Dogecoin saw a staggering 628,209 transactions. To put that in perspective: The highest number ever recorded before this new alltime-high was on December 20, 2013, when the network processed just 201,440 transactions. In comparison, the total number of transactions that took place on Saturday (628,209) is more than three times the historic high from 2013. Related Reading: Dogecoin Traders Watch For A Breakout On Higher-Than-Average Volume The madness first started rolling on Tuesday, May 9, when the transaction count doubled to over 40,000 and remained at that level over the next three days. On 11 May (Thursday) the Cambrian explosion occurred when the number of transactions rose above 450,000 for the first time. The sudden surge in transactions is mainly due to the registration process used to create the “Doginals” and DRC20 tokens. #Dogecoin transactions are skyrocketing.

The new DRC20 Tokens and ""Doginals"" pic.twitter.com/20DXWjYGTh — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) May 15, 2023 DRC20 And Doginals Spark Controversy In response to the emergence of DRC20 tokens, many members of the community enthusiastically began exploring and minting these tokens. However, Dogecoin core maintainer Patrick Lodder has little enthusiasm for the new trend. “Json doginals minting scams,” remarked Lodder via Twitter, adding with regard to the poor programming: “let’s push json” “let’s keep spaces” “oh and let’s keep newlines” lmao morons. When asked if there could be congestion in transaction times, similar to Bitcoin, Lodder stated: Yes, but it currently translates to a ~5-10 block wait. This is because they overpay fees too (10.3x recommended min fee) so you’ll get to get priority over these at 11x min fee (0.11 DOGE/kB). Ah, so higher cost per as well. hmm. Related Reading: Dogecoin Expected To Experience A Further 6% Decrease Prior to Initiating Recovery But Lodder rejected the necessity of a fork, saying that DRC20 tokens simply increase fees “a little bit”. In addition, the Dogecoin core maintainer also disagreed with the need for a “spam filter” (as has been discussed for Bitcoin) and shared a tip: “Just raise your fees a little now, and if you don’t like this, you can simply raise your dust limit so that you don’t relay these transactions – saves bandwidth.” At press time, the DOGE price stood at $0.07271.

Aevo users can trade options tied to Lido's LDO, Pepecoin (PEPE), Sui's SUI, Arbitrum's ARB, Litecoin (LTC), Aptos (APT) and others tokens which could earlier only be traded through an over-the-counter desk, Ribbon Finance said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.  Users can pick the options strike price and tenure of these options and get instant quotes from crypto market makers Galaxy, GSR and OrBit Markets.  Options are derivative contracts that offer the purchaser protection against bullish or bearish moves. A call option confers the right to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date, while a put option offers the right to sell.  Bringing more ""options"" to altcoin traders  The availability of onchain altcoins options means crypto traders that focus on tokens with small market caps can now set strategies, such as spreads or spot/futures and options combinations. With these strategies they can potentially take advantage of market scenarios or major fundamental event like litecoin's halving.  So far, the crypto options market dominated by Deribit and generally restricted to bitcoin, ether, and solana (SOL).  Currently, Aevo users can only buy options and hold the same till expiry or square off before the expiry. Down the road, Aevo plans to allow users to write options with customized margins and counterparty of choice, according to the official statement.  Market makers would need to post collateral, approximately 30% of the notional trade size, in the form of dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, Ribbon Finance's CEO Julian Koh explained to CoinDesk.  Crypto market maker OrBit Markets said Aevo's ""portfolio margin"" system makes it more capital efficient for users. The portfolio margin system offsets money-making and losing positions in a given portfolio to calculate its real-time margin requirements.  ""A major breakthrough of Aevo was the enablement of portfolio margin, which greatly improves the capital efficiency for on-chain option trading,"" OrBit told CoinDesk.  In 2021, Ribbon's structured products offered double-digit yields and emerged as retail-friendly alternatives to the popular cash and carry arbitrage. Last year, the firm launched Aevo, which allowed ether investors to trade options onchain.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/15/ribbon-finances-aevo-dex-unveils-altcoin-options-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fee0bacd9fabee98898005dfbe4e5f8b64528004-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The group's finance ministers and central bank governors announced they had discussed crypto asset supervision at a Saturday meeting in Niigata, Japan ahead of the G-7 summit next week. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, the summit's host this year, has said G-7 leaders are set to state their joint support for tougher crypto rules.  India, as the president of the G-20, has been pushing for globally coordinated crypto rules. In February, the group said forthcoming global crypto norms will be based on a new synthesis paper jointly produced by the IMF and the FSB. The G-7 has indicated it will follow the standards set by the FSB.  ""We look forward to the FSB’s finalization of its high-level recommendations by July 2023,"" the announcement said. ""We commit to implementing effective regulatory and supervisory frameworks for crypto-asset activities and markets as well as stablecoin arrangements, which are consistent with the FSB’s recommendations and standards and guidance established by SSBs (Standard setting-bodies).""  The G-7 also supports the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) efforts to accelerate the global implementation of its travel rule, which mandates the sharing of information on fund transfers between financial institutions, the finance ministers said. The global money-laundering watchdog is due to publish a progress report on travel rule implementation – something the G-7 is looking forward to ""in light of the growing threats from illicit activities.""  The G-7, which has previously said it will help developing nations issue CBDCs, will look to the IMF's recommendations on CBDCs, set to be published later this year.

12650644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532780,1684146641,Bitcoin Tweets Surpass Dogecoin Despite Meme Coin Craze,"Data from BitcoinInfoCharts, an analytics platform, shows that there are far more tweets about Bitcoin than Dogecoin despite the spike of meme token activity in the past month. Tweets About Bitcoin Exceed Those Of Dogecoin As of May 14, there were over 200,000 tweets related to Bitcoin. In contrast, users only posted roughly 4,800 tweets about the first meme coin, Dogecoin. What’s interesting is that this trend has been constant even with the spike in meme token activities over the past month. Bitcoin is the first blockchain project and the most valuable cryptocurrency that some governments have adopted. Trading at over $27,000 as of May 15, the coin dominates the crypto scene. It has remained resilient even in the recent crypto winter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Traders Watch For A Breakout On Higher-Than-Average Volume As dominance data shows, Bitcoin is preferred by traders despite the rise of meme tokens like Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogecoin. For context, after rising to as highs as $0.70 during the last bull cycle, Dogecoin prices plunged by over 90% throughout 2022, falling to as low as $0.05. During the last Bull Run, between April and May 2021, there were more tweets about Dogecoin than Bitcoin. For instance, as of April 16, 2021, there were 3,000 tweets about Dogecoin than Bitcoin. However, this was the last time there were more tweets about Dogecoin than Bitcoin. Since then, the number of Dogecoin tweets has fallen, following DOGE prices which also began crashing in May 2021. And although Bitcoin prices peaked at over $69,000 in November 2021, they also contracted in subsequent months, dropping to as low as $16,000 in late 2022. Still, there were more tweets about Bitcoin than Dogecoin throughout the bear market of 2022. Fortunately, DOGE and BTC prices have since recovered from the pits of 2022. DOGE prices rose 115% from H2 2022 lows to $0.105 in April 2023. At that time, BTC rallied from below $16,000 to as high as $31,000. Tweets Aren’t Everything Typically, the number of tweets about a cryptocurrency project can be used to measure popularity. The more there are tweets related to a crypto project, the more likely that it could be trending and that the crypto community is engaging with the platform. Even so, in most cases, considering the misuse of bots, the credibility of those tweets should be questioned. Depending on the popularity of projects, some rogue actors can be paid to spam the platform, increasing the tweet count.

The regulator cited LBRY's ""lack of funds and near-defunct status,"" as reasons for withdrawing its previous request for fine.  In March last year, the SEC sued LBRY on allegations that the sale of its native LBRY credits (LBC) violated federal securities laws. In November, a New Hampshire judge ruled the startup had violated securities laws by failing to register with the SEC.  Jeremy Kauffman, LBRY's founder has previously said this case could impact the wider crypto industry as the company maintained that LBC was not a security.Ripple Labs has a similar defense as it faces SEC charges for the sale of $1.3 billion in XRP tokens.  The SEC's request to remedy the penalty also argued LBRY should be ""enjoined,"" at least until it carries out its plans to dissolve the company and burn LBC tokens. The company had previously argued the SEC's $22 million penalty was unwarranted, comparing the sum to the regulator's $5 million settlement in its case against Kik over a $100 million unregistered token sale.

12649855,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532772,1684144362,Shiba Inu Coin Holders Hit Hard As 80% Of Addresses Smothered In Red,"Shiba Inu is causing significant losses for its investors. Recent data reveals that the hype surrounding SHIB, the once darling of the meme coin industry, may have led many investors astray. At the time of writing, a staggering 80% of all Shiba Inu token address holders are experiencing losses on their holdings, a fact that is causing concern among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike. Despite the initial excitement surrounding Shiba Inu, it appears that the reality of the situation is starting to set in for many investors. With such a high percentage of token holders not expected to make any kind of money as of yet, it is clear that the hype train may have been running a little too fast. This sharp downturn in the market has left many crypto capitalists wondering what happened and whether their investments will ever recover. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Grip On $1,800: Will The Bulls Barge In To Save The Day? Shiba Inu Token Holders Suffer Losses, Data Shows Addresses Unprofitable New data from IntoTheBlock indicates that the majority of Shiba Inu token holders are experiencing losses on their holdings. As of now, four out of five SHIB investors are holding unprofitable addresses, equating to 991,440 addresses with 497 trillion tokens valued at around $4.4 billion. This leaves only $668.4 million worth of SHIB that is currently profitable to its holders. The situation is further complicated by the fact that many of these unprofitable addresses purchased SHIB at the $0.000009 to $0.000014 price range. According to data, there are 348,170 such addresses, holding an enormous volume of 281.12 trillion SHIB. At present, the Shiba Inu token is ranked sixth among the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of the ratio of loss-making addresses to profitable ones. Source: Coingecko Recent SHIB Prices Raise Concerns About Long-Term Holding The current price of Shiba Inu token, listed at $0.00000892 per token on CoinGecko, is drawing attention due to its recent pricing history. SHIB total market cap at $5.15 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Crypto total market cap slides to $1.11 trillion on the daily chart at TradingView.com The fact that the token was priced at similar levels not long ago raises concerns about the motivations of current token holders, particularly in regard to their long-term holding strategies. The token’s recent 24-hour rally of 0.4% is far from impressive, but it is the 4.1% slump observed over the past seven days that is particularly troubling. This slump suggests that the token’s value is unstable and unpredictable, which could be a result of the high percentage of loss-making addresses. Given the current market climate, many investors are looking for opportunities to hold on to their cryptocurrency assets in hopes of long-term gains. However, the recent history of Shiba Inu token prices suggests that its owners are not taking a similar approach. This raises concerns that the token is being held for short-term gains rather than long-term investment, which could lead to further instability in the token’s value. -Featured image from PngTree, video from YouTube",NEGATIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-coin-holders-hit-hard/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
12649820,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532755,1684144223,Ripple CLO Exposes How SEC Ignores Law And Brags About It,"The legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US District Court of Southern New York is still awaiting a ruling from Judge Analisa Torres. Just last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse downgraded expectations, stating that a ruling would likely come in “two to six months” rather than the first half of 2023. However, this is not stopping Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty from continuing to attack the SEC and expose its unlawful legal practices. Via Twitter, Alderoty shared a court decision over the weekend that shows just that. Ripple CLO Exposes Unlawful Guidance By SEC Specifically, it concerns the “common enterprise” issue that is a component of the Howey test. The Ripple CLO writes that in the 1946 Supreme Court case “Howey”, the SEC unsuccessfully tried to pull off a trick that it is unpacking again today. At the time, the SEC wanted to enforce that an investment in a “common enterprise” was not required as long as there was a “common interest”. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Labels BEN Coin As Scam, Bitboy Reacts “The SEC was wrong then and it is wrong now. Common Interest ≠ Common Enterprise,” wrote Alderoty, who also shared the text of the writ. XRP community attorney John E. Deaton added that the SEC’s framework for digital assets ignores just that: The SEC is so arrogant that it ignores the law and brags about it. The SEC’s website, where the “Framework for Investment Contract Analysis of Digital Assets” can be found, states that in order to satisfy the “common enterprise” aspect of the Howey test, federal courts require that there be either “horizontal commonality” or “vertical commonality” (Revak v. SEC Realty Corp.). Related Reading: XRP Holds Above Key Support As Ripple CEO Predicts Delay Of Verdict The Commission, on the other hand, does not require vertical or horizontal commonality per se, nor does it consider a “common enterprise” to be a distinct element of the term “investment contract”. On that basis, Alderoty said in a follow-up tweet: The Revak case exposes yet another SEC sleight of hand. Without a ‘common enterprise’ it matters not whether ‘the fortunes of investors’ are tied to the efforts of others. The Howey test is not ‘so easily satisfied.’ Whether Judge Torres will agree and rule in Ripple’s favour remains to be seen. The pressure on the judge is likely to be intense, especially in light of the US Democrats’ attack on crypto. XRP Price Above Key Support At press time, XRP was trading at $0.4280, holding above the key support level of $0.4131 over the past few days. This support is crucial as a break below it would send the XRP price back into the early November 2022 to mid-March 2023 trading range, a signal the bulls should avoid at all costs.

Data from two sources show waiting times for staking ether lingers at 640 hours, or about 26 days. Exiting the network, on the other hand, takes just 0.013 hours, or less than a minute.  Validators are entities in a proof-of-stake blockchain, such as Ethereum, that process transactions and help maintain the overall security of such networks. As of May, nearly 50,000 validators are waiting in a “queue” to be able to enter the network, data shows.  The data indicates the demand for validators to enter the network and earn the nearly 5% annual yield. Such strong demand is likely stemming from large ether holders, who do not want to cash out and instead just want to earn some passive income on their holdings.  Some market watchers say these upcoming validators could be a mix of both new market entrants as well as stakers who previously unstaked ether from the network to test if the process works seamlessly and are now entering again.  “Immediately following the Shapella upgrade, a significant amount of demand pressure was exerted by stakers who had been locked up for 18+ months and may have wanted to exit their staked ETH position,” explained Matt Leisinger, co-founder at Alluvial.  “This demand has since subsided as those stakers have all exited their position, and we are now seeing an increase in demand for staking from what we can infer are new participants entering the market for the first time,” Leisinger added.  Shappella – a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades that occurred simultaneously on April 12 – gave investors the ability to withdraw their staked ether at will for the first time.  As such, staking deposits have surged in the past few weeks. More than 200,000 ether were deposited to the network last week, data from the on-chain analytics tool Nansen show, marking the first time deposits had outpaced withdrawals since Shapella went live last month.  These additions have brought the number of ether locked for staking purposes to over 19 million tokens – about 15% of the total circulating supply.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/15/ether-holders-embrace-near-month-long-wait-for-staking-eth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a9b2217a66a48f416269858f5a23709a5383a6f-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

By considering the amount of transaction volume per unit of cryptocurrency, we can establish grounded fundamental metrics as well as a relative valuation for these two instruments. Calculating this shows that BTC is significantly more valuable on a 30 days trailing basis. Looking further, however, we see that this is mainly because BTC network utilization is experiencing variance far beyond historical norms. This leads to an inconclusive pattern while usage trends normalize and ultimately a hold rating for the instrument. Overview Legendary value investor Warren Buffett has been outspoken regarding his distaste for Bitcoin. Telling investors nearly a decade ago that he doesn’t believe it to be a ‘store of value’ or a ‘reliable means of exchange’, he has made clear that it doesn’t even fulfill the definition of a currency. This year he referred to it as a ‘gambling token’ unworthy of serious fundamental investors. Yet, time has proven the worth of these digital currencies. While highly volatile, Bitcoin and Ethereum have maintained threshold levels of value while also continuing to act as a means of exchange. At this point it is fair to assert that Buffett may not be entirely correct regarding these instruments. While I do agree with Buffett in that Bitcoin and digital currencies in general cannot be looked at through a traditional value lens, I think it is evident at this point that they have some level of fundamental value if we are to consider them as currencies. I will note that It is important for us to consider cryptocurrencies as currencies specifically. They are decidedly not like owning stocks; owning cryptocurrencies does not represent a fractional claim on a company’s cash flows like owning shares of stock does. Rather, cryptocurrencies should be evaluated on the basis of their value as currencies: to what extent they provide for, and are used for, exchanging value. Since we have readily available metrics for this we can work towards establishing a fundamental valuation methodology for cryptocurrencies. This article will outline these metrics and compare Bitcoin and Ethereum on this basis. Currency Fundamentals For Cryptocurrencies A currency’s worth is established from the set of transactions that it supports. In macroeconomics there is an established body of theory around this. The more ‘demand’ (total transactions) for a currency, the higher the value of it. At constant levels of currency supply, more transaction volume implies a higher value for a given currency. A second-order demand effect would be countries holding certain currencies in reserve so that they can transact in those currencies in the future. Fiat currencies’ value are then derived from both the size of a country’s economy as well as the international transaction volume for its respective currency. The total of domestic and international transaction volume forms the total demand for a given currency. A good example of this in the real world would be the large global levels of Dollar-denominated debt as well as Dollar-denominated energy trading; these are well understood to represent fundamental underpinnings to the Dollar’s uniquely high value. With that being said we can establish a fundamental supply and demand metric, along with a relative valuation, for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The demand here is the level of transactions occurring ‘on-chain’, as in directly using the blockchain network for like-kind exchange. This metric doesn’t take into consideration secondary market demand for these two cryptocurrencies, namely crypto-to-fiat conversions. While these secondary market forces are undoubtedly a material price driver, this goes beyond the scope of functioning as a currency per se and won’t play into our fundamental analysis this time around. The supply here is of course the actual quantity of cryptocurrency outstanding.

BTC Circulating Supply 19.370 M ETH Circulating Supply 121.340 M Source: Excel, YCharts We can now divide the average transaction volume (in Dollars) by the total supply to arrive at a ‘total transaction value per unit’ metric: Transaction Value Per Unit Supply BTC $622.91 Transaction Value Per Unit Supply ETH $16.05 Source: Excel, YCharts This paints a stark picture. On a pure supply/demand basis for the past month, Bitcoin is presently 38.8x more valuable than Ethereum – even though its price is only 14.82x that of Ethereum. We must contextualize this further, however. Worth noting is that there has been a very significant uptick in Bitcoin network volume over the past month; it is currently far beyond historical norms. It appears that this surge is receding, but it is inconclusive which way it will go. Furthermore the average network activity for Bitcoin appears to have settled lower than historical norms over the course of 2022 and the first 2 months of 2023. This longer-term, structural, trend may well continue when the short-term uptick recedes. YCharts As to Ethereum, the recent trendline also saw volatility but delayed by 3 months. The structural trend here appears to be the reverse of Bitcoin; Ethereum utilization has been fluctuating at a higher level than it was at previously. YCharts While the data is stark on 30 days trailing basis, a review of the longer-term technical picture here indicates that Bitcoin's network utilization trend is too short-term and high-variance to constitute a reliable buying signal. The other thing to consider is the significant multiples that each of these cryptocurrencies trade at relative to the amount of daily transaction volume they support. For a monthly level of utilization, however, the prices appear to be more grounded relative to market prices: Monthly Transaction Volume Per Unit Supply BTC $18,687.41 Monthly Transaction Volume Per Unit Supply ETH $481.61 As such I will venture that this is the metric best utilized now and going forward. On this measure BTC also appears to be relatively cheap: BTC Price / Monthly Transaction Volume Per Unit 1.435 ETH Price / Monthly Transaction Volume Per Unit 3.755 Conclusion While we have established a sensible way to relatively value these two cryptocurrencies, current fluctuations in Bitcoin's network utilization are too variable to make the numbers reliable for an investment decision. If Bitcoin’s massive uptick in utilization proves to be consistent for another 3 months, I would feel comfortable calling it a buy on a relative basis. Alternatively, if the BTC trend normalizes and Ethereum’s structural trend continues to accelerate towards higher utilization, I would call Ethereum a buy. At present I would be cautious and rate Bitcoin a hold while network utilization evens out to something more in line with historical norms.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4604487-why-buffett-never-bought-bitcoin-fundamental-value-for-cryptocurrency?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12648853.jpeg

Through her team, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) now plans to go after rogue exchanges that knowingly allow criminals to launder money. NCET Wants Exchanges To Be Compliant The Financial Times reports that Choi is concerned about the spike in crypto-enabled crimes and is setting their eyes on cryptocurrency exchanges, mixers, and tumblers. Open-source token mixers such as Tornado Cash, a protocol that United States authorities have already sanctioned, are widely used by criminals to launder stolen assets. Because they make it hard for authorities to trace transactions on public ledgers, hackers are actively exploiting these tools to obfuscate transactions and evade justice. Related Reading: Binance, Coinbase Bitcoin Reserves Fast-Dropping, Is This Bullish? NCET and the DoJ will go after crypto companies that, though compliant with existing laws on paper, have allowed themselves to be used by criminals; a development that Choi says is “problematic”. By targeting these rogue agents, the director said they would send a “deterrent message” and hope their involvement would have a multiplier effect. Specifically, NCET seems to have a problem with cryptocurrency exchanges that skirt anti-money laundering rules and those which don’t comply with know-your-customer (KYC) laws. The enforcement team says going after them could make them invest more in risk-mitigation procedures and comply more with existing rules. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is reportedly one of the exchanges on the radar of the DoJ. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the DoJ, among other agencies, including the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is investigating the Changpeng Zhao-led exchange for violating established rules. Total market cap sits above $1.1 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com US Government’s Position On Crypto President Joe Biden’s administration has taken a relatively tough stance on cryptocurrencies. Regulators in the United States have been in recent months going after companies they deem to be non-compliant, especially after the collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. The position adopted in the United States, especially on regulation and enforcement, could be one of the strictest in the world. Several officials and policymakers in the country strongly believe cryptocurrencies can pose a significant risk to the stability of their financial infrastructure, which could also impact national security. In that regard, steps have been taken to increase oversight and, most importantly, double down on regulation of the cryptocurrency scene.

Eun Young Choi, director of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), said the DOJ is targeting crypto exchanges that allow ""criminal actors to easily profit from their crimes and cash out,"" as a means of fighting crypto crime which she said has grown ""significantly"" in the last four years.

The NCET also aims to bring more enforcement actions against investment scams, which Choi describes as ""pig butchering"" schemes, after a Chinese phrase referencing fattening pigs for slaughter, which involve scammers building relationships with victims over a period of months.  The agency last month announced busting around $112 million from six such scams.

12646705,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532740,1684134913,This Week In Bitcoin And Crypto: Key Dates That Will Impact Prices,"After eight consecutive red daily candlesticks, the Bitcoin price ended the day yesterday (Sunday) with a green daily candle. The Bitcoin and crypto market is entering a week that, while not a macro blockbuster week, could still be trend-setting for the crypto market. Friday in particular could once again be the most important day of the week. Last week, the US Dollar Index (DXY) bounced up from a historically important support level, putting significant pressure on the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Weaker-than-expected consumer expectations, waning US consumer confidence and sticky core inflation boosted the DXY, which will remain a key focus this week. Key Dates For Bitcoin And Crypto This Week On Tuesday 16th at 8:30 am EST, the US Census Bureau will release the final figures for US Retail Sales for the month of April. The final figure for March was -0.6%, well below the forecast of -0.4%. For April, consumer sentiment is forecast to rebound by 0.7%. Strong consumer spending is seen as supportive for the DXY and could accelerate the rally. On the other hand, if the reading falls short of the forecast, it will indicate that consumers remain reluctant to spend. Accordingly, the DXY is expected to consolidate again, providing a tailwind for Bitcoin and crypto prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges Below $27,000, Which Holder Groups Are Selling? On Wednesday the 17th at 8:30 am EST, the Census Bureau will release the preliminary figures for US building permits for April. Recently, the US stock market and subsequently the Bitcoin price reacted positively to the better-than-expected housing data. At 1.430 million, the number of new housing permits issued in April was slightly above forecasts. If the expectation of 1.430 million permits issued is exceeded again, this could be another catalyst for the market. A day later, on Thursday the 18th (8:30 am EST), the Philadelphia Fed will release its latest manufacturing index. The Philly Fed manufacturing index is considered a leading indicator for the all-important ISM purchasing managers index and could therefore be important for the broader financial market. If the index comes in below forecasts of -19.0 for the fourth month in a row, the bearish reaction in the financial market is likely to repeat itself as it did last month. An above-forecast reading, on the other hand, would be bullish as it would reduce the likelihood of a recession in the near future.

Friday the 19th is the most important day of the week, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will step in front of the cameras at 5:00 pm EST and could provide new information on the Fed’s interest rate and monetary policy stance in the coming months. Market volatility is likely to increase. Notably, 14 Fed members are scheduled to speak this week, each with a different perspective.

As far as the DXY is concerned, a decision may soon be imminent. As technical analyst Gert van Lagen explains, the DXY could be due for a head-and-shoulders reversal similar to that seen in 2020/2021 – but this time it is signaling a downtrend rather than an uptrend. #DXY – Head and Shoulders reversals: '20-'21:1.

The ‘hard fork’ is scheduled for about noon time UTC on Monday. A hard fork refers to an upgrade in any blockchain network. Bitcoin Cash’s May hard fork is set to bring added security and privacy to the fledgling network, with plans for “CashTokens” – which would enable decentralized applications directly on Bitcoin Cash, as per developers.  Other proposed improvements already locked in include smaller transaction sizes – which help speed up transactional times – and smart contracts functionality that could allow Bitcoin Cash-based applications built that offer recurring payments, derivatives trading, and crowdfunding opportunities, among other uses, to Bitcoin Cash users.  This development comes on the back of growing interest in tokens issued on Bitcoin: The recently-launched ‘Bitcoin Request for Comment’ (BRC20) tokens.  These standards allow developers to issue tokens – and DeFi applications – natively on Bitcoin – which has spurred a collection of digital artwork and meme tokens built on Bitcoin in recent weeks.

Striking Gold On PEPE And LADYS Data from Scope Protocol, an analytics platform, shows that the anonymous trader was among the earliest buyers of PEPE and LADYS meme tokens. Imagine you are profit $10M but can't sell. 0xaf23 is blacklisted by both $PEPE & $LADYS because bought too early. he bought 2.52T $PEPE with 0.013 ETH, now these $PEPE worth ~$4.6M he also bought 290T $LADYS (33% of all) and holds 71T now (~4.9M).https://t.co/XzsxRdAMCY pic.twitter.com/7rWZnw6oMQ — 0xScope (🪬 . 🪬) (@ScopeProtocol) May 11, 2023 The two meme projects have experienced a tremendous surge, catapulting early holders into the realm of millionaires. Related Reading: PEPE Attempts Market Rebound, Surges By 28% In 24 Hours Records show that the trader acquired 2.52 trillion PEPE tokens for just 0.013 ETH. His stash grew to $4.6 million. The trader also bought 290 trillion LADY tokens, or about 33% of the total supply. As of May 11, the blacklisted address held roughly 71 trillion LADY worth over $4.9 million. Yet, with the two projects blocking his addresses, the trader cannot liquidate and profit. Unconfirmed rumors have it that the trader is associated with a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot. Despite this setback, the inability of the trader to sell their PEPE and LADYS tokens could support prices considering the amount held by the trader. A block sell could adversely impact liquidity. The surge of PEPE, though without any utility, points to the community’s greed, and unwillingness to miss out due to FOMO. MEV Bots Raise Concerns Concerns about the impact of MEV bots on Ethereum’s security and fairness have grown, as they can impact gas fees, front-run transactions, and congest the network especially as the meme token craze continues. The blacklisting of the trader’s addresses suspected of being MEV bots coincides with PEPE and LADYS spike in trading activity on Ethereum. An example is a notorious MEV bot named Jaredfromsubway.eth that’s sandwiching meme token traders for profit. Because of the number of trading done amid the meme token craze, the bot is one of the biggest contributors of the high fees in Ethereum. As trading volumes of meme tokens rise, more bots will likely be deployed to profit from this popularity. Already, CoinMarketCap data on May 14 shows that PEPE’s average daily volumes stood at over $520 million which is almost the same as its market cap at $721 million. Meanwhile, LADYS daily volumes reached $74 million as its total market cap rose 30% to $80 million. There were also signs of suspicious activities and addresses in the LADY token ecosystem which previously raised some concerns. Nine addresses transferred 26 trillion LADYS, equivalent to $3.7 million, to exchanges. Earlier, these addresses received ETH from KuCoin simultaneously before buying LADYS. If you notice these suspicious addresses, then you can predict the drop of $LADYS in advance. 9 addresses transferred a total of 26T $LADYS ($3.7M) to exchanges. Is it a coincidence that the price of $LADYS drops after each transfer?https://t.co/isFU2u9zVK pic.twitter.com/uoa8tBFWUA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2023 Furthermore, they transferred all of their holdings to new addresses. Interestingly, each transfer coincides with a drop in the price of LADYS. Users were advised to watch these whale accounts as their activities could impact prices. If you bought $LADYS, you should pay attention to these 42 suspicious addresses. They hold 205T $LADYS ($19M), 23% of the total supply. They all received $ETH from #KuCoin at the same time and bought $LADYS.

42393562,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bizU6j,1684116982,Jack Butcher Expands Checks NFTs Ecosystem With Physical Print-Backed 'Elements' Collection,"Jack Butcher, founder of creative agency Visualize Value and artist behind the breakthrough Checks VV non-fungible token (NFT) collection, is releasing a new project titled Checks Elements that pairs generative artwork with hand-drawn physical prints.  Checks Elements, a 152-piece generative art collection, is inspired by the four classical elements of earth, fire, water and air. Each piece in the collection is a unique algorithmically-generated composite of colors that make up these elements, and explores the ""ever-evolving relationship between consensus and truth.""  ""Elements are conceptually ... the first instance of decentralized consensus,"" Butcher told CoinDesk. ""We're trying to play into the themes that Checks is trying to express about consensus on the internet to pre-internet consensus, which is that all of these different cultures, languages, parts of the world, different schools of thought around how the world came to be ... all landed on these four categories of matter – earth, water, air and fire.""  Butcher explained that to create the new collection, his team modified the algorithm that created the original Checks collection and added some new parameters. Butcher teamed up with master printmaker Jean Robert Milant and Cirrus editions to bring the NFT outputs to life, translating them into hand-drawn 30-inch by 43-inch monoprints created via an on-chain SVG file fed through a vintage lithographic printing press.  To create the physical prints, the signature four-by-four Checks grid was etched onto a plate used by the printer. Each paint color featured in the collection was added one by one, based on the algorithmic outputs created by Butcher and his team. Each physical artwork was then authenticated using Butcher's fingerprint and comes paired with an Ethereum-based NFT.  ""Translating Checks into a physical artwork, it never felt like anything was really continuing the project's DNA until we spoke to Milant and understood his process,"" he said. ""There's a lot of similarities in the way conceptually these [prints] come from a set of constraints that then get modified based on rules that are computer generated.""  Three of the four ""Alpha"" elements, including water, air and earth, will be offered at a solo auction at Christie's beginning on May 16 and concluding on May 23. A portion of the sale proceeds will be donated to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The physical work and their digital counterparts will then be displayed at Christie's New York gallery from May 20.  The remainder of the Checks Elements, including the fourth Alpha element of fire, will then be offered via public auction for 24 hours. The physical prints will begin shopping on June 24.  Existing with and apart from Checks VV  Butcher told CoinDesk that the auction will use ""some of the dynamics"" used in the original Checks collections, although he said that this project would not necessarily be interoperable with the other gamified pieces. In the previous Checks collection, inspired by the blue verification check mark popularized by Twitter, holders have been able to composite NFTs to create smaller, unique editions of checkmarks (you can read more about the mechanics here).  ""There are definitely things that will carry over when the rest of the collection is offered at auction post-Christie's and this is not going to operate as a traditional, run-of-the-mill auction,"" he explained. ""There are a lot of mechanics at play once that launches. But the idea of [Elements] over the long term is to exist as pairs that sit together as a complement to the existing checks ecosystem.""  It is also possible that collectors may want to decouple their physical prints from their NFTs and sell them separately, an outcome that Butcher said is possible, though he believes that for provenance purposes, people will want to keep them together.  ""I have some guesses as to how that will play out and I would imagine the pairs staying together for people who are in it for the art,"" he said.  ""We made a conscious choice not to include a burn mechanism into this thing,"" added Martin Klipp, president of Beyond Art Creative, who helped bring the artwork to life. ""Because in my mind ... both pieces are art. Both pieces are twinned, both pieces have their merits and both exist together or apart.""  Other NFT artists and galleries have recently embraced physical forms of their NFTs, with Tyler Hobbs exhibiting large-scale prints of his QQL: Analogs at New York City's Pace Gallery in March 2023. In February 2023, Art Blocks and NFT Gallery Bright Moments paired up to bring real-life experiences to locations in five cities, allowing owners of artist Mpkoz's Metropolis NFT collection to join a physical activation to mint a second, physical piece in the specific city tied to their NFT.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/15/jack-butcher-expands-checks-nfts-ecosystem-with-physical-print-backed-elements-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a3ed3a22582860d63c11fa31c5f7a4c9720947a-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $27,165, up 1.1% over the past 24 hours and a little above where it stood when the weekend began. BTC remains down more than 10% since May 5 when it started its most recent swoon, the result of profit-taking and low liquidity against a backdrop of industry-focused and macroeconomic uncertainties.  ""Financial markets in general (are) driven by risk, by liquidity, and so, not surprising right now, when people are fearing risk assets as a whole, we're seeing large swaths of selling,"" Ryan Rasmussen, an analyst for crypto fund manager Bitwise, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Friday.  ""When there's less liquidity, you're going to have larger swings in price whenever an asset (is) sold."" But he added: ""There will be more liquidity come into crypto.""  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was changing hands near $1,800, down a few fractions of a percentage point and about the same level as early Saturday. Other major cryptos moved into green territory as the Asia trading week began with Litecoin recently up more than 5.7%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's performance, was up 0.8%.  Leading Asia indexes were mixed with the Nikkei up about 0.5% but the Hang Seng down 0.2%. Rasmussen noted the declining correlation between crypto and traditional asset markets, which were mixed last week with the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite up slightly over the most recent five days but the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) falling 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively.  ""Any kind of mistrust in traditional financial systems plays into the hands of crypto,"" Rasmussen said, adding: ""I'm happy to see the correlation fall between traditional risk assets, traditional equities and crypto.""  In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, noted that the current ""macroeconomic situation around the world is creating a conducive environment for crypto assets to thrive.""  This week, DiPasquale is looking for bitcoin's price to hold steady in a range between $25,000 and $27,000 ""before bouncing toward $30K again.""  ""We don’t think the market needs a catalyst in the immediate term,"" he wrote. ""It is only a matter of time before we see another major rally.""

The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) has declined approximately 11% over the most recent 11 days, indicating a potential increase in buying pressure for bitcoin.  The metric, which measures the ratio of bitcoin’s market capitalization to the market cap of stablecoins, gives insight into the supply-and-demand dynamics between stablecoins (used as a vehicle to purchase cryptocurrencies) and BTC itself.  A higher SSR indicates that buying power is weakening, while lower values indicate that buying power is increasing.  The recent SSR drop follows a 52% increase between March and May 5. The pivot indicates that additional cash or liquid reserves have entered the market, and could lead to higher BTC prices.
