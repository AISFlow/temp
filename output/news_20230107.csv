Looking at the CEXs in aggregate, trading volume dropped 46% last year, in a move that showcases the growing lack of participation throughout the ecosystem. From the high-profile failure of the Terra ( LUNC-USD ) blockchain in May 2022 to November's fallout from once-mighty trading platform FTX ( FTT-USD ), crypto market participants have become increasingly wary of where to park their cash. “One of the biggest signals showing the lack of participation is the drop in volatility and liquidity in the market,” according to a recent report . “On October 22, the annualized 30-day volatility of BTC ( BTC-USD ) dropped to 26.6% – the lowest figure since July 2020, reflecting the risk averse sentiment in the market.” Binance maintained its top dog status, helped in part by the June launch of zero trading fees and FTX’s ( FTT-USD ) meltdown, even though spot trading volume on the exchange cratered 45.3% in 2022 to $5.29T, CryptoCompare noted. Binance and Bybit were the only platforms that experienced an increase in their market shares for each quarter of the year. Coinbase ( NASDAQ: COIN ) finished 2022 in second place, with a 8.2% market share in December compared with 10.1% at the beginning of the year. OKX took the third slot with a market share of 5.9% vs. 10.7% at the start of 2022. The CEXs that featured the smallest market share included Bittrex (0.1%), Bitfinex (1.0%) and Kucoin (1.5%). The market share of FTX ( FTT-USD ), which filed for bankruptcy in November, nearly halved to 3.3% from the start of 2022. Binance also controlled the vast majority of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) trading volume last year, CoinDesk noted, citing an Arcane Research report , ending 2022 at 92% vs. 45% to start the year. “No matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market,” Arcane wrote. Bear in mind, though, it's ""not healthy to have so much of the trading volume concentrated with any one exchange,” especially in the event that the exchange fails like FTX, which was at one point the second-largest platform by trading volume. In 2022, digital asset funds saw inflows plunge 95% in 2022, underscoring bearishness .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3922779-binances-crypto-market-share-dominated-in-2022-as-cex-trading-volume-wanes?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7217703.jpeg
42413203,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl87IO,1673117872,US Investigators Subpoena Hedge Funds in Binance Money-Laundering Probe: Report,"Federal prosecutors are investigating the relationship between Binance and U.S.-based hedge funds as part of a broader investigation into the cryptocurrency exchange's possible skirting of money-laundering guardrails, according to a report by the Washington Post.  Heading the investigation is the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, which, in recent months, has sent subpoenas to firms requesting records of their dealings with Binance, the Post reported, citing two people who had reviewed one of the subpoenas.  The subpoenas come at a time when Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume, faces intense media and regulatory scrutiny over its business practices and financials. That scrutiny boiled over late last year in the wake of FTX's multibillion-dollar implosion, which rocked investor confidence in an increasingly turbulent and troubled crypto market.  The subpoenas do not automatically mean authorities will bring charges against Binance or its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao, the Post noted as federal authorities are still discussing a potential settlement with Binance and are assessing whether the evidence they have is sufficient to bring charges.  In past years, Binance acquired a reputation for circumventing regulations and finding legal loopholes to sustain its business' operations in jurisdictions all over the world, according to legal experts who spoke to the Post. The company's previous lack of identification requirements raised concerns from lawmakers over the platform's role in money laundering, according to a former DOJ prosecutor quoted by the Post. Last year, a Reuters report cited evidence Binance had been used as a ""hub for hackers, fraudsters and drug traffickers"" with connections to the Russia-based dark web marketplace Hydra.  The company's financials have also been deemed opaque by some. Last month, a representative from Nansen, a blockchain data analytics company, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that there isn't much on-chain [data] or any kind of financial access or transparency into [Binance's] entities.""  Recently, Binance has made efforts to increase its commitment to compliance, growing its security and compliance staff by 500% in 2022.

42413223,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl87aA,1673103600,Audi-Backed Startup Holoride Is Bringing VR to the Car,"LAS VEGAS — There’s a use case for virtual reality that remains untapped: the automobile. “VR in the car” – where passengers amuse themselves with virtual reality (VR) headsets instead of phones or iPads – sounds like a good idea on paper but the tech is notorious for inflicting motion sickness on many wearers, even when they’re standing still. Throw in a moving car and you’re practically guaranteed to need a (non-virtual) barf bag.  There’s a way to solve this problem, and a startup spun out from Audi has done it. Holoride, launching in the U.S. at CES 2023, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the car’s motion in real time, combining that with the head movements of the wearer to smooth out the experience and ensure any barf bags stay in the seat-back pocket. For testing the product at CES 2023, we can confirm that it works.  The company has also added a metaverse element: Its platform is powered by a token, RIDE, based on the MultiversX blockchain (formerly Elrond). The token incentivizes developers by acting as an in-game loyalty token with real value, and for users, it functions as a currency, portable across games compatible with Holoride as well as any future products that choose to integrate RIDE into the experience.  Holoride ambitiously calls this vision the “Motorverse,” and it’s spent a lot of time thinking it through. The company spun out of Audi years ago, and while the hardware is new to the market, it’s been crafting the platform for a while. RIDE launched at the end of 2021, and it’s since been listed on several exchanges, the company says: Gate.io, Bitstamp, MEXC Global and the MutiversX decentralized exchange.  “We wanted to come up with a very fair compensation method for the creators we work with,” Nils Wollny, CEO of Holoride, told CoinDesk. “So the revenue we generate, we split with the creators that build for our platform. We didn't want to be… a black box – we wanted to make this transparent.”  I got a chance to try out Holoride at CES. Riding in the backseat, we were able to play Cloudbreakers: Living Haven, a game where your character flies through the air with relatively complex movements, punching and shooting at various drones to shatter them to smithereens. As the car made a series of turns in the Las Vegas traffic, the movement within the game mimicked the car’s motion in perfect synchronicity, keeping the action right in front of me. As a result, I barely noticed.  It wasn’t perfect, however. When I stopped playing games and instead fired up Netflix to watch Seinfeld, the app initially thought I was facing the rear of the car. That was quickly fixable with an easy re-centering of the user interface (very common in VR), but as we drove the orientation of the app kept drifting to one side or the other, requiring me to keep hitting the recenter button every minute or so. That would get tiresome after anything longer than a television clip. Nonetheless, I liked the Holoride video experience since it meant I didn’t have to crane my neck over a phone.  “We have developed a tech stack that picks up the car data in real time,” explains Wollny “You don't get motion sick … because you see this moving in your peripheral view the whole time.”  Holoride needs to fully understand the car’s motion to work. The tech can be built directly into a car’s systems, though it’s only available on select Audi models so far. But the product launching at CES is an aftermarket solution: the Holoride retrofit, a short black cylinder gadget about the size of a hockey puck that you mount on your windshield. That puck then connects wirelessly with the headset to work its motion-fusion magic.  Holoride is based on the HTC Vive VR platform and it works with the Vive Flow headset, which connects with the puck (or car system) wirelessly. If you’ve already got a Vive Flow you can buy the puck for just $199, but the company expects it will sell more packages with the headset included, which sells for $799 (the Vive Flow typically retails for $499 on its own). You’ll also need a subscription to the Holoride platform, which costs $20 a month or $180 yearly.  That’s because Wollny says Holoride’s target customer isn’t necessarily a metaverse enthusiast, but rather a busy parent looking for a different experience for their kids in the back seat on long drives.  “Primarily we focus on families at the moment – teenagers on backseats,” he says. “With our tokens, whether you are a parent, whether you’re a kid, you can benefit from this. That's our core focus.”  Time will tell whether that amounts to a robust market. But if it does, the company is prepped to meet it: With a metaverse platform, a Web3 token and a gadget that actually works, Holoride is poised to take over VR in the car – as long as customers are willing to come along for the ride.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | EGLD,Pete Pachal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/07/audi-backed-startup-holoride-is-bringing-vr-to-the-car,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cd7f86c91efbb96f0b9417c4ced66ed9ee987dc-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The prosecutors with the DOJ's Eastern District of New York office have requested interviews and documents from DCG and Genesis, the report said, while the SEC appears to be in a similarly early stage of its own inquiry. The report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said that neither Genesis nor DCG, which is also the parent company to CoinDesk, has ""been accused of wrongdoing.""  The inquiries seems specifically focused on the financial interplay between Genesis and DCG, according to the report.  CoinDesk reported in late June that Genesis Trading was facing major losses due to loans made to the now-imploded hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, later filing a claim for $1.2 billion. DCG assumed the claim for Genesis.  In November, Genesis announced that its lending unit would suspend withdrawals, which had knock-on effects against companies including Gemini, which relied on Genesis for its Earn platform. Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss and DCG founder Barry Silbert have since begun publicly feuding over issues arising from this suspension. Genesis has also undertaken major layoffs in the past few months, replacing its executive leadership and nearly halving its headcount since August. The subsequent implosion of crypto empire FTX further damaged Genesis's books.  Genesis has also tapped advisers to explore options, which could potentially include a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.  As of early December, Genesis creditors had made claims totaling upward of $1.8 billion, CoinDesk reported at the time.  Separately, another DCG subsidiary, Grayscale, is facing issues with its key bitcoin trust product. A discount in the price of a share of the trust relative to the price of bitcoin broke 50% last month, indicating a lack of trust in the product or in investors' ability to cash out of it.  A DCG spokesperson told CoinDesk Saturday morning that ""DCG has a strong culture of integrity and has always conducted its business lawfully. We have no knowledge of or reason to believe that there is any Eastern District of New York investigation into DCG.”  A spokesperson for Genesis did not immediately return a CoinDesk request for comment. Bloomberg quoted a Genesis spokesperson as saying it ""maintains regular dialogue"" with regulators but couldn't comment on any specific issues.

Related Reading: Ethereum Gains 4.5% in Weekly Timescale As Shanghai Upgrade Nears On-Chain Developments To Play A Big Role For MATIC The Layer 2 ecosystem has been seeing on-chain developments grow. Just before the turn of the new year, Polygon’s first prediction market Bhavish Finance made several records that brought Polygon in the spotlight. Uniswap, a decentralized exchange in the ecosystem, ended 2022 with a $28 billion annual volume. The DEX surprisingly accomplished that with a sub-$100 million TVL, but as of writing Uniswap’s TVL on Polygon is at $111.21 million, according to the DEX’s public dashboard. Chart: Uniswap.org These bullish developments, however, are preceded by big news on Polygon’s NFT arm. DeGods and y00ts, two of the biggest names on Solana, will bridge their collections on Polygon and Ethereum on Q1 of 2023. This would inevitably bring interest on Polygon’s NFT market, pushing the price of MATIC upwards. However, with the nearing timeline of the ‘Shanghai’ network upgrade of Ethereum, Polygon’s main offering, which are low gas fees due to a better roll-up protocol, will be challenged. With this in mind, it remains to be seen what developments on-chain would differentiate Polygon with Ethereum’s upgrade and other L2 protocols. Crypto FUD Will Strengthen Bears Long-Term The crypto market has definitely suffered from last year’s big collapses. But the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) that came about these events might be strengthened as Huobi, a centralized exchange, seems to be melting down in real time. Recent news shows that the CEX will be laying off 20% of its employees.

In addition, the team behind the project have been proactively working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more sensible regulation. In doing so, DOT might have just saved itself from this market landscape-changing development. DOT total market cap at $5.3 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Polkadot Price Forecast As there is no clear timetable yet for the enforcement of additional regulations for the crypto space, DOT investors need to turn their focus first on what awaits the digital asset in the days to come.

The roadmap is ambitious, but network activity is lackluster. This appears to be a coin that is benefiting from low volatility and decentralization as a narrative. While most of the crypto market has been down pretty big since the collapse of FTX (FTT-USD), there are some coins that have been showing general strength comparatively. No coin with a top 100 market capitalization rank has done better than Toncoin ( TON-USD ) in the last 60 days. TON is up over 34% in that time period compared to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) which are both down about 20% as of publishing. Toncoin Weekly Chart (CoinMarketCap) Following the fall of FTX in November, many of the coins that have outperformed the rest of the market since have had a focus on decentralization in some way. Self-custodial wallet tokens like Trust Wallet Token ( TWT-USD ) and non-custodial DEX dYdX ( DYDX-USD ) have performed very well. Toncoin is another example of a public blockchain that is marketed as a decentralized network. The rally in TON coupled with the relative underperformance of the rest of the crypto market has propelled TON all the way to a top 25 market capitalization according to CryptoMarketCap.com: Market Cap Rank: 25 Circulating Market Cap: $2.6 billion Fully diluted Market Cap: $10.9 billion Circulating Coin Supply: 24% Toncoin's History Toncoin is the native currency of ""The Open Network."" The Open Network has one of the more bizarre histories of the top public blockchains. The network was originally developed and launched by the founders of Telegram. Past history (The Open Network) One of the key problems with The Open Network from the launch was the $1.7 billion private sale in 2018. It was such a large token offering, that the SEC stepped in with a lawsuit: The US Securities and Exchange Commission sues Telegram, accusing it of conducting an unregistered securities offering. Telegram argues that the SEC's claims were baseless, but agrees to postpone the launch of TON until legal matters are resolved. Despite disagreeing with the SEC's position, Telegram ultimately ceased the development of TON, paid a fine, and returned funds to the original investors in 2020. Because there was already a community interested in developing on the chain, there was enough excitement and valuable code from the original project that a group of independent developers took over TON and have brought it back into the wild without any ICOs. Structurally, The Open Network is a proof of stake blockchain that is sharding-enabled for fast blocks, nearly instant finality, and very high TPS projections. According to the TON Foundation's own analysis of the blockchain, the network is ideal for gaming and social interaction. New Development? The development group behind this new version of The Open Network is the TON Foundation. As it is described on ton.org : The TON Foundation is a decentralized community started by Anatoliy Makosov and Kirill Emelyanenko after Telegram stepped away from the project. A community of open-source developers has supported the development of TON ever since, with the goal of staying true to the network design detailed in the original whitepaper. Following Telegram's exit from TON, there were multiple competing development teams trying to get control of the project. The one led by Makosov formally asked for the ton.org domain. That request that was granted by Telegram and the TON Foundation was later given the stamp of approval from Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov: Unlike the original TON, Toncoin is independent from Telegram. But I wish its team the same success. Coupled with the right go-to-market strategy, they have all they need to build something epic Fedor Skuratov is a former community manager with TON labs, an entity linked to the initial Telegram-led version of TON. In an old CoinDesk article , Skuratov seems to indicate that Makosov was chosen to take over because his development team planned to follow Telegram's initial plan for the network: As to why Durov chose to support Toncoin rather than Everscale, Skuratov said he believes that’s because Toncoin’s team “does not position itself as independent and ‘follows Telegram’s legacy’ without any leadership ambitions of their own, and Durov likes that.” Everscale made a point of cutting all ties with Telegram to avoid a “toxic” association with the project targeted by the U.S. regulator, Skuratov said. I think this raises some questions about just how independent TON really is from Telegram but that is speculation on my part at this point. The TON Foundation does have control of quite a bit of money as $250 million was raised through investments by Kucoin and Huobi. There was an additional $90 million raised by a handful of other crypto investment entities separately from 176 independent donors who supported the network with over 527 million TON back in April of 2022 - that TON is now valued at over $1.3 billion. Network Activity and Roadmap So far, the community has launched a variety of applications built on The Open Network - most of these apps are geared toward NFTs and gaming in some form. Though there are some block explorers like TON API . According to that site, there are over 1.8 million accounts on The Open Network. The volume of daily transactions on the chain is very volatile and there isn't much of it even happening at peaks as daily transaction volume is generally well below $1 million. TON Real Volume (Messari) The biggest success from this blockchain so far seems to be through Telegram's sales of usernames and virtual phone numbers on a TON-based marketplace called Fragment. The roadmap for the network is ambitious to say the least: Roadmap (ton.org) The TON Foundation wants to ultimately have a footprint in DeFi, stablecoins, file storage , domains, and websites. Essentially, it is trying to be everything all in one blockchain network. So far, adoption appears fast but still very small compared to other Layer 1 chains. Risks Jurisdiction risk seems like the obvious one for Toncoin. I think there are fairly large concerns about how the SEC would view this project given the new team's roadmap seems to be still very much tied to implementation with Telegram. The project's official Twitter handle has been suspended and one of the leading apps on the blockchain, Fragment, is blocked in the United States: TON Domain Marketplace (Fragment.com) This is in addition to all of the normal risks that come with any cryptocurrency. Those risks include macro headwinds as well as loss of confidence in the future of public blockchain from individual investors. It's also important to remember that this is an industry that is filled with fraud and scams. Summary There isn't a lot of network data that is available and the roadmap seems very much tied to one specific social messaging app for onboarding users, namely Telegram. Telegram seems to be the only company that is doing anything meaningful with the blockchain itself and there is plenty of competition in the Web3 space. Furthermore, I think it's problematic that major US-based exchanges like Coinbase ( COIN ), Kraken, and Gemini haven't listed the token. I'd probably steer clear of this one for the time being even with DEX purchases.",NEUTRAL,ICO | TON,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TON,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568395-toncoin-telegram-blockchain?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7179442.jpeg
7179039,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568394-why-i-added-to-silvergate-after-45-percent-crash?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1673050244,Why I Added To Silvergate After 45.33% Crash,"Summary Crypto bank Silvergate Capital crashed 45.33% in one day. The bank issued a press release admitting it lost 70% of deposits. Losing your deposit base is disastrous to most banks. I believe it may not be as bad in this unique case. Short term I expect more pain and reckoning but long term I see value. It is a terrible feeling to be long Silvergate ( SI ) and see it collapse ~49% in a day after an extended period of downward momentum, and today isn't looking too good either. Data by YCharts The collapse happened because Silvergate issued a business update admitting to losing 70% of its deposits. Everyone knew they were losing deposits, but I don't think anyone expected them to lose this many. A downward correction seems more than appropriate. It always feels ridiculous to defend a company that's coming out with bad news like this and where there's still more bad news (opinions can differ on how bad it will get). These are times that will be interesting to reflect on three years from now. Will Silvergate be significantly higher than it is today, will it go to zero, or will it continue to languish around this level? If I try to distance myself a little bit from the outrage and the chaos at hand and take a long-term view, my view is still that this will be significantly higher in three years. I recognize the challenges ahead and understand it may not work out if regulators uncover wrongdoing or if regulators otherwise undermine the future of the business. One thing I believe is essential is that I understand Silvergate always encouraged customers (primarily digital asset companies) to take deposits elsewhere if they weren't actively deploying the capital. Silvergate wasn't paying any interest on digital asset customer deposits and therefore, the capital must be used in a way that's more productive than the short-term yield customers could have gotten elsewhere. Their deposit base also had a volatile history going up and down fairly wildly. They prepared for this with an excellent balance sheet loaded with liquid government-guaranteed or backed securities. Customers like the services Silvergate provides and see value in the SEN network (this allows them to trade dollars with each other). With crypto firms blowing up left and right and all kinds of rumors being circulated about Silvergate (go on Twitter and search for $SI) there, customers may have gotten scared. Enterprise customers tend to deposit large sums, and FDIC insurance doesn't cover that. I expected enterprise customers wouldn't be easily scared away and trading firm deposits would be very sticky (chaos in the crypto world means great trading opportunities for arbs and market maker-type firms). I was wrong. 70% of deposits got pulled. Normally, it is a disaster for a bank to lose deposits. Once you lose them, it is tough to get them back. You have to entice them with high yields but that sort of defeats the purpose. A bank ideally wants low-cost sticky deposits. But Silvergate's case is fairly unique. Customers aren't here because of the yield or because they know the brand... They are here because of the SEN network and the specialization in providing bank services to digital asset customers. This is still hard to find. I think that if it becomes clear Silvergate is completely sound, deposits could return quickly. With this latest PR, it should be clear Silvergate is sound. The bank has cash on hand that more than covers the digital asset customers' deposits. The latest deposit figure was slightly higher than the absolute bottom, which may (or may not) be indication deposits are starting to bounce back. I think the remaining deposits will be the most sticky. These are likely the customers that derive the most use from Silvergate's services. If you don't believe in a future where crypto plays any role, this company doesn't make sense. Ultimately, I believe digital assets will be a thing of the future, and that's why I continue to see value here. Yesterday's press release contained a lot of interesting information. The company also held a lengthy call , worth listening to, where they provided a lot of additional color. At the risk of sounding like a delusional bull, I'll review some of the ""positive"" takeaways from the business update. Quotes are directly from the PR or the call transcript and my discussion follows in between: The Silvergate Exchange Network Platform continues to operate 24/7 with average daily volume totaling $1.3B in Q4 vs. $1.2B in Q3. The increase in volume appears small. However, we should take into account that deposits dropped by 70%. This looks like trading volume, done by the remaining customers, exploded. This is in line with my expectation that the remaining customers derive a lot of value from the SEN-network and are more likely to be sticky customers. Cash and cash equivalents as of Dec. 31, 2022 was ~$4.6B, in excess of deposits from digital asset customers. It should be clear to customers that their deposits are covered, and they can pull their money anytime. During Q4, Silvergate ( SI ) sold $5.2B of debt securities for cash proceeds, resulting in a loss on the sale of securities and related derivatives of $718M during Q4 2022. It looks like this loss is primarily losses on the bond portfolio that were already present before this run on deposits. It is just that selling assets to cover redemptions forces the company to recognize these losses within its financials instead of just pointing them out in the discussion in the 10-K. It is mostly the result of the Fed raising rates and banks (including Silvergate) taking a hit on the long end of their existing bond portfolios. Accountancy rules allow you to categorize these loans/bonds as held-to-maturity or HTM, meaning you're assuming you'll get paid back in full at the end of their life. If you can't realistically apply HTM, like when 70% of your deposits get pulled, you have to mark these to market. However, the economic loss already existed in reality whether accountancy reflects it or it is only reflected in the footnotes. Here is some color from the call: .. . We did make the decision late in the fourth quarter that we no longer have the ability and the intent to hold the securities that were previously categorized as held-to-maturity. And that was fairly obvious given the fact that we were selling a significant portion of our securities portfolio. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we will likely sell additional securities here early in 2023 to further pay down wholesale borrowings. And so just to make sure nobody is double-counting here, you could go back and look at the mark on the available sale portfolio at September 30, and then also look at the mark on the HTM portfolio, which was disclosed in our 10-Q. And you could assume that all of that now is -- has either been realized through that $700-plus million of loss and/or is included in the remaining roughly $300 million of mark on the portfolio... Another comment from the call I liked is the following: At December 31, 2022, the company held $5.6 billion of total debt securities at fair value, all of which are U.S. government or agency-backed and available for sale, and which include unrealized losses of approximately $0.3 billion. The company anticipates selling a portion of these securities in early 2023 to reduce wholesale borrowings, which will result in recognition of a fourth quarter impairment charge related to the unrealized loss on those securities expected to be sold. As we always have, we will continue to evaluate our balance sheet and liquidity management needs, which will depend on deposit flows and customer behavior. The company is anticipating paying back wholesale deposits. To my understanding, they've been raising deposits (to decrease the need to sell securities) from nondigital asset customers by enticing them with high rates. Of course, this is very high-cost funding, and they would ideally get rid of it under more stable conditions. This sort of suggests they expect more stable conditions for next quarter already, AND they're not saying they expect selling to meet digital asset redemptions. The last comment from the call I wanted to highlight is the following(emphasis mine): So as Alan characterized, there was a crisis of confidence and a lack of trust in the industry that happened in the fourth quarter. And so we had clients that were proprietary traders, market makers that had been doing business with each other for sometimes 6, 8 years, that just stop doing business with each other and pulled their -- essentially pulled all their deposits. We had some clients that moved -- these are crypto-native firms that moved almost completely into U.S. treasuries. So that was sort of the dynamic that happened in the fourth quarter. As we were talking with our clients and asking them, ""Hey, when might you shift to a risk-on position?"" they really couldn't tell us. That said, we didn't have any clients that said that they were exiting the space altogether. Perhaps there will be some that do, but we didn't receive that feedback. And our clients were generally supportive of Silvergate despite the fact that they pulled their deposits. And just really given the overall circumstances, decided to take that action. And -- but seemed to be committed to the space and willing to come back when market conditions are right. This client feedback, obviously provided by the company (hence with a bullish bias), is a confirmation of my hunch that the deposits are more likely to return than if a similar amount of deposits are left at a ""normal"" bank. Data by YCharts If you believe crypto is toxic or uninvestable, I can't make any case for this bank that makes sense. I don't love buying the bank on a book value basis. Although the deposit news was terrible, the business update gives clarity and survived a tremendous run. I saw an article in the FT today saying: It has simply decided to retrench for the time being. Unlike others involved with cryptocurrency, it may find a means to survive financially. Its reputation though will not. I can't entirely agree its reputation will not survive. I would say its reputation should be enhanced, given the bank run it endured. In my opinion, a run that wasn't entirely necessary but encouraged on social media . In the short term, the pain will likely continue for a while. Earnings power is unlikely to ""normalize"" in 2023 and maybe not even in 2024. However, I do see paths where the deposits return, and the bank goes back to making $3+ per year in EPS while growing. In the shorter term, I can see paths where it gets to a pre-2020 level of $1-$1.20 per share. That is likely enough to support the share price as is, without any growth. Right now, people all talk about survival and book value (as they did after 08' about every company anywhere). Me too. But the crypto world moves fast, and if we're ever getting past this deleveraging, fraud shakeout, people start thinking again about the embedded optionality. About the value of future earnings. I added shares yesterday between $12.25 and $13.90. On the Special-Situations report, I've included an admittedly speculative option position that could be interesting to bullish investors.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568394-why-i-added-to-silvergate-after-45-percent-crash?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7179039.jpeg
