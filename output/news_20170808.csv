42379738,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYub,1502226034,India Close to Finishing Work on Cryptocurrency Rule Proposals,"India's government has reportedly completed work on a proposal that outlines possible steps for regulating cryptocurrencies.  According to local media source Business Line, the report, submitted by an intergovernmental body put together in April, has been delivered to the Indian Ministry of Finance.  It's contents are currently unknown, though media reports in recent weeks suggest that at least some of the panel's participants want to adopt a more restrictive stance. Other sources have indicated that India may ultimately move to establish some kind of tax policy for cryptocurrencies.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the committee was established in order to examine the current framework in for cryptocurrencies in the country. Startups in India that work with bitcoin or blockchain have called forhttp://esk.com/india-bitcoin-startups-government-rules/ an inclusive stance from the government, particularly in light of confusion among consumers about the tech's exact legal status.  It's not clear when the Indian Ministry of Finance will publish the report or in what form that release will take.  Meanwhile, efforts to examine the regulatory environment for the tech continue to expand.  CoinDesk reported earlier this week that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has unveiled a broad advisory committee that will research blockchain and other technologies. The goal, according to SEBI, is to see whether the tech could be applied to its own regulatory processes.

The long-debated scaling upgrade reached the necessary threshold to ""lock in"" today at block 479,707 with 100% of bitcoin mining pools signaling support for the proposal. According to network data, the block was mined by BitClub.  But the change won't officially lock-in until tomorrow, once the signaling period has ended.  Further, the change will be unusable, as CoinDesk described in more depth, for a couple more weeks.  The network will move into a roughly two-week ""grace period,"" to give users and mining pools a chance to upgrade their software. After that, which looks to end August 21, SegWit will activate and miners will start rejecting blocks that do not support the change.  First proposed by bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille in December 2015, the expectation for SegWit is that it will open up several ways to scale bitcoin to support more users. While this doesn't seem particularly contentious, it has been the subject of tireless debate within the bitcoin community.  Other communities such as litecoin managed to activate it last spring.  But today, the SegWit loop has been closed for bitcoin.

Kasikorn Bank, or KBank, revealed today that it wants to move away from paper-based letters of guarantee – which are commonly issued by banks to ensure the delivery of certain types of securities – to a wholly digital format.  The process won't happen overnight, though. According to KBank, the plan involves digitizing 35 percent of the total amount of these contracts it generates by the end of next year. For a sense of the scale, KBank said that it expects to issue as much as $9 billion in letters of guarantee during that time.  Of those, 5 percent will be executed on the blockchain-powered platform, which uses the Hyperledger Fabric software as a basis. And looking ahead, KBank wants to find other partners that would use the platform.  As Pipit Aneaknithi, KBank's president, explained in a statement:  ""Blockchain technology is applied to create highly secure networks of document filing and retrieval. As Thailand's largest issuer of Letters of Guarantee, KBank is working with IBM to implement this innovative technology to further define and articulate our leadership in this market.""  The solution was previously tested in conjunction with Thailand's central bank as part of its regulatory ""sandbox"", or a framework in which new kinds of financial tech can be trialled in a limited setting.  As reported previously, KBank has been working with IBM to develop blockchain solutions for certifying the veracity of documents.

42379741,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KYzd,1502207425,$100 Million: Putin Advisor Targets Big Raise for Bitcoin Mining ICO,"An advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to raise as much as $100 million in an initial coin offering (ICO).  The funding effort for the ""Russian Mining Company"" was revealed this week by Dmitry Marinichev, who serves as the internet ombudsman to Putin's office.  According to a presentation published in tandem with the unveiling, the team behind the effort is planning to tap as much as 20 megawatts to power their mining farm, using chips developed domestically. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, creating new tokens – 12.5 BTC, or roughly $42,000 at current prices – as a reward for the miner.  The presentation details how the sale will take place in two parts: a pre-sale that began yesterday and will last until August 25. From there, a second-stage sale will occur between August 28 and September 2.  The ICO is the first planned release on a new service jointly created by the Party for Growth, a Russian political partner, and the developers of the Waves blockchain platform. The initiative was first unveiled in June.  Russian billionaire and party chairman Boris Titov, according a new blog post, remarked during a presser yesterday that the platform would act as a screening mechanism for projects hoping to launch ICOs.  He told attendees:  ""...within the framework of the ICO-generator we will conduct the initial selection of projects, their legal and economic expertise, after which investors in the ICO market [can] be sure that these companies are working under our umbrella and not crooks.""  Bloomberg  , which attended the press conference, reports that Marinichev struck an ambitious note about the mining venture's prospects.  ""Russia has the potential to reach up to 30 percent share in global cryptocurrency mining in the future,"" he was quoted as saying.  If the offering does raise the target amount, it would represent one of an increasingly growing number of big-ticket ICOs that have occurred in recent months. According to data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker, more than $1.6 billion has been raised through the ICO model to date.

UNICEF, as previously reported by CoinDesk, has spent much of the past year weighing whether blockchain can assist in its mission of improving the lives of children across the globe. The agency's work with the technology forms part of a broader effort within the UN to apply blockchain in various use cases.  The latest trial, according to a recent blog post, is to test new ways of sending transactions, including the use of smart contracts – self-executing pieces of code that operate on top of a blockchain. More specifically, the focal point of the trial is on the use of multi-signature contracts.  The agency has also made public the ethereum address being used for the test, which reveals that the agency conducted a number of transactions over the weekend.  In the blog post, UNCIEF software developer Qusai Jouda provided some background for the project, writing:  ""One way to re-shape online transactions is in lowering the 'cost of trust'; in effect, improving how parties transfer assets across the Internet. For UNICEF Ventures – where we assess and prototype emerging technology that can provide a portfolio of solutions to our organization as early-stage tech matures – this means testing ethereum-based smart contracts as a tool for improved efficiency, transparency and accountability.""  The trial comes less than a year after UNICEF invested in its first blockchain startup.  As CoinDesk reported at the time, the organization invested roughly $100,000 in 9Needs, a company focused on creating distributed educational tools for children.

With the announcement, Overstock.com shoppers can now use ether, litecoin, dash and bitcoin cash at checkout, a move that follows Overstock's early embrace of bitcoin as a payment method. Overstock first began accepting bitcoin for payment in 2014, and it has remained active in developing the technology, even launching a dedicated subsidiary to focus on applications.  In statements, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne sought to portray the decision as one that gives its customers greater freedoms outside of the traditional financial system.  Bryne said:  ""Overstock is pro-freedom, including the freedom of individuals to communicate information about value and scarcity without relying on a medium created through the fiat of unaccountable government mandarins.""  The move further comes at a time of broader diversification in the cryptocurrency market, which has seen bitcoin's share of the total asset class slip below 50%.  As such, Overstock framed the move as one that keeps it in line with new developments in the blockchain market. But whether the company believes this trend will continue remains unclear.  Notably, Overstock said it intends to convert the cryptocurrency it receives to bitcoin, as well as issue refunds using the protocol.

42379692,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KWqH,1502193606,ICOs Meet IPOs: Blockchain Author Alex Tapscott to Take Token Startup Public,"If blockchain author Alex Tapscott gets his way, his newly launched investment firm will be the first publicly traded company to focus on initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Fresh off the news that Tapscott's NextBlock Global has raised $20 million to invest in projects selling cryptographic tokens, he has revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that he plans to list the company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).  Whereas ICOs have been popularized as an alternative to traditional funding, Tapscott's rationale in appealing to accredited investors is that he believes they could unlock even more capital for the sector. To bridge that gap, Tapscott said he's already held ""numerous"" meetings with Canadian regulators, and that he will likely file paperwork for an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming weeks.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Tapscott went on to describe the importance of what may be the first ICO investment firm to IPO.  He explained:  ""Anybody with a discount brokerage account, whether it's small retail investors, all the way up to a mutual fund or a pension fund, will have what we view as a safe, regulated and relatively straightforward way of owning a diverse collection of the best opportunities in this asset class.""  After the application is filed with the TSX this fall, it will be reviewed by the Ontario Securities Submission (OSC), and if approved, Tapscott expects to go public in six months, ""concurrent with a much larger raise.""  Structure and strategy  Also revealed to CoinDesk were new details about NextBlock Global's investment strategy, including its plans to focus on protocols with the potential to enable entire ecosystems of decentralized applications.  The majority of those investments, Tapscott said, will be made in projects planning to offer an ICO, but which haven't yet done so. According to CoinDesk data, blockchain projects have in total raised over $1.5 billion in ICOs through July, including $500 million over the last 30 days alone.  In this way, Tapscott is positioning himself among a growing pool of investors who believe that while token sales funded by the public make venture capital dollars less necessary, the skills provided by his team will incentivize experienced investors to join the market.  For example, Tapscott only opted to pursue a publicly traded digital asset investment firm after considering several potentially competing models.  This research included exploring whether the company should hold its own ICO that would issue fund units to accredited limited partners, or whether it should seek a more traditional fund structure by selling to general partners and limited partners.  Still, he believes an IPO remains the preferred option.  ""The market is still relatively small, and the number of investors that are actually deploying capital is still relatively small,"" said Tapscott, adding:  ""And it's always been my goal to accelerate mainstream investment in this asset class.""  Global asset migration  Elsewhere, Tapscott discussed the importance of jurisdiction in informing his choice.  Since co-authoring his book, ""Blockchain Revolution,"" last year with his father, Don Tapscott, he has taken on an advisory position at the World Economic Forum and appeared regularly at blockchain conferences. But while he's become a fixture around the world, he said he chose to come home to his native Canada to list the company for both personal and professional reasons.  Tapscott cited TMX's early work with blockchain prototypes and the fact that Canada is among several countries that have shown willingness to let blockchain startups safely experiment in so-called regulatory ""sandboxes"" as reasons for the move.  ""My priority is not only to accelerate adoption,"" said Tapscott. ""But to make sure my home country, my hometown, leads in a positive way.""  Still, Tapscott acknowledged his goal in listing his company on the Toronto Stock Exchange has implications beyond Canada.  He concluded:  ""If we're going to be successful in migrating all traditional assets – bonds, interest royalties, deeds, titles, etc – into digital assets that are built on top of blockchain technology, then we’re going to have to interact closely with the people who lead in that field today, lead in the traditional world today.""

All told, the price of bitcoin has now climbed 250% since the start of the year, rising from just under $1,000 on January first to its all-time high today.  Year-over-year, the price gains are even more impressive, with bitcoin increasing nearly 600%. The price of bitcoin on August 8, 2016, was roughly $595, according to BPI data.  Whether bitcoin will push higher, however, remains to be seen, as the price did encounter some resistance, later declining to $3,458. The day's opening price was $3,431.  The price surge also coincides with a new all-time high in the wider cryptocurrency markets, as the value of all publicly traded cryptographic assets rose above $120 billion for the first time, up from $116 billion yesterday.  Overall, it appears bitcoin was responsible for much of the upward movement. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the market cap of bitcoin hit $56.8 billion today, up from around $53 billion yesterday.

42379716,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KXAP,1502186411,From ICOs to DCOs: The Dawn of Cleared Crypto Derivatives,"Conor O'Hanlon, Deborah North and David Lucking are lawyers based in Allen & Overy's New York office, where they focus on matters relating to fintech, derivatives and international capital markets.  In this opinion piece, the authors explain the significance of a recent CFTC approval of a cryptocurrency derivatives platform and its potential impact on the market.      In what was a bustling month in crypto-land, one of the more important industry events may have been lost in the news flow.  We're talking about LedgerX, a startup whose board members include, among others, Mark Wetjen, a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner, and its successful registration as a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) with the CFTC – the primary U.S. derivatives regulator.  While the first registration of a DCO intending to offer cryptocurrency-linked derivatives is significant in and of itself, the approval was granted alongside a letter providing LedgerX exemptive relief from some of the onerous requirements that (justifiably) apply to DCOs.  This article discusses those details, as well as what impact the registration might have more broadly.  1. Clearing derivatives: an overview  First, let's clear up clearing.  ""Clearing"" a contract (or ""swap"") as opposed to a security, means that a transaction, which may be entered into bilaterally or an exchange or other trading platform, is then legally transferred to a central counterparty (a CCP, or in the CFTC's nomenclature, a DCO).  This is in comparison to an uncleared swap, which remains bilateral between the buyer and seller (which means they remain exposed to each other's credit risk). In a cleared swap, the CCP acts as a central counterparty for each buyer and seller, and effectively ""guarantees"" performance (to the extent it has the resources to do so).  CCPs are beneficial because, among other things, they ameliorate default risk and allow participants to offset transactions entered into with multiple counterparties. But if there's one thing that Satoshi taught us, it's that centralization carries its own systemic risks – that's why CCPs are subject to significant regulatory requirements and oversight.  It's worth pausing at this point to note that earlier in July, LedgerX also registered as a swap execution facility (SEF). This is a separate regulatory designation. An SEF is a trading platform through which users can view indicative pricing and quotations, and trade and transact in derivative products.  Unlike a CCP, an SEF does not stand between buyer and seller. SEFs were introduced following the financial crisis and the major U.S. legislative efforts that followed (the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its related regulations).  The purpose of SEFs include providing greater transparency in pricing, business conduct, execution and reporting of derivative products. Currently LedgerX is one of two SEFs offerings cryptocurrency-linked products, the other being TeraExchange.  To round out this whistle-stop tour, it is worth mentioning that some existing cryptocurrency exchanges do offer margin trading (which is a form of derivative). However those exchanges have generally relied on an exemption from being regulated with the CFTC as an SEF that permits margin trading so long as it results in the ""actual delivery"" of bitcoins within 28 days (rather than deferred delivery, or a claim against an account with bitcoins).  2. What about securities and the SEC?  In the U.S., the regulation of swaps and securities is overseen by separate regulators, respectively, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The SEC's recent determination that DAO tokens were securities does not by itself impact LedgerX or the CFTC's regulation of swaps. It does, however, mention that some cryptocurrency exchanges that traded DAO tokens should have been registered as national securities exchanges or received an appropriate exemption.  To clarify, what the SEC is talking about here is securities exchanges, not necessarily exchanges or trading platforms on which trades in commodities or swaps are executed (which the CFTC regulates). For the moment, the only proposed crypto-derivatives relate to bitcoin, and so the SEC's wider role in regulating some security related elements of the derivatives market (like security-based swaps) has yet to be addressed.  3. How LedgerX compares to other DCOs and SEFs  While the CFTC's order approved LedgerX's registration as a DCO, such a designation comes with significant regulatory requirements and oversight.  That part of the equation was addressed in a CFTC letter issued at the same time. The letter outlined the exemptive relief being granted to LedgerX from some of those regulations. The relief included regulations pertaining to financial resources and related requirements of risk management, participant eligibility and management of funds.  LedgerX managed to avoid many of these requirements because of two primary differences between it and other established DCOs.  First, it is using a fully collateralized clearing model (buyer and seller must provide the full amount of their potential future obligations up front) so many of the regulations, which are aimed at protecting the CCP against defaults from its participants, are addressed by the fact that 100% of the collateral is already in place.  Second, LedgerX will only initially clear trades from LedgerX's own SEF, meaning it already has vetted the relevant participants.  In addition, the initial product being offered looks to be a simple bitcoin swap and the CFTC has already determined bitcoin is a commodity. Given these factors, the CFTC granted the above relief to LedgerX. However, as LedgerX expands both its client and product base, it will likely have to engage with the broader array of CFTC regulations applicable to DCOs.  4. What does this mean for cryptocurrencies?  This registration represents a small but significant step forward for bitcoin, and cryptocurrency more generally, as an asset class.  Although LedgerX's initial launch will be relatively limited, it signifies a growing interest from institutional investors who are keen to gain exposure to cryptocurrency risk.  For example, given the relative lack of regulated bitcoin-based investment vehicles, the LedgerX DCO now provides another possible avenue for such investors.  Secondly, the SEC's order rejecting the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF in March mentioned, in pertinent part, that there was an absence of a significant regulated derivatives market for bitcoin which contributed to the SEC's determination that there wasn't sufficient transparency in bitcoin markets.  That decision is currently under review, and the LedgerX DCO approval may impact that analysis.  Third, the LedgerX approval and relief is the latest in a number of CFTC actions and initiatives with cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The regulator, and its current chairman Christopher Giancarlo, seem particularly focused on fintech and cryptocurrency-related issues, such as the establishment of LabCFTC.  The CFTC appears to developing into a particularly forward-looking regulator in the cryptocurrency space.  The order stated that LedgerX must have a cryptocurrency audit performed by an independent certified public accountant. No further detail is given on this requirement, and it comes at a time when the Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering best practices for cryptocurrency accounting.  Lastly, the order didn't mandate any particular cryptocurrency storage method (such as cold storage). This is perhaps unsurprising, given the evolving nature of the technology and industry.  While certain cryptocurrency derivatives already exist in jurisdictions around the world (Bitcoin Cash futures anyone?), LedgerX's registration as a DCO represents a noteworthy development the U.S.  As interest in cryptocurrencies continues to grow, ""crypto-derivatives"" may begin to find a place alongside other more established elements of the crypto economy, such as payments and securities tokens.

42379699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KWwZ,1502179210,SegWit Lock-In: What the Tech Milestone Means for Bitcoin,"Barring unlikely interruptions, the scaling proposal called Segregated Witness (SegWit) is expected to lock in on the bitcoin network today.  Should enough miners continue signaling support, SegWit is projected to meet the necessary threshold later this afternoon (around block 479,708). And while it's theoretically possible miners could change their minds, it's unlikely they will – in short, miners have a huge financial incentive to enforce the change.  At that point, bitcoin will be one step closer to changing how some nodes on the $50 billion network store data, potentially paving the way for more exciting, forward-looking technologies, such as the top-level Lightning Network and other in-development advances.  But even with the change locked in, bitcoin won't upgrade overnight for two reasons:  Because of SegWit's two-week ""grace period,"" the change won't ""activate"" until block 481,824, which is currently projected to happen on August 21.  While the lock-in ensures SegWit will become a part of the network, bitcoin services still need to upgrade their software to support the new style of transactions.  Entering a grace period  The original idea behind the SegWit grace period is simple – it gives miners time to upgrade their software so that they can change in unison. So, while this may sound like yet another delay, it's actually an essential step.  After this two-week period, miners who have upgraded their software to support SegWit will create blocks that enforce the new rules. This means miners who have not upgraded will be at risk of losing their rewards (worth roughly $42,000), since their blocks would be rejected by other miners.  At the point of activation, though, it's still unclear how long it will take for the code change to ripple through the ecosystem and to actually be adopted by users, wallet providers, exchanges and other essential network infrastructure.  A number of services are already primed to support SegWit, including one of the most-used wallets, bitcoin startup Blockchain, as well as major bitcoin exchanges Kraken and LocalBitcoins.  However, some notable voices contend any larger embrace of SegWit could take longer given the costs involved. All in all, this remains a matter of dispute.  The importance of lock-in  Further, while it's one of several SegWit-related deadlines to pass recently, that shouldn't undercut the significance of this particular milestone – the lock-in is the step that actually ensures SegWit will be added to the network.  As such, the idea that SegWit will have reached this level of support could be seen as a breath of fresh air for many. Despite lingering critics, it's fair to say SegWit enjoys broad support (though the exact details of proposals for its enactment have varied).  In this light, today may be best viewed as a turning point in network development.  Perhaps most notably it ensures at least some sort of scaling-related tech will be added to the network, without the creation of an entirely new blockchain to get there.  And its enactment could go a long way toward encouraging other advances, showcasing bitcoin's willingness to change, however cautiously.  Proposed in 2015, and introduced for users to run at the end of last year, SegWit has taken just over a year-and-a-half to go from concept to production.
