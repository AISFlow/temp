42412657,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5iP2,1678838137,"Bitcoin Gains Early, Fades Late to Trade Below $25K","Buoyed by mildly encouraging inflation data and the banking sector’s continued rebound from near disaster, bitcoin rose above $26,000 on Tuesday for the first time in nine months before losing some of its gains.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $24,700, up over 2% in the past 24 hours. At one point on Tuesday, BTC had risen by double digits for a second consecutive day.  Bitcoin’s gains followed the Bureau of Labor Statistics release of the February consumer price index (CPI), which showed inflation declining to 6% from January’s 6.4% reading. The core rate of inflation that strips out food and energy costs, increased by 0.5%, a tick up from January, and against forecasts for 0.4%, although the year-over-year core rate was down slightly from the previous month.  “I think it was a healthy pullback after a euphoric crypto-specific rally,” Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk in a direct message on Twitter. “I'm still surprised how quickly the market seems to have shrugged off the events of the weekend.”  Carey highlighted that markets are still illiquid, which “makes all these moves sharper.” Meanwhile, Tuesday's news on a Russian fighter jet colliding with a U.S. Air Force drone over the Black Sea “added some jitters to all markets,” he added.  BTC’s surge this week followed U.S. banking and finance regulators’ decision to protect depositors of collapsed Silicon Valley (SVB) and Signature Bank (SBNY), and reflected investor hopefulness that the U.S. Federal Reserve would reverse its current hawkish prescription for inflation in response to concerns that its oversteps had precipitated the near banking meltdown.  James Lavish, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, said bitcoin’s pullback late Tuesday indicated that the cryptocurrency “got ahead of itself with short covering after pushing through key $25,000 resistance for traders.” In an email to CoinDesk, he added: “That, plus the CPI numbers suggest the hikes are not quite over yet, even if the 50-basis point is essentially off the table now.”  In the options market, traders have “priced in explosive upside moves for BTC” throughout 2023, said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata.  “Bitcoin has stopped trading as a ‘risk-asset’ and is instead now trading as an alternative currency as the Fed pivot narrative remains strong in the crypto community,” Magadini told CoinDesk in an email.  “Before SVB, the Fed had grown more hawkish due to strong employment numbers, with the downfall of SVB, we finally got a real ‘pivot’ catalyst,” he added.  Elsewhere in markets  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, also surged in the morning but then retreated. ETH was recently changing hands at $1,705, up 1.5% for the day. LQTY, native token for decentralized borrowing protocol Liquity, was one of the big gainers Tuesday, up 10% amid renewed interest in stablecoins post Circle USDC’s depegging.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was also up 2% for the day.  Equity markets rallied by Tuesday’s closing: The S&P 500 was up 1.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 1%.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/14/bitcoin-gains-early-fades-late-to-trade-below-25k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/886056ddb214e3848414e4904224b57294307453-1138x584.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412671,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5ibC,1678838000,"EU Parliament’s Smart Contract Plans Limit Standard-Setting Promise, EU Commissioner Says","Controversial European Union rules requiring a kill switch for certain smart contracts may limit the vital ability to set standards for the sector, the European Commission’s Thierry Breton told reporters on Tuesday.  His comments imply that provisions voted on by lawmakers earlier that day no longer meet the objectives set out in a 2022 Commission legal proposal known as the Data Act.  “We need to harmonize basic requirements for these smart contracts” to ensure interoperability, legal certainty and large scale deployment, said Breton, the commission’s lead official responsible for internal market laws, including for the digital sector. “When we made this proposal we intended to mandate standardization organizations to develop these.”  “I’m aware that the Parliament proposed changes to these basic requirements,” he said. “Notably these changes may limit the possibility to develop harmonized standards for smart contracts.”  Breton is now set to mediate between lawmakers and national governments to hammer out a final law, which aims to set out exactly how the makers of smart devices like cars or fridges can use the information they gather.  The Parliament's plans mean anyone offering a smart contract as part of a data sharing agreement to ensure it can be terminated or reset if something goes wrong. Arguably, that negates the purpose of a smart contract, intended to be unalterable and immune from central control – but Breton said he still wanted to see them succeed.  “Smart contracts are a useful tool to enable data sharing,” Breton said. “They can provide both data holders and data recipients with guarantees that data sharing conditions are fully respected.”  Read more: EU Parliament Passes Bill Requiring Smart Contracts to Include Kill Switch",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/14/eu-parliaments-smart-contract-plans-limit-standard-setting-promise-eu-commissioner-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a083063ccd6f488cf29890201997762923f67e02-5395x3035.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412654,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5iO6,1678834727,Staked ETH Withdrawals Being Processed on Ethereum Goerli Testnet Ahead of Shanghai Fork,"The final dress rehearsal for Ethereum’s upcoming Shanghai upgrade, more accurately known as “Shapella,” occurred Tuesday on the Goerli test network (testnet). The test simulated staked ether (ETH) withdrawals, bringing the highly anticipated upgrade closer to its final step: activating live on the mainnet blockchain sometime next month.  The upgrade was triggered at epoch 162304 at 10:26 UTC, however the epoch has not yet finalized at the time of writing, due to low validator participation rates. Under normal participation conditions, the epoch would have finalized at 10:38 UTC (6:38 p.m. ET).  There was a 29% validator participation rate at the time that the epoch triggered, which is particularly low for Ethereum. On a YouTube livestream, Ben Edgington, a product lead at Teku, an Ethereum client, acknowledged the low participation rate was likely due to validator nodes not having upgraded on time for the Goerli fork.  Read more: Shanghai + Capella = 'Shapella': How Ethereum Devs Now Refer to Upcoming Upgrade  The Shanghai upgrade will complete Ethereum’s full transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network by finally allowing validators to withdraw their staked ether as well as any rewards earned from adding or approving blocks to the blockchain. These funds have been locked up since December 2020 when Ethereum’s PoS Beacon Chain went live.  Testnets are used as a testing ground to mimic a main blockchain, allowing developers to patch any bugs before any upgrades are deployed on the mainnet.  Goerli was the last of three testnets to run through such a simulation. This test was the most anticipated of all three given that it has the largest validator set and mimics the Ethereum blockchain’s activity most closely. It was also the last opportunity for staking providers to test that staked ETH withdrawals would be properly processed before the upgrade goes live.  Ethereum developers will meet for their biweekly call on Thursday to ink in a date for the mainnet Shanghai upgrade. During the last biweekly call Ethereum developers discussed a mainnet target date for some time in the beginning of April, which is a slight deviation from their initial timeline set for March.

42412661,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5iTi,1678833842,"Signature Bank Shutdown Caused by 'Crisis of Confidence' in Leadership, NYDFS Says","Signature Bank was not shut down for crypto-related reasons, the New York Department of Financial Services said Tuesday, rejecting claims the regulator took over the bank to send an ""anti-crypto message.""  NYDFS took over Signature over the weekend, turning it over to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The move followed California's banking regulator seizing Silicon Valley Bank last Friday, and Silvergate Bank announcing it would voluntarily liquidate its assets last week. Signature, like Silvergate, served a number of crypto clients.  In a statement Tuesday, an NYDFS spokesperson echoed comments from the regulator's head, Superintendent Adrienne Harris, who said Monday the bank closure was not due to its role with crypto companies.  ""The decisions made over the weekend were not crypto-related,"" the spokesperson said. ""Signature was a traditional commercial bank with a wide range of activities and customers, including small businesses like food vendors at Hunt’s Point, residential mortgage banking, commercial real estate, to name a few. DFS has been facilitating well-regulated crypto activities for several years, and is a national model for regulating the space.""  Barney Frank, a Signature Bank board member and former U.S. congressman whose name adorns the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and who also endorsed a 2018 change to the law, told CNBC, Politico and other news organizations that he believed regulators shuttered Signature due to its servicing crypto clients.  “I think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message. We became the poster boy because there was no insolvency based on the fundamentals,"" Frank told CNBC.  NYDFS' statement said the bank still had ""significant withdrawal requests"" pending over the weekend, after a run on deposits on Friday.  Frank acknowledged that depositors withdrew over $10 billion on Friday.  ""The bank failed to provide reliable and consistent data, creating a significant crisis of confidence in the bank’s leadership,"" DFS said. ""The decision to take possession of the bank and hand it over to the FDIC was only made when it was clear the bank would be unable to do business in a safe and sound manner on Monday. The Department continues to work with federal regulators in addition to other officials to review and fully investigate the events that have unfolded and hold people accountable.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/14/signature-bank-shutdown-caused-by-crisis-of-confidence-in-leadership-nydfs-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ba3a21d2016ab12520e1f2213a971a9831fd7b2-3567x2006.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412659,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5iQu,1678833418,"In About-Face, Crypto Exchanges Abandon Support for STG Token Reissuance","Bitfinex and Binance are walking back technical support for Stargate Finance’s plans to reissue its stargate (STG) tokens, according to several announcements that came out this week. They will now promote the use of the protocol’s original STG tokens.  The crypto exchanges’ decision to eliminate support for the new STG tokens follows Stargate decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO) decision on Tuesday to pump the brakes on its plan to mint new tokens, according to a recent community proposal. At the time of that decision Stargate Finance had already begun disseminating the new STG tokens, according to data from Etherscan – a problem with which exchanges must now contend to eliminate security risks to STG token holders.  StargateDAO initially voted in favor of reissuing all STG tokens by March 15 after it uncovered security risks posed by “illegitimate STG transfers from compromised Alameda wallets,” referring to the failed crypto trading firm where roughly 10% of STG tokens are held. However, the DAO abandoned those plans when liquidators of FTX, Alameda’s sister company, rebuked the plan, arguing it violated an automatic stay issued in the FTX bankruptcy case.  ""[The reissuance] was to try to help the safety of the tokens in question. This is now being challenged with the liquidators clearly not wanting them moved,"" StargateDAO’s latest proposal to unwind the token’s reissuance reads.  As a result, Bitfinex and Binance are now revoking scheduled STG contract swaps on various blockchains. They have also taken steps to ascertain whether their users who have STG holdings are, in fact, holding original STG tokens and not reissued tokens.  Bitfinex provided its users with a contract address on the Ethereum network against which they could check the validity of their STG tokens.  ""We would like to remind our customers that there are STG tokens with different contract addresses in circulation; therefore, please don't send any STG tokens to our platform other than the one with the above contract address to avoid losing funds,"" Bitfinex said in its post about the canceled reissuance.  Meanwhile, Binance pledged to ""swap [users’] new STG tokens back to old STG tokens"" to mitigate security risks associated with the use of the new STG tokens.

Because of “astounding” growth in virtual assets, the industry often “treats regulations and financial crimes compliance as an afterthought,” Rosenberg said. She said the potential harms from criminal use of virtual assets has been illustrated by groups affiliated with North Korea that have “conducted ransomware attacks, stolen hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of virtual assets and laundered their ill-gotten funds through mixers and other virtual asset service providers to fund North Korea’s illegal nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.”  Read More: US Treasury Wants Public to Comment on Crypto’s Role in Illicit Finance",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/14/us-treasury-poised-to-release-view-on-how-defi-used-in-illicit-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69fdbd85a804a2bb50fc20873933f80508a836cb-4806x2703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412658,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5iSm,1678822757,Accounting Platform Cryptio Partners With Protocol Labs to Help Filecoin Miners Go Public,"Institutional-grade crypto accounting platform Cryptio has partnered with the company behind Filecoin, Protocol Labs, to help Filecoin miners meet audit obligations – an important factor for companies looking to go public.  Filecoin, which functions as a decentralized storage marketplace, allows users to rent out spare storage on their computer and rewards network participants who help with storing files or retrieving them.  Cryptio’s software helps crypto companies with accounting, audit and tax software. The company will now allow Filecoin miners to extract auditable transaction logs from its chain, according to a press release.  Filecoin miners, which are the storage providers for the protocol, will be able to generate accounting reports needed to pass their public company accounting oversight board (PCAOB) financial audits, the press release said.  There are currently over 4,000 storage providers (SP) on the Filecoin network, according to the company’s website.  “Miners can now import all on-chain activity from Filecoin and complete accounting, reporting, tax, and audit preparation to the high standard required by auditors and regulators,” said the press release.  For bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, a number of mining companies of the cryptocurrency are listed on public stock exchanges, Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platform (RIOT) to name a few. The publicly traded bitcoin miners have seen a massive exodus from investors during the recent crypto winter, which included a slump in bitcoin prices and rise in energy costs for the mining companies.  There are not many dedicated Filecoin miners that are currently publicly traded. Whether there is an investor appetite for more miners, particularly for Filecoin storage providers, also remains to be seen.  However, Cryptio remains committed to providing the accounting service, whether a miner decides to go public or not.  “Filecoin is a very complex chain and hard to 'index,' unlike Bitcoin,” said Hemant Pandit, head of revenue at Cryptio. “Cryptio has built this financial infrastructure that allows them to do their accounting and reporting in an auditable way, whether Filecoin miners want to go public or not.”  Of course, having accounting reports is not the only step for a private company to go public, but the software aims to help the miners with one crucial step towards a potential public listing. ""It was difficult to go public without this infrastructure. The [Securities and Exchange Commission] has higher audit standards for public companies. There have been large Filecoin miners (en route to going public) who were blocked by this previously,” he added.  Cryptio currently provides accounting infrastructure for more that 300 enterprises including MetaMask, 1inch and Chivo across 12 blockchains including Ethereum and Bitcoin.

42410997,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvTct,1678820101,Crypto Investors Are Left Guessing the Fed’s Next Move,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is in an apparent conundrum, wrestling with two scenarios.  Continue the recent pace of rate hikes: Inflation (while declining) is still too high, the tightness of labor markets is likely to push prices even higher and inflation is acting as a tax that impacts everyone. Nothing has changed.  Reverse course: While inflation is still high, the pace of rate increases has diminished the value of bond portfolios. The consequence of this trend has affected the financial stability of numerous banking institutions; thus the financial stability of all depositors in jeopardy. Everything has changed.  Crypto markets favor the second option. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are up 5% and 4%, following Tuesday’s release of inflation data.  The markets are concerned the U.S. central bank’s ongoing monetary hawkishness is a bigger, more immediate threat to the economy than inflation. The recent banking crisis has supported their contention.  Meanwhile, Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed a few items of note. Inflation rose 0.4% in February, a move in the right direction from the 0.5% increase in January.  But core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to 0.5% from 0.4% in the prior month. On an annualized basis, U.S. consumers are paying more for everything across the board, with the exception of used cars and a mild contraction in gasoline. The narrative of troublesome inflation remains intact.  Tuesday’s price action suggests that inflationary concerns will be secondary to those of economic growth.  Bitcoin increased 4% in the hour of the CPI data release, and breached $26,000, its highest level since June 2022.  Bitcoin trading activity spiked to more that twice its 20-day moving average for the second consecutive day, while also breaching the upper range of its Bollinger Bands.  Bollinger Bands are a widely used technical indicator that plots an asset’s moving average and calculates price points that are two standard deviations above and below the average. A breach of either the upper or lower band is significant as prices are expected to remain within two standard deviations of its average, 98% of the time. This marks the first upper band breach in 57 days.  ETH is on the precipice of doing the same, although a breach of the upper band has not been confirmed. Volume was 25% higher than its 20-day moving average. Other notable names whose volume was two times higher than normal were Polkadot's DOT, Litecoin's LTC and Ethereum Classic's ETC.  The macro narrative has returned to crypto markets, with what appears to be much less certainty now. The probabilities for a milder 25 basis point rate increase have oscillated from 0% to 35% to 16.6%, in just a week.  The volatility displayed in the aforementioned comment on rate probabilities will likely show itself in risk assets and cryptocurrencies especially in upcoming weeks.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETC | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/14/crypto-investors-are-left-guessing-the-feds-next-move,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa26ff1dac66d6c696695530283d341b04277e8c-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421334,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqnd,1678820024,Should I Keep My Money in Bitcoin or a Bank?,"Three banks have failed in less than a week. U.S. government officials have stepped up to backstop losses, in a bid to prevent further panic. There are genuine concerns about whether that was the right move – effectively bailing out two poorly run institutions facing highly irregular problems and letting the third collapse – as well as the risk that more banks will fail.  So should you take your money out of your bank and keep it safe under the mattress or in bitcoin? The answer is, if you’re anything like me, whatever money you have in a checking account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) up to $250,000. So, no, it’s improbable that JPMorgan Chase will rug you.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Still, many are moving their money into crypto, like Tatiana Koffman, who described the move Monday in CoinDesk as an act of protest. Putting aside stablecoins, crypto is volatile, making these assets less than ideal currencies if you want to preserve your wealth. But they offer “root ownership” – meaning no one can make a run for your deposits.  Bitcoin, as many have already said, was born out of an earlier banking crisis. The blockchain’s very first block contained a message about bailouts. It was designed to disintermediate third parties from internet money by making people responsible for their own keys, in contrast to the highly intertwined private banking sector and public sector.  President Joe Biden has said U.S. taxpayers will not foot the bill for the bailout, and that unlike in 2008 the architects of this financial crash will not benefit. There are enough responsible actors here to play the blame game, but if you’re like Tatiana the issue is The System itself.  Senior management of Silicon Valley Bank sold millions of dollars’ worth of shares in the leadup to the crash. That is seemingly the only risk management they performed. In 2015, SVB Chief Executive Greg Becker said institutions like SVB did “not present systemic risks” while testifying before Congress over plans to deregulate banking that were implemented in 2018.  SVB essentially took a bet that interest rates would stay near zero forever. Over the past couple of years, it took in deposits from a tech industry that was booming, in part, due to historically low rates that made venture capital financing worth the risk for many investors. In an effort to juice as much yield as possible from those deposits, SVB put a majority of its money into long-term, fixed-rate interest investments.  The Federal Reserve, as my colleague David Z. Morris wrote, essentially created the foundation for a tech hype cycle through financial engineering to stimulate the economy, and then threw the frying pan into ice water when things got too hot. The recent interest rate rises were not necessarily unpredictable, but the Fed’s inconsistent messaging – saying rate hikes were unthinkable until they weren’t – did not help the situation.  Venture capitalists like Peter Thiel helped accelerate SVB’s outsized growth, and its quickened collapse. Thiel is reportedly a believer in Girardian mimicry, which explains why groups of humans make predictable if irrational decisions and our relentless pursuit of scapegoats. Tech leaders have said SVB grew out of a feedback loop that made it the place for startups to bank.  Also, a similar social dynamic, fueled by chat groups and social media, kicked in on the way down. Some even put sometimes-CoinDesk author Byrne Hobart at the center of things, because he wrote a supposedly well-read blog last month saying SVB was effectively insolvent. And so depositors like Roku, which left some $487 million uninsured at SVB, are not blameless.  Politicians, who like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are using the situation to justify their pet causes, once promised us “no more bailouts,” yet wrote the rules that allowed SVB to use a little accounting magic and hide billions in unrealized losses. Some, like former Rep. Barney Frank said Signature Bank, where he is now a board member, was attacked for political reasons because it dealt with crypto.  When Frank was in Congress he co-sponsored the legislation ultimately enacted as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, stymied bank failures. Signature had reportedly experienced the worst of its bank run and could have survived without government intervention, Frank said. If moral hazard is the argument that people will engage in riskier behavior if protected from the consequences of their actions, then we need a new term for Frank’s claims.  See also: Why Stablecoin USDC's Unstable Weekend Matters | Learn  There were sound arguments for stepping in and preventing a cataclysmic blow to the valuable U.S. tech industry. Taxpayer money isn’t being used (at least not directly), deposits for growing businesses are safe, shareholders and bondholders aren’t being bailed out and even the New York Times is calling for clawbacks of SVB executive’s compensation and stock sales.  And, yes, there are solid arguments in favor of having let Silicon Valley Bank and Signature run their course. Expected losses were almost certainly exaggerated. A sound startup could have raised equity and banked elsewhere, and it would have put the fear of God back into the supposedly capitalistic U.S. economy.  But not bailing SVB and Signature out was never an option. Bank failures today are exceedingly rare and would cause a tremendous amount of panic, such as how the collapse of Silvergate Bank – essentially a free-floating entity detached from the wider economy – led here. And because SVB and Signature rode both the wave of cheap money created by Fed policy up and down, how separate can private and public interests really be?  So, if the U.S. government is officially in the business of bailing out banks, should you keep your money at a bank?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/14/should-i-keep-my-money-in-bitcoin-or-a-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cbe0f7648cb30df1b2b7693e5ef221933fb38d6c-2048x1112.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This interview is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week.  For those just tuning in, “House of Chico” is the second season of ""The Gimmicks"" – basically a vulgar animated comedy that’s a mix of ""South Park,"" wrestling, and crypto. It’s a grand experiment in community-driven storytelling, as the NFT (non-fungible-token) holders can vote on what happens to the characters.  Last year, I went for a deep dive into the world of ""The Gimmicks,"" and I’ve been curious as to how it's surviving the bear market. “The DIC punches are still flying. The viewership on the series is up to 7 million views,” says John Attanasio, Toonstar’s CEO and co-founder.  One reason for its success? The token holders of ""The Gimmicks"" aren’t using it to get rich – they’re just having fun. They enjoy being part of the story. That might be a useful lesson for others in Web3: If there’s compelling content or a convincing use case, you can find traction even in a world of slumping prices.  I caught up with Attanasio and Huang to see how ""The Gimmicks"" has evolved, what they have in store for the future and why the series gets a creative jolt from a new feature called “F#ck yeah, buddy!”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  In Season One of ""The Gimmicks,"" you were still experimenting with how much creative agency to give the community and how much to give the showrunners. What have you learned since then? Have you recalibrated?  Attanasio: For me, it's a little bit like a chemistry set or even a recipe, like a baking recipe, where there are degrees of participation and there are different types of participation. Some percentage is from the showrunners, some percentage from the community.  And each episode could have a different sort of complexion, as to how much that is. Some parts of it are choose-your-own-adventure, where you only have three choices. We try to give the impressions that you [the community member] have as much impact as you can, but at the end of the day, it might only be three choices. There’s no way around that. But there are other ways, like with the Wiki [like Wikipedia but for ""The Gimmicks""], where the community feeds so many ideas to the show.  Huang: We also evolved our thinking on the voting structure. We started asking questions that would build on top of prior decisions. So for example, in episode one of “House of Chico,” the butler gets attacked by the armadillo, and the audience had a choice of, well, okay, what happens to the butler? Does he die?  I’m guessing they killed the butler?  Huang: Yeah. They effectively killed him. But what ended up happening was that the butler turned into a ghost, and now he haunts Chico. So they [the community] effectively created a new character. They had a true impact on the season.  Wait, how did the mechanics work? I can see how the audience voted for the butler to die, but how did they create the new ghost?  Huang: They chose for him to die, and then subsequently, in the Wikis, they had the idea of the ghost haunting Chico.  Attanasio: And the other way we’re experimenting is instead of asking, “Go right or go left?” you start to get into the why. You ask questions about motivations. This gives you longer-term implications to a story arc.  Can you give an example?  Attanasio: You can ask why a character did something. So the villain in “House of Chico” is Señor Tomas. You ask a question of, hey, why is he doing these bad things? And all of a sudden, it feels like you’re going deeper.  Got it. You mention that a lot of the audience ideas are coming from the Wiki. So how much of that requires Web3? You can have Wikis and fan fiction in all kinds of Web2 formats, and we’ve had that for years or even decades. What makes ""The Gimmicks"" different?  Huang: Good question. There are two aspects of the Wiki, and we’ve upgraded the system. First off, the versions of the Wiki are all recorded on-chain. So you can see the evolution. And then there’s also the concept of, well, the “F**k yeah, buddy” button.  I love it already. What’s the “F**k yeah, buddy”?  Huang: So when you finish reading the Wiki, and you're like, ""Oh my God, this is like amazing,"" you can then hit the “F**k yeah, buddy” button. It’s at the bottom of the story. Pressing that button basically moves that Wiki up in the ranking system. It's a little like Rotten Tomatoes-ish.  Then you’re able to see which stories are resonating with people. So there are two ways people can participate in the Wikis now; they can actively write and contribute, or they can give lots of “F**k yeah, buddy”s.""  And are these Wikis token-gated?  Huang: You need to own an NFT in order to write your Wiki and to vote. And when you vote, it generates DIC punch tokens that go into your wallet, and that allows you the ability to give “F**k yeah, buddy” to other people.  Amazing. I know that the fans of ""The Gimmicks"" aren’t doing this to get rich, but crypto winter is impacting almost everyone. How have you guys been affected?  Huang: It's a tough time to really bring people into the ecosystem. Because of everything that’s happened, there’s a fear, right? People are, like, what is this Web3 stuff? The only thing they have in their heads is, “Oh, there’s that crazy dude who just made billions of dollars just vanish.” That’s the headline that sticks.  Attanasio: Right, right. The guy with the crazy hair, “Madoff with crazy hair.”  Huang: And one of our goals was that entertainment would bring more people into the [Web3] ecosystem. The point of our project wasn’t to get degens involved. It was about creating an accessible project for people who loved animation, or loved entertainment.  And [crypto winter] has made it much more challenging to bring people into the ecosystem. There’s more skepticism.  Attanasio: We’re also having conversations with potential strategic partners, like Hot Topic. (Last year, Toonstar announced a partnership with Hot Topic, the pop culture retailer with 11 million members.) And we’re looking at potentially amplifying ""The Gimmicks"" into Web2, or other traditional channels in Hollywood. And now the [crypto skepticism] always comes up.  It’s like you have the conversation and they ask about FTX, and you have to get into all that. I think it’s very clear that Web3 needs an image makeover. There’s no doubt.  And we also try to make a distinction. This is no knock on DeFi (decentralized finance), because we also think that DeFi has use cases, but the point is that we’re not DeFi. That’s not us. We’re not about flipping assets or investments. We’re about building the next-generation entertainment IP (intellectual property) and doing it through interactive storytelling and killer community experiences.  We’re all-in on Web3. And I think that for us, we need to help be the ones to sort of educate and drive that message.  Huang: It was important for us to launch “House of Chico” when we did, at the end of October [2022]. People asked us, “Look at the market, are you sure you want to do that?”  We wanted to show that regardless of what was happening in the industry, this is actually something that we are committed to. We fundamentally believe in the underlying technology and how it's going to reshape entertainment. So we're not going to fold ""House Chico"" for better weather. It's, like, full steam ahead.  What has community engagement been like in the past year? Are you seeing a slow-down?  Attanasio: I’ve been really surprised. At first, I was like, ""Oh now, is the community going to fall off a cliff?"" And it really hasn't. We're still seeing really strong engagement metrics.  The DIC punches are still flying. The viewership on the series is up to 7 million views. Seven million views on the content, and that's really driven by 5,000 token holders. So the reach multiplier is super high. And I think that only comes when you have people who are super active and engaged, because we’ve spent zero on marketing. This is all grassroots.  When we last spoke, you guys were still in the early stages of figuring out how this whole thing is monetized. I know you’re still in early days, and still focused on storytelling, community building and experimentation. But do you have any more clarity on monetization?  Huang: That’s something that we're continuing to hone in on. I think the future of monetization is really going to be a mix: Part of it might come through actual NFTs or tokens. And then another portion might be from premium experiences.  Attanasio: And I think legacy [media] could be complementary to what we're doing. I don't think it has to be an either or. So if someone were to say, “Hey, we love what you’re doing with 'The Gimmicks,' and we want to do a TV series or film,” that’s another potential revenue stream.  What can you tell us about future content, future shows?  Attanasio: We are looking at doing more spinoffs in ""The Gimmicks"" world, but all those would have to tie to the core theme, which is generally ""South Park"" meets sports. We started with wrestling, but we’ll probably do some spinoffs that are maybe more fan focused, or related to other types of sports.  Anything in the non-Gimmicks world?  Well … there’s this project we’re going to launch with you guys [CoinDesk] at Consensus. I can tell you more then.  Good tease! Final question. Any predictions for how community-driven storytelling will look in the future?  Attanasio: We have this stat, that the average ""Gimmicks"" token holder spends 15 to 20 hours per week in the community. That’s DIC punching, it's writing Wikis, it's interacting with other community members.  That's not traditional content viewing behavior. We did the math, and that would be like you watching your favorite 30-minute sitcom 40 times in the same week. It's crazy.  People just want to be more involved. They want to be interactive. And there are just more creators in general, or people who aspire to be a creator, and they’re willing to spend that kind of time with characters that they really love. So we can’t predict exactly what it will look like, but we do think that this is the future of storytelling.  Can’t wait.

42421332,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqkX,1678819271,How Sports DAOs Can Offer Fans a Piece of the Action,"It’s a company run by everyone at once. It’s a group chat you buy into with crypto. It’s the future of business. It’s free to create and scale at internet speed. It’s a decentralized autonomous organization: a DAO.  Whatever your level of understanding of DAOs, what makes or breaks one is its mission, vision and community engagement.  Adam Miller is the CEO and founder of MIDAO. This article is part of Culture Week.  It’s not just companies that achieve greater success with a stronger, clearer vision. The construction of the “why” and its achieved alignment with its target audience is what makes some DAOS live on and some DAOs fail.  A DAO lives and dies by its first 100 to 1,000 members who connect with its vision so deeply, it becomes a part of them. It’s these “superfans” who light the fire that leads to the DAO scaling.  Where else do we see superfans acting as the fire pushing something skyward? In sports, of course. From Bayern Munich to Paris St-Germain to National Basketball Association teams such as the Golden State Warriors to National Hockey Leagues teams including the Boston Bruins and beyond, it’s the twelfth man that rules.  Without fans, these sports teams would not even exist. We refer to them as “we” or “us” as if we are truly a part of them. Studies have shown that our self-esteem is linked to how our favorite teams are doing.  Sure, we are not on the field with them. Still, we react as if we are, feeling so proud of wearing our favorite team jerseys or distancing ourselves from the team when things aren’t going well. In the end, it all comes down to our most basic need to belong. Sports teams give us a natural community to be a part of, just as social clubs do – and now with Web3, DAOs do, too. But with one major difference.  Despite our deep connection, we have no meaningful say in what our favorite sports teams do. We don’t vote on what players they acquire in the offseason. We don’t decide when coaches get replaced. And, importantly, we don’t share in any financial upside.  Using DAOs, all this can change. We seek out ways to get more skin in the game, and now a tool has come along that can practically make us part of the teams we love. The future of sports is fan-run, and DAOs can help make that happen. Even so, we’ll have to start small. Most of the world doesn’t even understand why DAOs matter as an organizational paradigm, let alone as the future of fandom.  Using Ukraine DAO as a framework for success  To date, we’ve seen BuytheBroncos and Krause House, both of which were created to buy sports teams and make them truly fan-run. Karate Combat announced it launched a DAO for fans and handed team governance over to the DAO. However, while these DAOs are still operational, none has managed to reach its goal just yet.  The reason why is simple. Before we can have fan-owned teams, we need the organizations running the teams to understand what DAOs are and how they can benefit from them. In order to achieve this end, it can be useful to learn from other DAOs that have been successful in their on-the-ground efforts thus far, and that have begun to establish standards and frameworks for education that can provide us with useful templates.  Ukraine DAO offers one such example. Its mission is clear: “Help Ukraine win the war against Russia.” As the group has expanded, it has built out a powerful library of onboarding materials for those interested in joining its efforts. And the kicker? Essentially no crypto knowledge is required for entry. Translators, disinformation experts, donors and, most importantly, any Ukrainian interested in working directly to save their country are welcome.  Because of their success in attracting non-crypto individuals, numerous other DAOs are seeking to emulate their approach. From the social impact space to the future of sports teams, the more that we seek to put crypto on the back end, the more widely used and successful DAOs will be.  To do that, we’ll have to develop industry-standard frameworks for different types of DAOs, such as investment DAOs, service DAOs and, of course, sports team DAOs. In other words, we need DAOs-as-a-service, but before that we need accelerators, cohorts and meetups focused on educating those with zero crypto knowledge.  This means individuals and institutions need to get involved.  The more we educate the world on why DAOs matter, the wider the potential market of DAO participants becomes.  Sports DAOs offer democratization of the fanbase  As DAOs scale, it’s not too off-base to hope for a day when we’ll be able to vote on whether or not to sub out a struggling player or whether or not to go for the gold when the game is down to the wire. Just as the Ethereum network continues to show us the way toward a fairer internet, DAOs will show us the way toward the future of being a fan.  For the teams themselves to buy into greater fan involvement, they will have to see DAOs not as a threat but as an opportunity to increase their engagement of their fanbase and, potentially, their long-term success. Before we have fully fan-run teams, we will have teams in which fans simply have direct voting power through DAOs over certain issues, such as perhaps what vendors to choose for the stadium or what newly designed jersey to wear.  A common retort to the vision for sports team DAOs is, “You think fans can make good decisions for the team? There is no way a democratic vote can produce the same outcome as professional management!” And these skeptics may have a point.  But the point is that by allowing fans to have more skin in the game, they can take ownership of whatever the results may be – for better or worse. And in the meantime, the team will be able to attract more fans to its base, win or lose, simply because by giving democratic-like power over management to fans through a DAO that team will be more engaging and more fun. I would even expect it to start drawing support away from other teams.  Just as people would rather live in a democracy than in an autocracy, fans will want to support teams that are more democratic.

Over the past several weeks, regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled a slew of enforcement actions against crypto companies in what many industry players view as an hostile attack on crypto and U.S. innovation, saidd Brian Quintenz, a former Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner and current head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  “The SEC is completely out of control. They’re going rogue,” Quintenz said.  A lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Leticia James last week against crypto exchange KuCoin alleged that ether (ETH) was an unregistered security. If proven in court, it would place the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap under the purview of the SEC.  READ MORE: What Happens if Ether Is a Security?  “The United States has to make a decision about whether or not it will embrace and support innovators in this country,” said Quintenz during an afternoon panel. “There are jurisdictions that are mindful about this. That is not what we are seeing in the United States, and the clock is ticking.”  Another panelist, CoinFund President Chris Perkins, added that jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom were ahead of the United States in terms of progress.  “We try to advise our founders about regulatory risk, but it’s hard without regulatory clarity,” added Perkins. “Other countries are not waiting for us.”  Many industry players have now turned towards a potential legislative solution with support from both Democrats and Republicans.  “There aren’t many issues where you’ll see [Rep.] Ritchie Torres [D-N.Y.] agreeing with [Sen.] Ted Cruz [R-Texas],” said Perkins.  “I see bipartisan interest, and that gives me hope,” said Julia Hueckel, associate general counsel at Coinbase.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ASIA | COMMODITY | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/14/sec-is-completely-out-of-control-says-a16z-cryptos-head-of-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e196faba7f15ecc25325cd2ada692d4dea690145-4030x2267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price of LQTY, the secondary token for decentralized borrowing protocol Liquity, was up nearly 20% in the past 24 hours – placing it among the best-performing crypto assets for the period. Moreover, LQTY has soared nearly 500% since the start of the year and was trading around $3.33 at presstime.  The most recent price action came after investors balked at Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The dollar-pegged crypto’s loss (whose weekend woes stemmed from $3.3 billion in then-inaccessible bank reserves at Silicon Valley Bank) has been a win for Liquity, a decentralized platform for taking out loans denominated in protocol’s primary token, LUSD.  Liquity’s LUSD ""clearly managed to take center stage during the USDC depeg panic, and that’s likely caused some investors to take a second look at"" LQTY, said Andrew Thurman, head of research for data company Nansen.  While LUSD is meant to retain its dollar peg, Liquidity’s secondary token LUSD has seen the upside. LQTY, which has a total supply of 100 million and a market capitalization of $314 million, per CoinGecko, captures the fee revenue generated by the Liquity protocol, which are then paid out to stakers.  Data from Nansen shows a 10% jump in wallets holding the LUSD stablecoin since March 6, indicative of a new stablecoin narrative following the depegging of USDC.  Liquity allows users to deposit ether (ETH) into the protocol as collateral and take out loans denominated in U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin LUSD. Instead of charging a variable interest rate for drawing loans, Liquity has a 0% interest rate, charging users a one-time fee.  With a total value locked (TVL) of $683 million, according to data aggregator DeFiLlama, Liquity has generated $30 million in lifetime revenue. As of March 11, users have borrowed almost $4.5 billion LUSD, according to a dune dashboard created by a Liquity developer.  Currently, more than 52 million LQTY worth about $184 million has been staked, which represents 52% of the total supply of LQTY, per blockchain explorer Etherscan.

The collapse of SVB shows why Bitcoin is needed, but that is not why it is rallying. The charts tell the real story. Expectations of a Fed pause have been renewed, and this is helping risk assets again. Thesis Summary Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is staging an incredible rally following the collapse and posterior bailout of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Fundamentally, BTC is benefitting from the renewed hopes that a Fed pause is coming sooner rather than later. Ultimately, this supports the idea exposed in my last piece on BTC, where I talked about its correlation with liquidity. All paths lead to Rome; in this case, Rome means monetary inflation, which is great news for Bitcoin holders. From a technical perspective, we have found support at key levels, and this sell-off came with various warnings. While fundamentals certainly play a big role, technicals can often help us predict moves like this and better understand when price action will change. What is Happening to Banks? To say that we have witnessed a wild week in markets would be an understatement at this point. Silvergate ( SI ) shut down last week, delivering a blow to crypto, something which I already covered here . However, this ""crypto bank's"" failure is nothing compared to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. SVB has now been officially taken over by the FDIC, which has assured depositors they will be made whole. SVB fell victim to a run on its deposits, which began after the bank tried to raise capital. This made people panic, and depositors rushed to take their money out. The bigger issue at play, though is the fact that interest rates have risen so much over the last few years. This hurts SVB, and is hurting other banks, in two main ways. Assets on balance are being repriced lower. Banks deposits have to compete with short-dated treasuries that are yielding upwards of 4%. As is common when something like this happens, this bank failure is sending shockwaves through the market, and the word contagion is being thrown around. Signature Bank (SBNY) is also being taken over by the FDIC and as I write this, trading has been halted for First Republic Bank (FRC) down over 60% for the day. The collapse of SVB has even taken crypto by storm, with USDC losing its peg over the weekend. SVB was one of Circle's partners, and so was Signature bank. USDC (Coinmarketcap) USDC recovered over the weekend, after dipping as low as 88 cents. With the FDIC stepping in, Circle should not be in trouble regarding solvency. Liquidity, however, is another issue. Like with SVB, USDC depositors have incentives to retrieve their dollars, especially given the high yields. Bitcoin Shines Once Again While the US financial system crumbles, Bitcoin has staged an incredibly impressive one-day rally. Though the world's premier did sell off on Thursday and Friday, Bitcoin is now back above $24,000. For those following my work, this sell-off was anticipated, at least to a degree. BTC TA (Author's work) A couple of things stand out here. First off, notice how Bitcoin reached a local top just at the $25,000 level. This was a key area of resistance since it is where BTC topped in its last relief rally and BTC failed to break it three times. Now, the RSI and MACD also gave us clear signals of price exhaustion, which we can see due to the divergence between these indicators and the price. Both the MACD and RSI topped towards the end of January, while Bitcoin's price kept making new highs. Already, this was a sign that buyers were getting exhausted. And then, of course, we have our EW count. BTC TA (Author's work) I have been playing with some different counts, but this one seems most likely for now. This puts us in wave 4 to complete our initial wave (I) off the lows and assumes a bottom is in. From a technical perspective, this reversal could have been easy to call. For one, BTC found strong support at the 50% retracement of its wave 3, which is ideal for wave 4. Bitcoin did dip below this level temporarily, but buyers stepped in exactly at the support offered by the long-term trendline, which we can see in the chart. (The black diagonal line coming down from the left). This trendline came from the BTC top in 2021 and was broken for the first time in January. This was an initial bullish signal. Holding it during this pull-back, as US banking stability is questioned, I'd call it a very bullish indicator. But this is not the first time we have seen Bitcoin thrive as the financial system collapses around it. In 2013, Cyprus had a massive financial collapse just as Bitcoin was beginning one of its most spectacular rallies. To wrap up, let's look at the long-term picture: BTC long-term (Author's work) Zooming out, we have been completing a corrective ABC structure in a macro wave IV since the beginning of 2021. In fact, I see the top we made in 2022 as an overshooting B wave. Since then, we have completed what could be seen as five waves to the downside, meaning a bottom could be in. This count, shown in red, would have us bottoming just above $15,000, which makes sense since this represents the 50% retracement of the large wave III. My only issue with this count is that wave IV was quite short, both in terms of price retracement and time. For this reason, we must also consider the possibility that everything we have seen since July of 2022 has been part of an ABC correction in a large wave IV. This would mean the latest impulse is a C wave, which could take us near the $30,000 area, only to send us back down to new all-time lows. Arguments can be made for both bulls and bears, but the real test will come as we finish this wave C and begin a retracement. The nature of the decline will tell us which count we are on. If, and only if, we can retrace correctively and then break back above the wave I high will we be able to say with a high degree of confidence that a bottom is in. The Macro Outlook Aside from the technical analysis, there are also some fundamentals supporting this rally: the renewed expectations that the Fed could pause its rate hikes sooner. If bad news is good, then financial collapse should be great for stocks. Rate expectations (CME Fed watch) With that said, we are now witnessing a repricing in rates due to changes in expectations. Thursday last week, expectations for a 50 bps rate hike reached 70%, which has come down notably since. Add to this the mixed jobs report last week and the Fed pause narrative is, once again, gaining momentum. In 2007, the Fed also paused its rate hikes, giving us a solid twelve months of stock market rally. SPX 2008 (Author's work) Though a recession seems inevitable, the question is when will it happen? And how much can stocks, and especially Bitcoin, rally until then? Final Thoughts Bitcoin is rallying on the back of increased hopes for a Fed pause. Eventually, whether it is because of weak banks, falling housing prices or a recession, the Fed will probably have to turn the printing press back on. Other countries already have. Bitcoin is one of, if not the best, asset to hold in this situation. In a recession, even if the Fed is cutting rates, earnings can fall, and certain sectors can underperform. Just look at how bank stocks are collapsing today. Bitcoin, however, is impervious to this and the perfect way to profit from a Fed pivot/pause.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4587337-banks-collapse-bitcoin-rallies-looking-charts?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10683544.jpeg

42411033,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB4EK,1678810012,"Metaverse Fashion Is on the Rise, but for Whom?","In the last week of March, Metaverse Fashion Week will return to the virtual world of Decentraland.  Traditional brands including Adidas, Coach and Dolce & Gabbana will showcase their collections of digital wearables, host pop-ups and engage with their growing communities of fashion non-fungible token (NFT) collectors.  Last year, nearly 70 brands flocked to the metaverse for the inaugural event, hosting a lineup of runway shows, activations and immersive experiences. While the event itself turned out to be a whimsical, seemingly “clumsy” (in the words of one CoinDesk writer) interpretation on real-world fashion week, its deeply rooted Web3 ethos of accessibility, creativity and self-expression shone through to inspire innovation in the space.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week.  Experts point to digital fashion’s utility as having five defining facets. These include digitally native garments such as an avatar’s clothing, augmented reality (AR) filters on Instagram and TikTok, digital tailoring or superimposing NFTs on real-life photos, speculative investing, and proof of ownership through blockchain data.  But while the use cases tout a future in which digital fashion can solve many faults of the current fashion industry, many experts are left wondering who these technologies have in mind as their consumer audience. Though traditional brands such as Gucci, Nike and Tiffany have been making moves to expand their presence in Web3, identifying audiences for the growing realm of digital fashion has been, and will continue to be, vital to the industry’s growth in the coming years.  Several builders have called into question whether target markets for these products exist currently, and how they must evolve for mass adoption for digital fashion to take place.  The ‘who’ in ‘who what wearables’  The intricate technological and cultural interweavings of NFT fashion have helped lay the foundations for early digital wearables markets, as builders in the space attempt to understand who comprise their audiences.  Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer and founder of Web3 consultancy Journey, told CoinDesk there are four main markets for on-chain fashion. These include the Web3-native consumers who purchase NFTs to wear in the metaverse, gamers on popular platforms such as Fortnite and Roblox, digital art collectors who buy these assets for speculation, and social media users of platforms such as Instagram and TikTok who will dabble with AR filters and digital tailoring.  Read more: Megan Kaspar: Meta-a-Porter Fashion  To expand customer bases and utilize these technologies to their full potential, interoperability between metaverses must be at the forefront of creators’ minds to help better onboard their audiences.  “There is some interoperability [between metaverse platforms], but that bigger promise doesn't currently exist,” said Hackl. “That's if you view virtual fashion as something that you want to wear across virtual worlds.”  With many companies and brands looking towards physical fashion to build presences in the metaverse, that impact may be felt more on the street than, say, in Decentraland.  “Companies are wanting to experiment and also see if virtual fashion can also influence physical fashion,” said Hackl. “What culture is being created that impacts what you see on people wearing on the street?”  Hackl recently launched her own Web3 fashion label, Verseluxe, kicking off with her inaugural jewelry line Frillz created in tandem with designer Simone Faurschou. Users can scan a near-field communication (NFC) chip in the collection’s physical necklaces and bracelets to access a digital twin on-chain, helping to onboard the next group of digital fashion users.  Karinna Nobbs, co-founder of Web3 fashion company The Dematerialised, told CoinDesk metaverse fashion is pulling in early adopters of fashion and technology, once two separate worlds that are merging together through the prominence of Web3.  “It’s those creative economies, those areas because they're the most open to experimentation,” Nobbs told CoinDesk.  While many use cases are emerging for digital fashion, including digitally native wearables, AR filters and the growing impact of artificial intelligence on NFTs, the key to onboarding more users begins with introducing digital components to physical goods to help bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, Nobbs said.  “For people coming into the space for the first time, buying a physical fashion piece that just happens to have a digital counterpart will bring lots more people into the space because they can get their head around it a lot easier,” said Nobbs.  The push to ‘strut’ outside Web3  While metaverse fashion is taking different forms in its early days of adoption, there are key barriers to entry that prohibit the space from gaining traction outside Web3-native creators and communities.  Megan Kaspar, founding member of digital fashion house Red DAO and managing director of Web3 venture capital firm FirstLight, told CoinDesk that as a pioneer in the space, the greatest struggle in attempting to expand markets for digital fashion has been making the technology accessible to onboard traditional consumers to blockchain technology.  “You have this big bubble of Web3-native crypto users, but it's a bubble, sometimes an echo chamber, and I'm encouraging the community to corral all the Web2 influencers, creators and consumers,” said Kaspar, “That's where the adoption is gonna occur, and it can only occur when those people know how to use a wallet.”  Read more: Cathy Hackl: The 'Godmother of the Metaverse'  Kapsar said that once wallet adoption increases among target groups that help define fashion and culture trends, the demand for digital fashion will sharply increase. She said that while brands in the space such as Nike-owned digital fashion house RTFKT and NFT influencer Gmoney’s fashion brand 9dcc have been successful at tapping into their native Web3 audiences, recent initiatives from Amazon to establish an NFT marketplace and digital fashion house UNXD’s announcement of their partnership with luxury brand Valentino will help propel a greater adoption of NFTs and digital fashion.  “These initiatives will help expand the reach beyond just the echo chamber that we're living in,” said Kaspar.  This year’s Metaverse Fashion Week is set to take place in the depths of a chilling crypto winter across the Web3 space, but innovation in digital fashion throughout the past year will be on display during the virtual event.  New York Fashion Week’ Nolcha Shows in September showcased early product designs from metaverse fashion brand Chain Guardians. Utilizing NFC chips to help bring consumers from the physical to the digital world at their fingertips, future adoption of digital wearables is well-underway, as brands in the space work on bridging the technological gaps in order to best build their audiences.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/14/metaverse-fashion-week-decentraland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bab64fbed98b387075776e2c161e92120c403ff2-2322x1306.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412670,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5iYO,1678807641,Banking Crisis in U.S. Likely to Push Crypto Firms Offshore,"U.S. crypto firms are looking for bank accounts offshore following the collapse of three digital assets-friendly financial institutions last week.  Sygnum in Switzerland and Bank Frick in Lichtenstein told CoinDesk they have seen an increase in requests to open accounts in the past few days from various jurisdictions - including the U.S. Meanwhile, Swiss bank SEBA said it has already started onboarding crypto clients that have recently shown interest. On the retail side, Gibraltar's Xapo Bank has also seen increased demand for new accounts in the past few days and is adding GBP payment services with USDC options likely starting later this week.  Industry sources have also pointed to FV Bank in Puerto Rico, Jewel Bank in Bermuda, and Tether and FTX-tied Deltec in the Bahamas, as options for U.S. dollar-based banking. A list sent out to some companies in the Digital Currency Group umbrella (which includes CoinDesk) also identified EQIBank in Dominica. These banks didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Last week, three of crypto’s preferred banks in the U.S. became effectively defunct. Silvergate Bank (SI) was liquidated, whereas Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank (SBNY) were shut down by regulators.  While an interim solution for Silicon Valley Bank has been set up in the form of a bridge bank to allow customers to use their accounts, in the long-term companies will have to move their funds to other banks. The Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC), which manages the process, typically organizes bridge banks for up to two years, said a spokesperson for the agency. That's plenty of time for firms to go through the onboarding process of most banks.  Read more: The Banking Crisis Is Not Crypto’s Fault  Europe and beyond  Europe’s relative regulatory clarity could prove an asset, particularly as the U.S. lacks a regulatory framework plus the trust of many crypto insiders in U.S. authorities has been shaken. Reported claims that the closure of Signature Bank was part of a larger campaign against the crypto industry have raised concerns among industry participants.  ""There is a very real risk that more crypto companies will move offshore, particularly with regulatory frameworks being proposed in the U.K. and the [European Union],"" said Dave Weisberger, CEO and co-founder of algorithmic trading platform CoinRoutes.  Crypto firms will likely look beyond Europe for their banking needs because more jurisdictions are increasingly friendly toward digital assets. ""Global crypto companies will definitely be looking at banking options in Europe, Hong Kong and the Middle East,"" said Sanjay Raghavan, vice president of Web3 initiatives at real estate investment platform Roofstock onChain. He pointed to the United Arab Emirates, which is ""embracing crypto innovation and has announced plans to launch an economic free zone dedicated to crypto and digital asset companies.""  Some crypto firms were already looking to go overseas or offshore even before the closing of these three banks, said Josh Frank, co-founder and CEO of information platform The Tie. ""Many crypto companies already had multiple on and off-shore banking partners,"" he said, noting that U.S. companies will likely prefer Caribbean and European banks first.  SEBA's Managing Director Yves Longchamp said that interest in the bank's services has increased in the past few weeks but especially the last few days, ""across all segments in the space, from VCs [venture capital firms] to foundations to trading firms and treasuries.""  However, in his view, ""it’s no longer reliable"" to rely on one banking provider in one jurisdiction anymore, ""particularly when recent messaging from the regulating bodies has been less than encouraging.""  The push for overseas banking is a ""missed opportunity for the U.S. economy in my view, given it has the best chance of regulating the industry and helping it mature,"" said Xapo Bank's CEO Seamus Rocca.  Regulatory pressure  Regardless of where U.S. crypto companies look for their banking partners, regulatory risk in their home jurisdiction will likely loom large.  The willingness of internationally established banks to do business with U.S. crypto entities at the moment also hangs on the question of what the U.S. regulators will let the companies do for their banking partnerships. ""Many European and Asian banks also have some U.S. presence, which could presumably put them in sight of regulators if they are banking U.S. customers via offshore entities,"" Frank said.  Being approved by banks in European countries will likely take longer and be a heavier lift. Only crypto companies that are regulated and have proper compliance and governance will be able to access non-U.S. banks, said Henri Arslanian co-founder and managing partner of Dubai-based Nine Blocks Capital Management.  Longchamp said that ""previously, the lack of a clear regulatory framework [for crypto firms] in the U.S. had been a large deterrent"" to servicing clients. In the Asia-Pacific region for example, SEBA has always preferred not to ""involve more U.S. aspects in a business unnecessarily.""  The bank, which is licensed in both Switzerland and Abu Dhabi, takes measures like ""segregated accounts and risk management"" to provide its clients ""full autonomy over their assets,"" Longchamp said.  Meanwhile, Bank Frick said that its reviewing every new onboarding case individually. ""We apply and have always applied the same strict standards in the crypto area as in the classic banking business. If all necessary local [know your customer/anti-money laundering] standards are fulfilled, it is also possible to onboard jurisdictions outside Europe,"" Nicolas Marxer, Bank Frick’s head of blockchain banking, told CoinDesk.  Sygnum Bank, for its part, does not onboard U.S. clients, said Martin Burgherr, the bank's chief clients officer, so the applicants for new bank accounts are likely knocking on the wrong door.

42394487,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8LK7,1678803739,Why Stablecoin USDC’s Unstable Weekend Matters,"Crypto markets are still reeling from a turbulent weekend, after one of the market’s leading stablecoins, Circle’s USD coin (USDC), lost its 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar and plunged to as low as 87 cents. USDC restored its peg on Monday and continues to hover close to $1 as of writing, but the crisis might have broader implications for crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi).  On Friday, Circle confirmed it had been holding $3.3 billion of its reserves at the failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Many USDC holders suspected potential consequences from the SVB crash and quickly redeemed over $1 billion of USDC for U.S. dollars, causing the USDC price to lose the peg. Late Friday, the Coinbase crypto exchange, the largest based in the U.S., paused customers’ ability to convert USDC to dollars until Monday morning, when U.S. banks were open.  As a result, USDC market capitalization dropped to the lowest point over the past year, to $39.5 billion (USDC’s highest point was last summer at $55.9 billion). USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, following tether (USDT) at $72.4 billion, according to CoinGecko. Tether gained about $2 billion in market capitalization since Friday, likely profiting from its closest rival’s troubles because USDT was not affected by SVB’s collapse.  On Sunday, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that Circle would be transferring $3.3 billion of its funds from SVB to BNY Mellon.  Allaire also noted the problems Circle endured from the crash of another crypto-friendly bank, Signature Bank. When Signature has been shut down by state regulators, Circle could no longer use the bank’s SigNet settlement network. Allaire tweeted that Circle would switch to the service by Cross River Bank immediately.  On Monday, USDC restored its dollar peg.  Why stablecoins are key to the DeFi ecosystem  USDC has been a crucial part of the DeFi economy. In DeFi, people use stablecoins to buy other tokens as well as to speculate on stablecoins’ own fluctuating value, said Andrew Thurman, head of content at a blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  “Many of the top decentralized exchange pools have USDC in one of the [trading] pairs, cross-chain bridges are heavily weighted towards USDC, other stablecoins such as DAI and FRAX have significant (if not majority) USDC collateral and it's a popular collateral type on lending marketplaces,” Thurman told CoinDesk.  Tether’s USDT, despite its leading position on the market, is not as popular for those use cases, Thurman added, possibly because USDC has been traditionally perceived as more transparent and less risky than USTD. How Tether maintains its reserves has been a long-standing question in the industry, and the company has repeatedly dodged requests to reveal which assets are backing its stablecoin.  See Also: Fiat-Backed Stablecoins: What You Need to Know About Tether, USD Coin and Others  Andriy Velikiy, co-founder of token swap service Allbridge, told CoinDesk USDC is especially popular among crypto startups operating in the U.S. and Europe due to its good reputation and lack of regulatory issues to date.  “USDC is this official, fully backed stablecoin, and if you’re raising funds in the U.S. an American fund would be comfortable sending you USDC and you would be comfortable keeping it,” Velikiy said.  Outside of the West, Velikiy noted, the most popular stablecoin is USDT, which is broadly used in cross-border trade among China, Vietnam and Eastern Europe. “Traditionally, the entire market in Eastern Europe is running on USDT on the Tron blockchain.”  Arbitrage never sleeps  One man’s crisis is another man’s opportunity, and many traders rushed to make some money on USDC’s Friday crash, Velikiy said. He said on Allbridge the daily volume of USDC went up by 10 times on Friday night.  “People were trying to get rid of USDC at any price, they were swapping it for other assets and running between centralized exchanges and DeFi pools until the pools’ liquidity was drained and USDC was trading on DeFi platforms with the same discount as on centralized exchanges,” he said.  Velikiy said the wildfire did not spread with the same speed in all parts of the crypto ecosystem at once, so during several hours on Friday night there was a window for arbitrage between centralized exchanges and DeFi pools, because the price of USDC was higher on platforms where traders hasn’t withdrawn liquidity yet.  Read More: Crypto Arbitrage Trading: How to Make Low-Risk Gains  The price gap closed on the most popular DeFi platforms quickly, but savvy traders were still taking advantage of a price gap on Tezos, where USDC was still trading at 96 cents while Ethereum-based USDC had slipped to 90 cents. “People who know how to move between different chains could make money on that,” Velikiy explained.  At the same time, many used an opportunity to pay back their USDC-denominated DeFi loans at a lower price; Aave and Compound repayments surged on Saturday, said Axios reporter Brady Dale. In this case, they could buy USDC to pay back their loans much cheaper than before.  “This weekend I asked if folks were paying back DeFi loans like crazy because of an effective discount on the debt. Looks like: Yes, yes they were,” Dale tweeted.  Is this the end for stability from stablecoins?  There are not many alternatives to USDC’s current role on the market, given all the circumstances, said Velikiy. One reason, he said, is USDT does not look reliable enough for USDC holders.  Another previously popular stablecoin, Binance’s BUSD, has been in regulators’ crosshairs since February, when the New York Department of Financial Services questioned its legality and ordered Paxos to stop minting the currency.  Stablecoins DAI and FRAX, on the other hand, rely on USDC for their reserves (they are backed by other cryptocurrencies, not dollars in a bank account), and algorithmic stablecoins lost trust after the crash of Terra's terraUSD stablecoin.  ""After the most reliable and regulated stablecoin lost 10% of value in one night, some people will just quit crypto,” Velikiy said, which could make the USDC market cap fall by more.  According to Nansen’s Thurman, classic volatile crypto assets like bitcoin and ether are currently on the rise, especially among the institutional players. “Unbacked crypto assets such as BTC and ETH are ripping. Indeed, smart money is leveraging up to buy more, while they're ignoring an asset backed by the fractional reserve banking system, USDC,” Thurman said.  Has the crypto industry gone full circle, going from not trusting the traditional financial system to relying on it for stability and regulatory calm to not trusting banks again? It's one possibility.  “Up until very recently, investors were thrilled with the idea of having safe dollars on-chain. Now they're reconsidering what ""safe"" means in the context of banks collapsing,” Thurman said.

The ALGO price is likely being hurt by a $9 million MyAlgo Wallet breach within the last couple weeks. The breach was at the application layer and was not a problem on the chain itself. TVL growth is strong despite declines in total daily transactions. One of the most important utilities that a blockchain can have is smart contract operability. Given that, there are dozens of smart contract chains that have a top 100 market cap in the broad crypto market. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is still far and away the most large based on DeFi footprint and broader adoption, but there are key reasons why other smart contract chains have come to market. At the height of DeFi growth and the NFT craze, the cost to transact on Ethereum rose to ridiculously high levels per transaction. This made it uneconomical to participate in lower-value transactions on Ethereum. While I'm still very bullish on Ethereum long term, Ethereum's scalability issues have been well documented . High transaction fees are less concerning for assets that have six figure price tags like homes or 'blue chip' NFTs. But for very low value transactions in areas like gaming or micropayments, Ethereum is essentially unusable on the base layer. This is why popular P2E gaming platform Axie Infinity ( AXS-USD ) had to utilize the Ronin sidechain for gameplay - this led to an enormous $650 million breach as assets were lost when a hacker found a vulnerability in the Ronin bridge about a year ago. There are obviously risks associated with using bridges for swaps or more scalable side-chains. This is why even as bullish as I am on Ethereum long term, I believe it does make some sense to get exposure to non-EVM blockchains that are optimized for cheap, scalable network activity. One of my favorite ideas in that area is Algorand ( ALGO-USD ). What is Algorand? Algorand is a layer 1 blockchain that enables high throughput with transaction fees that are a fraction of a penny. The ALGO chain uses a proof of stake mechanism rather than a proof of work mechanism. This means it requires far less energy to complete blocks and has thus been positioned as ""the green blockchain"" by its developers. Algorand was founded by Silvio Micali. Micali is a nearly 40 year faculty member at MIT and a researcher who has studied cryptography. He also co-invented zero-knowledge proofs. He is a Turing Award winner for computer science and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. In addition to founding Algorand, he is currently in charge of research for the protocol's development. MyAlgo Wallet Breach One of the more notable developments from the Algorand community over the last month was the MyAlgo Wallet breach. In this hack, roughly 30 million ALGO were siphoned from numerous users of the MyAlgo application. In total, it is an estimated heist of a little over $9 million adjusting for the nominal price of ALGO. Purely anecdotally, judging by some of the complaints that can be witnessed on Twitter, the MyAlgo hack has been a point of contention within the community that I believe has led to underperformance in the price of ALGO in the month of March: Since March 1st (Seeking Alpha) Now down 19% month to date, ALGO has been lagging the native assets of other alternative layer 1 blockchains like Aptos ( APT-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), and Solana ( SOL-USD ). While the MyAlgo hack is discouraging for the Algorand community, it's important to note that the hack was at the application layer and was not a failure of the Algorand blockchain according to Algorand Foundation CTO John Woods. Network Activity From a DeFi standpoint, Algorand's network activity has been strong despite the decline in coin price. We can see from DeFi Llama data that total value locked on chain, or TVL, has been steadily growing on Algorand despite crypto winter: ALGO TVL (DeFi Llama) From a native asset standpoint, Algorand's TVL has increased by 24.5% year to date from 557.3 million ALGO at the start of the year to 693.8 million ALGO as of March 13th. Wallet Thresholds 12/31/2022 3/13/2023 YTD Total Addresses 29.37m 29.96m 2.0% Over 1K ALGO 123,219 130,052 5.5% Over 10k ALGO 21,977 23,844 8.5% Over 100k ALGO 2,214 2,262 2.2% Source: Algoexplorer Not nearly as exciting as the TVL growth, wallet addresses have grown year to date as well from 29.4 million to just under 30 million. The growth in holders has been stronger in wallet addresses with over 10 thousand ALGO but as the thresholds get larger the growth tapers off. Transactions (Algoexplorer) One area that I would like to see some better momentum is in total transactions. In March of 2022 the chain was averaging 7.1 million daily transactions and so far this month that number has fallen approximately 59.% down to 2.9 million daily transactions. Risks The crypto industry faces headwinds. Regulation is probably the biggest long term risk that potential investors should consider as Gary Gensler's SEC has made it no mystery the agency now views anything that isn't Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to be an unregistered security even if the asset fails to meet all 4 criteria of the Howey Test. It's difficult to predict what those regulations could look like before jurisdiction over the space is sorted out. But if you buy the notion that crypto is the target of Operation Chokepoint 2, then some of the recent actions by regulators against crypto businesses and crypto-friendly banks might make more sense. Summary Algorand is a low transaction cost, scalable blockchain that was founded by a leading computer scientist. Picking layer 1 winners not named Ethereum is tricky and possibly carries more risk than just picking the more established smart contract ecosystem. But I think Algorand is a layer 1 that should be on the radar of most crypto buyers. I have personally added to my Algorand position on the recent dip below $0.20 as I believe any concerns about the MyAlgo Wallet hack have been overblown by the market.",NEUTRAL,ALGO | ETH,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4587263-algorand-hack-buying-opportunity-on-weakness?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10676107.jpeg
42421322,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqbF,1678802696,AI and Crypto Are Combining to Create Web3's 'Multiplayer Era',"Technology hype cycles that get people excited and concerned are as expected as the changing seasons. This year the conversation is around artificial intelligence (AI).  OpenAI’s ChatGPT will either save the business world or automate it away. Stable Diffusion and Lensa apps are either going to destroy the art business or open up a new world of creativity to newcomers with big ideas. Like all innovations, these tools will lead to as many questions and concerns as optimistic use cases.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Culture Week.” Caitlin Burns is Palm NFT Studio’s director of story.  Thankfully, another technological innovation, Web3, could drive AI in a more manageable and democratic direction. The difference could be seen by examining earlier hype cycles around virtual and augmented reality (aka VR and AR), which required big budgets, big teams and bulky hardware.  See also: AI Could Help Build More-Efficient Crypto Markets | Opinion  While there are large players in Web3, it is also a field for anyone to join and make an impact. And, at least for today, the same is true for AI. Together, these technologies have emerged to make technology more “multiplayer.” And in particular, Web3 and AI are democratizing art, making it more accessible to more creators.  AI art tools make creating with code accessible  The next several years will be fascinating to watch as AI art apps battle it out with artists in court about the sourcing of the images their tools were “trained” on, and whether or not their tools make it easy to spam people or create malware (they do). The debate will continue. But for many creators these tools have become rapidly integrated into workflows. OpenAI went from zero to over one million users in less than five days.  There is clear demand for tools that help people create written and visual content quickly. For creators who are good at ideas and prompts but aren’t skilled artists themselves, access to text-to-image apps is particularly exciting. Being able to conceptualize your ideas can mean creating better pitches, working faster with creative teams. You can build projects faster and at less cost. And while the output of these images may not be perfect, it’s good enough to convey an idea in a simple, visual format.  There’s some really delightful pieces being built using AI art tools, despite it being early days for public use. The Bestiary Chronicles uses AI art to flesh out original human-written stories by Steve Coulson. An 11-year-old wrote a text-based video game in ChatGPT that went viral. MusicLM lets users create music from text. There’s an infinite ""Seinfeld""-like show on Twitch. Finally, CatGPT will generate text based on human language prompts in cat. It may be a chatbot but you’re nothing in the zeitgeist until you’re a cat meme.  The world will continue to refine, regulate and determine long-term demand for these technologies’ capabilities but they make a promise: AI art tools allow creators to convey their ideas quickly and at lower cost than ever before.  Web3 projects teach people how to create together  While a solo creator can create a work of art using AI art apps without collaborators, Web3 projects help people learn how to create stories and productions together in real time. Non-fungible token (NFT) collections like Broadside, DC Bat Cowls and DuskBreakers are built to bring audience members together through highly interactive features accessible through ownership. They’re designed to create a community and allow that community to create together.  These generative storytelling NFT projects give each holder a character and the keys to shape the storyworld. For some collections, like the original Batman comic book series ""Batman: The Legacy Cowl,"" work is done in real time by DC Comics artists, based on the votes of the community. Other projects like Broadside grant collectors the ability to write and create their own in-world stories thanks to CC0 licenses.  Similarly, governance tooling provides a framework for individuals to learn how to create, together. DAOs rely on collective decision-making supported by Web3 technology to guide the growth of shared tools, resources and environments. While these communal structures are also emergent and developing alongside regulatory precedent, it’s clear that two major innovations are happening, and as they converge, very interesting things will come to life.  The multiplayer era  What we’re beginning to see is the foundation for creativity’s multiplayer era:  AI art tools help creators convey and concept ideas quickly.  Web3 communities create source materials and distribution channels to communities that share and are interested in shared content.  Web3 tools allow communities to have a greater voice and share in the decision making process of shared intellectual properties.  As AI art tools show us how to communicate ideas quickly, Web3 tools help us create projects together in more equitable ways.  See also: What Kind of Culture Are We Building in Web3?  If you want to bring an idea to life, you can now get your first ideas created fast. If you want to start building a project for what you’ve created, you can leverage Web3 mechanics like tokenized ownership, generative storytelling and governance.  As these technology categories grow together, the possibilities for shared creation are exciting. With more access, and more participation, what will the storytelling formats of the future look like? As we begin to collaborate more deeply with code, we may begin to collaborate more deeply with one another, too.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Caitlin Burns,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/14/ai-and-crypto-are-combining-to-create-web3s-multiplayer-era,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2261f393d8ccf9aacf1a2becf22cc1bc978eb606-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin continued to rally early Tuesday, building on Monday's gains, with an 18% increase over the past 24 hours. The world's largest cryptocurrency broke the $25,000 mark following the release of U.S. inflation data. The cryptocurrency has since reached around $26,200, a nine-month high. Over $100 million worth of bitcoin shorts, or bets against a rise in prices, were liquidated on Monday. Ether also gained on Tuesday, up 10%, and crypto exchange OKEx’s OKB token rose 25%.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced former White House official Carole House as the new chairwoman and blockchain analysis company TRM Labs' Ari Redboard as vice chairman of its Technology Advisory Committee. The CFTC published a list of its members to the committee on Monday, announcing the committee had been newly constituted and is being sponsored by Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero, who took office last March. ""To protect our markets from increasingly-sophisticated cyberattacks, to ensure responsible development of digital assets in a way that protects customers and to ensure that the implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence are well understood, the Commission requires advice from technology experts,"" Goldsmith Romero said in a statement.  Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has officially suspended trading for the binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, according to a tweet on Monday. The exchange announced its intention to delist BUSD in February with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong citing liquidity concerns. The decision came after Paxos Trust, the company that issues BUSD, stopped minting the stablecoin as a result of regulatory action by the New York Department of Financial Services and, reportedly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the combined market capitalization of the top three dollar-pegged stablecoins – USDT, USDC and BUSD – continues to slide despite bitcoin's 25% recovery from late Friday lows near $19,550.  The divergence reflects investor preference for assets detached from traditional finance.  Three U.S. banks have collapsed within a week, bringing attention to bitcoin as a censorship-resistant non-sovereign alternative asset that cannot be debased.

On a year-over-year basis, inflation slowed to 6.0% from 6.4% the month before, also in line with estimates.  The core rate of inflation – which strips out food and energy costs – increased by more than forecast to 0.5% in February versus 0.4% in January, and against forecasts for 0.4%. The year-over-year core rate was 5.5%, as expected, compared with 5.6% in January.  The bitcoin price (BTC) rose to a nine-month high of $25,484 in the minutes following the report. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap then extended the advance, surpassing the $26,000 mark for some time before recently settling back to the $25,500 range.  Inflation concerns have become secondary over the past few days as investors, the government and the Federal Reserve have had to deal with the possible systemic implications of multiple bank failures.  Less than one week ago, traders had been betting the Fed would hike the benchmark fed funds rate by 50 basis points at its March meeting. Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday and the shutdown of Signature Bank over the weekend, traders quickly pivoted and are now pricing in only the slimmest chance of any rate hike in March and rate cuts by mid-summer.  “The macro backdrop is transitioning from that of tightening to significant loosening, or at least this is what the market is predicting,"" Bob Ras, co-founder of Sologenic, a blockchain-powered network for tokenizing securities, wrote CoinDesk in an email. ""Bitcoin and digital assets tend to lead the way in terms of anticipating these kinds of macro shifts, and this is why we’re seeing a pronounced rally in the crypto market.""  Ras noted that the CPI was falling and that ""liquidity injections to shore up the banking sector are having an effect similar to that of quantitative easing.""  ""The conditions for a sustained rally for Bitcoin and other digital assets are ripening – and, indeed, these conditions of banking instability and resulting monetary turbulence are exactly why Bitcoin was created in the first place,” he said.

Blackstone and Apollo are looking to purchase a book of loans held by Silicon Valley Bank, according to the report, which cited people with knowledge of the matter.  New York-based investment manager KKR (KKR) is also reported to be interested.  Silicon Valley Bank's assets were seized by financial regulators at the end of last week, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. named as its receiver.  The tech and venture capital-focused bank fell apart last week following a $42 billion bank run after it announced plans to sell $2.24 billion in new shares. The proposed sale was meant to compensate for a $1.8 billion loss on the sale of $21 billion worth of its portfolio's securities.  The collapse, the biggest of a U.S. bank since Washington Mutual's in 2008, was sandwiched in between the implosions of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank (SBNY), two banks that focused on crypto.  Blackstone has $880 billion in assets under management, and Apollo $500 billion.  Apollo declined to comment, and neither Blackstone nor KKR responded to requests for comment.

42412691,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5jvW,1678797051,EU Parliament Passes Bill Requiring Smart Contracts to Include Kill Switch,"The European Parliament on Tuesday voted in favor of new data controls that could require that smart contracts include details of a kill switch to reset activity.  A 2022 European Union bill known as the Data Act included provisions intended to give people more control over information from smart devices, but has generated concerns in the Web3 community.  On Tuesday, 500 EU lawmakers voted in favor of the bill, 23 against, with 110 not voting.  “The new rules will empower consumers and companies by giving them a say on what can be done with the data generated by the connected products,” lead lawmaker Pilar del Castillo Vera said during the debate on the bill.  Provisions included in del Castillo Vera's redraft of the bill would mean that smart contracts must have to have access controls and protect trade secrets. They would also need to have functions to stop or reset – something that experts worry could undermine their purpose.  Not all agree with the bill.  “Article 30, as currently drafted, goes a step too far in addressing the issues raised by immutability,” Thibault Schrepel, an associate professor at VU Amsterdam University, tweeted ahead of the vote. “It endangers smart contracts to an extent that no one can predict.”  Schrepel, a specialist in blockchain legal issues, believes that the legal text is unclear about who in practice would have to hit the kill switch on a smart contract and that it interferes with the fundamental principle that the automated programs can’t be altered by anyone.  The vote empowers del Castillo Vera and other lawmakers to negotiate with governments in the EU member countries to hammer out a final version of the law.

The ability of Bitcoin to emerge stronger out of the ""crypto winter"" highlights its appeal as an alternative to the dollar and store of value. We see room for Bitcoin to climb higher and recover levels last reached in early 2021. The U.S. banking sector has been engulfed in a crisis of confidence. From the apparent overnight collapse of SVB Financial Group ( SIVB ), a relative niche bank specializing in startups and venture capital funding, all eyes are on other regional names and the mega-cap leader that could be facing similar pressures. Regulators moved quickly in their attempt to contain the mess, but at the same time, the damage has been done. The new layer of uncertainty comes from questions regarding the underlying stability of the entire financial system. On the other hand, the setup can be seen as particularly bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), on the basis of the cryptocurrency being an alternative form of money, and operating decentralized outside the traditional financial system. BTC has had a very impressive year, rallying nearly 50% from its 2022 lows, gaining movement over the past week in contrast to the volatility in equity markets. We see several tailwinds supporting more upside. Data by YCharts BTC as the Gold Standard of Crypto Looking back at all the scandals that have rocked the crypto sector, a common theme becomes apparent. Bitcoin was not the cause or culprit in the fall of names like ""FTX"", ""Voyager Digital"", ""Celsius Network"", or Terra ( LUNC-USD ) among others. While those examples of apparent fraud or mismanagement have added to the reputation of crypto being the wild-west of financial markets, Bitcoin can stand out as ""the gold standard"" being the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, bigger than a single ecosystem or celebrity entrepreneur. The idea here is that while most users are typically trading Bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase Global Inc ( COIN ) or Block Inc ( SQ ), it doesn't necessarily need those platforms to survive. BTC is bigger than any fintech startup and serves a function as a store of value based on the credibility of its own transparent and public network protocol. Without getting into any apocalyptic scenarios requiring the Dollar or other fiat currencies to fail, the main tailwind right now is that the ongoing macro developments simply work to reaffirm Bitcoin's place as an alternative asset. So while the failure of SVB and Signature Bank Group ( SBNY ), in particular, may have been in part related to their risker lending profile serving tech and even some ""crypto"" startups , it had nothing to do with Bitcoin. From there, we sense any new regulatory effort going forward would like to target crypto exchanges and token offerings which are the problematic areas. Again, Bitcoin is above and beyond all that. BTC will always have value based on its capped global supply while people are willing to accept an exchange rate. For all the naysayers that have predicted BTC's demise in the last decade, there's a case to be made that its outlook is now stronger than ever. These are themes that were covered by ARK Invests within the investment managers' annual ""Big Ideas "" of innovation update. According to the group, Bitcoin addresses an underlying weakness of ""centralized monetary systems"" that have failed potentially billions of people. Growing recognition and adoption of Bitcoin, evidenced by climbing transaction levels and the number of addresses confirm the long-term potential where demand will further lift prices. The benefit of Bitcoin being auditable and transparent has been reinforced by the latest banking crisis. source: ARK Invest Bullish Tailwinds for BTC While we see space for some of the other major cryptocurrencies to survive as digital assets like Ether ( ETH-USD ), it is our view that Bitcoin benefits from a higher layer of quality as the most fundamentally pure crypto ideal. Here we can draw a parallel between gold vs silver and other metals, which is simply our preference that is understandably controversial. As a trading instrument, BTC has ""enough"" volatility that attempting to find the next great token is simply a futile effort. BTC should lead the sector higher, and it's hard to see a disconnected scenario where BTC somehow gets left behind. Over the near term, there are several factors at play supporting continued upside momentum in BTC. The pullback in rates/ lower bond yields U.S. Dollar selloff Store of value angle compared to banking system fiasco. Technical setup, approaching a breakout zone. First is the ""historic"" repricing of rates, based on a consensus that the Fed is effectively done hiking. Simply put, the lower available yields make holding Dollars relatively less attractive compared to other currencies. source: CNBC BTC is capturing some of this dynamic reflected in a falling U.S. Dollar Index which is a trend that has been in place, curiously since BTC bottomed in Q4. We can also make a connection that stronger foreign currencies like the Euro or even fiat from emerging markets support the buying power of BTC from those regions as another impulse. source: finviz BTC Price Forecast We're bullish and the first target is $25k which marked the recent high in February. A breakout from there would place $30k in sight as a return to levels from last Q2. On the downside, the area to watch is ~$21.5k as the first area of support. A break lower from there would undermine the recent gains and likely drive a new round of volatility. As long as BTC can hold ~$18k as the next important area of support, the bulls will likely stay in control. It won't likely be a straight line higher, but our view is that there is room for more upside with BTC proving that its relevancy is alive and well. source: finviz Final Thoughts With BTC trading near its highest since last August, the latest rally despite the financial market volatility should be encouraging for investors. Ultimately, the higher price level of BTC works to rebuild confidence in the cryptocurrency following a particularly challenging 2022.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4587240-bitcoin-may-emerge-even-stronger-from-the-us-banking-turmoil?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10673248.jpeg

Bitcoin options worth $2.4 billion have changed hands on Deribit in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day tally since May 17, 2021, according to data tracked by Amberdata. The number of contracts traded in the past 24 hours stood at a record high of 99,195 BTC at press time. The 24-hour notional volume in ether options totaled $948 million as of writing, the highest since November.  On Deribit, one options contract represents 1 BTC and 1 ETH. The exchange controls more than 80% of the global crypto options market. Options give traders the right to buy or sell the underlying asset, in this case, bitcoin, at a specific price, known as a strike, by a stated date. Call options give the right to buy, while put options give the right to sell.  Three U.S. banks have collapsed in less than a week, injecting volatility into financial markets and forcing both crypto and traditional markets traders to seek hedges via options. Volume in options tied to Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX index, soared to a four-year high last week, according to Reuters.  Bitcoin initially came under pressure after Silicon Valley Bank shut down on Friday but picked up a bid over the weekend. Prices have risen nearly 25% since late Friday, with prices gaining 9% in the past 24 hours, as the banking crisis has weakened the case for continued monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.

The wallet labeled vitalik.eth was created seven years ago and held more than 5,360 ether as of Tuesday. While Ethereum Names Service domains resolve to crypto wallets, they may be not necessarily held by a person popularly associated with the name.  “Vitalik-labeled address has deposited 500 $ETH in Reflexer to mint 150k $RAI, and swapped 132.5k $RAI for 378.5k $USDC,” blockchain analytics firm PeckShield said Sunday. “Additionally, they swapped 17.5k $RAI for 50k $DAI within the last 3 hours.”  Buterin has previously acknowledged RAI’s unique stablecoin mechanism in a blog post.

42412696,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5k0C,1678784179,Bitcoin Nears $25K as Interbank Funding Stress Indicator Surges to Highest Level Since COVID Crash,"Bitcoin (BTC) continued to rally early Tuesday as a key banking sector risk indicator spiked, strengthening the case for a pause in rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose to a three-week high of $24,900, extending a three-day winning streak, CoinDesk data shows. Prices pretty much reversed the entire drop from $25,000 to $19,500 seen in the second half of February.  The gap between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement, or FRA, and the overnight index swap rate, or OIS, also known as the FRA-OIS spread, a measure of how costly it is for banks to borrow U.S. dollars from one another, surged to 54.00, the highest since March 2020, according to data source MacroMicro.  The borrowing and lending between banks is a crucial component of the banking system that helps banks manage their immediate liquidity needs. When the interbank lending market is strained or dysfunctional, banks face greater liquidity risk, which can result in insolvency.  So, the sharp rise in the FRA-OIS spread is a sign of the system reaching a point of vulnerability. That strengthens the case for the Fed to pause its rate hike cycle at next week's meeting or opt for a smaller 25 basis points move instead of the 50 basis point raise expected last week. The central bank has lifted the official borrowing cost by 4.5 percentage points in one year, roiling risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""Banking sector stress strengthens the case for Fed pause next week. Likely beneficiaries from the financial stress are gold and bitcoin – hard assets,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, told CoinDesk. ""Likely beneficiaries from the financial stress are gold and bitcoin, the hard assets.""  The surge in the banking stress indicator comes after the failure of three U.S. banks, including the startups-focused Silicon Valley Bank, within five days and has prompted investors to reassess their outlook for interest rates.  The Fed rate hike bets have crumbled in the past 24 hours as the CME's FedWatch tool now suggests a 46% chance that the central bank will keep rates unchanged in the range of 4.5%-4.75% next week.  Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said that signs of financial market stress might mean more government guarantees in terms of liquidity. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, are widely considered to be pure liquidity plays.  ""Financial market stress indicators have risen to the highest levels since the European debt crisis a decade ago. At the same time, credit default swaps, which measure the cost of insuring bond portfolios against defaults, have increased markedly. Bitcoin has benefited as more government guarantees might mean more money printing,"" Thielen said.  While the FRA-OIS spread is nowhere close to levels seen during the great financial crisis of 2008, it is significantly higher than in recent weeks.  According to ING, the sharp deviation higher from the recent range has weakened the case for a 50 basis point rate hike.  ""It's a market deviation versus the very tight FRA/OIS spread seen in recent weeks. We remarked at the time that such a tight spread meant that the Fed could indeed deliver a 50 bp hike at the March meeting, as the system was taking it quite calmly. That's clearly changed in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse,"" analysts at ING wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.  ""The Fed would no doubt prefer the system to look and feel safer. U.S. CPI [inflation data due on Tuesday] is less relevant – the system is key for now,"" the analysts added.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release inflation figures for February on Tuesday at 12:30 UTC.  According to Reuters, the forecast is for the Consumer Price Index to rise 0.4% from January, bringing the year-over-year rate to 6%, which would mark a decline from January's 6.4% reading. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is projected at increase by 0.4% from January and by 5.5% from February 2022.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/14/bitcoin-nears-25k-as-interbank-funding-stress-indicator-surges-to-highest-since-covid-crash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61e3e7497a223b5867173d0797ad76ace4d4480d-1711x860.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During an assessment in 2022, the researchers found several critical vulnerabilities that could have been exploited by attackers to compromise the network. At the time, Dogecoin developers addressed and resolved the vulnerabilities.  However, further investigations by Halborn revealed that similar vulnerabilities were present in several other networks, including Litecoin and Zcash. This could potentially expose over $25 billion worth of tokens to potential security risks, Halborn said.  ""Due to codebase differences between the networks, not all the vulnerabilities are exploitable on all the networks, but at least one of them may be exploitable on each network,"" Halborn CEO Rob Behnke said. ""On vulnerable networks a successful exploitation of the relevant vulnerability could lead to denial of service or remote code execution.""  Halborn has dubbed the vulnerability “Rab13s.” According to the researchers, the most critical vulnerability found in the affected networks pertains specifically to the way peer-to-peer (p2p) communications are conducted in these networks.  An attacker can send malicious consensus messages to individual nodes in the network, causing them to shut down and leaving the entire network vulnerable to 51% attacks or other severe issues.  While some of the vulnerabilities were previously found on the Bitcoin network, Halborn also identified a zero-day vulnerability that was uniquely related to Dogecoin. This particular vulnerability was related to Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services, which could allow attackers to execute code remotely and impact individual miners.  Meanwhile, Halborn said it made a good faith effort to contact the affected networks for responsible disclosure. The severity of the Rab13s vulnerabilities, coupled with the simplicity of the p2p messaging mechanisms, increases the likelihood of attack.  However, due to the severity of the vulnerabilities, Halborn is not releasing further technical or exploit details at this time.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | LTC | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/14/dogecoin-networks-patched-bug-is-still-present-in-280-blockchains-blockchain-security-firm-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f23058fb993c002a69b124935324acbbc829763f-1265x712.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412684,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5joy,1678777936,India’s Crypto Industry Finally Sees Lawmakers Engaging,"On Saturday, India’s crypto industry pulled off a near-coup by bringing lawmakers and members of India’s ruling party to a conference discussing Web3.  Indian exchange CoinDCX, backed by the industry’s policy body, Bharat Web3, and media outlet Forbes brought lawmakers to an event titled “Namaste Web3” at one of New Delhi’s five-star luxury hotels, to discuss India’s G-20 presidency and potential opportunities for India in the Web3 sector.  The conference managed to bring senior leaders from India’s ruling party – National Vice President Baijayant Panda and former Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad – to an event. From the opposition benches it brought a chairperson of the parliamentary standing committee on commerce and a deputy leader of the parliament’s lower house.  While lawmakers and government officials have privately had wide ranging consultations with the industry, this was a rare occasion where they’ve publicly shown up lending the space a fresh legitimacy.  “Web3 is important with a caution … come out of the shadow of crypto,” said Prasad, who has also been a former information technology minister.  ""I am a great supporter of blockchain. But crypto is a different ball game altogether. Let me be very clear about it. Because in crypto there are issues of financial sovereignty of India,” Prasad said, adding Web 3 needs to find its own ways of decoupling from crypto.  The opposition’s Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who chairs the country’s parliamentary committee on commerce, said he wasn't on the stage as chairperson of the parliamentary standing committee on commerce but as a Web3 enthusiast.  “Web 3 can be one of the biggest factors in bringing to fruition India’s dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy. Negative focus on cryptocurrency, a bit obsessive in the earlier years, has affected the perception about Web3 and its usage. The blockchain narrative needs a paradigm shift from the crypto to the transformative changes that can be brought about with the application of Web3,” he said.  A ‘little caution’  India’s crypto industry remains heavily stifled by a 30% tax on profit and a 1% tax deducted at source that led to volumes plummeting, and a recent move to bring the industry under India’s rules to prevent money laundering.  “A little bit of caution isn’t unreasonable,” said BJP Vice President Baijayant Panda, who is considered the ruling party’s expert on technology.  Panda said Indian policymakers would update rules and regulations based on feedback during a fireside chat on leveraging India’s G-20 presidency to advance the development of Virtual Digital Assets regulatory principles through international cooperation.  “As far as blockchain and bitcoin is concerned, this is the cutting edge of the regulatory questions that need to be answered throughout the world. You are beginning to see a level of consultation that is more than what used to be before,” Panda said.  Gaurav Gogoi, a parliamentarian from the opposition, said the crypto ecosystem has a lot to do to remove the perception of being used mainly for money laundering and terrorism financing. He added he was worried about the government’s true position on crypto.  “I hope our government is not telling others (in the G-20) to put a 1% TDS [on crypto transactions][. That could be the global consensus as well, or it could be a ban,” he said.  Read More: India Has Clamped Down on Crypto.

42412683,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5jo2,1678773751,"Bitcoin Crosses $24.7K, Sees Highest Liquidations in Two Months","Bitcoin (BTC) added over 11% in the past 24 hours to trade above $24,700 on Tuesday, retracting all losses from over the weekend and setting a three-week high.  The movement possibly came as a surprise to traders who may have otherwise bet on declining prices after two key crypto-friendly banks were shut last week and USD coin (USDC), a major stablecoin, depegged from the U.S. dollar.  Over $100 million worth of bitcoin shorts, or bets against a rise in prices, was liquidated on Monday. This was the highest liquidated amount since Jan. 14 when a bitcoin surge caused $500 million in liquidation across several crypto futures.  Monday’s liquidations meant 78% of all bitcoin futures traders took on losses, data from Coinglass shows. The losses were spread mainly over crypto exchanges Binance, OKX, Huobi and Bybit.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Bitcoin prices rose as U.S. bank stocks dropped steeply on Monday, exacerbated by fears of a similar bank run on regional outlets following last week’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.  As such, data suggests the price action was spot driven. As of Tuesday, open interest on futures remained below Mar. 9 levels, when bitcoin traded above $23,500, even as bitcoin retraced all losses – implying the price action was led by investors purchasing bitcoin instead of being futures driven.  Elsewhere, crypto exchange Binance said Monday it would convert $1 billion of its native Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin to bitcoin, ether (ETH), BNB coin (BNB) and other unspecified tokens – which also likely contributed to the price rise.  Meanwhile, Asian companies mirrored the U.S. market movement on Tuesday's open – as the Asia Dow fell 2.2%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.5% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed nearly 1%.",POSITIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/14/bitcoin-crosses-247k-sees-highest-liquidations-in-two-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a59a9159a52554510d328d92902b31e0b691e848-1432x805.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412682,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5jn6,1678768125,Coinbase Files Amicus Brief in Insider Trading Case: ‘We Need Rulemaking’,"The digital assets that Coinbase lists are not securities, but Coinbase, if given proper guidance and rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission, would like to list securities, Coinbase said Monday in an amicus brief. But the SEC’s willingness to work with the exchange in a productive fashion has been limited, the brief reads.  Coinbase filed the amicus, or friend of the court, brief as part of a case against its former employee Ishan Wahi. Wahi, along with his brother, has been charged with insider trading and is the subject of a civil complaint by the SEC for securities fraud regarding leaking information about new token listings on Coinbase.  While Wahi has pleaded guilty to the insider trading charges, he is contesting the SEC’s allegations of securities fraud, arguing the tokens in question were not securities and pushing for the case to be dismissed.  Coinbase's filing of the amicus brief should not be read as a signal of support for Wahi, insiders say, but rather an attempt to force the SEC out of what should be a criminal case.  “The SEC’s suit rests on the erroneous premise that the seven Coinbase-listed assets identified in its complaint are ‘securities.’ But Coinbase does not list any securities on its platform,” Coinbase’s brief reads. “The SEC posits that the digital assets qualify as securities because they are “investment contract[s], but the assets lack both essential attributes of that statutory term: They are neither contracts nor investments.”  In mid-February, the Blockchain Association trade group also filed an amicus brief in the case. The group argued that prior regulation by enforcement via the SEC has made the U.S. an opaque and confusing jurisdiction to do business in for the digital assets industry.  “Such behavior is improper for a government agency, and is irreconcilable with due process concerns,” it argued in its brief. “The SEC’s motive, then, is merely to backdoor a precedent that can be used in other cases, as, indeed, it is already doing in other cases where the DOJ has brought an action, and the SEC has piled on with similar allegations of securities laws violations against absent third parties.”  Coinbase also brought forward a similar argument to the Blockchain Association’s, arguing the SEC has failed to provide clear guidance, has deviated dramatically from its own earlier statements and has previously ignored petitions filed by Coinbase.  “Proceeding with enforcement in these circumstances violates bedrock principles of due process and fundamental fairness, which bar an agency from seeking to punish regulated parties without providing the regulatory clarity necessary to discern their legal obligations,” Coinbase’s brief reads.  Coinbase accuses the SEC of refusing to follow the guidance Congress has set out for these agencies, namely the process of “notice-and-comment rulemaking.”  “Rulemaking is the only realistic way in which the SEC can provide fair notice to affected stakeholders and coherently consider all important aspects of regulating the crypto industry,” the brief reads.

Signature Bank’s assets were transferred to Signature Bridge Bank – a new interim entity that will be temporarily run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Signet was launched on Jan. 1, 2019, as a proprietary blockchain-based digital payments platform. The service was integrated with digital asset custodian Fireblocks in 2020 to facilitate the secure movement, storage and issuance of digital assets.  Silvergate Bank, another crypto-friendly institution, voluntarily liquidated last week. The firm had previously offered its own real-time payments service, Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN).  Read more: Signature Bank, Stablecoins Might Benefit From Silvergate Exchange Network's Demise  After Silvergate’s liquidation, SEN went down the drain with it, leaving Signature Bank’s Signet platform as one of the last places to perform 24/7 crypto banking. But Signature’s shutdown on Sunday seemed to shatter those hopes, leaving key industry players scrambling to find alternative service providers, even though a source told CoinDesk that Signet is still up and running.  “With all of the deposits and substantially all of the assets of former Signature Bank, the bank will continue to take care of its clients, providing a full suite of loan, deposit, and banking services,” said new Signature Bridge Bank CEO Greg D. Carmichael in a press release. The release did not mention Signet.  Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle – a Signature Bank client – said his firm has been unable to use Signet to mint and redeem tokens.  “We will be relying on settlements through BNY Mellon,” Allaire said. “Additionally, we will be bringing on a new transaction banking partner with automated minting and redemption potentially as soon as tomorrow.”  Read more: Circle Scrambles to Right USDC After Signature Bank Failure  CoinDesk asked the source, a person affiliated with Signature Bridge, about the discrepancy between Allaire’s tweet on Sunday and Signature Bridge’s press release on Monday announcing business as usual.  “This tweet came out last night, prior to our announcement today that Signature Bridge Bank is open for business,” the person said.  Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov told CoinDesk that Signet “looks like it’s technically working” and that nothing had changed on Fireblocks’ end.  Publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) also told CoinDesk that it’s business as usual for the firm.  “As shared on Twitter, Coinbase continues to operate as usual,” said Natasha LaBranche, senior manager of corporate communications. “We intend for USDC:USD conversions to remain available 24/7/365.”  A Coinbase spokesperson also confirmed that at least from their end, Signet is still functional.  ""As of Tuesday, Signet continues to function and all past and future customer deposits continue to be FDIC-insured,"" the spokesperson said. ""As always, Coinbase maintains multiple banking relationships and we are always working to establish additional contingency to ensure we are prepared for any eventuality.""  The help section on the exchange’s website lists four FDIC-insured banking partners – Signature Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Cross River Bank and Pathward (previously known as MetaBank).  “While we have confidence in our bank partners, we do have contingency plans and redundant payment rails to ensure we could continue to serve our clients and provide them access to their cash stored with Coinbase in the event we encountered changes with our bank partners,"" the Coinbase website states.

42412686,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5jrm,1678758867,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin’s Store of Value Narrative Is on Full Display; Crypto Prices Stay Green,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is leading the crypto rally as a flight from USDC accelerates.  Insights: Banks serving the digital asset industry will continue to exist, despite the recent banking crisis.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,099 +51.6 ▲ 4.9% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,235 +1630.1 ▲ 7.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,674 +52.5 ▲ 3.2% S&P 500  3,855.76 −5.8 ▼ 0.2% Gold  $1,919 +56.6 ▲ 3.0% Nikkei 225  27,832.96 −311.0 ▼ 1.1% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Twenty-four hours ago, crypto was in dire straits. The industry’s fiat pipelines were being disconnected one by one. Circle’s USDC had been knocked off its dollar peg because of the issuer's exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, and the stablecoin still hadn’t recovered.  Fast forward to today and this all seems like less of an issue. Depositors are being made whole. Circle said it would cover any shortfall.  Stablecoins are supposed to be the safe haven asset of crypto. They came into the spotlight during the COVID-19 crypto crash of March 2020, and the subsequent bull market, making them a key part of the ecosystem.  “We are closely watching whether this moment creates an opening for other currencies, notably the euro, to emerge as a linchpin of the digital asset ecosystem,” David Bachelier, Asia-Pacific CEO of Flowdesk, said in a note to CoinDesk. “Such an outcome would be positive, as it would bolster the role of the euro in crypto in terms of trading volumes, too. This would put crypto-fiat trading volumes more in line with proportions of the euro’s trading volumes versus the dollar’s.”  Bitcoin, as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes correctly predicted, is on a rally, up nearly 8.5% in the last 24 hours, leaving other cryptocurrencies in its digital dust. Ether is up 5%, Binance’s BNB up 6% and dogecoin is up 2.5%.  Tokens associated with layer 1 blockchains Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) are all fairly flat.  On-chain data suggests this rally is fueled by a flight from USDC into bitcoin. Data from Nansen shows the supply of USDC on exchanges has increased over the last few days. Total supply on exchanges is up 8% compared to a week ago. Notably, the largest deposit of USDC in the last 24 hours was 18.3 million, a 41% increase from the prior record of 13 million.  The same can’t be said for stablecoin USDT. There’s been a 5.7% decline of USDT on exchanges from the last week, which translates into a negative net flow of 96.6 million.  ""Bitcoin is rallying as financial stability risks sent Treasury yields crashing. In a scramble to avoid another massive bank run, federal regulators stepped in as some Americans grew skeptical of traditional banking,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, told CoinDesk via email. “Bitcoin volatility should remain elevated and it will be interesting to see how much momentum will be left with today's surge.""  Moya also pointed to gold as a continued safe haven in times of uncertainty with Treasury yields.  “Gold's breaking out as volatility is picking up, [Treasurys] are surging and it seems there is too much headline risk,” he wrote. “The two-year Treasury yield is down 49 basis points to 4.095%, which means we are almost down a full point since last week. ​The entire Treasury curve is now below [the Federal Reserve's] target, and that normally means a recession is coming.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Bitcoin BTC +7.1% Currency Gala GALA +3.1% Entertainment Ethereum ETH +3.0% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP −1.5% Currency Solana SOL −0.5% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Will Small Banks Fill the Crypto Gap?  The crypto ecosystem was built on the belief that no one entity, meaning a bank, should be in charge of one individual’s finances. Until that becomes a reality, traditional banking will likely have to serve as a bridge between centralized finance and decentralized finance.  Thus, the shutdown of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank will certainly cause headaches for the industry in the short-term as many crypto companies search for new banking partners, uncertain if larger entities will even want to touch crypto companies anytime soon.  “For now, it's not clear what new financial institutions will partner with these crypto companies in the wake of Silvergate, SVB and now Signature,” said Ilya Volkov, CEO of and co-founder of YouHodler, a Swiss-based international fintech platform providing a variety of Web3 crypto and fiat service.  “The industry is currently running out of options and that needs to be addressed soon to prevent further problems,” Volkov added, noting that it will cause some fear-based reactions from the investors.  In the long run, however, this contagion shouldn’t hurt the crypto industry as there will likely be other smaller banks that will likely bridge the gap. “Crypto liquidity is likely to take a hit in the short term, but this is an opportunity for new innovative challenger banks to step up and take the place of SVB, Silvergate and Signature,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at digital asset market maker DWF Labs.

42411001,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvTtQ,1678754403,"Prices, Volume Spike on Mix of Regulators' Backstops and Lower Rate Expectations","Crypto assets reversed course on Monday from their recent down trend as Federal Reserve comments appeared to allay investor fears about the impact of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse on the banking sector and economy.  Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos all spiked on Monday, the former two assets by well into the double digits, as conditions late Sunday and early Monday improved. The turnaround followed just a couple of days after markets went into a tailspin.  The collapse of SVB, once holding close to $200 billion in investor deposits, had sent markets roiling on Friday because the bank’s depositor base extends through much of the technology and crypto ecosystem. (SVB was CoinDesk's bank.) BTC’s price fell below $20,000 on Friday (UTC) on heavy volume as fears of contagion rippled through on-risk, asset markets.  The announcement by the U.S. Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that depositors would have full access to their deposits by Monday morning renewed markets’ confidence and boosted BTC and ETH prices by as much as 15% and 10%, respectively.  Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said the announcement had reassured “both traditional and crypto markets.”  The intraday price move would have represented the largest one-day moves for BTC and ETH since February 2021 and November 2022, respectively.  The Federal Reserve also announced plans to make additional funding available to all eligible depository institutions, and is “prepared to address any liquidity issues that may arise”.  The Fed statement is a crucial one, as it implies that the pain incurred by the collapse of SVB will be ring-fenced to SVB only. Holders of deposits in excess of the traditional $250,000 limit were essentially ensured that they will be made whole.  USDC, which reportedly held funds at SVB, regained its peg with the U.S. dollar, after falling to as low as 94 cents on Friday.  BTC and ETH volume exploded on the day as both traded more that two times their average 20-day trading volume. The same spikes occurred in XRP, MATIC, ADA, DOT and SOL.  Meanwhile, in macroeconomic news, bond yields plunged as the fallout from the SVB collapse led investors to believe the Fed will slow or even pause rate hikes in response.  One day ago, markets were assigning a 40% chance that the U.S. central bank would boost interest rates by 50 basis points. Following the banking sector near-meltdown, they are assigning a 35% chance the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee will leave rates unchanged. The shift underscores concerns the Fed had spurred the crisis by overstepping in its efforts to tame inflation by limiting money supply.  Just in time to make macroeconomic conditions even more interesting will be Tuesday’s inflation report, which is likely to have an outsized impact on Tuesday trading. A favorable inflation figure will likely increase the chorus of calls for no rate hikes.  A less than optimal inflation figure will likely take markets on a ride, especially following today’s move higher.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/14/prices-volume-spike-on-mix-of-regulators-backstops-and-lower-rate-expectations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf1fea4c6b9db6b3971c8a64f67721d6d53bd2e3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
