42378795,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmMl,1467393375,Silk Road Agent May Have Stolen More Bitcoin After Guilty Plea,"New documents unsealed in the ongoing case between the US government and a former Secret Service agent convicted of stealing bitcoins during the Silk Road investigation allege that additional thefts may have taken place.  Shaun Bridges was one of two former US federal agents accused of going rogue during the investigation of the Silk Road, the now-defunct dark market. At the time, the US government alleged that Bridges stole as much as $800,000 in bitcoin seized from the Silk Road.  Bridges plead guilty last summer to money laundering and wire fraud charges, and was sentenced to roughly six years in prison in December.  Yet according to the documents unsealed yesterday – an emergency motion for arrest filed in January and a search warrant granted in February – Bridges is believed to have stolen additional funds months after he was initially charged.  Prosecutors said that the government was investigating whether Bridges took “approximately $700,000” in bitcoin around 28th July of last year, followed by an additional theft of roughly $20,000 in bitcoin around 10th September. The latter theft allegedly occurred less than two months before Bridges' sentencing, and after he had already pled guilty.  Notably, the thefts allegedly took place after the Secret Service had been warned by prosecutors about Bridges’ continued access to those funds. However, the motion asserts that the Secret Service did not secure the funds, and only discovered the discrepancy when trying to return roughly 125 bitcoins seized from bitcoin exchange Bitstamp during its investigation into ex-DEA agent Carl Force IV.  The emergency motion states:  “Unfortunately, the US Secret Service did not do so and the funds were thereafter stolen, something the US Secret Service only discovered once it was ordered to pay a portion of the seizure back to the affected claims. The government is now investigating both of these thefts as well as whether there were other thefts of digital currency aside from these.”  Bridges was re-arrested in February following suspicions that he was attempting to flee the US. Court documents filed later that month by the US government suggested that Bridges was being investigated for additional bitcoin thefts.  Attorney Steve Levin of Levin & Curlett LLC, who is representing Bridges in the case, declined to comment when reached.

42378798,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmLV,1467388077,Russian Finance Firms Form Blockchain Consortium,"A group of Russian banks and financial services companies has formed a private-sector consortium focused on blockchain applications.  Announced 1st July, the consortium includes payment processing firm QIWI, B&N Bank, Khanty-Mansiysk Otkritie Bank, Tinkoff Bank, MDM Bank, and professional services firm Accenture. The launch came during the 25th International Financial Congress in St. Petersburg, which was hosted by Russia’s central bank and held between 29th June and 1st July.  Areas of focus include the development of blockchain proofs-of-concept, work on joint research and policy outreach, and the creation of technology standards. The group said in public statements that it intends to take a proactive approach in working with domestic regulators and policymakers.  The move comes months after QIWI expressed its hope to create “Russia’s R3CEV”, a reference to the financial services consortium focused on blockchain and distributed ledger development that counts more than 40 institutions among its membership.  QIWI CEO Sergey Solonin said in a statement:  ""I’m convinced that the Consortium, which brought together the Russia’s largest financial company, is able to become an effective platform for multilateral cooperation in exploration, launching innovations and their implementations in financial services.""  Reports suggest that the central bank event revealed additional details about blockchain development in Russia.  According to ForkLog, Bank of Russia deputy chairwoman Olga Skorobogatova disclosed work on a blockchain-based “message transmission system” which is reportedly being tested in conjunction with outside parties.  “Our position is in applying the technologies where they may benefit the market, not just replacing one solution with another,” Skorobogatova was quoted as saying. “Currently we’ve developed a system for message transmission via blockchain. We’re testing it along with other market players.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/07/01/russian-finance-firms-form-blockchain-consortium,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9e7c5a674ce86929d580bad7adc9c758111d634-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378809,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmab,1467378117,ICAP is Building a Blockchain 'Rosetta Stone' to Enhance its Post-Trade Process,"ICAP has built what it refers to internally as a 'Rosetta Stone' for trades.  That description refers to an ancient hieroglyphic text that brought together several languages from antiquity, and opened a pathway to understanding messages encoded in Egyptian ruins.  ICAP invokes this term to describe its new system for managing securities post-trade workflow, one it has now encoded into a single business process. It's designed to let any buyer transact with any broker across a wide range of possible trades.  To use the current blockchain terminology, the company has written what they describe as an elaborate smart contract. So, it only makes sense the next step would be to introduce an actual blockchain in the system.  Since the interdealer broker’s Post Trade Risk and Information Services division announced in March the successful test of a blockchain prototype using multi-asset messaging and its Harmony matching network, that’s exactly what they’ve been doing.  In conversation with CoinDesk, ICAP’s CEO of Post-Trade Risk and Information, Jenny Knott, explained why the elaborate post-trade system is being built to use a variety of blockchains.  Knott said:  ""Today the smart contract is compatible with ethereum, but if ethereum becomes something else, what we’ve done is created a system we believe should be ultimately compatible with any other equivalent blockchain technology.""  Knott first proposed the idea of building a parallel blockchain service that would operate alongside ICAP’s automated workflow shortly after she was appointed CEO in August 2015, after spending eight years at Standard Bank.  Assembling a team  Three months after Knott was hired, ICAP’s investment branch, Euclid, introduced her to the newly formed private blockchain firm, Axoni, and the process of exploring a distributed ledger prototype began.  By December, David Thompson, the chief operating officer of UK-based ICAP's subsidiary Traiana, had been introduced to Axoni and was tasked with helping build a post-trade prototype.  From Traiana’s 350 employees, Thompson selected a team of seven, and by February of this year had completed a test that converted trade data from banks into smart contracts that could be processed via a network of nodes.  Beginning with foreign exchange trades within Traiana, the corporation is now building out a blockchain system that runs parallel to its existing re-imagined business process, which it calls the Transaction Lifecycle Center, but which doesn't yet interact directly with customers.  Smart contracts with value  Currently, Traiana’s team is working with Axoni to troubleshoot the blockchain integration and expand the offering to areas other than foreign exchange.  But, the team must also show its clients that the service isn't just a new toy and that it brings real value.  ""When you’re working with blockchain what you’re actually asking the client to do is trust a new golden source of information,"" said Thompson, adding:  ""To earn that trust it’s a natural demonstration that the old and the new do the same thing but more efficiently.""  From 2015 to 2016, the subsidiary's volume without blockchain integration increased 183% and currently transacts $1.5tn daily from about 3 million trades on its Harmony network, according to numbers released Tuesday.  Changing with the times  As part of the ongoing tests, Traiana is working with one of its 500 partners to work out the kinks in the system.  A beta version of the smart contract-enabled business process is expected to be ready in the first half of next year, with a full release forecast for the end of 2017.  Though ICAP’s early-stage investment firm, Euclid Opportunities, is invested in blockchain firm Digital Asset Holdings and ICAP is already working with Axoni, Knott said it’s important for her company to keep its options open.  Knott said there are still many unanswered questions as to whether there will be one blockchain that dominates the financial sector, or a series of competitors.  In the meantime, Knott's company is busy preparing its business process for eventual blockchain integration and helping educate regulators about its work. Last week, Knott addressed a group of European regulators in Brussels as part of an educational meeting.  She told CoinDesk:  ""The critical point will be making sure that we are agnostic of potential technologies. Making sure that we are re-engineering the business process so that our banks are instantly agreeing, validating that transaction, making it golden, and making it a legally binding transaction through a digital signature. That is what’s important.""
