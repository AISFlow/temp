37692252,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374517,1734306352,Emerging Markets Drive Crypto Growth: Consensys Report,"According to the second annual Global Survey on Crypto and Web3 by Consensys, emerging markets are spearheading global cryptocurrency adoption. The report reveals that countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and the Philippines are driving significant growth in awareness, ownership, and participation in crypto-related activities. Emerging Markets at The Forefront The survey shows that 93% of people globally are aware of cryptocurrencies, with 51% claiming to understand them. Ownership levels stand at 42%, with the highest rates reported in Nigeria (73%), South Africa (68%), and the Philippines (54%). These countries also displayed a notable increase in Web3 activities, such as holding NFTs, using decentralized finance (DeFi), and staking. In Nigeria, 77% of respondents correctly defined blockchain, while 80% knew about decentralization. Similarly, South Africa reported 74% familiarity with the latter concept, while 61% of participants in the Philippines shared the same understanding. Per the report, crypto adoption in these areas is driven by various factors, with a large number of proponents perceiving it as a solution to local economic challenges. Additionally, many in these markets view digital assets as a lifeline, with 65% of Nigerians seeing them as a way to store value amid currency instability and another 58% considering them as the “future of money.” Individuals in these countries are also more likely to invest in crypto in the coming year. The Philippines has been capitalizing on the opportunities provided by such assets, with a 7% increase in ownership over the last 12 months. Entry Barriers and Blockchain Solutions Despite the growing enthusiasm for crypto in these regions, the survey also highlights persistent barriers to entry. Concerns about market volatility, scams, and the lack of understanding of its purpose remain widespread globally. However, these obstacles are less prevalent in emerging markets, where respondents demonstrated a willingness to embrace virtual currencies despite the challenges. The report also reveals that blockchain could be key in addressing concerns about artificial intelligence (AI), with 75% of those interviewed worried about its potential to generate fake news and perpetuate fraud. About 54% of participants globally believe blockchain could provide the transparency and accountability needed to combat AI-driven misinformation. Speaking on the increasing importance of data privacy as highlighted by the survey, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin said: “The critical role of blockchain and decentralization in enhancing privacy, trust, and transparency for how our data is managed cannot be overstated.” He added that the last few years have shown growing momentum for crypto, blockchain, and Web3 adoption, with 2024 marking a significant period. He explained that this is due to various factors, including the recent U.S. presidential election , which could lead to greater regulatory clarity for the industry.

This comes as optimism remains sky-high on the back of a crypto-friendly US presidential administration. As we reported just last night, President-elect Donald Trump confirmed his plans to back the national Bitcoin strategic reserve proposed by crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis. Since his election victory in November, Bitcoin has been on a tear, climbing by 50% in just over a month. Investors are betting big on the changes coming under his administration. Trump has made it clear he’s no fan of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose regulatory crackdowns have been a thorn in the side of the crypto community. The decision to replace Gensler with Paul Atkins, a known crypto ally, has made the market even more bullish. Bitcoin-based ETFs have been a game changer this year, and 2024 has been all about capital flowing in at an insane pace. Just last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $676 million in inflows. The derivatives market is also on fire. Open interest in Bitcoin futures and options has hit record levels. Everyone is betting on where it’s headed next, and the sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish. Altcoins have been left in the dust, with Bitcoin’s market share growing as investors double down on the one crypto they trust the most. While enthusiasm is high, there are signs of caution. Liquidity clusters around $100,000 suggest some volatility ahead. If prices dip, it’s likely a temporary pullback as the market resets before making another run.

A new report from Electric Capital has revealed that Asia now commands 32% of the world’s crypto development. This is a sharp rise from just 12% in 2015. As North America’s influence declines, emerging markets, especially India, are becoming the main source of new talent in crypto. Asia’s Rapid Growth and the Emergence of India Asia’s growing dominance in crypto development is undeniable. The region’s 32% share of global developer activity marks a substantial shift in industry trends. What was once a Western-centric field is now expanding rapidly eastward, with India leading the charge. Since 2023, India has accounted for a larger share of new crypto developers than any other country. This underscores the country’s growing importance in the crypto ecosystem. India’s large talent pool and booming tech industry are driving its rise in blockchain development. The country is becoming a key player in the global crypto ecosystem. Its contributions are shaping the future of the industry. In a recent report, the country emerged as the global hub for Web3 innovations . A Decline in North America, But Veteran Developers Are Flourishing While Asia rises, North America’s dominance in the crypto field is dwindling. The region’s share of global developer activity has dropped from 43% in 2015 to just 24%. Still, the outlook remains positive. The crypto space has seen a 7% drop in active developers this year, but the picture is far from discouraging. Developers with over two years of experience have grown significantly, increasing by 27%. These seasoned experts now contribute over 70% of code commits in leading blockchain ecosystems, underscoring their importance to the industry. Their expertise drives innovation, sustains key projects, and stabilizes the fast-changing field. Despite fewer newcomers, the growing presence of experienced developers highlights the maturing nature of the crypto ecosystem. New Talent Flocks to Solana and Other Blockchain Ecosystems Ethereum remains the top platform for crypto developers, but its dominance is being challenged. Solana is rising quickly, attracting new developers , and becoming the preferred choice by mid-2024 in key markets like the U.S., U.K., China, and Canada. Alongside Ethereum and Solana, other blockchain ecosystems are also gaining traction. Platforms like Internet Computer, Aptos, Coinbase’s Base , Bitcoin, Sui, NEAR, Polkadot, and Polygon are seeing a significant influx of new developers, each adding at least 1,000 new contributors in the past year alone. This shift shows growing interest in diverse blockchain solutions and expanding innovation in previously overlooked markets. The surge of talent entering the crypto space, with over 39,000 new developers this year alone, signals the start of a new era for blockchain development.

Among the top contenders , Altura($ALU) stands out as the most bullish investment opportunity, with a potential return of 8-30x. Here, we delve into the top three AI coins to consider for Q1 2025, with Altura as the central focus. 1. Altura ($ALU): The Game-Changer in AI-Powered Gaming Altura has emerged as a frontrunner in the AI and blockchain space, particularly within the gaming industry. The platform enables the creation and trading of smart NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that adapt and evolve through AI algorithms. This revolutionary approach is set to redefine how players interact with in-game assets, offering unprecedented levels of customization and engagement.Why Altura is the Best Bet for Q1 2025: - High Growth Potential: Analysts predict Altura’s price could surge between 8x and 30x, thanks to its innovative use of AI in gaming and NFTs.- Strong Partnerships: Altura has formed alliances with top gaming studios and blockchain developers, creating a robust ecosystem.- Scalability: By leveraging blockchain networks like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon, Altura ensures seamless and low-cost transactions, crucial for mass adoption.- Community Support: Altura’s growing community and active developer base make it a vibrant and dynamic project poised for success.For investors seeking high returns and a front-row seat in the AI and gaming revolution, Altura is a must-watch in Q1 2025. 2. Fetch.ai ($FET): Pioneering Autonomous AI Solutions Fetch.ai is another standout project in the AI crypto space, aiming to create an autonomous machine economy. The platform uses AI and blockchain to enable devices and applications to perform complex tasks without human intervention. From supply chain optimization to decentralized finance (DeFi), Fetch.ai’s use cases are vast and varied.Why Fetch.ai Deserves Attention: - Real-World Applications: Fetch.ai is already being used in industries like logistics, energy, and transportation.- Innovative Technology: Its decentralized AI network allows for efficient, cost-effective, and scalable solutions.- Market Momentum: As industries increasingly adopt AI, Fetch.ai is well-positioned to benefit from this growing trend. 3. SingularityNET ($AGIX): The Hub for Decentralized AI SingularityNET is a decentralized platform that allows developers to create, share, andmonetize AI services at scale. With its robust ecosystem and strong development team, SingularityNET has become a go-to platform for AI innovation.Why SingularityNET Stands Out: - Diverse Use Cases: From healthcare to robotics, SingularityNET’s AI marketplace supports a wide range of applications.- Active Development: The team’s continuous innovation ensures that the platform stays ahead of the curve.- Integration Potential: SingularityNET’s focus on interoperability makes it compatible with other blockchains and ecosystems, broadening its reach Why Invest in AI Coins Now? The AI crypto sector is poised for explosive growth in 2025 as industries increasingly integrate artificial intelligence into their operations. By investing in AI-focused cryptocurrencies like Altura, Fetch.ai, and SingularityNET, investors can position themselves at the forefront of this technological revolution.Conclusion For Q1 2025, Altura ($ALU) shines as the most promising AI coin, offering potential returns of up to 30x. Its groundbreaking innovations in gaming and NFTs set it apart from the competition. Meanwhile, Fetch.ai and SingularityNET provide compelling opportunities in the broader AI and blockchain space. As always, conduct thorough research and consider your investment goals before diving in. The future of AI and crypto is here, and now is the time to act.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-bitcoin-reserve-trumpres-solana-memecoin-to-explode-17000-before-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

These sentiments from the crypto analyst mirror the dynamic nature of the market and the constant shift in investors interest. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Next Big Player In Crypto While PEPE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are household names in cryptocurrency, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making waves with its decentralized crypto wallet that gives investors absolute control over their digital assets without the interference of third parties. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is known for its adoption of AI solutions and machine learning algorithms that promote financial literacy, security and decentralization among its users. Touted as the SHIB of this cycle, the leading crypto analyst believes WallitIQ (WLTQ) is significantly positioned to benefit from the billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market as the demand for efficient crypto wallets continues to rise. In addition to the leading crypto analyst predictions of WallitIQ to replicate SHIB’s previous success, WallitIQ’s projected $10 million monthly revenue has attracted both retail and institutional investors who missed out on SHIB in 2021, with its low token price and an opportunity to create generational wealth. Following the crypto analyst predictions, the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale has seen massive interest from investors, selling millions of tokens in just a few weeks. Early investors have positioned themselves to enjoy several benefits, including governance participation, early gains from token price appreciation, premium features, etc. The crypto analyst has also mentioned that the best time to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens is now to enjoy the benefits that come with its rapid price growth. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained popularity through its meme status and community-driven support, WallitIQ (WLTQ) distinguishes itself by providing tangible benefits such as annual percentage yields (APY) of 180% as rewards for users who stake their tokens. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides its users with access to over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, giving them an efficient and secure platform to diversify their portfolios. As a platform that prioritizes security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has won the heart of the crypto analyst with its combination of the advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic cryptographic curve (ECC) that protects user private keys and transactions from fraudulent individuals. In addition, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a smart contract audit conducted by a prominent cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm known as SolidProof . This firm specializes in protecting financial institutions and preventing hackers from penetrating blockchain projects. PEPE As Dogecoin (DOGE) Replacement Just recently, PEPE crossed the $11 billion market cap milestone for the first time. With the latest price rally stretching its year-to-date (YTD) to 2,570%, PEPE is positioned to outperform rival meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the current bull cycle. As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to experience fluctuations, many are turning to PEPE as a fresh opportunity. The crypto analysts believe that PEPE could capitalize on the momentum previously enjoyed by Dogecoin, especially with PEPE’s increasing demand increasing social media buzz. According to data from CoinGecko , PEPE’s market cap is at $10.3 billion with a daily trading volume of $5.5 billion. As of the time of this writing, PEPE is trading at a price of $0.00002459. On the other hand, Dogecoin’s market cap is $60.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $6.7 billion. As of writing time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at a price of $0.4121. Be Part Of The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale With PEPE positioning itself as a viable replacement for Dogecoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) aims to capture the spirit of SHIB, attracting all classes of investors with its discounted token price. With the presale moving faster than expected, smart investors are seizing this opportunity to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens for a low price of $0.0243 each. Millions of tokens have been sold, reflecting the growing demand for innovative solutions that offer both utility and security.

37691319,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627923,1734303617,Marc Andreessen exposes Biden admin’s plan to control AI,"Marc Andreessen criticized the Biden administration’s AI regulations, fearing that they would limit innovation. He learned that the government planned to restrict AI development to a few large companies. This led him to endorse Donald Trump, who he believes supports less government control over tech. Marc Andreessen is the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, an influential figure especially when it comes to the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, he exposed his deep concerns over the Biden administration’s plan to regulate and control AI technology, after attending a series of meetings with government officials in May 2023. Andreessen criticizes Biden’s AI regulations Andreessen described the experience as “horrifying,” and it had a significant impact on his decision to endorse Donald Trump in the upcoming election. In the meeting, Andreessen learned that government officials were planning to take strong control over the AI sector, limiting its development and access to a few large companies that cooperate closely with the government. According to Andreessen, the officials clearly stated that AI startups would not be allowed to exist. He recalled the statement, “Don’t fund AI startups. That’s not something that we’re going to allow to happen.” The government’s plan was to establish a situation where only two or three major companies, tightly controlled and “wrapped in a government cocoon,” would be allowed to develop AI technology. These companies would receive government protection from competition and be fully directed by the administration on how to move forward with AI development. Government plans to limit AI Innovation What alarmed him was that the government would go even further by restricting access to the fundamental technology that powers AI. He explained that government officials suggested they could follow a similar path to the Cold War, where certain scientific areas, including physics, were classified and kept secret from the public and the research community. Andreessen was shocked when the officials suggested that AI could also be “classified” in a way that would limit or even prevent open research and development. This discussion raised serious concerns for Andreessen, especially since he had investments in AI startups. His firm has funded several cutting-edge AI companies, including Elon Musk’s xAI, Mistral AI, and Character.AI. The idea of controlling AI development would threaten his business interests and the tech innovation ecosystem. For Andreessen, this wasn’t just about his personal investments it was about the future of AI innovation in the United States. The Biden administration has taken an approach to AI, like issuing an executive order in October 2023 asking companies to voluntarily follow safety and transparency guidelines. The executive order called for companies to share safety test results with the government and for Congress to review data privacy practices. However, Andreessen claims that the government’s actual plan is much more controlling and stricter. He believes their anti-capitalist stance threatens innovation and the spirit of American business. His view is that the government’s approach to AI reflects a shift towards a more controlled economy. After the meetings, Andreessen decided to support Trump, who he saw as a leader promoting innovation. Trump’s approach of reducing government control over business and encouraging private companies in tech was the opposite of the Biden administration’s policies.

37690845,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26489,1734303300,Coinbase Faces $1 Billion Lawsuit Over Wrapped BTC Delisting,"Crypto exchange Coinbase is being sued for over $1 billion by BiT Global Digital Limited, alleging market harm after Coinbase’s November decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). In a Dec. 13 complaint, BiT Global accused Coinbase of delisting wBTC to promote its own product, cbBTC. The move allegedly caused significant financial losses and damaged consumer confidence in wBTC. The lawsuit claims attempted monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act, predatory practices to undermine wBTC, and false statements suggesting wBTC failed to meet listing standards. Coinbase announced the token delisting on Nov. 19, citing undisclosed failures to meet its listing standards. A Coinbase spokesperson defended the decision, stating: “Coinbase is committed to maintaining the high integrity of our listing standards, and we regularly evaluate assets listed on our platform. Should an asset fail to meet those standards, it is delisted.” BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, has been a joint custodian of wBTC reserves with BitGo since August. The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California by law firm Kneupper & Covey, alleges Coinbase favored memecoins while challenging wBTC’s compliance with listing standards. Attorney Kevin Kneupper stated, “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space. If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next?” The lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $1 billion and demands injunctive relief to prevent further harm. BiT Global claims Coinbase aimed to eliminate competition, stating: “It’s clear that Coinbase’s decision is an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, pushing forward their own wrapped Bitcoin product, cbBTC, and removing the largest and most influential competitor in wBTC.” Coinbase previously announced: “Based on our most recent review, Coinbase will suspend trading for wBTC on Dec. 19, 2024, on or around 12 pm ET.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/coinbase-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-over-wrapped-btc-delisting/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Justin Bons, Cyber Capital founder and CIO, argues in a recent tweet that AI-enabled wallets will be the death of ETH’s ambitions of streamlining its ecosystem. Bons wrote: AI agents embedded in user wallets will revolutionize the crypto User Experience! Hilariously it will also be the last nail in the coffin for ETH alignment. ~Justin Bons He added that the situation would arise from AI objectively choosing the blockchains with the best offerings in fees, security, and transaction speeds. Thus, it would do away with what he termed as “all the tribalistic BS!” Netizens pushback on Bons’ claims Those claims kicked a Twitter storm with several netizens pushing back on his suggestions. One X user tdubb led the assault terming Bons’ prediction the worst take on the subject that he had ever seen. He insisted that the intention of the AI is what will matter as these tools will work according to their creator’s instructions. “AI will objectively choose chains with the best fee/security/speed properties” is up there with one of the worst takes on AI i’ve ever seen icl — tdubb — ux/acc (@tdubbdoteth) December 15, 2024 He suggested that there were other factors other than speed, cost, and security that would determine the working of AI-embedded wallets. These include the chain’s liquidity, product, and interoperability. But ultimately the AI agent’s design would hold sway. Another user @calebini also took Bons to task on his assertion that the AI agents wouldn’t choose Base as it was slow, costly, and totally centralized. He made fun of Bons’ apparently forgetting that virtuals, a prominent AI-agent platform was running on the network. @calebini also slammed Bons for relegating his platform to attacking ETH or BTC at every chance he got. He wondered why he (Bons) wouldn’t use it to highlight the positive developments within the entire crypto ecosystem. To him, Bons’ hostility towards the two was tiresome and undermined his credibility. Vitalik Buterin pushes for Ethereum alignment to unite the ecosystem The Ethereum alignment concept grew from the complexities that emerged from the blockchain’s evolution. As the network grew it accommodated many projects with diverse views, goals, and operating principles. This divergence threatens the realization of ETH’s core principles. To bring back all the players to Ethereum’s founding philosophies, the network’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the Ethereum alignment concept. Its key components are ecosystem unity and coordinated governance. Through it, the Ethereum Foundation hopes to build a stronger network with an enhanced ecosystem value. It also looks to improve the user experience by easing user navigation of the blockchain’s services and promoting the interoperability of applications.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA.

BTFD Coin Is the Best Meme Coin Presale to Join Now – Don’t Regret It Twice!,"If you’ve been keeping an eye on meme coins, you’ve probably heard of BONK. It exploded onto the scene as Solana’s first dog-themed meme coin, driving a frenzy in the crypto world. Back when it launched, early adopters were laughing all the way to the bank, turning tiny investments into jaw-dropping gains. BONK wasn’t just another token; it was a movement, a viral sensation. But here’s the thing – if you weren’t there to grab BONK during its early days, you might’ve missed the chance to cash in big time. Fast forward to today, BONK still holds a solid spot in the meme coin landscape, but the astronomical gains are harder to catch now. As it stabilises, those dreams of turning a hundred bucks into a small fortune feel like a distant memory. If you’re wondering whether history will repeat itself, well, it kind of is—but not with BONK. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a meme coin rewriting the playbook and turning heads during its explosive presale phase. Why BTFD Coin Is the Best Meme Coin Presale to Join Now Launched with the mantra “Buy The F***ing Dip,” BTFD Coin has become the hottest topic in crypto circles. With over $3.9 million raised in its presale and a price of $0.00013 per coin, BTFD is delivering on its promise to make sure you never miss a juicy dip again. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a full-blown movement, complete with its own P2E game, staking rewards, and an engaging community called the Bulls Squad. Here’s the kicker: when the presale ends, the listing price will jump to $0.0006. That means if you put in just $1,500 now, you’d snag a whopping 15 million BTFD coins. Once the coin hits the market at its projected price, your investment could skyrocket to $9,000 . Multiply that by the staking APY of up to 90%, and you’re looking at gains that most meme coins can only dream of. The presale has already sold over 55 billion coins to 5,400 holders, and with every passing stage, the price edges higher. Whether you’ve got 1 Ethereum (buying you 38,863,600 coins) or 1 Solana (grabbing 2,287,200 coins), the entry points are as diverse as they are lucrative. And if you’re into gaming, the BTFD P2E platform offers even more ways to earn. But what makes BTFD truly revolutionary is its community-driven ethos. With its Bulls Squad leading the charge, this token is built to withstand the wild swings of crypto markets and turn every dip into a launchpad for growth. Missed BONK? Don’t miss the lucrative BTFD presale . BONK vs. BTFD: A Tale of Two Meme Coins Comparing BONK to BTFD is like comparing yesterday’s news to tomorrow’s headline. BONK had its moment of glory, rallying meme coin enthusiasts around its quirky branding and strong community vibes. When it launched, its price surged astronomically, creating millionaires out of early believers. Even today, BONK remains a staple of Solana’s ecosystem, celebrated for its contribution to meme coin culture. But let’s not sugarcoat it: BONK’s peak growth is behind us. Its current price movements are more about consolidation than explosive growth. Analysts predict steady, albeit modest, increases in BONK’s value as it integrates deeper into Solana’s ecosystem. While that’s great news for existing holders, it leaves little room for the kind of exponential gains new investors crave. On the other hand, BTFD Coin is fresh out of the gates, riding a wave of excitement that shows no signs of slowing down. Its Ethereum-based foundation ensures scalability and security, while its built-in staking and gaming mechanisms make it far more than just a token – it’s an ecosystem. This combination of innovation and community engagement positions BTFD as the best meme coin presale to join now , eclipsing BONK’s fading spotlight. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Your Second Best Chance Crypto opportunities don’t come with guarantees, but they do come with patterns. BONK’s meteoric rise was a wake-up call for anyone sleeping on meme coins. If you missed that boat, don’t let BTFD Coin sail without you.

Qubetics Brings a Fresh Start for High-Growth Investments,"Have you ever wondered what might have been if you’d acted on early crypto trends? AAVE is a prime example of a project that started small but exploded into a major force in decentralised finance. It began quietly, with many sceptical of its potential, but today, AAVE is a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. If you missed the boat then, you’re not alone.

While some, like AAVE, are showing signs of strength, others, like MANA, remain in consolidation mode, waiting their turn in the spotlight, according to the analyst. Martinez noted that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market due to a combination of strong rhetoric and fundamentals. The key factors include: The growing importance of the US Bitcoin Reserve. Anticipation surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock's 2% portfolio allocation recommendation to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is included in the Nasdaq 100. Martinez noted that Ethereum (ETH) has historically outperformed Bitcoin every December, pointing to the importance of timing and positioning. “If you’re investing in altcoins, the important thing is to get into projects with strong fundamentals early on,” he said. Martinez warned investors not to chase memecoins and be tempted by the lure of quick riches, instead focusing on altcoins with real utility and strong fundamentals that have a better chance of generating sustainable gains. Related News: An Extraordinary Proposal for Bitcoin: ""Make 1 Satoshi Now 1 BTC"" According to Martinez, several altcoins stand out as potential winners in the next market cycle: Worldcoin (WLD): A new project that aims to revolutionize identity and global finance. Uniswap (UNI): Leading decentralized exchange with a proven track record. AAVE: A DeFi leader that is already showing its strength. Chainlink (LINK): The home of widely adopted decentralized oracles. Maker (MKR): A stablecoin and one of the cornerstones of DeFi. ONDO: Positioned to capitalize on the narrative of tokenized real-world assets. Solana (SOL): Known for its speed, scalability, and thriving ecosystem. BNB: Exchange token with wide usage and market relevance. “These are not just ‘hype coins,’” Martinez said. “These are projects with solid use cases that can weather market volatility.” “For sustainable gains, position yourself where the smart money is flowing,” he said, suggesting that the next altcoin season may be closer than expected. *This is not investment advice.

37687853,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627909,1734296455,South Korea works to steady markets and calm allies post-impeachment,"South Korea is in political chaos after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and suspended for trying to declare martial law. Acting President Han Duck-soo is now trying to keep the country afloat, juggling financial stability, diplomatic relations, and a growing domestic scandal. Han wasted no time. Within hours, he called U.S. President Joe Biden, promising that South Korea’s policies, especially its critical alliance with the U.S., would remain solid. “South Korea will carry out its foreign and security policies without disruption,” Han’s office said , stressing that the impeachment drama would not affect the nation’s international commitments. That message was meant for nervous allies and investors, both rattled by Yoon’s sudden fall from power. Prosecutors are already circling Yoon. On Sunday, he ignored a summons for questioning over his December 3 martial law declaration. Officials have promised to issue another order, with potential charges that could include insurrection, abuse of authority, and obstructing civil rights. Markets panic as central bank jumps into action The Bank of Korea immediately stepped up, vowing to keep the economy on track and control the volatility shaking the won and the stock market. The currency hit its weakest level against the dollar since the 2008 global financial crisis, while the Kospi index saw steep losses. “The Bank of Korea intends to utilize all available policy instruments in conjunction with the government,” the central bank said in a rare Sunday statement. The bank emphasized that this crisis is different from past political upheavals. Global trade tensions, intensified competition, and external economic risks make the current situation far more dangerous. Markets had already taken a hit. Now, the Bank of Korea fears overlapping domestic and global pressures could spiral into deeper financial instability. Acting President Han told his team to monitor markets closely and take “bold, immediate” action if the situation worsens. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok echoed this urgency, announcing plans to release updated policies before the end of the year. Crypto’s wild ride during the chaos Amid this political and economic disaster, South Korea’s crypto market stood out for its bizarre reaction. After Yoon’s martial law fiasco, Bitcoin prices plummeted on Korean exchanges, hitting $71,814.99, far below the global average of $93,600. From November 5 to 28, South Korea’s daily crypto trading volume reached $9.4 billion, outpacing the $7 billion traded on the Kospi. While traditional stocks dropped 3.4% during the same period, an index tracking the top 100 cryptos surged by 53%. Over 7 million South Koreans, nearly 15% of the population, are registered on crypto exchanges. Many of them missed Bitcoin’s early rally and are now chasing smaller, riskier coins. These altcoins account for more than 80% of trading volume on local platforms, boosted by promotions like Bithumb’s zero-fee campaign. South Korean regulators, however, are keeping a tight grip. Spot Bitcoin ETFs remain unapproved, forcing traders to look overseas. Leverage-hungry investors have turned to foreign funds, with products tracking Bitcoin and Ether among the most-bought overseas securities last month. Meanwhile, South Korea is also bracing for external challenges. President-elect Trump’s trade policies could hammer the export-heavy economy. Trump has promised more tariffs on Chinese goods, which would hit South Korea’s supply chains hard. As China’s top supplier of intermediate goods, South Korea depends on stable trade flows to keep its semiconductor and automotive industries running. Trump has also criticized South Korea’s financial relationship with the U.S., calling it a “money machine” and demanding that the country pay more for hosting American troops.

Pseudonymous trader Bluntz tells his 304,000 followers on the social media platform X that the utility token for decentralized oracle service Pyth Network ( PYTH ) has broken out of a bull flag pattern. Bluntz’s chart also suggests that PYTH is in the midst of a five-wave impulse to around the $0.50 level. “Solana ecosystem looking good again, nice bull flag PYTH breakout. Looking impulsive.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz practices Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to go through a five-wave move up before an ABC correction. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that PYTH is on the verge of starting its fifth-wave surge following the bull flag breakout. At time of writing, PYTH is trading at $0.431. Bluntz is also bullish on memecoins, saying that the sector may be gearing up for a revival that will “catch a few off guard.” The trader names the Solana-based Dogecoin ( DOGE ) rival Bonk ( BONK ) as a potential candidate for leading a memecoin resurgence. He says BONK has likely completed an ABC-wave correction downward, suggesting an imminent rally, as per Elliot Wave theory. “BONK has pulled back 46% from the highs and looks like a clear three-wave move down. Looks like a really good dip to buy in my opinion, sales like this don’t come around that often. I am betting on fresh all-time highs still to come.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that BONK will surge close to $0.00007 before ending its five-wave ascent. At time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.0000347.

Boring’s bold prediction comes at a time when optimism is rising in the cryptocurrency market following Trump’s return to the political scene. Bitcoin recently surpassed $100,000, fueled by speculation over potential pro-crypto policy changes under a Trump administration. The former president’s son and Trump Organization Vice Chairman Eric Trump called his father “an incredible ally for the industry” during a Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi. He also claimed that Trump’s plans could turn the U.S. into the “crypto capital of the world.” Related News: Watch Out: Very Important Week Ahead - Major Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up! Here is the Day by Day, Hour by Hour List Speaking on a news program, Perianne Boring highlighted key proposals that could support Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. These include creating a Bitcoin reserve for the US government, tailoring tax policies to encourage crypto adoption, and removing regulatory hurdles for the blockchain industry. “Everything Trump outlined would solidify the US’s leadership in the digital asset ecosystem,” Boring said. Boring also noted that the current regulatory environment under the Biden administration is driving crypto activity offshore. Trump’s appointments to key regulatory roles, such as Paul Atkins for the SEC and Brian Quintenz for the CFTC, demonstrate a commitment to clearer, more supportive policies for digital assets. Both officials have been fierce critics of excessive regulation and have called for a more business-friendly approach. As optimism grows, Bitcoin’s price predictions have also become increasingly bullish. Some analysts predict a near-term high of $250,000, while others believe the stock-to-flow model could push Bitcoin beyond $800,000. “If Trump successfully implements his proposals, the sky’s the limit because Bitcoin has a fixed supply,” Boring added. *This is not investment advice.

Although a December rate cut appears imminent, Leonhardt warned that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could accompany that decision with guidance suggesting a pause in rate cuts early next year. “Don’t be surprised if next week’s rate cut is combined with Powell’s statement that the Fed will pause rate cuts at the beginning of the year,” Leonhardt added, noting the directional challenges policymakers face in balancing economic signals. Goldman Sachs reiterated its expectation of a December rate cut, saying it was a foregone conclusion. The investment bank also forecasts additional 25 basis point cuts in January and March 2025, with further cuts likely at the June and September meetings. However, Goldman noted that some members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have expressed a willingness to slow the rate-cutting cycle earlier than initially expected, adding that there is increasing uncertainty about the pace of future cuts.

This funding wave highlights growing confidence in the sector, driven by expectations of a pro-crypto administration and clearer regulatory policies. Since the election on November 6, crypto startups have raised around $1.3 billion, signaling renewed interest from venture capitalists. According to industry data, November alone saw $796 million invested , with another $511 million following in December. A standout during this period was the Avalanche Foundation, which secured $250 million through a private token sale. This funding supports the network's major upgrade, Avalanche9000, set to improve blockchain scalability and reduce transaction costs. Infrastructure projects also captured significant attention, attracting over $500 million in investments. Notable beneficiaries included Zero Gravity Labs, which raised $40 million, and Bitcoin mining company Canaan Creative, which secured $30 million. Meanwhile, the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) sector also saw renewed momentum, receiving more than $150 million in funding. Key investments included $45 million for USDX Money and $30 million for World Liberty Financial. This funding boom is linked to optimism surrounding Trump's support for the crypto industry. Trump’s promises to clarify regulations and create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve have fueled excitement among investors. Additionally, his pro-crypto appointments, such as Paul Atkins as the proposed SEC chair and David Sachs as the first White House crypto czar, have signaled a potential shift toward a friendlier regulatory environment. Experts believe these developments could eliminate barriers for institutional adoption and drive further investments into the sector.

37688449,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-venture-funding-soar-with-1b-raised-post-trump-victory/,1734295506,Crypto Venture Funding Soar With $1B Raised Post-Trump Victory,"The U.S. presidential election was held on November 5, 2024, with Republican Party candidate Donald Trump claiming victory on November 6., fueling rapid surge in crypto venture funding. That has even hugely impacted the cryptocurrency sector, which has witnessed a huge inflow of funding. Massive Funding Boost Across Crypto Projects According to a report , venture capital (VC) funds have spiked since Trump’s electoral victory. Notably, several projects have raised over $1 billion ahead as the anticipation for a crypto-friendly administration grows. Stakeholders are optimistic that the crypto regulatory environment will be pro-crypto. DefiLlama data reveals that over $1.3 billion have been attracted in funding. Of this amount, VCs contributed the larger share in November, with $796 immediately after the election victory. In December, they raised an additional $511 million. Different venture capital firms fundraising with the Avalanche Foundation emerged as the highest fundraiser. Avalanche Foundation registered $250 million via a private token sale. Meanwhile, the Avalanche network will engage in an upgrade of Avalanche9000 on December 16. The goal is to enhance blockchain scalability and lower cost. DeFi Sector Gets Significant Funding Furthermore, there has been an uptick in VCs in crypto infrastructure projects. Infrastructure developers got over $500 million, with Zero Gravity Labs securing $40 million. On their part, Bitcoin miner Canaan Creative secured $30 million. The DeFi sector received significant funding to the tune of $150 million. USDX Money and World Liberty Financial were key investments that received $45 million and $30 million, respectively. The uptick comes following the DeFi market recovery, even as retail and institutional investors have picked interest in the sector. Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Stance Fuels Market Optimism Experts have attributed these funding boosts to the positive sentiments in the broader crypto space. Notably, many stakeholders see the incoming administration, which resumes on January 20, 2025, as pro-crypto. During his electioneering campaign, Trump pledged support for the crypto industry, and many expect positive reforms that could affect the sector. Aside from promising to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , Trump has taken several steps that signal he would walk the talk. Notable among these include the nomination of Paul Atkins as a replacement for Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. This development could positively influence crypto growth as Atkins could drive regulatory clarity following his appointment.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/chill-pepe-chilpepe-will-explode-over-14000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37686841,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627870,1734294616,Bitcoin has a twisted relationship with the most powerful men on Wall Street,"Bitcoin, which faced heavy criticism from Wall Street heads during the early years, has become a $2 trillion beast, punching its way past $103,000 for the first time after 15 years of chaos. It’s a love-hate story with Wall Street’s bigwigs—some think it’s a bubble, while others think it’s digital gold. And somehow, despite all the skepticism, it’s here, setting the stage for a clash between finance’s old guard and the digital disruptors. The world’s largest crypto is riding high on dreams of a crypto-friendly Trump 2.0 era. His return to power has brought hopes of a digital renaissance, pushing the entire crypto market toward a $4 trillion valuation. Now, as crypto companies sit flush with cash, some of Wall Street’s most notorious players are reluctantly wading into the game. Others? Still throwing stones from the sidelines. Jamie Dimon Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, doesn’t mince words when it comes to Bitcoin. Back in 2017, he called it a “fraud” and even threatened to fire employees for trading it. In congressional hearings, he doubled down, labeling crypto tokens as “decentralized Ponzi schemes” and calling for a government crackdown. But here’s the thing—while Jamie spits on Bitcoin, JPMorgan quietly trades Bitcoin ETFs and explores blockchain like a kid sneaking into the candy jar. Blockchain is fine, but Bitcoin? “A useless pet rock,” Jamie said recently. That’s his story, and he’s sticking to it. Hypocrisy? Maybe. But he’s not alone in the double game. Larry Fink Larry Fink, the BlackRock kingpin, took a hardline stance against Bitcoin in its early days. In 2017, he called it “an index of money laundering” and claimed his clients had no interest in it. Fast forward, and now BlackRock runs the world’s largest Bitcoin fund. Funny how things change when there’s money to be made. Larry admits Bitcoin’s value as a hedge against political chaos and currency devaluation. He’s flipped the script, now touting Bitcoin as uncorrelated to traditional assets and worth a serious look for investors. BlackRock’s pivot is one of the most historic decisions ever made in the finance industry. Its Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been its most profitable investment product ever. Ken Griffin Meanwhile, Citadel’s Ken Griffin once ridiculed Bitcoin as the financial equivalent of tulip mania. In 2021, he went as far as to say the crypto craze was a “jihadist call” against the dollar. But Griffin’s view has changed. “I wish I bought it when it was cheap,” he said recently, reflecting on Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. He admits his past dismissal was a mistake, though he’s still not all in. Griffin’s cautious optimism shows how Bitcoin’s success forces even its critics to rethink their positions. He might not love Bitcoin, but he respects its power now. Who wouldn’t? It’s simply undeniable. Warren Buffett The Oracle of Omaha has no love lost for Bitcoin. Warren Buffett famously called it “rat poison squared” in 2018, and he’s stuck to that script. At the time, he said he wouldn’t pay $25 for all the Bitcoin in the world. While other Wall Street titans soften their stances, Warren keeps his hands firmly in his pockets. Even when Bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark, he wasn’t impressed. In 2023, he called it a symptom of America’s gambling problem. As far as the legendary investor is concerned, Bitcoin is noise, not a signal. For now, it seems nothing can change that. Not Bitcoin’s massive price tag, and sadly, not our thoughtfully-written open letter to him. Ray Dalio: Bitcoin is gold, but with a target on its back Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio started as a skeptic, but his journey has taken a different turn. He once dismissed Bitcoin as a “speculative bubble,” but by 2021, he was calling it “one hell of an invention.” Dalio now sees Bitcoin as an alternative to gold, with all the potential—and all the risks—that entails. Dalio owns Bitcoin and Ether, but he’s cautious about government intervention. “If Bitcoin becomes too successful, governments will kill it,” he warned. The Trump factor and institutional FOMO Investors are piling into Bitcoin ETFs, and companies like MicroStrategy are doubling down. Their plan to buy $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years is particularly bold, even by crypto standards. This institutional FOMO (fear of missing out) is real. Hedge funds like Millennium and Capula are jumping into the mix, driven by demand for regulated crypto exposure. Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered called Bitcoin’s latest milestone a sign of the industry’s maturity. “This isn’t just speculation anymore,” he said. Meanwhile, Tom Lee has said: “Bitcoin might reach $250,000… Demand is increasing due to the rise in spot Bitcoin-traded ETFs… declining interest rates generally benefit riskier assets.” Last week, analyst Gil Luria famously said, “We would attribute a 1-2% chance to [Bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar] which is sufficient to justify the current asset valuation.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-has-a-twisted-relationship-with-the-most-powerful-men-on-wall-street/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37686841.jpeg

Sounds tempting, right? Well, this is where the magic of meme coins like BTFD Coin, PEPE, and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) comes in. While PEPE and PNUT are already crowd favourites, BTFD Coin is making waves with its presale that’s breaking records and setting the stage for massive returns. In Stage 12 of its presale journey, BTFD Coin has sold over 54 billion tokens to more than 5,400 bullish holders, raising an impressive $3.9 million so far. It smashed the $1 million mark in under 10 days and cruised past $2.5 million within just 14 days of its presale launch. The question now is, will you grab your chance at $0.00013 before the price hikes again? BTFD Coin: Leading the Charge in Meme Coin Evolution The crypto market has seen countless meme coins, but BTFD Coin is rewriting the playbook. Built on Ethereum, BTFD combines the essence of “ buy the dip ” culture with cutting-edge technology, making it a standout choice for investors who crave utility and fun. What’s Driving BTFD’s Success? Play-to-Earn Game (Beta Version): The newly launched beta version of BTFD’s Play-to-Earn game offers players a sneak peek into a vibrant crypto gaming ecosystem. While the beta version doesn’t dole out rewards yet, it lays the groundwork for a full-fledged earning platform that’s set to thrill gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Staking Rewards: With an APY averaging 90%, staking is a game-changer. Whether you’re a short-term holder or a long-hauler, BTFD’s staking system offers a significant incentive to lock in your tokens. Community-Driven Movement: BTFD isn’t just a token; it’s a movement backed by the Bulls Squad—a dedicated community rallying behind the coin. From engaging memes to real-time updates, the team ensures every investor feels like part of the action. Meme Coin Utility: Unlike traditional meme coins, BTFD offers real-world usability. Whether it’s through gaming, staking, or exclusive community perks, this coin is built to keep you engaged and rewarded. Why Invest Now?

The clock is ticking, and with the price set to rise in the next stage, the time to act is now. PEPE: The OG Meme Coin that Won’t Quit No conversation about meme coins is complete without mentioning PEPE Coin. As one of the pioneers of the meme coin frenzy, PEPE capitalises on internet culture with its playful nod to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme. What Sets PEPE Apart? Cultural Relevance: PEPE thrives on its status as an internet meme legend. Its strong brand identity makes it a go-to choice for crypto enthusiasts who value humour and nostalgia. Community Power: PEPE’s success lies in its loyal following. From viral social media campaigns to enthusiastic subreddit discussions, the community drives PEPE’s momentum. Market Position: Over the years, PEPE has established itself as a formidable contender in the meme coin arena, proving its ability to weather the crypto market’s ups and downs. While PEPE’s utility is more entertainment-focused, it continues to serve as an alternative investment vehicle for those looking to ride the meme wave. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): The Underdog with a Billion-Dollar Bite Inspired by the internet’s favourite squirrel, PNUT has carved its niche in the meme coin world by blending humour with solid market performance. Its recent inclusion in Coinbase’s roadmap has further cemented its position as a rising star. Why PNUT Stands Out Cultural Resonance: Like PEPE, PNUT taps into a beloved cultural symbol. Its connection to Peanut the Squirrel gives it a whimsical yet relatable edge. Institutional Interest: PNUT’s market cap surged after Coinbase added it to its roadmap, showcasing the potential for mainstream adoption. Volatility Meets Opportunity: With a market cap of over $1 billion and significant price swings, PNUT attracts investors who thrive on calculated risks. Beyond its meme roots, PNUT offers a blend of fun and financial opportunities, making it a versatile choice for both casual and serious investors. How to Buy BTFD Coins?

37687380,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52228,1734293711,BTFD Presale Shines as the Best Meme Coin Presales to Buy and Hold for Long Term While Dogwifhat and Popcat Fuel Meme Coin Mania,"Have you ever thought about turning a meme into a money-making machine? Ever thought you’d be cashing in on digital cats, cheeky memes, and a mantra as bold as “Buy The F*ing Dip”? Meme coins are no joke—they’re rewriting the rules of investing, turning the crypto space into a playground for the audacious. But here’s the kicker: not all meme coins are created equal. While seasoned players like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT) have claimed their thrones in the crypto kingdom, BTFD Coin is blazing a trail with one of the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for long-term gains. BTFD Coin is the talk of the town, thanks to its thriving presale and the unique community it’s fostering. If you’ve missed out on the meteoric rises of meme coin giants in the past, this could be your shot at riding the next big wave. BTFD Coin: Where Meme Coin Magic Meets Real Utility Meme coins are often seen as speculative, but BTFD Coin flips the script. Built on Ethereum’s trusted blockchain, it delivers more than just catchy slogans. This project brings tangible utility, community engagement, and financial growth opportunities. Presale Performance: Numbers That Speak Volumes BTFD’s presale is in its 12th stage right now, and it’s selling fast. Here’s what makes it stand out: $0.00013 per coin in the current stage, with a target price of $0.0006 by presale’s end. Over $3.9 million raised, smashing milestones like the $1 million mark in under 10 days. 54 billion coins sold to a growing community of over 5,400 With only 48% of the total supply allocated for presale, early investors are already celebrating their foresight. Play2Earn Game: Beta Version Now Live! Gaming enthusiasts take note. BTFD’s Play2Earn (P2E) game, currently in beta, invites players to immerse themselves in a thrilling digital world with endless possibilities. Imagine racing through levels, earning rewards, and engaging in a community-first experience. While the beta version doesn’t yet offer monetary rewards, it’s just a glimpse of what’s to come when the full game launches. Staking Rewards: The Power of Holding Why let your assets sit idle? BTFD’s staking program allows you to grow your holdings passively. With an average APY of 90%, staking offers substantial returns for those willing to lock in their investment. It’s not just about profits; it’s about fostering a stable, thriving ecosystem. Meme Coin Utility: Beyond the Hype Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on speculative trading, BTFD is a movement. It’s a rallying cry for crypto believers who know the value of buying low. Picture this: A trader using BTFD’s platform to double down on dips while engaging in a community that’s all about resilience and fun. That’s the essence of BTFD Coin. And let’s not forget the BTFD Rewards Program , where referrals earn you 10% bonuses. Whether it’s family, friends, or your social media circle, spreading the word about BTFD doesn’t just help the project—it rewards you, too. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Quirky Pioneer Dogwifhat (WIF) isn’t a new name in the crypto game. Known for its dog meme-inspired branding, WIF has cemented itself as a go-to investment for those looking to add a dash of fun to their portfolios. With a solid community and consistent market performance, it’s become a reliable alternative to traditional investments. The WIF community thrives on humour and camaraderie, proving that crypto doesn’t have to be all serious charts and graphs. Its decentralised finance (DeFi) features allow users to stake and earn rewards, making it a versatile addition to any crypto wallet. Over the years, WIF has evolved beyond a meme, integrating utility and real-world use cases that keep its holders engaged and hopeful. While WIF doesn’t have the buzz of a fresh presale like BTFD Coin, its stability and proven track record make it a favourite for those who prefer a bit of security in the Wild West of crypto. Popcat (POPCAT): A Community-Driven Favourite Popcat, the quirky Solana-based token, is a meme coin that’s captured the hearts of cat lovers and crypto enthusiasts alike. With its iconic open-mouthed cat mascot, POPCAT has created a vibrant community that thrives on creativity and shared enthusiasm. What sets POPCAT apart is its focus on gamification and community engagement. From interactive campaigns to partnerships with influencers, POPCAT knows how to keep its audience hooked. It’s also no stranger to market volatility, with its price swings often making headlines. But for those who’ve held on through the ups and downs, the rewards have been worth the ride. Like WIF, POPCAT is a symbol of how meme coins can go beyond jokes to offer real value. It’s a testament to the power of community and the endless possibilities of blockchain technology. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out While WIF and POPCAT have carved out their niches, BTFD Coin is redefining what it means to be the best meme coin . Its presale isn’t just about raising funds; it’s about building a community of bold, like-minded investors ready to seize the moment. From its innovative Play2Earn game to its lucrative staking rewards, BTFD is setting the stage for long-term success. With analysts predicting a surge in value as the presale concludes, BTFD Coin is positioned as one of the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for long-term gains. Don’t miss out—join the BTFD revolution today and turn market dips into your golden ticket. Conclusion In a market flooded with options, finding the right meme coin to back can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Dogwifhat and Popcat have proven their worth over time, building legacies that inspire confidence. But BTFD Coin is the new kid on the block with a presale performance that’s too impressive to ignore. Based on current trends and community enthusiasm, BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin ; it’s a phenomenon in the making. From its robust tokenomics and staking rewards to its thrilling P2E game and referral program, BTFD offers something for everyone. Don’t miss your chance to join the next big thing in crypto. The current stage of the BTFD Coin presale is your golden ticket to ride the bull run from the start. Act now.

37685992,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627864,1734292852,Can real estate and Bitcoin together bring big returns? Grant Cardone explains,"Grant Cardone advocates combining real estate and Bitcoin. By using real estate cash flow to buy Bitcoin, he opines that investors benefit from Bitcoin’s price swings while protecting against inflation. His Bitcoin Real Estate Fund has raised $87.5M in real estate and $15M in Bitcoin, with plans to expand. Cardone, a well-known entrepreneur and real estate investor, in a recent X post, mentioned that he has adopted Bitcoin as part of his investment strategy. He believes that the combination of real estate and Bitcoin could lead to massive returns for investors. Real estate and Bitcoin combined Cardone said his new strategy combines high-quality real estate investments with Bitcoin. The idea involves purchasing cash-flow-positive real estate (like apartment buildings) and using the cash flow to invest in Bitcoin. The American entrepreneur had launched a Bitcoin Real Estate Fund that combines $87.5M in real estate and $15M in Bitcoin. The fund is reportedly 90% subscribed already and plans to add more Bitcoin over the next few years using the cash flow from the real estate. This method combines the stability of real estate with the potential for huge gains from Bitcoin every year as in DCA (Dollar Cost Average). How does this work? Both real estate and Bitcoin are great assets to invest in this economic uncertainty. When governments print too much money, it leads to inflation, and the dollar loses its value. Both real estate and Bitcoin can act as hedges against inflation and also a weakening dollar. Real estate can appreciate over time, while Bitcoin has shown explosive growth in value, especially with the Trump Admin. Cardone explains, “We remove the volatility by adding the real estate and power the real estate by adding BTC’s volatility.” The result would be that investors benefit from both worlds. Real estate provides steady cash flow, while Bitcoin’s price increases can give more returns. This approach combines the best of both worlds. “Real estate powered by Bitcoin is changing real estate investing forever,” Cardone opined.

37685716,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52223,1734292478,"Bitcoin vs XRP Profit Prospect: To Get a 10x On BTC In 2025, Price Needs to Hit $1 Million","A recent tweet by crypto trader and investor PharaohX33 has highlighted the growing division between supporters of XRP and Bitcoin within the cryptocurrency community. The tweet criticizes the tribalism in the space, particularly from Bitcoin maximalists, and makes a case for XRP’s potential to deliver higher returns soon compared to Bitcoin. This debate raises important questions about the dynamics of crypto investing and the influence of community sentiment on financial decisions. XRP’s Potential vs. Bitcoin’s Growth Ceiling In his tweet, PharaohX33 draws attention to the growth potential of XRP versus Bitcoin. He notes that for Bitcoin to achieve a 10x return, its price would need to reach $1 million by 2025, a target many consider improbable given Bitcoin’s current market cap and adoption rate. In contrast, XRP would only need to reach $25 to achieve the same 10x growth, a scenario he describes as “WAY more likely.” PharaohX33 also highlights XRP’s strong performance in 2024, suggesting that it outperforms Bitcoin and will likely continue to do so in 2025. His argument is rooted in pragmatism: investors should focus on maximizing returns rather than adhering to the emotional biases or opinions of others. He even suggests a strategic approach, advising that investors could use profits from XRP’s potential 10x growth to acquire more Bitcoin if they choose, thus benefiting from both assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cautious Optimism: A Contrasting Viewpoint Not everyone in the crypto community shares the same level of confidence in XRP’s short-term potential. In response to PharaohX33’s tweet, a user named Nacho offered a more cautious perspective, suggesting that XRP’s path to substantial growth might take longer than 2025. Nacho points out several factors that could limit XRP’s immediate price appreciation: Escrow Supply: Tens of billions of XRP remain locked in escrow, creating a significant supply overhang. Lack of Scarcity Mechanisms: Unlike Bitcoin, XRP does not have a halving mechanism to reduce new supply. Low Burn Rate: The rate at which XRP is burned through transactions is minimal, which may not significantly impact overall supply in the near term. Nacho proposes that a more realistic timeframe for XRP to reach significant price milestones is 2028–2030, once all coins are in circulation and market dynamics shift in its favor. His view emphasizes the importance of understanding tokenomics and market supply when evaluating investment opportunities. The Need for Pragmatism in Crypto Investing The debate sparked by PharaohX33’s tweet underscores a broader issue in the cryptocurrency market: the impact of tribalism on investment decisions. While community loyalty can foster engagement and support for a project, it can also cloud judgment and lead to missed opportunities. PharaohX33’s perspective highlights the importance of prioritizing financial goals over emotional allegiances, urging investors to think independently and evaluate assets based on their potential for returns. On the other hand, Nacho’s measured approach is a reminder that long-term factors, such as supply dynamics and adoption rates, must also be considered when making investment decisions.

Tokenized bonds are a digital representation of traditional bonds that can be held and traded on a blockchain. The immutable nature of blockchains aims to promise a tamper-proof recording of ownership and transaction history of these tokens. In a statement, Societe Generale says it fully executed a tokenized bond transaction on Ethereum through its subsidiary FORGE. The bonds were deposited to serve as collateral in exchange for the central bank digital currency (CBDC) that France’s central bank, Banque de France, issued on its DL3S blockchain. Societe Generale says the transaction marks the first time a repurchase agreement (repo) with a member of the Eurosystem was executed on a blockchain. Repo is a short-term agreement to sell securities and repurchase these later at a predetermined higher price. “This is the first repo transaction (Sale and Repurchase Agreement) in digital securities (Security Tokens) with a Eurosystem’s central bank.” The bank says the transaction demonstrates the technical feasibility of conducting interbank refinancing operations directly on the blockchain. “It illustrates the potential of a Central Bank Digital Currency to improve the liquidity of digital financial securities.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37686592,https://thecoinrise.com/opensea-sparks-airdrop-buzz-amid-cayman-islands-registration/,1734291929,OpenSea Sparks Airdrop Buzz Amid Cayman Islands Registration,"OpenSea, the popular Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplace, is sparking excitement and speculation following its recent registration in the Cayman Islands. Many in the NFT community believe this move signals an imminent launch of its digital token and a potential airdrop. While OpenSea remains tight-lipped about the details, the signs are hard to ignore. A Mysterious Registration Raises Questions Pseudonymous researcher Waleswoosh, affiliated with the Azuki NFT collection, recently shared OpenSea’s official registration in the Cayman Islands with a screenshot. This news quickly stirred up speculation within the NFT community about an impending token launch and airdrop. This news follows OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer’s November announcement about the platform’s revival. He promised a revamped version would launch in December, but he did not provide details. The speculation around a token launch and airdrop has grown since then. Many users now wonder if this move signals a major shift for OpenSea and its plans. The Airdrop Debate: Will OpenSea Reward Its Users? The debate surrounding an airdrop has been noticeable. Many users are optimistic that OpenSea will reward those who have supported the platform. This is especially true for those active since its early days. This could help the platform rebuild trust after facing tough competition from other NFT marketplaces. Meanwhile, others, like DappRadar’s communications manager “nederob,” were less convinced. He noted that an airdrop might pose regulatory hurdles due to OpenSea’s U.S.-based operations. The NFT marketplace faces a class action lawsuit for alleged NFT securities sales. However, the registration in the Cayman Islands suggests that OpenSea may be planning a more flexible approach to token distribution. This could help avoid some of the regulatory challenges it might face in the U.S. Learning from Competitors: Blur and Magic Eden The possibility of an OpenSea airdrop is not just speculative. This strategy has already been successfully employed by competitors like Blur and Magic Eden. Blur’s entry into the NFT space introduced a token airdrop system. Reportedly, users receive tokens after the conclusion of each trading season. A single user earned up to $11 million from the Blur token airdrop in 2023. This underscores the potential value of such initiatives. Magic Eden followed suit with its token airdrop, but with mixed results. While the initial value of its ME token surged to $13.10, it quickly crashed by nearly 70%. This was after a poorly received claiming process and technical glitches. Despite efforts like the zero-fee initiative in February 2023 to compete with Blur, OpenSea has struggled to regain its dominance. Blur still leads in trading volumes, with OpenSea just a little behind. An airdrop could attract back users who switched to Blur and other platforms.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-bitcoin-reserve-trumpres-solana-memecoin-to-explode-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

While dog-themed tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long dominated the meme coin landscape, 2025 marks a new era—the rise of cat-themed memecoins. These feline-inspired tokens are clawing their way into the market, capturing the hearts of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. According to CoinGecko, cat-themed memecoins collectively boast a market cap of over $5.59 billion , with more than 260 tokens across prominent blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Base. Here are the top five cat-themed memecoins reshaping the meme coin universe. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat (POPCAT) is one of the most prominent players in this space. Built on the Solana blockchain, it draws inspiration from the viral meme of a cat named Oatmeal, famous for its wide-mouthed expression. Since its launch in late 2023, Popcat has skyrocketed by an incredible 32,854.3%, achieving a market cap of $1.2 billion. With a current price of $1.25 and daily trading volumes of $127.2 million, Popcat thrives on its vibrant community and AI-powered meme creation platform. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) Another strong contender is Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) , a token that humorously positions itself as a counter to the dominance of dog-themed memecoins. Launched on the Solana blockchain in early 2024, MEW has seen substantial growth, trading at $0.008 with a market cap of $750 million. The token has gained 828.5% over the past nine months, bolstered by listings on major exchanges like KuCoin. Simon’s Cat (CAT) Simon's Cat (CAT) leverages the popularity of the iconic British animated series to carve out its niche. Launched on the BNB Smart Chain, it combines meme appeal with entertainment and gaming utility. Trading at $0.00004426 with a market cap of $298 million, Simon’s Cat has surged by 301.4% in just four months, making it a favorite among both meme enthusiasts and crypto investors. Toshi (TOSHI) Toshi (TOSHI) , named after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s pet cat, brings together meme culture and the technical capabilities of Coinbase’s Base blockchain. Toshi offers features like community-driven governance and integration into decentralized applications. With a market cap of $114 million and an astonishing 1,428,954.9% gain over the past year, Toshi continues to grow, with predictions of becoming a significant player on the Base network.

As altcoin season approaches and the crypto market gears up for a bull run, Kaia may be set for significant gains. CHILLGUY Nearing Support Levels: A Bullish Reversal in Sight?

The nearest resistance is at $0.67. If CHILLGUY breaks through this level, it could rally towards the next resistance at around $0.88. This would represent a potential gain of over half from current levels. The Simple Moving Averages for 10 and 100 days are close, suggesting a possible trend reversal. Despite recent declines of around a third over the past week and month, the impending altcoin season could propel CHILLGUY higher. Keep an eye on the support at $0.24; a rebound from here could spark the next upward move. DYDX Surges Over 70%: Eyes Set on Breaking $3.47 Resistance DYDX has experienced significant growth lately, with its price increasing over 70% in the past month and nearly 20% in the last week. Currently trading between $1.92 and $3.06, the 10-day SMA stands slightly above the 100-day SMA, suggesting bullish momentum. The RSI is around 42, indicating the token is not overbought yet.

As 2025 kicks off, it’s the perfect time to reevaluate your portfolio and jump on the best cryptos to invest in for 2025 . The market is evolving, and savvy investors know that early moves in January often pave the way for massive returns throughout the year. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , Toncoin (TON), and Celestia (TIA). These projects aren’t just about riding hype; they’re solving real-world problems with cutting-edge tech. Qubetics simplifies crypto payments, Toncoin is revolutionizing blockchain ecosystems, and Celestia is making waves in modular blockchain infrastructure. Let’s dive deeper into why these three are must-haves this year. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Everyday Crypto Crypto has always struggled with accessibility, but Qubetics is flipping the script. Imagine managing your digital assets and making payments as easily as using Apple Pay or Google Pay. That’s the magic of the Qubetics non-custodial multi-chain wallet. Picture this: you’re a small business owner handling international clients. With Qubetics, cross-border payments are a breeze—its smart contract conversion tech instantly converts crypto to fiat at the point of sale. For individuals, the wallet’s integration with major payment platforms makes spending crypto feel as natural as swiping a debit card. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics tokens are priced at $0.0311. With $6.4 million raised, 334 million tokens sold, and over 9,700 holders already in, the buzz is real. The token’s post-presale price of $0.25 means a potential ROI of 900% for early investors. If you’re searching for the best cryptos to invest in for 2025 , Qubetics should be on your radar. Toncoin (TON): The Backbone of the Telegram Ecosystem Toncoin is tightly linked with Telegram, one of the world’s largest messaging platforms. That integration alone gives TON a massive edge in adoption and utility. The Open Network (TON) blockchain powers features like decentralized payments and tokenized services directly within Telegram, making it a unique and user-friendly crypto ecosystem. In 2024, TON saw major growth, with new use cases emerging in e-commerce and decentralized finance (DeFi). Telegram’s global user base of over 700 million gives Toncoin unparalleled access to potential adopters, making it one of the most promising projects in the blockchain space. For investors, TON offers a mix of utility and scalability. Its ability to serve as a bridge between traditional users and decentralized applications makes it one of the best cryptos to invest in for 2025 . If you’re bullish on Telegram’s role in expanding crypto adoption, Toncoin is a no-brainer. Celestia (TIA): Pioneering Modular Blockchains Celestia is rewriting the rules of blockchain design with its modular approach. Traditional blockchains often face bottlenecks because they handle everything—data availability, execution, and consensus—on a single layer. Celestia breaks this mold by separating these functions, allowing developers to create highly customizable and scalable blockchain applications. 2024 was a landmark year for Celestia, with the launch of several projects leveraging its infrastructure for modular dApps. This architecture reduces costs and improves efficiency, making it a game-changer for developers. As the demand for scalable blockchain solutions grows, Celestia is perfectly positioned to lead the charge. For those looking to the future, TIA is an excellent pick. Its focus on innovation and developer-friendly tools makes it one of the best cryptos to invest in for 2025 . Whether you’re a developer or an investor, Celestia’s potential to reshape the blockchain landscape is hard to ignore. Ready to Make Your Move? Qubetics, Toncoin, and Celestia represent the best of what crypto has to offer in 2025. Qubetics is making crypto usable for everyone, from freelancers to multinational corporations. Toncoin is leveraging Telegram’s vast user base to bring decentralized tools to the masses. And Celestia is breaking new ground in blockchain scalability with its modular design. Together, these projects cover key areas of innovation, usability, and growth potential. They’re not just the best cryptos to invest in for 2025 —they’re your roadmap to long-term success in the crypto space. Don’t let January’s opportunities pass you by.

37684572,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374569,1734290102,New Slashing Mechanism in ELIP-002 Enhances Accountability Across EigenLayer Ecosystem,"Leading Ethereum’s re-staking protocol, EigenLayer has unveiled its second EigenLayer Improvement Proposal (ELIP-002). The latest move is expected to be a significant step towards accountability and operational efficiency in its ecosystem. EigenLayer Releases ELIP-002 According to the official post , the proposal introduces a penalty mechanism, known as slashing, alongside two innovative concepts: Unique Stake and Operator Sets. Together, these features empower Application Verification Services (AVSs) to enforce credible commitments by penalizing operators who fail to meet their service obligations. Slashing serves as a deterrent against operational shortcomings such as computational errors or service downtime. Through Unique Stake, AVSs can differentiate and allocate specific stakes for operators, allowing tailored penalties in proportion to the severity of their failures. Meanwhile, Operator Sets categorizes operators into manageable groups, simplifying the enforcement of slashing rules and ensuring seamless implementation across diverse services. The introduction of ELIP-002 signifies a major upgrade for the EigenLayer ecosystem. By providing AVSs with tools to reward compliance and penalize noncompliance, this framework promotes fair execution and reliability within the network. This enhancement aims to strengthen user trust in EigenLayer’s decentralized architecture while maintaining transparency and flexibility in its evolving protocol. The proposal has invited community feedback. “With the release of the Slashing ELIP, we’re inviting everyone in the EigenLayer community to participate by reviewing the proposal and sharing your feedback in the comments below (or on Github). Your input will help us refine the proposal to ensure it aligns with user needs and expectations.” EigenLayer Ecosystem Developments Restaking has emerged as a crucial model for blockchain security, allowing protocols to rely on restaked assets instead of launching native tokens. This reduces entry barriers for DApps while fueling innovation. DeFiLlama reports around $27 billion in TVL across restaking protocols, with EigenLayer leading the space by contributing over $18 billion, according to DeFiLlama. The latest development coincided with the Eigen Foundation pledging 1% of its EIGEN token supply to the Protocol Guild, a collective supporting Ethereum Layer 1 R&D. As recently reported, this initiative aligns with EigenLayer’s mission of strengthening Ethereum’s security through restaking. The Protocol Guild’s 180+ members from 29 teams focus on critical development areas, ensuring Ethereum’s resilience and long-term sustainability.

With the RSI around 43 and a low stochastic of about 15, there's room for the price to climb. If UNI surpasses the nearest resistance at $23.88, it could target the next level at $30.92, marking a significant gain from current prices.

37684761,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627831,1734289829,Will Michael Saylor partner with MARA?,"Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) could team up, combining MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings with MARA’s mining skills. While nothing official has been announced, their shared focus on Bitcoin and Saylor’s strong belief in its future suggest that a partnership could help both companies. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) are two key players in the Bitcoin space. Recently, Saylor mentioned that MARA could be the next Bitcoin partner, while Fred Thiel wished him for a partnership with Nasdaq 100. This has led to speculations that the two companies might partner in the future. While no official partnership has been announced, the idea of Saylor teaming up with MARA is quite interesting. Saylor is making his company a major player in the cryptocurrency market. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has bought over 423,000 BTC, worth about $41.5 billion, using traditional financial methods. This strategy has helped position MicroStrategy as a key player in the Bitcoin world. Possible partnership between MicroStrategy and MARA Saylor believes in Bitcoin’s future and encourages other companies to do the same. Recently, he suggested that MARA could be the next Bitcoin-related company to join the Nasdaq 100in his X post. Saylor is in a position to form partnerships that could help Bitcoin to gain more mainstream adoption. MARA, led by Fred Thiel, has also made great progress in the Bitcoin world. As one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies, MARA recently bought over 11,000 BTC in December, showing its strong commitment to Bitcoin. This move shows that MARA is working hard to become a leader in Bitcoin mining. Although MARA’s market value is smaller than MicroStrategy’s, it has been growing fast, with its stock up nearly 17% in the last six months. MARA’s focus on Bitcoin and its recent investments show it has the potential to become a big player in the crypto market. In response to Saylor’s prediction, Fred Thiel said, “We’re working hard to get there,” showing that MARA is expected to reach the same level of success as MicroStrategy. Saylor’s influence and the way MicroStrategy and MARA are both focused on Bitcoin; a partnership between the two could still happen. While MicroStrategy focuses on buying Bitcoin and MARA focuses on mining it, they could work well together in several ways. The former MicroStrategy CEO believes it’s important to dominate Bitcoin, and a partnership could help both companies make a bigger impact in the industry. A partnership between Saylor’s MicroStrategy and MARA would show the market that more big companies are getting serious about Bitcoin.

The launch has generated significant excitement within the cryptocurrency community. However, it has raised some questions, as some community members have noticed RLUSD listings with significantly high prices. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has issued a critical warning regarding potential price fluctuations during the early stages of its release. As RLUSD goes live, there may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes. There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD. Tools will show you the highest price anyone is willing to pay, even if it's just for a… https://t.co/LOx4rGiiiJ — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 15, 2024 Stablecoins are designed to maintain a consistent value, typically pegged to a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar. However, Schwartz cautioned that in the initial days of RLUSD’s launch, supply shortage could temporarily disrupt its price stability. “Short-term changes in prices due to shortages of supply or demand are certainly possible, especially around launch,” he stated, emphasizing that such deviations should not last long. $1200 for RLUSD? Schwartz highlighted an unusual scenario where someone wanted to pay as much as $1,200 per RLUSD for a fraction of a unit. This inflated price likely reflects the excitement surrounding the launch rather than the stablecoin’s value. “Tools will show you the highest price anyone is willing to pay, even if it’s just for a tiny bit,” Schwartz explained. He speculated that such behavior might stem from the desire to claim the symbolic honor of being the first to buy the stablecoin. The excitement is palpable in the community, escalating with the recent creation of Trustlines for RLUSD. As a result, behavior like this is expected, but Schwartz advises caution. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple CTO Assures Community of RLUSD’s Stability Despite this potential volatility, Schwartz reassured the community that the market would stabilize quickly once supply meets demand. “Rest assured, the price will come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. If it doesn’t, something is very seriously wrong,” he warned. The CTO also discouraged speculative behavior, particularly the tendency to act on fear of missing out (FOMO). He reiterated one of the purposes of a stablecoin, which is to maintain a steady price, and that investing in RLUSD isn’t an opportunity to get rich. RLUSD’s approval from the NYDFS marks a significant milestone for Ripple , as the company aims to establish a compliant and reliable stablecoin that can serve a wide range of use cases, from payments to remittances. However, investors must be cautious so they don’t overpay and lose money on RLUSD. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

As new developers explore the space, the number of full-time roles has decreased and significant regional shifts have occurred as Asia has emerged as a dominant hub for crypto development. Despite 39,148 new developers entering the crypto space in 2024, the total number of developers working in the industry decreased by 7% YoY. However, the ecosystem saw record activity from established developers (those with two or more years of experience), whose numbers increased by 27% year-over-year (YoY) and accounted for 70% of all code submissions. Asia has overtaken North America as the top region for crypto developers in 2024, marking a major shift in the industry’s geographic landscape. India played a key role in this shift, adding the largest number of new crypto developers during the year. While the United States remains the leading country with a 19% developer share, this figure is down significantly from 38% in 2015. North America currently ranks third in developer share behind Asia and Europe. Related News: 14 Altcoins Most Traded by South Koreans in the Last 24 Hours Revealed Ethereum continues to dominate as the top ecosystem for developer activity on every continent. Specifically, Base, an Ethereum layer-2 solution, accounted for 42% of all new code written in the Ethereum ecosystem in 2024. Meanwhile, Solana emerged as the leading ecosystem for attracting new developers, growing 83% YoY. Developers are increasingly working on a variety of blockchain platforms. One in three developers now contribute to more than one chain, up from less than 10% in 2015. Bitcoin has also maintained a stable developer base, with 42% focusing on scaling solutions like the Lightning Network. Crypto activity now spans all time zones, reflecting truly global adoption. Stablecoin transactions remained consistent during Asian, European, and African business hours, increasing by 2-3% during these periods. Meanwhile, NFT trading peaked during American business hours, while minting activity increased during Asian business hours, highlighting regional differences in crypto use cases. *This is not investment advice.

37684128,https://nulltx.com/?p=135759,1734289211,"Web3Bay Drives User-Led Market Evolution, While ICP Growth Powers DeFi & TRON Adopts Chainlink","The Web3 sector is expanding, with the Internet Computer (ICP) experiencing significant growth fueled by demand for interoperable DeFi solutions. Simultaneously, TRON’s latest updates emphasize its commitment to enhancing its $7 billion DeFi ecosystem with a new Chainlink integration. Amidst this evolving landscape, Web3Bay is introducing a novel, user-governed model to Web3 and e-commerce. Its 3BAY token, currently at $0.003 in its initial presale phase, facilitates transactions, rewards user interaction, and supports governance, establishing a new paradigm for secure, community-driven digital marketplaces. Internet Computer (ICP) Growth Catalyzed by DeFi Applications The growth of the Internet Computer (ICP) is characterized by a surge in network activity, primarily due to increasing demand for interoperable decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Over the past year, the integration of ICP’s Chain Fusion feature has led to a 13-fold increase in activity, facilitating smooth integrations with Bitcoin and Ethereum and drawing more DeFi projects. Despite this increased network activity, ICP’s market price has remained subdued, hovering below critical technical thresholds with a neutral market outlook. With support levels around $6.7, there could be potential for a market rebound, though broader market trends will likely dictate its trajectory. TRON Updates: Enhanced $7B Ecosystem through Chainlink Integration Recent TRON updates highlight a strategic emphasis on fortifying its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, notably through integrating Chainlink. This collaboration brings Chainlink’s Oracle Data Feeds into TRON’s SCALE program, improving data precision for DeFi applications and supporting a network with over $7 billion in total value locked (TVL). With a rise in transaction volumes and ongoing strategic initiatives, TRON is positioning itself as a formidable player in the decentralized finance sector. These developments are part of TRON’s broader strategy to secure a competitive position in the rapidly growing DeFi landscape amid shifting crypto market dynamics. Web3Bay Innovates User-Governed E-Commerce Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce with its decentralized platform, empowering users to control their data and influence the platform’s future. In contrast to conventional online marketplaces, which centralize data and decision-making, Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and user-centric governance. This model grants users a significant role in guiding platform developments, positioning Web3Bay as a distinct and reliable venue for digital commerce At the heart of Web3Bay’s ecosystem lies the 3BAY token, which not only facilitates transactions and incentivizes engagement but also provides governance rights to its holders. Priced at $0.003 during its first presale phase, the 3BAY token aims to reward early adopters with advantageous pricing and governance privileges that enhance the shopping experience. Anticipating a 6430% return on investment (ROI) at launch, the 3BAY token offers early investors a considerable growth opportunity. As Web3Bay continues to attract attention, the demand for 3BAY is expected to rise, potentially increasing its value for early participants. This presale period presents a timely opportunity for investors to engage with Web3Bay’s visionary approach to e-commerce. Key Insights As Web3 transforms digital interactions, entities like Internet Computer, TRON, and Web3Bay are at the forefront, introducing novel opportunities. With ICP’s growth driven by demand for cross-chain DeFi solutions and TRON’s ecosystem strengthened by recent updates, these platforms are marking a new era for Web3. However, it’s Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model that distinguishes it. With the 3BAY token priced at $0.003 in its first presale stage and an anticipated 6430% ROI by the final stage, early investors have a strategic advantage. For those eager to engage with the emerging realms of Web3 and e-commerce, Web3Bay represents an attractive starting point.

The company has just announced a token airdrop exclusively for users of Solayer , a decentralized cloud infrastructure that powers staking and restacking on Solana. Solayer is advancing staking and network scalability with high transaction throughput and yield-bearing solutions like USD, a stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasury bills. This initiative acknowledges the early support of Solayer delegators and highlights Sonic’s leadership in the emerging restacking landscape. Sonic SVM and the Upcoming Airdrop Sonic SVM is the first Solana Virtual Machine chain, designed to power games and applications. It runs on Sonic HyperGrid, an innovative framework for orchestrating optimistic Solana rollups. Sonic is also home to SonicX, the industry’s first Web3 TikTok-like application layer to onboard the next billion users. Doing this requires user-focused campaigns, rewards, and functionality, and the upcoming token airdrop will be used to do just that. The airdrop will allocate a portion of Sonic’s forthcoming token supply to users who have delegated their SOL or eligible Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to Sonic’s Actively Validated Service (AVS) on Solayer. A snapshot capturing eligible delegations will be taken before Sonic’s highly anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE), scheduled for Q1 2025. This opportunity extends beyond direct stakers to include users participating through protocols powered by Solayer, such as Adrastea, a cutting-edge liquid restaking protocol that maximizes capital efficiency in DeFi. It allows users to retain liquidity while unlocking additional rewards, setting new standards for composability and ease of use in the Solana ecosystem. “By rewarding Solayer delegators and Adrastea participants, we’re incentivizing broader participation while ensuring our earliest supporters share in Sonic’s growth,” Chris Zhu, CEO of Sonic, s a id in a statement. “This airdrop is a testament to our commitment to empowering the community that has been instrumental in advancing Sonic’s AVS.” A Collaborative Ecosystem Gaining Momentum With $80 million in SOL delegated by over 81,000 unique users, Sonic has emerged as the largest Actively Validated Service on Solayer. Meanwhile, Solayer itself is flourishing, with over $360 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and growing adoption across the DeFi ecosystem. The partnership between Sonic and Solayer has introduced new possibilities for stakers, offering liquidity through Liquid Restaking Tokens that can be utilized in DeFi platforms like Banx, Orca, and Meteora. This synergy not only secures TVL for Sonic but also provides restakers with the flexibility to access liquidity without sacrificing yield. Adrastea, a key player in this ecosystem, further amplifies the benefits by enabling users to maximize rewards and capital efficiency through liquid restaking. It bridges the gap between network security and user convenience by simplifying the staking process and unlocking additional value. Driving the Future of Restaking The airdrop announcement arrives at a pivotal moment for the Solana ecosystem. Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) now boast a market capitalization of over $2 billion, underscoring their growing importance in decentralized finance. Initiatives like Sonic’s token rewards not only validate the role of restaking but also catalyze broader adoption by offering tangible incentives to participants.“Community-focused initiatives like these are key to energizing the restaking ecosystem,” Zhu added . “By integrating rewards seamlessly with Solayer and Adrastea’s user-friendly platforms, we’re making it simpler than ever for delegators to track their contributions and reap the benefits.”",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | SOL | AIRDROP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/sonic-and-solayer-team-up-to-reward-community-stakeholders/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The bank has reportedly completed the Proof of Concept (PoC) for its Wholesale digital rupiah Cash Ledger. This marks a key step in developing the nation’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This achievement, part of the ambitious Project Garuda, marks the first phase of a multi-stage roadmap toward digital financial innovation. The Immediate State: A New Chapter for Digital Rupiah Governor Perry Warjiyo unveiled this milestone as the completion of the “Immediate State,” the foundational phase of the digital rupiah journey. As Indonesia’s sole currency issuer, the Bank of Indonesia launched this initiative to keep pace with the rapid growth of digital finance. This ensures that the Rupiah remains relevant in a modern, digital economy. In an official statement, Warjiyo emphasized the central bank’s commitment to meeting the needs of a growing digital economy. He affirmed efforts to keep the Rupiah relevant in the digital age. The PoC: Laying the Technical Foundation The Proof of Concept (PoC) tested how well digital rupiah could work using distributed ledger technology (DLT). Bank Indonesia economist Fransiskus Xaverius Tyas Prasaja led the testing of two key distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms. This includes R3’s Corda and Kaleido’s Hyperledger Besu. The evaluation covered 55 scenarios to assess their performance in handling issuance, redemption, and fund transfers. These tests ensured the platforms could meet the technical needs of the digital rupiah initiative. The results showed that both platforms met the technical requirements and worked well with traditional systems and the ISO 20022 standard. Smart contracts performed exceptionally, improving transaction speed and flexibility. This success highlights the platforms’ potential for future upgrades. It also lays a solid foundation for advancing the digital Rupiah initiative. Notably, Project Garuda’s journey is still ongoing. Bank Indonesia’s “ Project Garuda: Navigating the Rupiah Digital Architecture” whitepaper outlines two upcoming phases. This includes the Intermediate State and the End State. The next stages will focus on improving privacy, managing liquidity, and using multi-validator systems. These efforts aim to strengthen the operational framework of digital rupiah. A Global Vision for the Digital Rupiah The digital rupiah is designed to be more than just a local currency. Bank Indonesia plans to integrate it with current payment systems and financial networks, supporting local and cross-border transactions. This vision supports global goals of connecting digital economies while keeping control of national currencies. Indonesia’s latest progress positions it as a key player in the fast-growing digital financial landscape. This comes as nations around the world race to develop their own CBDCs. With its advanced technology and clear strategy, Indonesia is positioning itself as a leader in digital currency innovation.

There’s a new feline meme coin in town, and it’s not afraid of slapping you out of the way. Catslap ($SLAP) is sending big waves through the crypto industry this week as its free flow of market-moving developments continues. Its new Zealy social quests campaign and airdrop pack a punch that could send Catslap well beyond the $0.1 mark in 2025. Currently trading at $0.004891, Catslap has soared 967% since CoinMarketCap began tracking its data on 21 November. Despite that, it currently holds a $21 million market cap, leaving room for more than a 50x gain to catch Popcat’s current valuation. The project has just officially launched season 1 of its Slap-to-Earn campaign. Slap the celebrity of your choice enough times on the project’s minigame, and you’ll be one of ten winners in the project’s $100K prize pool. For everyone else, there’s a Catslap airdrop where rewards are proportional to your score on the Catslap Slapometer leaderboard. There is also a Zealy community social campaign where users can generate more points. Zealy Social Quests Will Send $SLAP To The Moon The Catslap team underlined that the addition of Zealy quests aims to strengthen its holder metrics, demonstrating to top exchanges like Coinbase that it’s ready for the A-league. Quests will reward Catslap community members for being active on social media, which will spread the project’s word and expand its community. It’s a win-win. Those who complete the quests will earn additional points, lifting their position on the project’s leaderboard and gaining a bigger share of the $SLAP airdrop. Happy Friday, Degens Here's what you've been swapping this past week: $PEPE ( @pepecoineth ) $SLAP ( @CatSlapToken ) $SHIB ( @Shibtoken ) $DSYNC ( @DestraNetwork ) $HEX ( @HEXcrypto ) pic.twitter.com/w0qy9Zm6qZ — MetaMask (@MetaMask) December 6, 2024 Get The Most From Catslap With Best Wallet As a part of Catslap’s partnership with Best Wallet, all Slap-to-Earn participants must do their slapping activities from a Best Wallet account. You can create a new Best Wallet account or import an external wallet on the app. There’s a specific quest on Zealy to submit your wallet address. Make sure to do this carefully because it’s key to receiving your airdrop rewards. Comparing Zealy quests with the Catslap game, 1 Zealy XP equals 1,000 slaps. So, suppose you earned 10 XP, that’s equivalent to 10,000 slaps. The Zealy quests cover a wide range of angles – social media, on-chain, and secret code quests. Be sure to do them all to maximize your earning potential. For now, the Zealy quest leaderboard and the Slapomter leaderboard will remain separate, but the team is working on integrating Zealy results into the Slapometer leaderboard. Next CEX Listing Announcement in 6 days – $SLAP to Coinbase? The countdown is on for Catlsap’s next exchange listing. After a launch on MEXC sent the price to a new all-time high (ATH) last week, traders are unsurprisingly ecstatic about what could be next. With Coinbase listing Mog Coin, Moo Deng, Turbo, and Peanut the Squirrel this month, the community hopes that Catslap is next on its shopping list. Catslap ticks all the boxes top exchanges look for. It has a thriving community with 18.7K holders and $5.4 million in locked liquidity and has implemented burn and buyback mechanisms to bolster its supply and demand dynamics. So far, the team has burned over $730K worth of tokens and bought back $490K worth. Unlike many new meme coins on the market, Catlsap has avoided the boom-and-bust fate. Instead, it continues to press forward with new developments and a steadily increasing holder count. With that, the project is garnering attention from top analysts such as ClayBro, who recently said it could “become the most viral meme coin” and potentially 100x in 2025. How to Buy Catslap Tokens Investors can purchase Catslap tokens via the project’s website using its DEX widget, Uniswap, or the Best Wallet app. The project has been audited by Solid Proof and also has a DEXTools reliability score of 99/100.

Thank you all for joining us on this journey—it’s going to be a wild ride! pic.twitter.com/O6aMOfaha8 — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 5, 2024 But with thousands – if not millions – of buyers missing out on presale tokens, there were queues of people eager to buy $PEPU the second it hit exchanges. On the same day that $PEPU went live on exchanges (10 December), the team officially launched the Pepe layer 2 blockchain without a hitch. PEPE UNCHAINED L2 IS LIVE! Yesterday’s launch went off without a hitch. Our L2 network handled the massive volume effortlessly and is now ready to welcome the masses! Check out our official block explorer, Pepuscan, and witness this greatness firsthand.… pic.twitter.com/0EJ7itirOz — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 11, 2024 This only strengthened demand for the Pepe Unchained token, causing its price to skyrocket 500% in three days. It has already overtaken the market cap of Coinbase-listed Moo Deng and the viral meme token Just a chill guy. And because the Pepe Unchained presale price gradually increased throughout the ICO, early investors now sit comfortably on 10x gains. Are These the Next Meme Coin Gems? $PEPU shows no signs of slowing down, but diversification is key in crypto. That’s why top traders recommend alternatives that could offer a Pepe rerun, going from presale prospect to meme coin king. Currently, Crypto All-Stars and Wall Street Pepe are the two most promising meme coin presales for 10x-100x gains. Also, Flockerz has shown a considerable uptick in demand since Pepe Unchained’s IEO. Let’s take a closer look at each. Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars will launch on exchanges in seven days after raising over $14 million during its presale. The project is building a unified staking protocol that lets users earn passive income on their meme coins. It will begin by supporting 11 top projects, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Brett, Mog Coin and Bonk. The All-Stars have taken over! With 14 million raised and over 1 million raised per day in the past 2 days, this looks like complete All-Star domination! pic.twitter.com/c26W55xXKD — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 12, 2024 At a time when meme coin prices are soaring, traders will be looking for ways to compound their profits. Crypto All-Stars staking is the perfect solution. But here’s the kicker: to get rewards, users must maximize the amount of $STARS tokens they hold. This incentivizes holders of all the top meme coin to buy as much $STARS as possible. Pepe Unchained shook the market with the first meme coin-themed Ethereum layer 2 blockchain. Now Crypto All-Stars is looking to do the same by allowing meme coin fans to earn income on their assets for the first time. The project has already been noticed by top analysts. For instance, Crypto Chester told Cryptonews YouTube subscribers that the token could 100x after the ICO. The analyst underscored that Crypto All-Stars’ momentum is ramping up as the exchange launch date nears, showing brewing excitement that could lead to a parabolic rally. But with just seven days until the presale ends, prospective buyers must act fast. Visit Crypto All-Stars Presale Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe has just experienced the most successful day of any ICO in 2024. It raised a staggering $6 million in 24 hours, showing an incredible demand among traders. Remember, it took Pepe Unchained one month to raise $6 million – and that became the biggest ICO of 2024. With that, we could well see Wall Street Pepe surpass Pepe Unchained’s ICO efforts and potentially provide bigger gains once it lists on exchanges. https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1863905080426058015 So, what’s all the hype about? Like Pepe Unchained, Wall Street Pepe is riding the viral allure of Pepe coin while ushering in innovative utility. The project also combines the Pepe coin aura with the electric energy of Wolf of Wall Street, creating distinctive branding which aligns with its goal: to create an army of degen crypto millionaires. And they’re not just dreaming. The project is equipping its community with institutional-grade tools such as trading signals, meme coin picks, alpha calls, trading rewards, and staking. Analyst ClayBro says that this could be the next 100x breakout meme coin, highlighting that it is already surpassing Pepe Unchained’s growth. The Wall Street Pepe presale is raising funds at an unprecedented rate. That means that those yet to buy should act quickly so they don’t miss out. Visit Wall Street Pepe Presale Flockerz Flockerz is a new meme coin that zeros in on decentralization. It creates a new incentivization system for the project’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). $FLOCK holders can vote on all decisions relating to the project’s future via the DAO, removing control from the core team. The voters will even earn extra $FLOCK tokens for doing so, which encourages community participation and makes the decision-making process more decentralized. Analysts believe that this concept could catch fire. Jacob Bury appeared on the 99Bitcoins YouTube channel and said $FLOCK could 100x in price. The presale has raised $6.1 million so far and is currently priced at $0.0063754. However, this price will rise in two days.

37682551,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393366,1734285975,The Blockchain Bridging AI and Crypto: Could This Be the Most Innovative Platform of 2024 and Beyond?,"The post The Blockchain Bridging AI and Crypto: Could This Be the Most Innovative Platform of 2024 and Beyond? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto world is abuzz with speculation about a new blockchain platform that claims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency. As the integration of these two transformative technologies becomes increasingly sought after, this project could set a new standard for innovation, scalability, and real-world application. If the early buzz is any indication, 2024 might mark the beginning of a new era in decentralized technology. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale What makes this blockchain so special, and why is it generating so much excitement? Let’s explore. Why AI and Blockchain Integration Matters AI and blockchain are two of the most disruptive technologies of the 21st century. Their convergence could amplify their individual strengths while solving key challenges in both domains: Transparency in AI: Blockchain’s immutable ledgers can make AI models and decisions more traceable, reducing bias and improving accountability. Privacy for Sensitive Data: AI requires vast amounts of data, often raising concerns about privacy. A decentralized blockchain architecture can allow secure, private data sharing for AI processing. Efficiency and Automation: AI can optimize blockchain operations, from consensus mechanisms to smart contract execution, enabling faster and more scalable systems. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale This synergy creates the foundation for smarter, faster, and more secure decentralized applications (dApps) that have the potential to redefine industries. A Revolutionary Platform In The Making The blockchain at the center of this conversation is rumored to feature unprecedented innovations that could elevate it above its competitors. While specific details are being closely guarded, reports suggest it has several standout features: 1. AI-Optimized Consensus Mechanism The platform allegedly employs a new type of consensus mechanism—possibly called Proof of Intelligence (PoI)—that utilizes AI tasks to validate transactions. This approach reduces energy consumption while ensuring network security and scalability. Lightchain Protocol AI Pres a le 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM is said to be a cutting-edge environment specifically designed to handle AI-centric computations. This allows developers to create dApps that leverage AI for real-time analytics, decision-making, and automation. 3. Native Scalability Unlike Ethereum and other blockchains that rely on Layer 2 solutions to handle scalability, this platform is built with scalability as a core feature. Early tests reportedly indicate it can handle high transaction volumes without sacrificing decentralization or speed. 4. Environmentally Friendly Design By using AI to streamline operations and reduce computational waste, this blockchain aims to be one of the most eco-friendly platforms on the market, addressing a critical concern for the industry. Game-Changing Use Cases The possibilities of a blockchain that integrates AI are vast, with applications spanning multiple industries: Decentralized AI Models: Nodes on the network can collaborate to train AI models securely, preserving data privacy through federated learning. Smart Supply Chains: AI-powered analytics can optimize supply chain operations while blockchain ensures transparency and traceability. Personalized Finance: AI can enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms by providing tailored recommendations and automating investment strategies. Healthcare Innovation: Secure data sharing and AI insights could revolutionize patient care and research collaboration. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Race For Innovation In 2024 As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the pressure is on for platforms to differentiate themselves. Ethereum and Solana currently dominate the conversation, but this new project’s unique blend of AI and blockchain could disrupt the status quo. Its ability to address longstanding challenges—like scalability, energy efficiency, and real-world applicability—positions it as a strong contender to become the standout platform of 2024. What’s Next for the Industry? If this blockchain delivers on its promises, it could usher in a new wave of innovation and adoption in both the crypto and AI spaces. For investors and developers, it represents an exciting opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially revolutionary project. For the blockchain industry as a whole, it signals the start of a new chapter—one where AI and crypto converge to unlock unprecedented possibilities. The blockchain bridging AI and crypto may be the missing piece in the puzzle of true decentralized innovation. Its ability to combine the strengths of these two transformative technologies makes it a project worth watching closely. As more details emerge, the crypto community will no doubt be eager to see if it can live up to the hype.

At some point, the price correlation between the Dogecoin price and that of Bitcoin was at 0.97. Related Reading: Travala (AVA) Rally: Binance Early Bet And CZ’s Nod Drive 300% Growth Interestingly, recent market movements have seen the Bitcoin price returning above the $100,000 price level again, with the leading cryptocurrency reaching as high as 102,700 in the past 24 hours. However, this has yet to translate into a corresponding increase in the price of Dogecoin, with the meme coin breaking below support at $0.4 in the same timeframe. Dogecoin’s Recent Performance Amid Bitcoin’s Surge Bitcoin has once again surpassed the psychological $100,000 threshold after a 7.5% price increase since a $94,900 low on December 10. Notably, this upward movement is the latest recovery for Bitcoin after a rejection at the $100,000 price level that sent shockwaves of liquidations among other cryptocurrencies. But while Bitcoin has shown resilience, Dogecoin has faced notable challenges in sustaining its upward momentum. Dogecoin managed to rally to $0.48 on December 8, which is a level it hadn’t touched since 2021. However, a detailed examination of the meme coin’s price action reveals a recurring struggle with the $0.48 resistance level, which now seems to be the resistance level to break this market cycle. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.395, meaning it has lost about 17% since it reached this 2024 high of $0.48. As it stands, Dogecoin is down by about 13% in the past seven days, making it the worst performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap in this timeframe. Is A New Dogecoin All-Time High Still Possible This Cycle? Market analysts have provided different predictions regarding the possibility and timelines of the Dogecoin price to achieve a new all-time high in the current cycle. ogecoin last reached its peak price of $0.73 during the crypto bull run of May 2021. The prospect of breaking above this level this cycle is still there, but the path forward appears challenging, especially if the Dogecoin price were to continue detaching from Bitcoin’s rally. However, you could argue that the general consensus is for Dogecoin to resume its uptrend anytime soon. Historically, Dogecoin’s price surges have been due to sudden spikes in retail investor activity, often due to rumors on social media like payments on X and things of that nature. For Dogecoin to surpass its 2021 high, a similar wave of enthusiasm would need to emerge with significant trading volume and renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors.

This comes as governments, namely the United States, Japan, and Russia, are racing to integrate Bitcoin into their national financial arsenals, raising the stakes in the global race for crypto dominance. America sets the pace US President-elect Donald Trump has announced plans to create a national Bitcoin reserve with an ambitious goal: acquire one million Bitcoin within five years. This strategy wants to address the ballooning $35 trillion national debt and reposition America as a leader in the digital economy. To kickstart this plan, the US already has a decent head start. Federal agencies hold roughly 200,000 Bitcoin, confiscated from criminal activities and currently valued at $20 billion. Senator Cynthia Lummis is leading the legislative push for Bitcoin reserves, introducing the BITCOIN Act to Congress. This legislation not only backs Trump’s vision but also positions Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. Lummis sees Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial instability and a necessary tool for economic resilience. Japan eyes Bitcoin as a financial lifeline Japan is crafting its own Bitcoin narrative. Satoshi Hamada, a crypto-loving lawmaker, has called for converting a portion of Japan’s foreign reserves into Bitcoin. His argument is that Bitcoin is an opportunity to break free from the constraints of traditional currencies like the US dollar and yen. Hamada believes this could boost Japan’s financial independence and drive innovation in blockchain technology. But there’s a twist. The proposal doesn’t come with widespread political backing. His party holds just two seats in parliament, but his ideas are gaining traction among lawmakers keen to modernize Japan’s financial strategy. The government, though, hasn’t officially endorsed anything yet. Russia uses Bitcoin to fight sanctions Meanwhile, Russia, under the weight of crippling Western sanctions, sees Bitcoin as a lifeline. Anton Tkachev, a lawmaker, proposed creating a national Bitcoin reserve to shield the country’s economy from external pressures. He explained that Bitcoin offers an alternative to traditional currencies, which have become geopolitical weapons in the hands of Western countries like America and the UK. The Russian government is slowly warming up to the idea. Recent changes in crypto regulation include tax exemptions on Bitcoin transactions and the legalization of mining activities in certain regions. Also, as we reported, president Vlad Putin signed a law declaring crypto as “legal property” just a few weeks ago. All of these are laying the groundwork for a more Bitcoin-friendly economy. Tkachev sees Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a tool for maintaining financial stability in the face of geopolitical uncertainty. The US dollar, long the global reserve currency, is now facing a decentralized challenger. Some analysts are calling this a “crypto cold war.” The risks of adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset For all the hype though, Bitcoin isn’t a magic bullet. Its notorious price volatility makes it a risky choice for economies. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated by as much as 65%, far higher than traditional reserve assets like gold or USD. A sudden drop could destabilize a country’s economy terribly, turning Bitcoin from an asset into a liability and undoing years of tireless work to prove itself. There’s also the regulatory nightmare. Establishing a national Bitcoin reserve requires a complete overhaul of existing financial policies. There is no way that would be easy. Governments will need to get through many complex legal frameworks, address concerns about money laundering, and earn public trust in what is still a relatively new and misunderstood asset class.

According to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock executive Jay Jacobs says the asset management titan is now focusing on its BTC and ETH ETFs due to the demand they’re receiving rather than launching altcoin ETFs. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially Ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own (IBIT and ETHA) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new altcoin ETFs).” At time of writing, the data shows that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) has $54.38 billion in net assets while the firm’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) has about $3.84 billion. Both ETFs launched earlier this year, with IBIT making its debut in January while ETHA rolled out in July. IBIT is trading for $57.80 at time of writing while ETHA is moving for $29.71. Balchunas also reports that Mike Venuto of the Tidal Financial Group – a leading financial services and ETF investment platform – says that Bitcoin is becoming increasingly intertwined with options strategies. “We have people coming to us all the time trying to pitch ‘Bitcoin + something else’ ETFs… Every options strategy you can think of is going to be tied to Bitcoin, Nvidia, Tesla and MicroStrategy in ETFs. It’s coming.” The top crypto asset by market is trading for $101,895 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

37682238,https://nulltx.com/?p=135769,1734285269,Polkadot’s Scalability Gains Traction While BONK and 1FUEL Lead Altcoin Market Discussions,"The cryptocurrency industry is always advancing. Investors are becoming increasingly focused on scalability solutions. Likewise, more altcoins are showing promising features. Polkadot, for example, is gaining popularity thanks to its creative scalability maneuver. On the other side of things, tokens like BONK and 1Fuel are becoming popular in altcoin market conversations. They provide interesting prospects for investors during the presale period. 1Fuel, for instance, forecasted to 100x after its public launch, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments of 2024. But what elements drive cryptocurrency exchange rates, and how do different wallets fit into this evolving ecosystem? Polkadot and its promise of scalability Scalability has long been an issue for many blockchain platforms, especially those competing with Bitcoin and Ether. Amidst these struggles, polkadot has emerged as a major player in addressing this issue, providing a multi-chain interoperability framework. Polkadot’s first initial coin offering (ICO) was held in October 2017, and the Polkadot price was $0.29, with 2.24 million tokens offered. The second ICO was held in July 2020 with a price offer of $1.25, and 342,080 DOT tokens were sold. Polkadot’s capacity to manage transactions across different blockchains gives it room to improve scalability in ways that other platforms find quite challenging. BONK: The Meme Coin That Refuses to Fade Amidst the several meme coins that recently gained popularity, BONK is at the forefront. The token has secured the spotlight after its unforeseen rise. This attracts both retail and institutional investors into its realm. According to the one-pager, BONK is the first dog-themed coin on Solana “for the people, by the people,” with 50% of the total supply of the cryptocurrency airdropped to the Solana community. What makes BONK unique is that nearly half of the total supply—50 trillion coins—is distributed among those who maintain the Solana blockchain and contribute to the development of the community in any way possible. Safe to say BONK is one of the best crypto investments going into 2025. 1FUEL: The Hidden Gem Leading Altcoin Discussions 1Fuel, on the flip side, is becoming a keen subject of interest to presale investors as it promises a comprehensive cross-chain transaction process. 1Fuel is set to become the next breakout cryptocurrency. Analysts are telling tales of its significant growth potential. They’re saying early investors in the presale phase could potentially achieve returns exceeding 500%. And with the current cryptocurrency exchange rates, Investors are looking at a grand slam home run. 1Fuel offers juicy staking rewards of up to 30% APR. This means you can earn passive income just by holding 1FUEL, literally turning your investment into a continuous revenue stream. All of this, however, is simply the tip of the iceberg regarding the innovation happening with 1Fuel. 1Fuel is currently in stage two of its roadmap. With over 60 million tokens sold, investors aren’t slowing down their roll in stacking up 1Fuel. Comparing Market Dynamics: Polkadot vs. BONK vs. 1FUEL As the market evolves, altcoins such as Polkadot, BONK, and 1FUEL will continue to gain traction for their distinctive features. BONK has introduced a meme-token culture, while Polkadot presents fresh solutions for multichain interoperability. For several investors, these altcoins speak to the future of cryptocurrency. 1Fuel, on the other hand, is in a league of its own. It’s cross-chain transactions are a game changer. No more juggling multiple wallets or paying extra network fees. 1FUEL handles everything in the background, so investors can trade seamlessly and hassle-free. Looking at it from a long-term POV, 1Fuel can be said to be one of the best crypto investments anyone can have. In Conclusion As Polkadot’s scalability solutions attract attention, altcoins like BONK and 1Fuel are also sitting in the spotlight. No one can stop the advancement of the crypto sphere.

During its short presale CYBRO has already gone a long way in achieving crucial milestones: CYBRO App Launched: Users can now explore around 30 vaults offering competitive annual percentage yields (APY) to match their investment strategies perfectly First One-Click Strategy Introduced: The Blast Index, available in the Vaults list and on the One-Click page, simplifies investing by integrating with lending protocols Rapid Development Progress: CYBRO’s platform has laid the groundwork for seamless DeFi experiences, setting the stage for future growth and innovation. And there’s more to come. CYBRO’s roadmap through 2025 promises features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and even smarter AI tools, cementing its place as a game-changer in decentralized finance. With the listing just around the corner, $CYBRO is about to make its mark on major exchanges with all the momentum it’s built so far, this token looks ready to take off. Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It enables developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work model. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially handling up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for Enhanced Scalability Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol that lets different blockchains communicate securely. It allows value and data to be shared between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot improves speed and scalability, handling more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within its network. Holders can take part in development decisions and help verify transactions. Created by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot aims to make blockchains more interconnected and efficient. Conclusion In conclusion, while established cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) have seen significant growth, their potential in the short term appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO offers a technologically advanced DeFi platform that provides investors with exceptional opportunities to maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features such as attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO delivers a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. By prioritizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO distinguishes itself as a promising project attracting strong interest from major investors and influencers. As the bullish market of 2024 unfolds, CYBRO is well-positioned to surpass its competitors by 2025.

37682096,https://nulltx.com/?p=135766,1734284994,Solana And Aptos Holders Are Targeting A Major Market Surge On This $0.06 AI Coin With 80x Potential,"Investors in Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) show interest in a new AI coin poised for a major surge in value. Selling for $0.06, this coin boasts the potential to deliver an eighty-fold return before the bull market ends. Given its utility-focused nature and AI-based niche, SOL and APT holders believe it could be the best AI coin to invest in. Let’s find out if this coin can achieve an 80x increase in value! Solana Becomes the Fastest-Growing Network Adopted By New Developers Solana has emerged as the fastest-developing blockchain of the year, and new developers are rushing to the platform. According to a report by Electric Capital on December 12, 2024, Solana has become the number one blockchain used by new crypto developers, with an 83% annual growth rate. The report showed that out of 39,184 registered developers, 7,625 built primarily on Solana. This figure places Solana ahead of Ethereum, which recorded only 6,456 new developers. This number has risen monumentally every year for the last few years. While Solana is dominating, an AI-powered platform has emerged on the scene to challenge it on the crypto stage, thanks to its innovative features. Meanwhile, Solana’s SOL trades at $227 , having lost 6.13% of its weekly price due to market volatility. Analyst Discusses Aptos’ Potential to Hit an ATH After a Bullish Market Surge TraderLenny, a crypto expert with over 40,000 followers on X, has weighed in on APT’s potential to reach an all-time high if it succeeds at a breakout. Lenny remarked on APT’s outlook in an X post on December 12, 2024, as the coin prepares for a market surge. His analysis whirls around APT’s strong weekly performance and investors buying the dip. Experts are monitoring Aptos’s current path to determine the potential levels it will reach in the near future after a successful upside breakout. APT might be gaining traction slowly, but investors are more interested in an AI coin since it offers better gains. With support at $9 and resistance at $13.50, Aptos is set for a rally to $18.50 if it successfully breaks out of this resistance, indicating a possible 37% market surge in its value. Presently, APT trades at $13.56 after a 5.72% daily gain. Investors Move to Explore the IntelMarkets Advanced Trading Platform Investors are slowly gravitating towards IntelMarkets’ advanced trading platform in an attempt to explore its offerings. The platform is considered one of the best places to trade cryptocurrencies. IntelMarkets (INTL) is rising in popularity for its many state-of-the-art features. One of them is its dual-chain structure. Backed by Ethereum and Solana, IntelMarkets is fast, secure, cost-friendly, and efficient. The platform also allows users to trade using automated self-learning robots. These robots are trained with over 350,000 data points, allowing them to identify potential opportunities in the market and take action on the user’s behalf. Also, traders can access up to 1,000x leverages on IntelMarkets to boost their potential returns from every trade. This allows them to maximize trading opportunities and profit massively from even the slightest price move in their direction. With all these features on its side, it will not be surprising to see IntelMarkets outshine top market players like Solana and Aptos in the near future. SOL and APT Investors Aim at INTL: Can This $0.06 AI Coin Soar 80x? SOL and APT investors are growing attracted to INTL and, as a result, have placed it on their radar. What makes the AI coin so attractive is experts’ 80x projection on the coin during the imminent market surge. INTL trades at $0.064 in Stage 7 of its public presale. It will deliver a 71% gain to new investors once it launches at $0.110. However, there is a huge possibility that INTL will rise 80x like its predecessors in the altcoin market. The imminent market surge will see the AI coin reach a remarkable height, making it a good crypto to buy.

Let's find out why analysts are confident in making staggering 50x predictions for this GambleFi startup. Litecoin (LTC) Loses 17% - When Will It Bounce? Litecoin has fallen by 0.6% today as it attempts to find a footing at $119. Despite a recent drop, the Litecoin monthly candle is still up an astonishing 48%, as Litecoin has risen from $73 in a matter of weeks. This brings the Litecoin market cap to over $8.28 billion and cements this legacy altcoin as the 22nd largest crypto asset in the space. Litecoin is often seen as the silver to Bitcoin's digital gold, a reputation that will likely launch Litecoin to new highs sometime in 2025. To do this, Litecoin will need to take out its previous record of $413 that it reached during the 2021 bull run. Anything is possible in crypto, but investors should be aware that there are faster horses in the race. Chainlink (LINK) Whales Offload At Resistance Chainlink has retained its place inside the CoinMarketCap top 15 crypto index by rising by 6% today to hit $29. Chainlink has been exceptionally bullish recently with a 65% gain made over the past 30 trading days. This has taken the Chainlink market cap up to $14.2 billion and confirmed Chainlink's place as the leading oracle platform in the crypto space. Chainlink analysts have expressed concern in recent weeks that Chainlink whales have been offloading on the current pump. This would suggest that the Chainlink markets have entered a period of distribution, which could send Chainlink below $17 in the short term. Community Wins Big As Rollblock (RBLK) Scales To Hit The Big Time In 2025 Rollblock ( RBLK ) continues to attract masses of interest to its highly disruptive presale offering as it takes on the enormous $450 billion online gambling industry at its own game. Rollblockuses the Ethereum blockchain to securely encrypt all transactions on-chain, meaning that there can be no allegations of bet-fixing or tampering on the Rollblock platform. Its 7,000 casino games are already live and generating massive income for Rollblock, in addition to the brand-new sports betting feature that is making waves in the crypto space and allows for real-time wagers to be placed on a massive variety of sporting tournaments. This comprehensive offering is likely the main driver behind Rollblock’s recent parabolic growth, which has seen this upstart market entrant take in more than $7 million in early-stage funding. RBLK is available exclusively from the presale page and is priced at just $0.0415. Each week masses of RBLK coins will be pulled from exchanges using Rollblock operating profits, as 60% of these buybacks are burned immediately and the remaining coins are given over to stakers in the community. Analysts are predicting fireworks as a parabolically rising demand will meet a dwindling supply over the coming months, ensuring explosive price action for this true game-changer of a project.

Posh cars, stacks of money, and beautiful women - that’s all for DOGEN holders who don’t settle for less. Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Next Power Play! PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched on Ethereum, it follows coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE has no transaction tax and keeps its meme identity without utility. It reached a market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, sparking interest in the crypto world. The roadmap aims to increase visibility through social media trends and exchange listings. It uses a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum's security. PEPE is available on Uniswap and major exchanges like Binance. Its deflationary model and strong community may make it attractive in the current market. Solana's SOL: A Fast Blockchain for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for high-speed transactions and scalability, providing a base for decentralized applications. Its native coin, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Solana stands out by avoiding sharding or second-layer solutions, focusing instead on a network capable of handling many transactions per second. This approach aims to attract developers and users looking for fast and efficient decentralized services. With its emphasis on speed and flexibility across programming languages, SOL and the Solana platform offer potential in supporting high-activity products and services in the current market. BONK: Solana's Shiba Inu Memecoin Empowering the Community BONK is a Solana-based memecoin with a Shiba Inu mascot that aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. It surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing and serves as a ""community coin,"" airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana's NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of memecoins, BONK's integration into the growing Solana ecosystem, including the launch of the decentralized exchange BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player. The coin looks attractive in the current market cycle. TRON (TRX): A Decentralized Platform Empowering Content Creators TRON (TRX) is a blockchain-based platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It aims to give digital content creators full ownership rights by allowing them to share content directly with consumers. Originally deployed as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, TRX migrated to its own network in 2018. The platform supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), enabling developers to build and deploy their projects. TRON uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin's UTXO, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. By eliminating intermediaries like YouTube or Apple, TRON seeks to reward content creators more fairly. Its focus on decentralization and direct content sharing continues to attract attention in the evolving market. Conclusion Tokens like PEPE, SOL, BONK, and TRX show less short-term potential. DOGEN, on the other hand, is designed for those seeking luxury and success. It is expected to grow by 700% by the end of the presale, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN offers real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters, building a community of market leaders.

Polygon's Transition Boosts the POL Forecast Polygon is in the spotlight as its migration from MATIC to POL progresses, marking a critical step in its 2.0 roadmap. This transition enhances Polygon’s position as a leading Ethereum scaling solution, with the POL forecast reflecting increased utility and adoption potential. POL serves as the native staking and gas token, streamlining operations across the Polygon ecosystem. The introduction of a 2% annual emission, split equally between validator rewards and a community treasury, strengthens network security and incentivizes development. Additionally, Polygon's AggLayer, a new protocol for aggregating zero-knowledge proofs across blockchains, promises to simplify interoperability—a key advantage in a multi-chain future. With rising institutional interest, including $65 million worth of POL recently acquired by large investors, and growing traction in DeFi, Polygon's upgrades are pushing the POL forecast to new highs. Could a Solana ETF Ignite the Next Rally? Solana has been gaining momentum as discussions about a potential Solana ETF circulate, sparking excitement among market participants. With a market cap surpassing $100 billion and SOL prices peaking at $214.06 in November 2024, the blockchain is riding high on adoption and innovation. The network continues to attract users, with unique addresses rising by 42% since September, crossing the 100 million mark. Solana’s Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism remains a standout feature, ensuring ultra-fast and cost-efficient transactions. Meanwhile, its ecosystem is diversifying, with projects like Pudgy Penguins launching the PENGU token on Solana, further boosting community engagement. As regulatory clarity improves and the possibility of a Solana ETF gains traction, SOL could solidify its position among the top-performing crypto assets in 2024. Key Takeaways Polygon’s transition to POL and a strong POL forecast highlights its focus on scaling Ethereum, while Solana’s growth, bolstered by the buzz around a potential Solana ETF, cements its place among popular crypto coins . However, BlockDAG’s unique approach is setting it apart as a top contender. The recent AMA featuring Maurice Herlihy, an expert with Harvard and MIT credentials, revealed how its hybrid blockchain-DAG model tackles key industry challenges. With over $165.5 million raised in its presale and the Whitepaper V3 promising further clarity, BlockDAG is positioned as a strong bet for those seeking a project with long-term potential.

Its native coin, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Solana stands out by avoiding sharding or second-layer solutions, focusing instead on a network capable of handling many transactions per second. This approach aims to attract developers and users looking for fast and efficient decentralized services. With its emphasis on speed and flexibility across programming languages, SOL and the Solana platform offer potential in supporting high-activity products and services in the current market. AVAX: Eco-Friendly Blockchain with Customizable Subnets and Rapid Transactions AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for its eco-friendly approach, low transaction fees, and a processing capability of 4,500 transactions per second. Avalanche utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, aiming for transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform comprises three interoperable chains: X-Chain for asset transfers, C-Chain for smart contracts, and P-Chain for network validation and Subnet creation. AVAX plays a pivotal role in the ecosystem, serving for transaction fees, network security through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. Its strong utility in payments, staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains highlights its potential in the blockchain space. Polkadot (DOT): Enhancing Interoperability and Scalability in Blockchain Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication among different blockchains. It allows value and data to be transferred across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. By employing parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking, allowing holders to participate in the network's development and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched on May 26, 2020. Polkadot's focus on interoperability and scalability may make it an attractive option in the cryptocurrency market and could impact its position in the current market cycle. Polygon (POL): Enhancing Ethereum with Speed and Lower Fees Polygon is a layer two solution for the Ethereum blockchain that makes transactions faster and fees lower. It works alongside Ethereum, allowing users to move assets to many applications at reduced costs. POL is Polygon's own cryptocurrency used for network fees, staking, and governance. The platform uses proof-of-stake, so users can earn by staking their POL. Validators keep the network secure and process transactions, while delegators can stake through trusted validators. Polygon's efficiency and low fees make it attractive for using DeFi protocols and other apps. In the current market cycle, its technology offers potential benefits that may appeal to users seeking scalable and accessible blockchain solutions. Conclusion While SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL may offer less short-term potential, DOGEN is designed for those seeking the best in life. With an expected 700% growth by the end of presale and potential for huge returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK. Building a community of leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

MIT Talent Maurice Herlihy Led AMA Pits BlockDAG Ahead of Ethereum Classic and Cronos,"Which crypto stands out as the best bet for 2025 amid market shifts? Cronos (CRO) has captured attention with its latest Pallene upgrade, boosting network efficiency and fueling optimism about its ecosystem. Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has seen renewed interest, driven by a recent price gain and its appeal to traditional miners. Yet, while these projects gain traction, BlockDAG appears to be the better contender for 2025. BlockDAG’s recent AMA highlighted its advanced Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, earning widespread acceptance within the community for their scalability and security. This technical edge, combined with its successful presale raising over $165.5 million, positions it as a standout choice. As debates around Cronos (CRO) price analysis and Ethereum Classic (ETC) price gain unfold, BlockDAG’s momentum signals a compelling alternative. BlockDAG: The Technological Edge You Can’t Afford to Miss BlockDAG's latest AMA has sparked intense interest, showcasing its technological strength and market readiness. Maurice Herlihy, a pioneer in distributed computing from MIT and Harvard, explained how the Phantom and GhostDAG protocols ensure scalability and speed. These advanced mechanisms replace the limitations of traditional blockchain consensus, allowing BlockDAG to handle more transactions without sacrificing security—a feature that positions it as a leader among blockchain projects. For the community, this means a network capable of powering high-demand applications, increasing the value of BDAG over time. BlockDAG's presale success is another signal of its potential. Raising over $165.5 million and attracting 170,000 unique holders, the project is fostering one of the fastest-growing communities in crypto. The BDAG250 bonus system has driven both participation and confidence, highlighting BlockDAG’s ability to incentivize early adopters. A strong community can amplify the demand for BDAG, creating value for those who invest now. The AMA also emphasized how BlockDAG is maturing into a well-rounded network. Features like EVM compatibility and quantum resistance show it’s designed for longevity and innovation. These strengths make it more than just another blockchain project—it’s a competitor capable of outperforming legacy networks like Ethereum Classic and Cronos. When evaluating the best crypto for 2025, BlockDAG stands out as a platform offering real utility and growth potential. From cutting-edge technology to a thriving ecosystem, every element points to increasing long-term value for BDAG buyers. Cronos (CRO) Price Analysis: What’s Driving the Momentum? Cronos (CRO) has gained attention following its recent Pallene upgrade, which introduced Block-STM technology to boost transaction speeds and scalability. With the ability to process up to 60,000 transactions per second, the upgrade positions Cronos as a network ready for next-generation blockchain applications, including AI-driven use cases. These advancements have also stirred optimism among traders, with CRO’s price stabilizing near $0.185. For those considering CRO, its enhanced technical capabilities could translate into greater network utility and long-term value growth. The recently unveiled 2025 roadmap has also fueled excitement. Plans to integrate stock and ETF trading, launch a Cronos stablecoin, and pursue a CRO token burn have bolstered market confidence. Coupled with the strong strategic partnerships, like Google Cloud joining as a validator, these moves make Cronos a network worth watching as it builds toward its ambitious goals. Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Gain: Can the Rally Continue? Ethereum Classic (ETC) recently captured market attention with a price gain that saw it reach $33.71, buoyed by Bitcoin’s milestone surge past $100,000. Known for its adherence to blockchain’s original principles of immutability and decentralization, ETC has remained a popular choice among miners following Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake. This renewed interest in ETC mining reinforces its relevance, with potential for sustained price growth as miner activity increases. Adding to the bullish sentiment, a recent “Golden Cross” in ETC’s price chart—where the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average—has hinted at possible further momentum. Analysts are optimistic about ETC’s ability to reach $40 if the trend holds, especially with rising network activity. For buyers, Ethereum Classic offers a mix of established security and growth potential, making it a project worth watching closely. Key Insights Cronos (CRO) is advancing with upgrades like Block-STM and a bold 2025 roadmap, offering utility-driven growth opportunities. Similarly, Ethereum Classic (ETC) continues to attract miners and traders, supported by a recent price gain and bullish technical indicators. However, BlockDAG stands apart as the best crypto for 2025 . The AMA showcased BlockDAG’s superior Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, which provide unmatched scalability and efficiency.

As major tokens break new records, attention turns to emerging projects that could offer substantial returns. The search is on for promising assets that stand out in the crowded market and may be poised for remarkable growth. XYZVerse (XYZ), an innovative memecoin blending sports enthusiasm with crypto culture, emerges as a strong contender. Aiming to surpass the impressive multi-thousand-percent gains of previous tokens, it unites fans across various sports in a vibrant community. The All-Sports Meme Token You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where degens can score big off the growing demand for meme coins Picture this: Polymarket hitting $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election – now throw in the hype of meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field and cash in the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding – and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! >>>XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! In 2024, meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. With potential thousand-fold returns that will blow past the finish line, the presale plan draws a hefty 9,900% growth by the TGE. Forget about BOME’s 5,000% rise or WIF’s 1,000% rally – XYZ is here to outscore them all! With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain aiming to connect traditional institutions with the world of Web3. With security as its top priority, MANTRA meets real-world regulatory needs. Built using the Cosmos SDK, it's compatible with other blockchains and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. Capable of handling up to 10,000 transactions per second, it ensures scalability. MANTRA offers tools for creating and managing assets that comply with regulations, making it easier for institutions to step into blockchain. In today's market, MANTRA stands out by focusing on security and compliance, essential for institutional adoption. Its Proof-of-Stake validators enhance security. Compared to other coins that prioritize decentralization without much emphasis on regulation, MANTRA offers a unique balance. By providing a permissionless blockchain for permissioned applications, it appeals to both developers and institutions. This could make OM an attractive option for those looking for projects with real-world use and growth potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a fun experiment. Inspired by Dogecoin, it uses the same cute dog mascot. But SHIB is different because it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many Ethereum applications. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous person named Ryoshi, SHIB had a huge supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain trust, Ryoshi sent half of these tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin made headlines by donating a large amount of SHIB to help India fight COVID-19. He also ""burned"" 40% of the tokens, reducing the supply forever. SHIB's connection with Ethereum opens up many possibilities. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can be used in decentralized apps. There's already ShibaSwap, a platform where users can trade tokens without a middleman. Plans for a future NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on changes make SHIB even more interesting. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because it combines the fun of memecoins with the power of Ethereum. While it's still a risky investment, some see SHIB as more than just a joke, possibly offering real utility in the crypto world. Sui (SUI) Sui is a new blockchain platform that aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly. It is designed to be secure, powerful, and scalable, ready to support global adoption. Unlike many other blockchains, Sui focuses on improving the user experience by removing common barriers. With features like easy login methods, free transactions for users, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui wants to make interacting with blockchain applications as simple as possible. In the current market, where many cryptocurrencies face challenges, Sui stands out with its commitment to usability. By focusing on both strong technical foundations and an enhanced user experience, Sui has the potential to attract more users to Web3. Compared to other coins that may be more complicated or less accessible, Sui's approach could give it an edge. While the cryptocurrency market is always changing, projects like Sui that prioritize user engagement may find more success in the long run. Conclusion OM, SHIB, and SUI show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ), a unique memecoin uniting sports fans, offers potential growth with its community-driven, meme and sports blend ecosystem.

37681617,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/two-analysts-assess-xrps-explosive-rally/,1734283988,Two Analysts Assess XRP’s Explosive Rally,"XRP has emerged as the biggest beneficiary of President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency promises, sparking a massive rally that has left investors debating its future direction. Since the election, XRP has surged 370%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 46% rally and the broader crypto market’s 93% gain, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. The massive rally has seen XRP surpass Solana to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, attributes XRP’s rise to changing regulatory sentiment. “The asset that has been at the forefront of Peloton and has been through the regulatory hoops has been XRP,” Hougan told CNBC. “So if we move to regulatory enablers, almost by definition, it should benefit the most, that seemed like a rational response.” XRP’s supporters see the rally as a vindication after Ripple’s protracted legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Last summer, a judge ruled that XRP was not a security when sold on exchanges to individual investors, but was considered an unregistered security when sold to institutional investors. Related News: Famous Billionaire Makes a Statement About the Future of Bitcoin (BTC) Founded in 2012, XRP is the native token of Ripple’s XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain that Ripple leverages for its cross-border payments business, 95% of which operates outside the US. Despite its technological advantages, XRP has faced skepticism about its market potential. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, referred to XRP as a “blast from the past” and criticized its lack of clear product-market fit. “Despite a lot of marketing, there’s never been a clear product-market fit,” Thorn said, adding that XRP trades at valuations “well above some of the larger companies” without significant real-world use cases. While XRP’s critics say it has not seen enough adoption in business applications, supporters like Hougan highlight its unique consensus mechanism, which is less energy-intensive and more cost-effective than Bitcoin’s proof-of-work or Ethereum’s proof-of-stake systems. Hougan also praised XRP’s ability to maintain community interest throughout crypto’s boom and bust cycles. *This is not investment advice.

Investors are buzzing about tokens linked to prominent figures, anticipating massive gains amid the bullish trends. Enthusiasts are eager to discover which tokens could be the next big hit in this thriving market. Among these emerging tokens, XYZVerse stands out, uniting sports fans and meme culture in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for unprecedented growth. Dominate the Field with XYZ: The Next Meme Coin Champion! The game is on, and XYZ is leading the charge in the meme coin arena! This sensational all-sports meme token has hit the market with unstoppable momentum, knocking out weak competitors and scammy cryptos. As it charges ahead, XYZ is set to deliver jaw-dropping gains, leaving the likes of BOME and WIF far behind. With eyes on a staggering 9,900% growth, XYZ is ready to claim the meme coin crown in the next crypto bull marathon! 💸 Rule the game, cash in as the bets roll in 💸 XYZ is the star player in XYZVerse – the ultimate fusion of sports thrill and meme culture. This community-centered ecosystem is the perfect playground for crypto degens and sports fans alike. Think back to Polymarket's $1 billion trading volume during the US elections betting frenzy, and now, picture that on steroids with XYZVerse. With millions of sport bettors getting ready to jump in the action, opportunities for early investors in XYZ are really huge! XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is the latest buzz in the crypto world, capturing hearts with its dog-themed charm inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. Built on the Solana blockchain, WIF combines the fun of internet memes with the efficiency of modern technology. Meme coins thrive on community and viral trends, and WIF is no exception. It aims to bring people together for a shared experience that's as entertaining as it is engaging. What sets WIF apart is its blend of playful meme culture with Solana's fast and low-cost transactions. This gives it an edge over other meme coins that may struggle with slower networks. In a market where dog-themed tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made significant impacts, WIF enters with fresh energy and a unique background. As interest in meme coins continues to surge, WIF could attract those looking for the next exciting addition to their crypto portfolio. With the current market's appetite for community-driven projects, WIF's potential seems promising. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began as a joke in 2013, created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They used the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there is no maximum limit. In 2021, its value soared, reaching over $50 billion in total worth. This surge was fueled by social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, and a booming crypto market. What started as a fun project became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, showing the power of online communities. Dogecoin's technology is simple, making it easy to use for everyday transactions. Its plentiful supply keeps transaction fees low. This makes it attractive for small payments and tipping online. In the current market cycle, some investors find Dogecoin appealing due to its strong community support. While other cryptocurrencies focus on advanced features, Dogecoin's charm lies in its simplicity and viral nature. With influencers backing it, Dogecoin continues to draw attention. However, its unlimited supply means it's less scarce than Bitcoin or Ethereum, which could affect its long-term value. As the crypto world evolves, Dogecoin remains a unique player worth watching. SPX6900 (SPX) In a world where digital numbers can outshine gold, SPX6900 steps onto the stage from internet humor. This meme token has one bold goal: to surpass the S&P 500 by reaching a staggering $69 trillion market cap. The logic is playful yet simple—6900 is greater than 500, so SPX6900 must be superior to traditional investments. It's a whimsical journey, powered by those who believe that bigger numbers lead to better returns. Behind the laughter, SPX6900 is built on blockchain technology, offering transparency and security. In today's market, where meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have captured the spotlight, SPX6900 rides the wave of viral enthusiasm. Some might call it risky, but others see an exciting opportunity. With investors drawn to bold and unconventional assets, SPX6900 could be the next big thing—or simply a fun experiment for those willing to take a chance. Conclusion While WIF, DOGE, and SPX are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and aiming for 20,000% growth.

Cardano (ADA) is among the highlights; it pushed through the $1 barrier for the first time in two years. Leading blockchain innovators, ADA’s comeback has sparked debates on its market leadership. But among this buzz, experts believe that a rising star valued at just $0.15—Rexas Finance (RXS)—is the competitor to ADA’s market valuation. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Cardano (ADA) Competitor With special real-world asset tokenizing features, Rexas Finance (RXS) has rapidly become a strong rival of Cardano. Unlike ADA, which primarily addresses smart contracts and decentralized apps, RXS offers a novel platform that lets users tokenize and trade practically any real-world asset. From real estate and art to intellectual property and commodities, Rexas Finance (RXS) lets consumers fractionalize ownership or transfer complete ownership of assets globally with just one click. This usefulness has positioned RXS as an innovation leader in the fast-expanding Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization industry and a trend experts anticipate will define blockchain. Presale Success and Unparalleled Growth During its presale, Rexas Finance (RXS) has shown an amazing trajectory with notable benchmarks expressing great investor confidence. It recently sold out in the ninth stage of its presale, and the total raised was an impressive $26.38 million. At $0.15 per token, now in its 10th stage, RXS has 45 million tokens for sale to generate a further $6.75 million. This attests to its rising community and market demand since it brings its entire presale objective to $33.125 million. The popularity of the presale also indicates how increasingly RXS’s potential as a Cardano rival is recognized. Since its presale started, Rexas Finance has been among the most promising altcoins, showing a 400% price increase. The token’s unique qualities and the chance to leverage the $16 trillion tokenizing market attract investors. Predicted to Beat ADA’s Market Cap Cardano has long been a pioneer in blockchain innovation, but it now faces challenges from increased market competition and delays in network upgrades. Conversely, Rexas Finance (RXS) has acquired an advantage by focusing on RWA tokenization, a field in which ADA is invisible. Rising in popularity, RXS is a real competitor to ADA’s market cap this altcoin season since it can close the gap between blockchain technology and tangible assets. Rexas Finance’s pragmatic uses appeal to crypto enthusiasts and conventional asset owners seeking flawless integration into the digital economy, and investors and analysts are counting on it. The Certik platform audit offers extra security and confidence, therefore addressing investor worries about any flaws. With its continuous $1 million giveaway program, Rexas Finance (RXS) is drawing investors and helping build a vibrant community. With $50,000 worth of RXS awarded to 20 participants, this project generates notable discussion around the token. Participants must perform particular objectives, hold at least $100 worth of RXS throughout the presale, and recommend others to qualify for additional entries. With over 463,000 people interacting with the giveaway, the campaign has raised RXS’s profile and enhanced its standing as a community-driven initiative. Analyzers think Rexas Finance (RXS) could surpass Cardano’s market capitalization as it keeps exceeding predictions. Because of its unique emphasis on tokenizing actual assets, RXS is positioned as a transforming agent in the blockchain space. The altcoin is expected to rise even more as its $0.15 presale price increases quickly. Given its utility-driven demand and significant presale investment, market mood points to RXS doing this faster than most rivals. Should the altcoin keep its present rate of increase, Cardano may be replaced as the primary actor in the altcoin scene this season. Youtube Embed Which Altcoin Could Replace Solana in 2025? Final Thoughts Rexas Finance (RXS) is starting to disturb the bitcoin market as the altcoin season picks up speed. At just $0.15, this Cardano rival presents a special value proposition that closes the distance between blockchain and practical uses. With its successful presale, robust community engagement, and growing adoption, RXS is well-positioned to surpass ADA’s market cap and emerge as the leading altcoin of this season.

Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, TRX started as an Ethereum-based token but moved to its own network in 2018. It's a decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps). TRON aims to give full ownership rights back to digital content creators. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking a large cut, TRON allows creators to be rewarded directly by their audience. TRON's potential lies in its mission to decentralize the internet. By empowering creators and cutting out middlemen, it could change how we share and reward online content. TRX transactions are fast and tracked on a public ledger. In the current market, with growing interest in decentralized platforms, TRX stands out as a strong contender. Compared to other coins like Ethereum, TRON offers lower fees and high scalability, making it attractive for developers and users.

37681418,https://crypto.news/?p=14319603,1734283499,Solana blueprint: Falling wedge and moving averages keep bullish hopes alive,"Solana price has retreated by 16.8% from the year-to-date high as the recent crypto momentum faded. Solana ( SOL ) was trading at $220 on Sunday, bringing its market cap to $105 billion, and making it the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency. SOL has numerous catalysts that could propel the price higher in the longer term. It has become the biggest competitor to Ethereum ( ETH ), the biggest blockchain in the world. According to DeFi Llama , its total value locked has jumped by 18% in the last 30 days, bringing its total assets to over $9.12 billion. It has about $30 billion worth of stablecoins in its ecosystem. Solana has also become the biggest player in the Decentralized Exchange industry. Its seven-day volume stood at over $29.7 billion, higher than Ethereum’s $21 billion. The biggest Solana DEX networks are Raydium, Orca, and Meteora. Solana has a big share in the Decentralized Public Infrastructure and meme coin industry. Its DePIN networks like HiveMapper and Helium are doing well, while all Solana meme coins have a market cap of over $19 billion, led by Dogwifhat, Bonk, Peanut the Squirrel, and Popcat. HiveMapper is aiming to be a better mapping solution than Google Maps. According to its website , it has already mapped about 17 million kilometers of roads and has a global coverage of 29%. Helium is disrupting the wireless industry by building a decentralized network. Meanwhile, expectations are high that the incoming Trump administration will loosen crypto regulations, and potentially approve a spot SOL ETF. There are chances that such a fund will attract institutional capital, as we have seen with Ethereum, which has attracted over $2.26 billion in inflows in the past few months.

Solana price analysis: bullish patterns forms SOL price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SOL price peaked at $264.40 on Nov. 22. It pulled back to $220, but dropped and retested the crucial support level at $205 — the highest swing in March this year, and the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. A C&H pattern is made up of a horizontal line and a rounded bottom, and is a popular bullish continuation sign. Solana has also remained above the 50-day moving average — a sign that the bull market is still there. It has formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish sign. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the coming weeks. The first target will be the year-to-date high of $264, followed by $400.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a fun experiment. Inspired by Dogecoin, it uses the same cute dog mascot. But SHIB is different because it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many Ethereum applications. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous person named Ryoshi, SHIB had a huge supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain trust, Ryoshi sent half of these tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin made headlines by donating a large amount of SHIB to help India fight COVID-19. He also ""burned"" 40% of the tokens, reducing the supply forever. SHIB's connection with Ethereum opens up many possibilities. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can be used in decentralized apps. There's already ShibaSwap, a platform where users can trade tokens without a middleman. Plans for a future NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on changes make SHIB even more interesting. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because it combines the fun of memecoins with the power of Ethereum. While it's still a risky investment, some see SHIB as more than just a joke, possibly offering real utility in the crypto world. Sui (SUI) Sui is a new blockchain platform that aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly. It is designed to be secure, powerful, and scalable, ready to support global adoption. Unlike many other blockchains, Sui focuses on improving the user experience by removing common barriers. With features like easy login methods, free transactions for users, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui wants to make interacting with blockchain applications as simple as possible. In the current market, where many cryptocurrencies face challenges, Sui stands out with its commitment to usability. By focusing on both strong technical foundations and an enhanced user experience, Sui has the potential to attract more users to Web3. Compared to other coins that may be more complicated or less accessible, Sui's approach could give it an edge. While the cryptocurrency market is always changing, projects like Sui that prioritize user engagement may find more success in the long run.

The DeFi token has one of the best presales in 2024 and is set to explode after launch in 2025. 1Fuel has sold over 60 million tokens on presale, out of the 500 million available, the token’s limited supply will soon drive its demand and value through the roof, which is why it’s essential to get in early now.

The new token is set to pump massively and smart money is already investing heavily. Solana Tipped To Pump Hard In 2025 Solana started the year on a positive note. The altcoin quickly broke into the $100 price zone from about $70+ initial value. Solana is keen on ending the year on a similar note, but prolonged bear pressure has been a challenge. Solana has dipped 14% since reaching a $263.83 all-time high. The altcoin fluctuates around $224 and $225 currently, as it hopes to change the tide. Despite the prevailing bear pressure, analysts predict that Solana will be a top-performing crypto coin in 2025. The top altcoin is showing signs of a strong bull run, and it may eventually experience it in Q1. Solana may hit $600 in 2025, making it a good investment choice. Shiba Inu Ready For A Great Market Run In 2025 Meme coins are tipped to have a more rewarding 2025, and Shiba Inu could be the best-performing one. While Shiba Inu hasn’t yielded as much as Pepe and BONK this year, the meme coin is hoping to outperform them soon. This could see Shiba Inu yield massive returns in Q1. Presently, Shiba Inu trades around $0.00002831 as it looks to return to its current yearly high at $0.000033. However, Shiba Inu is yet to completely weather bear pressure, making it difficult to beat the resistance at $0.000039. Shiba Inu may eventually break out beyond its current resistance level and surge towards $0.000035 by Q1. Conclusion Solana could be a top-performing crypto coin in 2025, just like Shiba Inu. However, investors could gain the most from 1Fuel. The token has one of the best presales in 2024, and it’s expected to reward investors massively.

37681207,https://thecoinrise.com/ethereum-liquid-restaking-tvl-skyrockets-from-284m-to-17b-in-2024/,1734283030,Ethereum Liquid Restaking TVL Skyrockets from $284M to $17B in 2024,"Ethereum (ETH) restaking protocols have registered an astronomical surge in Total Value Locked (TVL). In 2024, the TVL witnessed a staggering increase of approximately 6,000%, driven by high demand for staked asset utilities. Explosive Growth of Liquid Restaking TVL DefiLlama data revealed that the value grew from hundreds of millions in January to tens of billions by December 2024. Notably, on January 1, liquid restaking TVL on the Ethereum network was almost $284 million. The figure has grown to $17.26 billion since December 15, 2024. This represents almost 60-fold growth. A growth credited to the utility of liquid restaking tokens (LRTs). The attraction of LRTs is that they simplify the complexities of traditional ETH staking while increasing capital efficiency in decentralized finance (DeFi). For clarity, LRTs build on the foundation of liquid staking tokens (LSTs). In liquid staking, stakers desiring to maintain liquidity receive derivative tokens like stETH from Lido while participating in network activities. These represent their staked holdings. Such tokens become usable in other DeFi activities such as trading, lending, or yielding farming. The aim is to allow holders to retain the liquidity of their staked assets. Liquid Restaking on Ethereum Liquid restaking tokens take the utility of the assets a notch higher. In liquid restaking, users who already staked ETH to secure Ethereum could also get to stake the derivative tokens they received. This allows them to participate in securing an application-specific blockchain or a layer-2 network. On the surface, these asset types offer flexibility. However, they have embedded risks, including the depegging or price volatility of derivative tokens. This has the potential to affect their value. LRTs increase this risk potential more as they are exposed to multiple networks. As such, failure in one network could hurt restaked assets, resulting in compounded losses. Ethereum Price Trends Amid Restaking Surge Meanwhile, at the time Ethereum’s liquid restaking registered this astronomical growth, ETH price climbed from $2352.59 to its current level. The coin breached the $4,000 level in early March before suffering a decline that saw its price plunge to $2,223 by September. However, amid broader bullish sentiments, ETH has rebounded well and soared to the $4,000 mark . At the time of writing, ETH is exchanging hands at $3,894.95.

37681038,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627816,1734282244,Key economic events that markets are watching out for this week,"This week is chaos for markets, and that’s exactly how it should be. A packed schedule of key events has investors bracing for effects across the global economy. From US interest rate moves to central bank decisions in Japan and the U.K., nothing about this week is boring. Every single number, decision, and statement matters, and markets will be dissecting them for any sign of what’s coming next. Fed’s interest rate decision: The main event The Federal Reserve is center stage on Wednesday. Analysts are almost certain that the central bank will slice interest rates by 0.25%, lowering the range to 4.25%–4.50%. Futures markets aren’t leaving room for debate, pricing in a 95% chance of this happening. This cut caps a year of aggressive rate hikes meant to hammer inflation back into submission. Inflation, however, isn’t playing nice. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed it creeping up to 2.7% in November, compared to 2.6% in October. At the same time, the labor market refuses to crack under pressure. The US economy added 227,000 jobs last month, smashing expectations. Why does this matter? Because even if the Fed trims rates this week, the next move isn’t a given. With Donald Trump set to re-enter the White House in January, the Fed might want to keep rates steady for a while. The president’s inauguration on January 20 will precede the next Fed meeting on January 29, and the central bank might pause to assess how his policies shake things up. PMI, GDP, and retail sales: The supporting acts Monday kicks things off with S&P Global’s Services PMI report. This little number gives us a snapshot of the US services sector, which has been carrying the economy while manufacturing drags its feet. November’s PMI stood at 56.1, signaling expansion, but expectations for December suggest a slight dip to 55.0. It’s not a catastrophe, but it does suggest that even the services sector isn’t bulletproof. On Tuesday, retail sales numbers for November drop. These numbers tell us how much consumers spent and where. October saw a modest 0.3% increase, but November, with its holiday shopping season, might nudge that number to between 0.2% and 0.4%. Still, with inflation and high interest rates hitting wallets, don’t expect a spending spree. Fast forward to Thursday, and we’ve got the final GDP estimate for Q3 2024. The previous number was a solid 4.9% growth, driven by consumer spending and business investment. Economists now expect a slight revision down to 4.7%. Why? Adjustments in trade balances and inventories are likely culprits. Also on Thursday, existing home sales data for November will tell us just how bad things are in the housing market. Spoiler: It’s bad. October saw a 1.4% decline, and analysts are bracing for another 2% drop. Global central banks enter the chat Across the Pacific, the Bank of Japan is grappling with its next steps. There’s been chatter about a possible rate hike, especially after Governor Kazuo Ueda’s previous attempts at normalization. The yen remains under pressure, and inflation seems to be behaving. But here’s the twist: Politics might ruin the party. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s gamble on a snap election backfired, leaving his Liberal Democratic Party stuck in a hung parliament. They’re now leaning on the Democratic Party for the People, a smaller opposition group that isn’t thrilled about more rate hikes. The DPP wants the Bank of Japan to wait until spring wage negotiations confirm whether this year’s wage increases are the real deal. The result? No hike this week. On the other side of the hill, the Bank of England is expected to sit tight. On Thursday, the bank is likely to hold its lending rate at 4.75%. November’s inflation data, set to drop the day before, could shake things up. The economists think annual CPI inflation will rise to 2.5% from October’s 2.3%. That doesn’t sound huge, but inflation in services could hit 5%. Food and energy prices aren’t doing anyone any favors, either. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee isn’t expected to make waves this week. Most members will likely vote to maintain the current rate. But there’s a slim chance the vote split could lean toward a more dovish stance, with some members eyeing potential rate cuts in 2025.

Meanwhile, Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) presale hits $17.67M with just 4 days left, offering 163% APY staking rewards. These tokens present strong growth potential as 2024 approaches, drawing investor attention. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Surges 9%: Bullish Momentum Targets $25.90 Resistance Hyperliquid (HYPE) has surged 9.12%, trading at $24.91, backed by strong buying pressure and a decisive bullish engulfing candle on the 2-hour chart. The price has confidently moved above the $23.95 pivot point, now acting as immediate support. If momentum holds, resistance at $25.90 could be breached, potentially propelling HYPE toward $27.12 and $28.36. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Technically, HYPE remains bullish, supported by an ascending trendline at $22.08 and the 50 EMA at $20.60. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 65.54, indicating robust buying sentiment but nearing overbought levels. Traders should monitor a breakout above $25.90 for sustained upward movement.

Technical Strength : Key levels like $23.95 and $25.90 highlight strong bullish momentum with potential for further upside. Growing Volume : Hyperliquid has witnessed exponential growth, with traders hitting $18 million+ in lifetime volume, boosting the platform’s visibility. Ethena (ENA) Surges 24.9% as Trump-Linked Wallet Buys ENA Ethena (ENA) is trending after a wallet tied to former President Donald Trump made significant ENA purchases, sparking investor excitement. ENA has soared 24.99%, currently trading at $1.23 on strong trading volume of $1.16 billion, with bullish momentum driving prices higher. – **Trump's fund** has made a major move into **Ethena (ENA)** tokens, suggesting a bullish outlook on DeFi's future. – **Qubetics** has broken presale records, highlighting strong investor interest in new crypto projects. — Diek Wechgelaar ( , ) (@DiekWechgelaar) December 15, 2024 On the 4-hour chart, ENA has successfully broken above a key upward trendline, signaling a continuation of its uptrend. The immediate resistance lies at $1.23, and a sustained move above this level could pave the way for further gains, with targets at $1.30 and $1.37. Ethena (ENA) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A bullish engulfing candle near $1.14 highlights strong buying interest, solidifying this level as critical support. Further downside protection comes at $1.08 and $1.02, where the 50 EMA aligns as dynamic support, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads 73.35, indicating overbought conditions. While this suggests caution for a short-term pullback, sustained momentum above $1.23 could drive a rally toward higher resistance levels. Key Catalysts Behind ENA’s Momentum Trump-Linked Wallet Activity : Large ENA purchases have amplified attention and investor interest. Technical Strength : Breakout above key trendline and bullish engulfing candle signal further upside potential. Next Targets : Immediate focus on $1.30 and $1.37 , with strong support at $1.14 and $1.02 . As market sentiment strengthens, Ethena remains firmly bullish. Traders are closely watching the $1.30 resistance for the next major move, while any pullback toward $1.14 may attract further buying interest.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-musk-loves-usa-muskusa-to-skyrocket-16000-before-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37680264,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374611,1734280993,"Ronin’s DeFi TVL Grows 149% YoY, Boosted by RON Token’s 30% Price Rise","Ronin, the Layer 1 blockchain developed by Sky Mavis, experienced a significant 149% year-over-year increase in DeFi TVL, reaching $147 million in Q3 2024. There are several factors influencing this growth. One of the major catalysts was, however, the price surge of the RON token. Ronin’s DeFi, NFT Demand Grows According to Messari’s latest report , Ronin’s DeFi TVL rose from $59 million in Q3 2023 to $147 million in Q3 2024. The figure was boosted by a 30% increase in the RON token price and wider ecosystem adoption. At the same time, native token TVL fell by 36%, from 128 million to 82 million tokens, indicating less participation. This could be because of fewer token-locking incentives, a shift to gaming and NFTs, and a preference for holding RON tokens. RON holders increased by 11,611%, reaching 527,000 in Q3 2024, with a 20% growth from Q2. Interestingly, Katana DEX holds a dominant 99% share of the total DeFi TVL on the Ronin network, while the next two largest protocols, Sablier Finance and MetaLend, contribute just 0.0029% and 0.77%, respectively. As the main decentralized exchange on Ronin, Katana drives liquidity and token swaps for assets like RON, AXS, and SLP. While Katana’s TVL dropped 9% QoQ from $165 million in Q2 2024 to $150 million in Q3 2024, it saw a 154% YoY increase, rising from $59 million in Q3 2023 to $150 million in Q3 2024. Throughout the year, Ronin’s daily NFT buyers generally outnumbered sellers, indicating a preference for holding. In Q3 2024, both buyers and sellers grew by 17%, with the former rising from 4,400 to 5,100 and the latter from 3,700 to 4,300. This growth followed a record-high in June this year, fueled by the Coinbase Learn campaign and Ronin Carnival, which featured Axie Infinity missions, a $1 million competition from Apeiron, and free trials from 0xScope. These events led to peak engagement with 28,000 buyers and 20,000 sellers. Zooming out, Ronin’s daily transactions grew 24% QoQ in Q3, rising from 1.8 million to 2.2 million. This growth was driven by new games and partnerships. However, average daily transaction fees fell 20% QoQ, dropping from $7,000 to $5,000, likely due to Ronin focusing on expanding its ecosystem. Compared to Q3 2023, daily transactions skyrocketed by 2,300%, from 90,000 to 2.2 million, and transaction fees rose 4,000%, from $134 to $5,000. Active addresses also grew by 23% QoQ, while new addresses increased by 22%. Ronin’s Security Woes Known for being the victim of the most costly DeFi hack, Ronin was breached in 2022 when an attacker used inadequate private key security to authorize a fraudulent transaction, draining $624 million from the cross-chain bridge. In August 2024, the platform suffered another attack, losing $12 million due to a smart contract flaw introduced by a recent upgrade.

However, many SHIB holders are diversifying into altcoins like PEPE, PNUT, and PCHAIN. With predictions of 45,039% compound returns by 2025, these tokens have caught the eye of speculative investors. PEPE capitalizes on meme-coin hype, PNUT focuses on utility in DeFi, and PCHAIN is pioneering blockchain interoperability in real estate. As Shiba Inu trades near $0.00002960 and struggles with resistance, investors turn to these alternatives for potentially exponential gains. But can they deliver the 45,039%? Let’s find out! PEPE, PNUT, and PCHAIN: High-Risk, High-Reward Opportunities Investors are always drawn to high-risk, high-reward altcoins. PEPE, PNUT, and PCHAIN represent unique opportunities as each offers distinct value propositions. These tokens appeal to investors willing to navigate volatility for the chance of high ROI. PEPE Pepe Coin , priced at $0.0000235, thrives on meme culture and strong community backing. Its trajectory mirrors Shiba Inu’s early days. Price forecasts for 2025 suggest a high of $0.000040, driven by viral campaigns and media sentiment. However, its extreme volatility makes it risky. Emerging integrations with tools like Lightchain AI for predictive analytics and governance offer unique growth prospects but remain speculative due to their reliance on hype​. PNUT PNUT focuses on decentralized storage solutions, targeting the growing demand for blockchain-based data storage. Its utility-centric model appeals to Shiba Inu investors seeking projects with tangible use cases. However, despite its price upward trajectory, limited adoption and competition from established altcoins pose significant risks. PNUT’s niche market could yield substantial long-term returns if it secures broader adoption and partnerships. PCHAIN PCHAIN is gaining recognition for multichain interoperability, allowing seamless data and asset transfers across blockchains. It has attracted Shiba Inu investors with features like AI, metaverse integration, and eco-friendly proof-of-stake mechanisms. PCHAIN stands out because of its RWA tokenomics, positioning it as a high-yield investment. Analysts believe its a token capable of attaining substantial growth because of its market positioning and unique strategies, thus solidifying its place in the blockchain market. The Path to 45,039% Returns: Is PCHAIN the Best Bet? The promise of 45,039% compound returns appears overly ambitious, but PCHAIN offers compelling reasons to consider it as a frontrunner among high-risk, high-reward investments. Unlike tokens like PEPE and PNUT, PCHAIN is rooted in practical applications that could reshape industries, particularly real estate. PCHAIN’s approach leverages blockchain, AI, and metaverse technologies to disrupt the $300 trillion real estate market. Its platform enables fractional ownership through tokenized real estate, allowing smaller investors to access high-value properties. This innovation creates liquidity in a traditionally illiquid market, allowing investors to pool funds and share ownership seamlessly. AI integration enhances the platform’s efficiency by automating property valuations, rent collection, and lease agreements via smart contracts. This eliminates middlemen and simplifies property management. Investors can use AI-generated insights to strategize based on market trends and predict price fluctuations. The metaverse integration further distinguishes PCHAIN by providing virtual tours of global real estate assets. This capability fosters informed decision-making, even for properties across continents. The ongoing presale demonstrates investor confidence. Priced at $0.011 in its 2nd stage, the token is set to climb to $0.032 at the listing, representing a 4.21% rise. This positions PCHAIN for a strong launch, with projections suggesting further growth as adoption increases. PCHAIN’s emphasis on utility, scalability, and real-world impact makes it a standout choice. While market volatility and competition risks remain, its presale performance and clear roadmap signal significant growth potential. PCHAIN may represent the most credible path to substantial returns for investors seeking more than speculative gains. PCHAIN Could Be Your Next Big Crypto Investment Investors are shifting their focus from established meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) to promising new tokens like PEPE, PNUT, and Propichain (PCHAIN) – a rising player with significant potential for growth. First-round Propichain (PCHAIN) presale buyers are already witnessing early gains. The token price has risen by 4.21%, from $0.004 to $0.011 in its 2nd stage. However, the real attraction lies in the projected 45,093% compound returns investors eagerly anticipate. If these projections hold, a small investment in Propichain (PCHAIN) during its first presale round could set the stage for massive returns by 2025, much like early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors who experienced life-changing gains. Propichain (PCHAIN) is already receiving attention, with a BlockAudit review adding credibility to its security and CoinMarketCap listing, further boosting its visibility.

37679973,https://crypto.news/?p=14319525,1734280200,DOGE aims $1.5 by 2025; investors seen investing in Yeti Ouro dominating the DeFi market,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin eyes $1.5 by 2025 with growing adoption, while Yeti Ouro rises as a P2E leader, capturing investors’ attention. Table of Contents Dogecoin price pushes for $1.5 tag The rise of Yeti Ouro: A new player in P2E gaming Why investors are so confidence in Yeti Ouro Comparing Yeti Ouro with Dogecoin Conclusion Dogecoin , the original meme coin, is back in the spotlight. Analysts are predicting DOGE to hit $1.5 by 2025, fueled by increasing adoption and a growing fan base. However, in the ever-evolving crypto market, investors are turning their focus toward new opportunities like Yeti Ouro (YETIO) . This viral altcoin is quickly establishing itself as a powerhouse in the Play-to-Earn (P2E) market, with many seeing it as the next big crypto success story. Dogecoin price pushes for $1.5 tag Dogecoin has seen remarkable growth since its inception, moving from a joke to a serious digital asset. It currently trades well below its 2021 peak, but analysts believe the DOGE price of $1.5 target by 2025 is achievable. Factors like Elon Musk’s continued support, DOGE’s integration into payment systems, and increasing use cases are driving this bullish sentiment. 1-week Dogecoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Market trends also play a crucial role. As crypto adoption grows, Dogecoin is benefiting from its widespread recognition. It remains a favorite for retail investors and a starting point for those new to cryptocurrency. You might also like: SHIB set to be replaced by Yeti Ouro and Floki, $1m raised in record time The rise of Yeti Ouro: A new player in P2E gaming As Dogecoin has grabbed the headlines, new cryptocurrencies like Yeti Ouro are making their mark in various fields. This altcoin is causing quite a stir in online gaming to play and earn (P2E), being well enjoyed by both gamers. In its recent presale, the entire amount was well over $1 million, signaling massive interest from early investors. Yeti Ouro stands out thanks to its utility. YETIO isn’t like many meme selections, its ecosystem includes Yeti Go, a longstanding P2E racing game people have been waiting for. Why investors are so confidence in Yeti Ouro Folks interested in security and earning potential must recognize Yeti Ouro. A capped supply of 1 billion tokens means the coin is inherently deflationary. Both staking rewards and token burns guarantee rewards for long-term holders. Besides, the community is the one thing Yeti Ouro has going for it. Users who got in now and watched it develop are excited at what the future holds: surely, this can only flourish under such high-quality gaming environments. Yeti Go’s immersive game settings and solid mechanics are just starting to establish benchmarks within the fiat economy of P2E, and it will likely shape the future. Comparing Yeti Ouro with Dogecoin There are a lot of differences between Dogecoin and Yeti Ouro. They address separate groups of investors entirely. DOGE can rely on its popularity and rising adoption provided it becomes a currency people are used to using. DOGE is an apparent choice for anyone after stability and a higher level of recognition. On the other hand, Yeti Ouro is about creativity. Its focus on P2E gaming places it in a rapidly growing market. While it’s younger and more speculative, the potential returns for trend-following investors are enough to keep them from missing out on this project. Yeti Ouro’s future looks promising in the P2E gaming market. With the rise of Play-2-Earn games, Yeti Ouro could become the market leader YETIO as it is both unique and offers strong utility features. The ongoing success of Ouro’s presale is evidence that investors trust it. And the launch of Yeti Go on top means its popularity must leap. Conclusion Dogecoin and Yeti Ouro represent two exciting opportunities in the crypto market. DOGE’s push for $1.5 showcases its enduring appeal, while Yeti Ouro’s rise highlights the growing potential of P2E gaming. Both projects have their strengths, but Yeti Ouro’s unique model is turning heads. With the evolution of the crypto market, portfolio diversification becomes particularly important. Whether you are holding Dogecoin or sampling Yeti Ouro, each token has distinct advantages. Yeti Ouro might be it for those looking for the next big thing.

37679930,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27748,1734280115,Why Hong Kong Has Grown into a Crypto Hub,"Hong Kong’s Unique Role in Crypto Innovation Hong Kong is fast emerging as a cryptocurrency capital, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow key markets like Singapore and UAE, each forging ahead on pathways to financial innovation. WOW Summit CEO Ivan Ivanov also attributes this move on the ground to Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” principle that has so far given way to “allow experimentation within the digital assets ecosystem with appropriate regulation in place”. “Hong Kong combines the excitement of crypto with the stability of an established financial system,” Ivanov said in an interview with Cointelegraph. With strong economic ties to mainland China, as well as with the rest of the world, it’s a perfect testing ground for new technologies, startups, and institutional investors alike. Policies That Drive Crypto Growth A key driver underlying Hong Kong’s rise is its welcoming regulatory environment. For example, stablecoin issuers are required to obtain licenses and hold fiat reserves in local banks, a policy to drive trust and transparency into the market. A number of other recent developments have only reinforced Hong Kong’s reputation as an innovation hub: Project Ensemble: A collaborative effort with the central banks of Brazil and Thailand to explore cross-border, tokenized settlements. Cyberport Web3 Network: This government-backed hub supports more than 270 blockchain companies today, of which 120 have joined in the last 17 months. AI in Finance: FSTB in October 2024 published guidelines to help promote the use of AI in financial systems and reduce potential risks. Hong Kong’s First Crypto Exchanges to Go Live in 2024 This year has seen a number of milestones for Hong Kong’s crypto industry. ZA Bank, the city’s largest digital bank, launched retail crypto trading services in November 2024. To further incentivize institutional investments , the government has proposed exempting capital gains taxes on crypto holdings. Such forward-thinking policies create an environment that is both secure yet dynamic for financial innovation. Investors and entrepreneurs benefit from stability in Hong Kong’s established financial infrastructure while exploring the potential of cutting-edge digital assets. A Bright Future Hong Kong’s unique blend of geopolitical advantages, regulatory foresight, and commitment to innovation ensures its position as a global leader in the cryptocurrency space.

They’re sprinting toward what they see as greener pastures in New York. Despite endless promises, reforms, and marketing campaigns from the UK government, regulators, and the LSE itself, nothing has stemmed the tide. FTSE 100 firms lead the charge out of London Big players from the FTSE 100 index, London’s crown jewels, are among the deserters. Since 2020, six heavyweight companies have made the leap to New York, taking their combined market valuations—worth nearly £280 billion—with them. To put that into perspective, that’s about 14% of the total market cap of the FTSE 100 gone in just four years. The latest defector? Ashtead, an equipment rental giant worth £23 billion. Its board has had enough of London’s sluggish markets and sees a brighter future in New York. It joins the likes of gambling juggernaut Flutter, valued at £39 billion, and building materials colossus CRH, which boasts a £55 billion valuation. Both have jumped ship within the past 18 months, citing better liquidity and a deeper pool of investors in the U.S. The reasons behind this corporate flight aren’t exactly a mystery. Liquidity is king, and U.S. markets offer it in spades. Businesses moving their primary listings to New York are lured by a bigger pool of investors and higher trading volumes. Goldman Sachs pointed out last year that the gap between the valuations of U.S.-listed and UK-listed companies is widening. The FTSE 100, dominated by old-economy sectors like energy and mining, has gained a respectable 8% this year. But compare that to the tech-heavy S&P 500 in the U.S., which has surged by a jaw-dropping 27%. For fast-growing companies and their investors, the choice is clear. London’s reforms: Too little, too late The UK government has tried to patch the sinking ship with a raft of reforms. Changes to pension rules and listing regulations were supposed to make the LSE more competitive. David Schwimmer, the LSE’s chief executive, once claimed that the notion of higher valuations in the U.S. was a “myth.” Sharon Bell, a strategist at Goldman Sachs, said businesses chasing higher valuations feel forced away from London by a lack of domestic investor interest. One FTSE 100 CEO called Ashtead’s decision to move “very sad.” The government likes to trot out examples of “confidence” in the UK’s capital markets, like the upcoming London listing of Canal+, a French pay-TV operator expected to be valued at over €6 billion. But one listing doesn’t fix a systemic problem. Even mid-tier FTSE 250 executives are skeptical. And then there’s the political angle. The “America First” rhetoric from U.S. leaders only adds more momentum to the corporate migration. A market in crisis or an opportunity for crypto? Meanwhile, the LSE has tried to reinvent itself as a hub for crypto enthusiasts. In May 2024, it introduced crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs), offering institutional investors exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum without directly holding the assets. It’s a bold decision, but it hasn’t done much to offset the broader market decline. The ETNs are physically backed, meaning the underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum are securely held, mostly in cold storage. The instruments are for professional investors, as retail traders remain locked out under FCA rules. Since their launch, they have had mixed results. Bitcoin is holding steady at around £60,000, while Ethereum trades at roughly £4,000. But crypto is no magic bullet for the LSE’s woes. Even as it pivots to new asset classes, the exchange’s traditional equities market continues to shrink.

37679395,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98929,1734278860,Top Analyst Says XRP Bull Rally Has Barely Started — Why He Envisions 2017-Style Price Boom Coming,"XRP began soaring after Donald Trump’s election win last month, but the crypto’s climb turned into a rocketship ride after Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler announced that he will resign effective January 20, 2025. The Ripple-linked token reclaimed its early 2018 highs amid speculation that regulatory clarity is coming and that it will open the door to U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A widely-followed analyst recently commented about XRP’s price action, arguing that its rally is just getting started. The analyst pseudonymously known as CryptoWZRD compared XRP’s current performance to its parabolic rally in 2017, forecasting a repeat of the surge in the near future. Could XRP Mirror 2017 Rally? CryptoWZRD took to X to share a chart that shows XRP’s trend of forming long-term symmetrical triangle patterns, where resistance levels are flipped into robust support. This pattern can be seen in the historical price performance from 2017, which is similar to the present setup. The accompanying chart shows that XRP witnessed an explosive breakout from a multi-year consolidation phase. The crypto then saw a 40% pullback in the first week of April 2017 after surging by over 280% in March of that year. Notably, the downtrend continued until late April, with XRP recouping all losses and skyrocketing in May of the same year. The asset continued rising until it hit its current all-time high of $3.40 in January 2018. “I’m sorry if you think it’s over, it’s barely begun. It cannot get any simpler.. a 2017 style big boom is coming for $XRP,” CryptoWZRD wrote in his post. Market Developments Spark Bullish Market Sentiment A flurry of market participants anticipates a major market rally ahead for XRP, given a series of bullish developments in the Ripple ecosystem. For context, the market expects a more lenient regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies after Donald Trump’s election victory. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple for alleged securities violations, leaving XRP with an uncertain future in the United States. However, the forthcoming regime change has bolstered investors’ confidence that XRP will encounter fewer challenges ahead, and could be adopted for spot ETFs. Moreover, some crypto commentators have said that Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin launch will create several tailwinds for XRP, mainly because it will provide the San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm with a less volatile asset to deepen its remittance and settlement services. At press time, XRP remains about 28.2% down from its $3.40 record high, but again, it’s closer than it has been in roughly seven years.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/top-analyst-says-xrp-bull-rally-has-barely-started-why-he-envisions-2017-style-price-boom-coming/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

This could make OM an attractive option for those looking for projects with real-world use and growth potential. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a fun experiment. Inspired by Dogecoin, it uses the same cute dog mascot. But SHIB is different because it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many Ethereum applications. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous person named Ryoshi, SHIB had a huge supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain trust, Ryoshi sent half of these tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin made headlines by donating a large amount of SHIB to help India fight COVID-19. He also “burned” 40% of the tokens, reducing the supply forever. SHIB’s connection with Ethereum opens up many possibilities. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can be used in decentralized apps. There’s already ShibaSwap, a platform where users can trade tokens without a middleman. Plans for a future NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on changes make SHIB even more interesting. In today’s market, SHIB shows potential because it combines the fun of memecoins with the power of Ethereum. While it’s still a risky investment, some see SHIB as more than just a joke, possibly offering real utility in the crypto world. Sui Sui is a new blockchain platform that aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly. It is designed to be secure, powerful, and scalable, ready to support global adoption. Unlike many other blockchains, Sui focuses on improving the user experience by removing common barriers. With features like easy login methods, free transactions for users, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui wants to make interacting with blockchain applications as simple as possible. In the current market, where many cryptocurrencies face challenges, Sui stands out with its commitment to usability. By focusing on both strong technical foundations and an enhanced user experience, Sui has the potential to attract more users to Web3. Compared to other coins that may be more complicated or less accessible, Sui’s approach could give it an edge. While the cryptocurrency market is always changing, projects like Sui that prioritize user engagement may find more success in the long run. Conclusion While OM, SHIB, and SUI show potential, investing in XYZVerse could offer a unique chance for significant growth in a community-driven, sports-inspired memecoin ecosystem.

37679166,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662635,1734278438,"Ethereum Forming A Symmetrical Pattern – Key Resistance At $4,100","Ethereum is making another attempt to break above the $4,000 level as it edges closer to its all-time highs. Despite its strong fundamentals, doubts linger in the market regarding Ethereum’s performance this cycle, with some expecting it to underperform amid stiff competition from other blockchain ecosystems. However, Ethereum’s recent price action suggests that it is building momentum, keeping investors on edge for a potential breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck Between $99K And $102K – Analyst Explains Macro Situation Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis, noting that Ethereum has encountered strong resistance near the $4,000 mark and is now consolidating within a symmetrical triangle on the hourly chart. This pattern often precedes a decisive move, leaving traders speculating whether ETH will break out to new highs or face a temporary pullback. Ethereum’s performance at this key level will likely shape market sentiment in the coming weeks. A breakout above $4,000 could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high, reigniting investor confidence. On the other hand, failure to clear this resistance might validate bearish concerns and lead to a retrace. As ETH remains at a critical juncture, all eyes are on its ability to navigate this pivotal zone and deliver the next major move. Ethereum Preparing To Move Ethereum has been grappling with significant resistance above the $4,100 level, leaving the market in suspense as traders anticipate its next move. With the price consolidating and showing signs of tension, Ethereum appears ready to make a decisive move in the coming days. The critical question remains: will it break higher, or is a pullback imminent? Runefelt shared his insights on X, pointing out that Ethereum is currently trading within a symmetrical triangle on the hourly chart—a pattern known for signaling potential breakouts or breakdowns. According to Runefelt, Ethereum’s immediate future hinges on two key levels. A breakout above $4,100 would confirm a bullish trajectory, likely propelling ETH toward new highs. Conversely, a breakdown below $3,675 would signal bearish sentiment, opening the door for a deeper correction. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon Runefelt emphasizes the importance of these levels, noting that the symmetrical triangle suggests mounting pressure that could soon lead to significant volatility. As Ethereum holds its position near critical resistance, the next few days are shaping up to be pivotal for determining its market direction. Technical Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,840 after failing to break above the critical $4,000 resistance level. While the price remains strong and within range of this key level, it needs to clear $4,000 to confirm the continuation of its uptrend. Without a decisive breakout, ETH risks losing momentum, leaving traders and investors cautious about the next move. The $4,000 level has proven to be a significant psychological and technical barrier for Ethereum, with multiple attempts to break it being met with selling pressure. A successful breach of this resistance would likely pave the way for ETH to target higher levels, potentially pushing toward the yearly high of $4,100 and beyond. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon – Top Trader Sets $2 Target However, if Ethereum fails to overcome this hurdle, the market could see a retrace to lower demand zones. The $3,500 area is emerging as a critical support level that traders are closely monitoring.

The proposal proposes replacing the current system, where one Bitcoin (BTC) is equal to 100 million satoshis (sats), with a simpler structure that makes the satoshi the new base unit. Under Carvalho’s plan, “one Bitcoin” will no longer represent the larger BTC unit we know today. Instead, it will refer to the smallest indivisible Bitcoin unit, currently called a satoshi, which is equivalent to one hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. This redefinition will eliminate the need for decimal points in Bitcoin transactions, making values easier to read and understand. For example, a transaction currently displayed as 0.00010000 BTC will appear as 10,000 BTC under the proposed system. Related News: Onchain Data Shows Whale, Who Once Had $240 Million in Assets, Bought This Altcoin Carvalho argues that this change will reduce confusion, bring Bitcoin’s appearance into line with its integrated protocol, and make the cryptocurrency system more user-friendly for newcomers. “The decimal point is just a human-imposed abstraction,” Carvalho says, suggesting that Bitcoin’s technical framework supports this change. Carvalho’s proposal is not the first to address Bitcoin’s unit structure. In 2017, leading Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song introduced BIP 176, which advocated using “bits” as a standard value. This would allow users to avoid confusing fractional BTC displays when dealing with smaller transactions. However, the idea never gained widespread adoption. Critics warn that redefining Bitcoin’s currency structure could present challenges for wallets, exchanges and other platforms already built around the current system. Such changes could also confuse existing users and increase the risk of transaction errors during the transition period. *This is not investment advice.

In the current market cycle, where investors are looking for novel opportunities, MEW presents an interesting option. Its distinctive branding and potential for growth may appeal to those seeking something different in the cryptocurrency space. POPCAT: A potential revival in the cryptocurrency market POPCAT is a new cryptocurrency aiming to breathe life into a market affected by dead wallets, pump and dumps, and rug pulls. For those who missed out on previous opportunities like $BONK on Solana and are searching for the next significant play, POPCAT presents itself as a promising option. It seeks to restore confidence by introducing innovative technology and engaging the community to revitalize the market. In the current market cycle, where investors are cautious yet eager for credible prospects, POPCAT’s potential to deliver meaningful growth makes it an attractive consideration for those exploring new opportunities in the crypto space.

By operating on Solana, WIF benefits from fast transactions and low fees. The coin focuses on creating a fun and engaging experience for users. In the current market cycle, WIF may attract attention due to its unique theme and the growing interest in meme coins. Its potential lies in community growth and leveraging social media trends. Investors interested in meme coins might find WIF appealing. BONK: Solana’s Shiba Inu meme coin empowering the community BONK is a Solana-based meme coin with a Shiba Inu mascot that aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. It surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing and serves as a “community coin,” airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of memecoins, BONK’s integration into the growing Solana ecosystem, including the launch of the decentralized exchange BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player. The coin looks attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion While MEW, POPCAT, WIF, and BONK show limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by the end of presale, with potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following successful tokens, it builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

The registration, which was revealed in a post on X, has led users to anticipate a potential token launch, which would mean a marketplace airdrop. Earlier this year, the Cayman Islands announced new amendments to its Virtual Assets Act, providing licensing for virtual asset platforms while updating its anti-money laundering act. The new update established the region as the go-to place for friendly crypto-policy and a prime location for business. Cayman Island general registry showing OPENSEA’s Foundation registration | Waleswoosh via X Is OpenSea making its comeback? Some months ago, OpenSea CEO and co-founder Devin Finzer hinted at a resurgence of the platform, noting that the marketplace is planning to make a comeback. In his post on X, Finzer said the platform needs to take a step back to come back the right way. “To really innovate, sometimes you have to take a step back and reimagine everything. So we built a new OpenSea from the ground up,” Finzer said. We've been quietly cooking at @opensea To really innovate, sometimes you have to take a step back and reimagine everything So we built a new OpenSea from the ground up Sails up in December ⛵️ https://t.co/HaU1bDm29S — Devin Finzer (dfinzer.eth) (@dfinzer) November 4, 2024 Although he refused to give further details at the time, he added that the firm intends to launch a new and improved platform. Furthermore, the OpenSea handle on X shared a link that led to a waiting list page that asked users to connect their wallets. A DappRadar-affiliated handle mentioned that there is serious hype about the new platform, hinting that the platform could launch a token. While OpenSea has yet to provide any detailed explanation or statement, users are going off with a theory of a likely token airdrop. When the first announcement came months ago, there was no likelihood of an airdrop happening because of OpenSea’s United States-based operations. However, this new development has sparked renewed optimism that the platform may reward its users. Matter Labs’ Golem also took to his X handle to drop his opinion , drumming up hopes that the platform rewards early users. “Opensea officially registers a foundation in the Cayman Islands. This means that an OpenSea token is coming. I pray that they reward their OG users, myself & many others who came up on NFTs & OpenSea in 2021. They have the chance to turn everything around,” he said. Users anticipate OpenSea’s attempt to win back loyalists The consensus is how OpenSea intends to win back its loyalists, seeing other platforms already snatching them up. A user mentioned that OpenSea might decide to follow marketplaces like Blur and Magic Eden, to issue tokens and incentivize its loyalists. This is not the first time that OpenSea will attempt to reinsert itself in the NFT conversation, with the platform announcing zero fees in an attempt to retake the lead from Blur. Blur, on the other hand, continues to hold on steady in front, dominating the NFT marketplace in trading volume. OpenSea is second, while OKX is not too far behind in third place. The company made a statement when it entered the market, incentivizing users with token airdrops at the end of every trading season. Blur gave a user $11 million in Blur tokens after the marketplace concluded its second trading season in 2023. Magic Eden also followed in the same direction, promising its users airdrops for their activities on the platform. The platform’s native token, ME, rose to $13.10 before falling by about 70%, much to the discontent of its users. Users claimed the platform’s application had bugs which affected the claiming process.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-bitcoin-reserve-trumpres-solana-memecoin-will-explode-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In a new CNBC interview, Dan Morehead says that he thinks Bitcoin and crypto still have more room to the upside this cycle. Morehead notes that his firm has accumulated positions in three altcoins including the layer-1 protocol Solana ( SOL ). “The fun thing about crypto is we’ve been doing this for 11 years, and Bitcoin has a little bit more than doubled this year… On average, it has done that for 11 years in a row. So crypto going up double is not remarkable. We’re normally long because the markets are going to go up another huge amount, another order of magnitude possibly. We’re typically long. We’re always just looking at which other tokens are interesting. We have a big position in TON, Telegram’s token, Solana, ONDO. Those are some of ours.” In May of this year, Morehead revealed that Toncoin ( TON ) is Pantera Capital’s “largest investment ever.” According to Morehead, TON is in a unique position to leverage Telegram’s 900 million monthly active users. “99.999% of blockchain projects are a tech idea trying to create a community – from nothing. According to CoinMarketCap, there are more than 23,000 cryptocurrencies. That’s a hard road for most. Telegram is a community integrating blockchain technology. That’s just got to be easier.” At time of writing, TON is trading for $6.25. ONDO is the native asset of Ondo Finance, a decentralized exchange protocol focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWA). At time of writing, ONDO is trading for $1.85.

37679559,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105151,1734275621,Here is How Much Dogecoin You Need to Hold for Retirement if DOGE Hits $4,"This piece analyzes how much Dogecoin (DOGE) you need to hold for retirement if its price reaches $4, with insights on investment strategies and potential returns. As 2024 wraps up, Dogecoin has been one of the top-performing crypto assets in the market. At its current price of $0.4000, it boasts a year-to-date return of 355%.Meanwhile, considering Dogecoin's lowest value of the year at $0.07497 and its 2024 peak of $0.4835, holders have seen a 545% return on investment.This performance affirms Dogecoin's prospects for holders, and optimism continues to run high that the meme coin could indeed be a path to life-changing wealth for its investors.For instance, widely followed market commentator Altcoin Moe recently boldly asserted that Dogecoin would retire many people, proposing a 6X potential return.Retiring with DogecoinThe idea of retiring on Dogecoin hinges on two factors: the amount invested and DOGE's future price appreciation. Retirement thresholds vary widely depending on geography, lifestyle, and economic conditions.For example, in low-cost regions, $500,000 to $1 million may suffice for retirement. Meanwhile, in higher-cost areas like major U.S. cities, a comfortable retirement could require $2 million or more.Given these benchmarks, let's examine what it would take for DOGE to help an investor achieve financial independence.How Much Dogecoin to Hold to Become a Millionaire?Assuming an investor starts with a $10,000 investment at DOGE's current price of $0.4000, they would acquire 25,000 tokens. This portfolio would expand to a value of $500,000 if the price of Dogecoin rises to $20. Notably, analysts like Ali Martinez have suggested this possibility for Dogecoin by 2025.At a $20 price, Dogecoin would attain a market cap of $2.9 trillion. Critics consider this scenario ambitious, making the likelihood of it happening slim. However, investors willing to commit more capital could reduce the required price target for retirement.If an investor commits more funds to Dogecoin, say $100,000, this would buy a portfolio with 250,000 DOGE tokens. In this case, the investor would become a millionaire if the price of Dogecoin reaches $4 , a more reachable target for DOGE in the short term than $20.Meanwhile, even a $50,000 investment in Dogecoin would elevate an investor to millionaire status if DOGE hits $8.Early Adopters Have an EdgeInvestors who entered DOGE early have the most significant advantage.

If DOGE hits $0.80, the same investor would realize $1.25 million.Essentially, while Dogecoin offers the potential for life-changing gains, retiring on DOGE requires careful planning, significant capital, or early adoption.Although these projections may seem appealing, it's crucial to recognize that they are based on speculative evaluations.

Analyst Shows That $3, $7, $14 Do Not Look Far","Dan Gambardello, a prominent cryptocurrency market analyst, has unveiled an optimistic forecast for Cardano (ADA) in the upcoming bull cycle. Gambardello believes that Cardano could achieve significant price milestones, including a $7 valuation and even a $14 peak, which would bring its market capitalization to an impressive $500 billion. This ambitious projection suggests an 11-fold increase from current levels, reflecting the analyst’s confidence in the unfolding supercycle. While bold, these predictions are grounded in Cardano’s historical performance and expanding ecosystem. The Cardano milestones of $3, $7, and $14 do not look far at all when you open up a daily chart. Super. Cycle. pic.twitter.com/NvSw0p7z4o — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 13, 2024 Recent Price Trends and Milestones At press time, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.12, marking a 0.24% drop in the past 24 hours. ADA needs to rise 177% from its current price to reach the $3.10 all-time high. Recent trends, however, demonstrate the asset’s capability for rapid growth. In November, the asset surged by 257%, climbing from $0.3214 to a two-year high of $1.1471. This performance suggests that reclaiming the $3 level may not be an overly ambitious goal for the cryptocurrency. To reach $7, the token would need a 525% price increase, resulting in a market capitalization of approximately $245 billion. On the other hand, achieving a $14 price target would necessitate a 1,150% gain, pushing the market cap to the half-trillion-dollar mark. Historical Performance Supports Optimism While a 1,150% increase may seem daunting, some Cardano supporters argue it is achievable based on the asset’s historical trends. For example, during the last bull market, ADA experienced a remarkable 17,364% increase from its cycle low to its all-time high. The token’s lowest point during the last cycle was $0.01913 in March 2020. By September 2021, ADA had surged to $3.161, marking a 164-fold increase in value. Proponents believe that the $14 target for this cycle may even be conservative, compared to its previous performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Driving Optimism Beyond historical trends, the asset has made significant strides in development and partnerships, positioning itself for long-term growth. The network has recently formed alliances with major blockchain projects such as Bitcoin, Ripple, Stellar, and Dogecoin. Additionally, influential industry leaders, including Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse and Stellar’s Jed McCaleb , have expressed support for Cardano (ADA). These partnerships and endorsements add credibility to its growth potential. Founder Charles Hoskinson has also announced plans to build a dedicated team to establish the asset as the leading platform for Bitcoin DeFi applications. Furthermore, the network is actively working with universities and governments, including initiatives in Argentina, to expand its influence and adoption. Potential to Surpass Ethereum With its expanding ecosystem, technological advancements, and growing support, analysts like Gambardello believe the digital asset could challenge Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space. While Ethereum has long been viewed as the market leader, Cardano’s supporters argue that its undervaluation presents significant upside potential. As the cryptocurrency market gears up for its next bull run, the token’s path to $7 and beyond will depend on market dynamics, adoption, and technological innovation. While the $14 projection remains ambitious, proponents view it as a realistic goal for the next cycle. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Michael Sonnenshein became the chief operating officer of Securitize, the tokenization platform revealed this week. He had departed crypto asset manager Grayscale in May. Read more : Ex-Grayscale CEO shifts focus to tokenization Securitize is perhaps best known for helping BlackRock tokenize its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) in March. Backed by US Treasurys, the fund quickly grew to manage more than $500 million in assets. Sonnenshein told Blockworks in a Thursday interview that bringing real-world assets onchain is “one of the most exciting frontiers in the broader blockchain and digital assets space.” While tokenized fiat currencies (aka stablecoins) are well-established, US Treasurys are the collateral serving as the “substrate” for many capital markets transactions, Sonnenshein said. Read more: ‘Growing investor appetite’ in tokenized fund space: UBS “Continuing to build products that can address some of the inefficiencies and…move into offerings where the underlying assets are not dollars, but instead yield-bearing assets, I think is a very, very attractive value proposition,” he added. Galaxy also named Tony Paquette as its chief financial officer. He takes over for Alex Ioffe, who is set to move to a senior adviser role at the firm on Jan. 1. Paquette most recently held the CFO title at hedge fund firm Point72. Earlier in his career, he worked in Bank of America’s Corporate Investments Group and Treasury division, and held a head of funding and liability management role at JPMorgan Chase. Paquette then went on to oversee fintech company SoFi’s treasury, market risk, and regulatory and financial operations. In another notable people move this week, crypto-focused investment firm Hashdex appointed Mick McLaughlin as US head of distribution. His responsibilities will include growing the company’s US crypto ETFs . McLaughlin was formerly chief distribution officer at rival crypto asset manager Bitwise Asset Management. He also previously led Americas ETF distribution for Deutsche Bank and spent over a decade building the iShares business at BlackRock and Barclays. Meanwhile, Ethereum researcher Max Resnick announced his move to the Solana ecosystem , where he will join the research and development firm Anza after previously working at Consensys subsidiary Special Mechanisms Group. “In my first 100 days, I plan on writing a spec for as much of the Solana protocol as I can get to, prioritizing fee markets and consensus implementations where I believe I can have the highest impact,” Resnick wrote in a Dec. 9 X post .

The altcoin leader continues its sideways trading despite glimpses of a forward run through multiple resistance. Lower market sentiments have affected bulls significantly, as shown in recent whale movements out of the ecosystem. New market data released by the firm shows dwindling confidence for a $5K resistance level break. Currently, traders believe it only has an 8% chance of hitting the market despite increasing inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs . Steve Dawson, Derive’s head of research, noted a 17% chance of tapping the mark at its peak. Frequent price grips and corrections lowered Ethereum’s chances of hitting $5K. ETH stands at $3,702 at press time, 35% away from the much-anticipated target. Unlike Bitcoin and other altcoins like Solana , institutional flows didn’t help ETH this year. Ethereum Bulls May Defy Odds Although the price target is far up for most users, Ethereum Bulls projects a massive uptrend based on swinging macro factors. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), ETH contributor Eric Conner flagged the increasing inflow into ETH ETFs, tipping a supply-side crisis. Similarly, a crypto trader, Pentosh, noted that the network is changing in terms of inflow with little resistance to a new all-time high. “ Much like this thread with BTC, $ETH is having structural changes as well as the beginning of consistent and large ETF flows.

Last week, the asset’s funds saw the largest institutional flows, beating July’s high when spot ETH ETFs were approved.

37676983,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98924,1734273338,Binance Founder Projects High-Scale Bitcoin Government Adoption in Ten Years,"Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao pointed to increased government adoption of the asset in the next ten years. In an interview , he highlighted its use-case as the future of money to drive massive investment. This will increase the asset’s price as well as the wider crypto sentiment. Zhao hinted at more strategic Bitcoin reserves for countries to flip negative macro realities. Talks around a Bitcoin reserve in the United States gained momentum in the run-up to the U.S. Elections. With a rising national debt, crypto enthusiasts tip the asset to offset debt and promote finance and cross-border payments. A possible US backing could influence other jurisdictions to adopt the top crypto for payments and a reserve. After the U.S. election, the price of Bitcoin hit new milestones, shaking off previous corrections and setting the tone for positive projections. Trading above $100K, bulls set sights on a higher rally on the back of increased institutional adoption. These inflows to the asset could spike growth coupled with government adoption in the coming decade. Bitcoin’s Utility Over Gold Zhao highlighted the advantages Bitcoin (BTC) has over gold amid recent adoption. Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory backed by heavy institutional buys , with bulls projected over-the-top surges for the crypto leader in five years. Gold and Bitcoin are popular as a store of value for varying groups of investors with a decade-long debate on utilities. In a recent interview, Zhao noted that Bitcoin is more scarce, coupled with new use cases that could fuel its price. Bitcoin is termed digital gold because of its portability and access to a wider adoption net, which users say helps its case against precious metals. According to him, the scarcity of the asset will drive more investment in the coming years. On the other hand, the world doesn’t know the total supply of gold despite its availability for centuries. “I think it should be way more than that (a 16 trillion market cap), as you said it has many advantages over gold and gold is not a limited asset, people control the supply of gold by not mining and we don’t know how much they are.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

37676805,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627665,1734272917,Crypto startups have attracted more than $1 billion in VC funding since Donald Trump’s election,"Crypto startups have raised more than $1 billion in funding from venture capital firms since Donald Trump was elected President, according to data from Defillama. The new data showcases just how Trump’s victory has impacted crypto deal-making. Defillama data shows that VC funding for crypto startups in November was $796.41 million, while December is already at $511.48 million. Thus, the amount of funds raised by crypto startups in Q4 has already crossed $2 billion, more than the $1.7 billion that startups raised in Q3. VCs crypto investments since 2019. Source: Pitchbook While this marks a resurgence in crypto fundraising per quarter, it remains to be seen whether Trump’s momentum will be enough to make Q4 the biggest quarter for crypto startups in 2024. So far, Q1 has seen the biggest fundraising at $2.85 billion. Whether Q4 will beat that mark remains uncertain, but it looks to be on track. Nevertheless, VC interest in crypto remains low compared to the peak in 2022. Crypto startup fundraising peaked at $11.22 billion in Q1 of 2022. Since then, interest has declined due to the crypto industry’s struggles, including regulatory challenges. VCs bullish in expectation of regulatory clarity The rise in crypto funding is not completely surprising. It started in October and mirrors the general reaction of the crypto industry, first to the likelihood of Trump winning and, after the election, to his victory. With prices pumping and Bitcoin crossing $100,000, VCs are bullish on the crypto industry again and look forward to investing. This positive sentiment is fueled by the expected regulatory clarity that many believe the Trump administration will bring to the industry. With Trump already replacing the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler with a pro-crypto nominee and several pro-crypto people expected to join his cabinet, many believe the administration will allow the industry to thrive. Even crypto founders, including Solana’s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, have called on crypto startups to move to the US for the upside. Coinfund managing partner Chris Perkins also noted that regulatory overhaul will increase the number of startup deals. Perkins said: “It’s going to be a lot of cleanup. … People don’t realize how big a deal regulatory derisking is. It’s the biggest impediment to institutional adoption.” VCs are interested in other high-potential crypto sectors, such as tokenization, DeFi, stablecoins, infrastructure, and AI, which they consider the most attractive. Meanwhile, a few concerns remain about the Trump administration and whether he could achieve all his promises. This is not the first time that VCs and traditional finance have shown strong interest in the crypto sector, but many believe this episode will be different. For one, Trump appears very committed to achieving his pro-crypto plans and has a willing Congress backing him. Still, there are concerns that reality could fall below expectations. Avalanche and OG Foundation’s $250M raises lead Q4 deals Meanwhile, Layer-1 blockchain Avalanche is still the biggest raiser of Q4, receiving $250 million in a private, locked token sale led by Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital, and Dragonfly. Over 40 firms were involved in the token sale. Crypto-AI startup OG Foundation also raised $250 million in November in a token presale, while the affiliated developer OG Labs also raised $40 million in seed funding led by Hack VC, Delphi Digital, OKX Ventures, and Samsung Next. Beyond these two, most of the fundraising in this quarter has been for below $40 million, with Trump-backed World Liberty Financial raising $30 million, Klickl with $25 million, USDX Money with $45 million, and StakeStone with $22 million. Projects attracting investment fall into AI-crypto, real-world assets (RWA), DeFi, L1 and L2 networks, DePIN, and payments.

37676221,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627739,1734271644,Bitcoin adoption unshaken despite Microsoft’s decision,"The Bitcoin adoption wave appears unshaken by Microsoft’s shareholders’ decision not the add the asset to its portfolio when they met as scheduled on December 10. Before the meeting, there was little optimism for a Bitcoin victory. The board of directors had already decided against adding the asset to the company’s balance sheet. If the proposal had been approved, it would have immediately sparked another wave of momentum for the asset. Aside from the asset seeing a likely surge in price, it would have also started another buying spree, one led by corporations this time. The surge would have also BTC, which is still sustaining a Trump-fuelled run to greater heights, creating a batch of new millionaires among the elites and retail traders alike. A new Bitcoin buying spree is on the horizon All indications point to a renewed Bitcoin buying spree in the crypto industry. With Microsoft deciding against the asset, firms and retailers are stepping up. According to the think tank in charge of Microsoft’s proposal The National Center for Public Policy Research, the next company that is thinking about adding BTC to its balance sheet is Amazon. Amazon shareholders have scheduled an April meeting to vote on a Bitcoin proposal. The shareholders will vote on a proposal similar to Microsoft’s, requesting the company to consider BTC as a treasury asset. With BTC above the $100,000 mark and the regulatory clarity the Trump administration promised the crypto industry, other companies might be looking to follow in this direction. With more shareholders also seeing the potential of the asset, they might be forced to call for a consensus to vote on their firms adopting Bitcoin. If the firms refuse, it could lead to backlash from shareholders and the public. It would be a case of shareholders urging the companies to invest in an asset that they approve. This will mean more firms may gravitate toward Bitcoin to boost shareholder value, a win for the cryptocurrency. Presently, the largest publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin have some affiliation with Bitcoin, including Coinbase Global and Microstrategy. Although there is an exception like in the case of Tesla. Most of them are buying Bitcoin because they need to, with Coinbase Global a typical example. The firm has an exchange where people buy and sell the asset. Effect on investors and BTC’s broader outlook While Microsoft’s decision is a setback in the wider adoption push, investors are hoping for a new set of corporations to push Bitcoin forward. For that to happen, the people outside the crypto industry need to see the asset as secure and worthy of long-term investment. In terms of profit, investors need a renewed surge of shareholder activism for Bitcoin adoption to recoup huge profits from the asset. In a recent talk held by the National Center for Public Policy Research, the think tank chose Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor to give a talk on why Microsoft needs to buy Bitcoin. In his speech, Saylor said that if Microsoft could purchase $100 million in BTC every year, it would push the market cap of the company to trillions. Meanwhile, there is a stronger argument for holding Bitcoin, as individual investors are still supporting the asset. With support from Wall Street and, very soon, the White House, hope is on the horizon. A notable purchase by one of the tech titans in Silicon Valley could set off another buying spree. While Microsoft may have dashed investors’ hopes by refusing to make a statement by voting for Bitcoin, Amazon will have its opportunity soon.

37676028,https://crypto.news/?p=14319576,1734271605,Project Garuda takes flight: First phase of Indonesia’s Digital Rupiah achieved,"Bank Indonesia has completed the Proof of Concept (PoC) for its Wholesale Rupiah Digital Cash Ledger. This initiative advances the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) development through Project Garuda. Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo announced that the central bank has completed the “Immediate State,” representing the first phase of the Rupiah Digital exploration journey. The development aligns with the bank’s mandate as Indonesia’s sole currency issuer and responds to the rapid growth of the digital financial economy. “This achievement is a manifestation of Bank Indonesia’s commitment to the development of the Rupiah Digital in response to the rapid growth of the digital financial economy,” Warjiyo stated in the official report. According to Bank Indonesia economist Fransiskus Xaverius Tyas Prasaja , the PoC validated the required technical capabilities using distributed ledger technology (DLT). The testing phase showed that DLT-based solutions could effectively meet the requirements of the Rupiah Digital business model. You might also like: Bitcoin to $180k? Expect a 30% correction, warns VanEck The technical implementation involved testing across two DLT platforms: Corda, developed by R3, and Hyperledger Besu, developed by Kaleido. Both platforms were tested through 55 scenarios, focusing on three core business processes: issuance, redemption, and fund transfer. The PoC revealed that the DLT platforms successfully integrated with conventional systems using existing standards and the ISO 20022 standard. Smart contracts showed better transaction efficiency and flexibility for future Rupiah Digital development. The central bank’s whitepaper , “Project Garuda: Navigating the Rupiah Digital Architecture,” states two remaining phases – the Intermediate State and End State – in Indonesia’s CBDC development roadmap. The successful completion of this initial phase positions Indonesia among the growing number of nations actively advancing their digital currency initiatives.

Experts Predict Massive Price Gains Just Like Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Saw,"The post DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next 5x Crypto Star? Experts Predict Massive Price Gains Just Like Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Saw appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto space is heating up, with many cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) seeing big price gains recently. But now, a new name is making headlines— DTX Exchange (DTX) . Many experts believe that this phase six presale star, which has already given early buyers a 500% return, could see the same growth potential as these top crypto coins. They foresee a potential 5x surge for DTX in 2025, which could make it one of the best tokens to watch for fast but explosive returns. DTX Exchange (DTX) Seen as an Altcoin Not To Miss Out On Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) offered something few had tried before: Ethereum opened the doors for DeFi with smart contracts, while Shiba Inu took advantage of the meme culture. Similarly, DTX Exchange (DTX) is making its path by combining the best of CEX and DEX, thus providing a one-stop-shop solution for traders. On it, people will be able to trade over 120K asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, crypto coins, etc. This will be made possible thanks to the VulcanX blockchain. The testnet for this blockchain was recently launched, making headlines with its TPS of over 100,000. The hype is intense for DTX Exchange, which has now raised over $10.1M in its crypto ICO event. During this event, traders can buy its native token DTX for a discount. Those holding DTX can give input on future DTX Exchange products and more. Currently, it is worth $0.12, which is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. But a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to push this altcoin price to $0.20 – a 66% return for all who buy DTX. Poseidon: The Price of Ethereum (ETH) Could Reach $10K Ethereum (ETH) is a top 5 cryptocurrency showing green price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the Ethereum price increased around 20% in the past month alone, moving between nearly $3,200 and close to $4,000. Crypto analyst Poseidon also excited traders with his Ethereum price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers that once this altcoin breaks past $4,000, nothing could stop it from reaching $10,000. Nevertheless, while Ethereum looks to be in a good spot right now, DTX Exchange clearly has some advantages. For instance, Ethereum has a TPS of 12-15, while DTX Exchange surpasses that by a long shot with a TPS of over 100K. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Break Out Soon, Bullish Indicators Show Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another token rising on the price charts. When it comes to Shiba Inu price movement, it has jumped nearly 15% on the one-month chart. Not only that, CoinMarketCap shows that its market cap grew from $14B to $16B in that period. According to crypto analyst Whales HQ, this meme coin is on the cusp of a big breakout. This Shiba Inu price prediction is backed by its technical analysis. TradingView shows that this meme coin is valued above its 30-day EMA ($0.000027) and its 50-day EMA ($0.000025). But, it is worth noting that the Shiba Inu coin has a market cap in the billions. In other words, although it may see a price surge, it may not be as big as people expect. On the other hand, DTX boasts a smaller market cap which means faster price growth with less money needed. Can DTX Exchange Be a Crypto Star Like Ethereum (ETH) & Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Traders have learned from Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) that being an early buyer can yield life-changing returns. Since DTX Exchange (DTX) will have a fair launch where everyone may benefit, and it has over 300K wallet addresses so far, it could be the next big thing in the crypto market. Some experts even hint at a potential 5x surge for this altcoin in 2025.

These digital assets, priced below $1, provide a low entry point and significant upside as they approach key psychological price thresholds. The $1 barrier often marks a critical milestone in a token's journey, triggering widespread attention, increased adoption, and a surge in market value. While investing in penny cryptos requires careful analysis and strategy, they present a unique chance to get in early on projects poised for rapid growth. Among the standout contenders, Lightchain AI offers unparalleled innovation, positioning itself as a leader in the next wave of crypto evolution. For investors ready to seize the opportunity, penny cryptos offer a gateway to potentially life-changing gains. The Significance of the $1 Psychological Barrier in Crypto Markets In the world of cryptocurrencies, the $1 price point carries significant psychological weight. It symbolizes a project's transition from obscurity to recognition, often accompanied by increased trading volumes and a broader investor base. Breaking this barrier can drive media attention and heightened market sentiment, further propelling prices upward. For tokens currently priced below $1, the journey to surpass this threshold often reflects the maturity and adoption of the underlying project. However, not all penny cryptos are created equal—only those with robust technology, clear use cases, and strong market positioning are likely to make this leap.

37675202,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627723,1734269571,China reveals plans to clean up AI content distorting classic literature and ideologies,"China has embarked on a crackdown on some AI-generated content due to fears it might undermine and endanger Chinese classical literature and its leading ideologies. This also follows a rise in generative AI particularly the spread of meme culture, which, although humorous, has been found to play a big role in shaping cultural ideas. Beijing argues that AI’s adaptations from its Chinese classic television dramas and literature are “highly deceptive.” Some parents also agree and are concerned that AI-made jokes might lead to a loss of respect for traditional classics. China calls for a clean-up of AI-made jokes According to SCMP , memes have been cited as one of the “key culprits” the Chinese authorities have cited recognized as risks to its ideologies and culture. Like memes, edited video clips primarily made for humor and social media traction have also proven to be part of China’s challenges in regulating AI. The SCMP revealed that the agency that oversees state broadcasting – the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) last week issued a notice calling on its supervisory bodies to “clean up” all such videos that use AI to make caricatures of Chinese culture . The broadcast watchdog noted the increasing trend of altering video clips from shows including Dream of the Red Chamber and Journey to the West. These shows are based on novels that have been hailed as some of the greatest works of Chinese literature. The NRTA added these AI-generated jokes “seek to gain traffic without boundaries and disrespect classic intellectual properties.” It added that these videos also go against the spirit of original works and might constitute copyright infringement. According to the broadcast watchdog, the videos also challenge traditional cultural perceptions. The country’s top internet watchdog – Cyberspace Administration of China, has also repeatedly made calls to clean up video content that could be harmful to the young. These calls also align with China’s ongoing campaigns to control online misinformation as well as clean up information not suitable or contrary to traditional values. Social media platforms in China still carry the implicated videos Largely characterized by humor and sarcastic tone, the AI-remastered videos can still be found on Chinese social media platforms. Some of the videos are clearly labelled as AI-generated while others are not. In one of the said videos, characters from the show, Journey to the West are featured happily riding motorcycles on their arduous journey. The show is based on a 16th-century novel about a Buddhist monk on a journey to India in the seventh century. Beijing-based lawyer Gu Yu said that while these videos did not cause much harm to the public, they could also influence people unfamiliar with the original works. “While new technologies should be approached with a degree of tolerance to encourage public innovation, it is also crucial to take action against works that distort basic values.” – Yu However, Yu highlighted that China’s AI regulation is still in an “exploratory phase,” with regulation and lawmaking lagging behind technological advances. Yu also maintains that without sufficient legal precedents, it might be challenging to create comprehensive laws. Measures are, therefore, introduced when problems arise. Policing AI content might be a challenge for China According to SCMP, the NRTA notice is a clear indication of one of the latest challenges the Asian economy faces in AI governance. The country is in a fix trying to strike a balance between using the technology to optimize operations and boost the economy while also trying to tackle the adverse impacts of AI, such as the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. It also has to deal with handling its potential impact on public perception. In China, traditional culture is critical to the Communist Party’s governance philosophy. It sees this as part of its cultural reconstruction campaign. The country has made several efforts to regulate AI technology including its “ Administrative Provisions on Deep Synthesis in internet-based Information Services ,” which was implemented in January last year. This requires labeling content that might mislead or confuse the public. Last year, China also took some measures to regulate generative AI services and issued guidelines for multimedia content labeling standards. Some Chinese nationals support regulating the sector and cleaning up AI videos from state broadcasters. The NRTA’s request to clean up AI-remastered videos was a trending topic over the past week and ignited discussions on the social media platform Weibo microblog, attracting more than 43.4 million views and over 14,000 discussions. Some argued that without oversight, such content could lead to serious “information pollution.” They argued that young children in junior school who have not yet read the Four Great Chinese Classical Novels are already exposed to funny videos of the Monkey King fighting with Jia Baoyu. Monkey King and Jia Baoyu are the protagonists in Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber respectively. Other online commentators have different opinions, arguing officials are “overseeing too much” limiting people’s freedom to enjoy “entertaining videos.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-cleans-ai-content-alterings-literature/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37675202.jpeg

Whale accumulating XRP and Bull flag formation are two factors that can take XRP to $4.Based on data from Santiment, XRP whales holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP acquired an additional 100 million XRP tokens between December 7 and 10. During this period, the price of XRP dropped by 27.2%, from $2.61 to $1.90.These whales' holdings did not decrease during XRP's downturn. Instead, their cumulative balance rose from approximately 4.71 billion XRP tokens to around 4.80 billion as they deployed an additional $200 million in capital. XRP chart from Santiment showing whale accumulation | Ali Martinez XRP Whales Bought 1.1B XRP in 30 DaysThis latest accumulation is in line with a consistent trend over the past 30 days, during which these whales have continued consolidating their holdings. In mid-November, their collective holdings stood at 3.71 billion XRP. With the current level at 4.8 billion tokens, they have added approximately 1.1 billion XRP to their portfolio within a month. During this period, the asset's price has risen from around $0.50 to $2.87.Interestingly, when XRP first reached its seven-year high of $2.87 in the first week of December, these whales took some profit, as illustrated by the slight dip in their holdings. However, they have since used the price dip to buy more XRP at lower prices.Their savvy move is already paying off gradually, as XRP has risen to $2.43 since the Tuesday crash.XRP Bull FlagWhile market participants expect an uptrend continuation to much higher levels, technical indicators suggest that XRP's recent comeback may be on hold for a while, with signals pointing to a potential another bearish market.In a tweet, Ali Martinez highlighted that while XRP's price patterns continue to form a bull flag, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on XRP's four-hour chart. Based on this, he emphasized that XRP could face another correction before the much-anticipated breakout beyond the $2 price range. Martinez believes the run toward $4 will begin after the anticipated brief pullback. He first pointed out the potential for a $4 price run on Monday during the dip, noting that the asset was forming a fourth bullish pennant.Previous instances saw XRP rise from $0.69 to $1.10, followed by a correction and then a resumption to $1.50. The cool-off from this movement eventually propelled XRP to $2.87. With the current pullback, the next resumption is expected to push XRP to $4.40, according to Ali Martinez.Notably, as of press time, XRP has already dipped by 4%, touching lows of $2.30 after reaching $2.46 yesterday.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/15/here-are-two-factors-that-can-rise-xrp-to-4/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-two-factors-that-can-rise-xrp-to-4,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Why It Could Happen This Cycle,"Both analysts and crypto buffs still find Solana (SOL) fascinating. Solana has shown grit and optimistic momentum while the more significant market negotiates waves of turmoil. Several technical and market signals support analysts' prediction of a likely surge in the current cycle to be $1,200. Three White Soldiers Pattern Suggests Reversal of Bullish Nature Prominent technical analyst Altcoin Archive has noted the unusual Three White Soldiers pattern on Solana's monthly chart. Often, before significant price rises, this candlestick pattern is generally considered a powerful bullish reversal indicator. Should this trend continue, Solana might be about to have a substantial breakthrough. Historical patterns confirm this study. Following U.S. election cycles, the cryptocurrency market has tended to surge, and analysts predict that Solana would gain even more positive momentum in such times. Macroeconomist Seth, who observed a bull flag development on Solana's daily chart, also shows great optimism. This pattern, marked by a brief consolidation period before starting the previous upswing, points to SOL perhaps breaking away from its present range. Should validation be confirmed, this might send the token near the $1,200 price point, indicating a dramatic change from its present value. Seasoned market analyst Joji compares Solana's present market structure with its bull run until 2021. Back then, SOL shot 884% from the same location. Joji claims that the present accumulation phase in Solana's chart could indicate yet another large-scale movement. Based on a 452.53% rise from its existing price, the analyst projects Solana might hit the $1,200 level in the next cycle. This study supports the more general view that Solana's creative technology, great scalability, and active community might drive its expansion in the approaching bull market. Technical indicators, historical data, and market conditions highlight the hope surrounding Solana's potential. Why Prospective Investors Should Think About Rexas Finance (RXS) Although Solana's bright future is appealing, Rexas Finance (RXS) is another cryptocurrency that could pique interest. This initiative has attracted interest because of its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization—offering a safe, quick, open platform for digitizing assets. Rexas Finance aims to democratize asset ownership so that people and companies may effortlessly tokenize bonds, real estate, artwork, and other physical objects. Its strong infrastructure and easy-to-use interface allow new and experienced users to access asset tokenization, broadening the audience for this technology. The project's presale events mirror its continuous success since they all sold out ahead of time. With tokens valued at $0.15, Rexas Finance has already raised $26,579,764 out of its $33,125,000 target in stage 10 of its presale. The fast token acceptance indicates that investors have great faith in the enterprise's ideas and possibilities. Rexas Finance is slated to sell its coins on three top-tier exchanges in early 2025 at an initial price of $0.20. The listing should increase demand for RXS tokens, hence raising their value. Rising from its present presale price of $0.15, analysts estimate that the token might soar to $44 by the end of 2025, a startling 29,233% rise. A recent Certik audit strengthens the platform's trustworthiness even more, guaranteeing that its security and operations satisfy the best industry criteria. Furthermore, the new listings of RXS tokens on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko give investors openness and accessibility, enabling them to instantly track the project's development. Rexas Finance is positioned as a leader in the developing industry of real-world asset tokenization as the cryptocurrency market enters what many predict to be a positive cycle. Rexas Finance is led by its creative platform and dedicated community since this new industry presents excellent development possibilities. Conclusion Although strong technical and market indications support Solana's chances of hitting $1,200 this cycle, investors should also take note of prospects in the developing tokenizing industry. Based on its emphasis on democratizing asset ownership and proven track record of investor confidence, Rexas Finance presents a remarkable value proposition. Both ventures show the transforming possibilities of blockchain technology in their respective domains, while Solana and Rexas Finance chart convincing paths forward.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES.

Beginning in 2020, it spent most of its first year varying around $1.50 before closing 2020 at $1.70, which was a dismal start by any measure for what would culminate in a stratospheric rise. Over four years, Solana's price jolted to an astounding $223.76, up an unheard-of 13,062%. Although this increase is impressive, Rexas Finance (RXS), priced at $0.15 during its presale, is expected to rise in a fraction of the time—just eight weeks—in the same proportion. Rexas Finance (RXS): A New Contender with Even a Lesser Timeframe Although Solana's development is an interesting narrative, Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast rising as a token ready to copy—if not surpass—that achievement. Unlike Solana, which took years to reach its present price, Rexas Finance (RXS) is predicted to rise a similar 13,062% in just eight weeks. Rexas Finance (RXS) sets itself apart by democratizing and simplifying the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The platform's users can quickly tokenize intellectual property, art, products, and real estate. By accomplishing this, Rexas Finance (RXS) closes the gap between conventional finance and blockchain, providing countless asset management and ownership opportunities. Rexas Finance (RXS) Performance in Presale Rexas Finance's (RXS) presale performance has already shown its market potential. The project's presale has raised over $27.36 million and is currently in stage 10. Priced at $0.15 as of writing, the coin has drawn much interest because of its creative use and investor-friendly strategy. Unlike many blockchain initiatives dependent on venture capital financing, Rexas Finance (RXS) has opted for a public presale approach, enabling regular investors to join its transforming journey. The crypto community has found resonance in this approach since it gives ordinary investors access to early on, high-potential projects. Furthermore, increasing Rexas Finance's (RXS) profile and generating greater interest in its presale is its recent listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Rexas Finance (RXS) is deliberately setting itself for a great start with intentions to list on three top-tier exchanges. Rexas Finance's (RXS) successful audit by top blockchain security company Certik is one of the elements encouraging confidence in it. Rigid standards of Certik audits are well-known, and their support of Rexas Finance gives the project legitimacy and trust. Attracting retail and institutional investors to the presale has been much aided by this. Projected Timeline for Rexas Finance (RXS) Growth Not only is Rexas Finance (RXS) unique in its idea but also in its exponential development possibilities. Industry analysts estimate that, in just eight weeks, RXS may rise from its presale price of $0.15 to almost $20, a 13,062% increase. Should this be successful, Rexas Finance will rank among the most profitable investments available in the crypto market. Unlike Solana, which needed years of consistent development and market adoption to reach its gains, Rexas Finance uses its innovative RWA tokenizing approach to quicken expansion. Rexas Finance (RXS) is positioned to reach quick acceptance by tackling a rising market demand for accessible and distributed asset tokenization. Rexas Finance (RXS) promises a paradigm change in asset ownership and management, not only about expected returns. A few clicks on its easy-to-use platform allows investors to tokenize and trade almost any real-world asset. Rexas Finance allows anyone to acquire fractional ownership of high-value real estate or tokenize intellectual property from anywhere globally. Furthermore, the project has attracted a devoted following by stressing security and openness. Rexas Finance has shown its will to create a reliable and inclusive ecosystem by selecting public presales and completing Certik audits. In conclusion, Solana's 13,062% increase over the past four years proves blockchain technology is transforming power. Rexas Finance (RXS) presents an unmatched chance for investors looking for faster profits. Rexas Finance is positioned to repeat Solana's success in a fraction of the time with its presale already surpassing expectations, strong technology basis, and clear road map for expansion. Rexas Finance (RXS) is the $0.15 altcoin to watch for anybody hoping to profit from the upcoming great crypto explosion.

However, its price tag can make it inaccessible to those seeking budget-friendly opportunities with similar growth potential. The hunt for alternatives that offer comparable performance at a more affordable price is on the rise.

The Ethereum counterparts have also enjoyed the momentum by attracting almost a billion dollars within the past week. BTC ETFs Keep the Momentum Going The initial 11 and now 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs have already broken several records in terms of massive net inflows in their first year. This is particularly true for BlackRock’s IBIT, which quickly became the largest of the bunch and continues to be the favorite among investors. The past five trading days solidified the recent trend that started even before the elections. On Monday, December 9, the funds attracted $489.1 million in net inflows, followed by $438.5 million on Tuesday, $223.1 million on Wednesday, $597.5 million on Thursday, and $428.9 million on Friday, finishing the week strong. Overall, the total numbers for this period shot up to $2,167.1 billion. Although it is lower than last week’s, it still means that more than $2 billion has been poured into the ETFs within just several days. IBIT led the charge during four of the trading days, with $394.1 million on Monday, $295.6 million on Tuesday, $431.6 million on Thursday, and $393 million on Friday. It saw no reportable flows on Wednesday, while Fidelity’s FBTC stood out with $121.9 million on that day. These substantial net inflows have positively impacted BTC’s price as the asset is up by 3% on a weekly scale and sits close to a new all-time high. ETH ETFs Are Doing Well, too The Ethereum ETFs have also enjoyed the past several weeks following their sluggish start. Their streak began even further back—on November 22—and they have yet to see a day in the red since. Once again, they recorded impressive numbers in the past week, attracting $149.8 million on Monday, $305.7 million on Tuesday, $102 million on Wednesday, $273.7 million on Thursday, and a more modest $23.6 million on Friday. The total now stands at $854.8 million. Interestingly, ETH’s price is actually down on a weekly scale by 2.5%. The asset jumped above $4,000 during the previous Friday but has been unable to maintain its momentum and now sits below $3,900 following a turbulent week.

37675500,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52217,1734268220,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: $1 Now Likelier Than Ever as Key Resistance Breaks, DOGE Whales Also Accumulate Rival $0.15 Token for Better Results","Dogecoin, the original meme coin, is generating excitement among investors and analysts as its price movements suggest a strong rally toward the $1 mark. Several analysts have pointed to patterns that show DOGE could soon join the $1 circle. Amidst this optimism, DOGE whales are accumulating a new token: Rexas Finance (RXS). This new entrant entered the scene in September and has since stolen the spotlight. Rounded Bottom Pattern Indicates a Rally A TradeView analyst, CobraVanguard, recently noted that Dogecoin’s weekly price chart has formed a rounded bottom pattern. The pattern follows an initial gradual decline, then stabilization, before recovery. The recovery often leads to significant upward movement. CobraVanguard expects the price movement to be powerful. Once the pattern is completed, he expects a surge toward $1 with a high target of $1.5. Elon Musk’s Influence and Whale Activity Elon Musk, the CEO of X and Tesla, remains a prominent figure in Dogecoin’s success. His support has historically boosted the coin’s price. CobraVanguard and many others believe that Musk’s influence is crucial in pushing Dogecoin to $1. Meanwhile, major cryptocurrency investors, known as whales, are actively accumulating DOGE tokens. In December alone, whales performed over $100,000 to $1 million worth of transactions, acquiring more than 240 million tokens in total. This significant accumulation indicates strong confidence in Dogecoin’s future growth. Bullish Indicators and Market Sentiment Other analysts have strengthened DOGE’s bullish outlook with their predictions. One analyst suggested that DOGE has created a rising wedge pattern, another bullish signal. Another independent analyst fueled optimism by saying Dogecoin is about to pull another god candle, which could directly push DOGE to $1. Popular analyst Trader Tardigrade pointed out a historical pattern that could lead DOGE to $1. He says Dogecoin’s price often experiences a parabolic rally after confirming a breakout above resistance. If history repeats itself, Dogecoin could achieve new highs soon. Rexas Finance (RXS): An Alternative on DOGE Whales Radar As investors anticipate DOGE movement to $1, whale investors have also diversified to another promising altcoin–Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance has captured these large investors with its promising outlook. Rising as a clear leader in the altcoin space, Rexas Finance attracts both institutional and retail investors. Its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) has positioned Rexas Finance as a pioneer in the financial sector. Tokenization turns RWAs like real estate and intellectual property into digital tokens, providing liquidity and global access into an industry valued at over $400 trillion. Blockchain technology lets these real-world assets split into smaller, tradable portions, facilitating more involvement in markets usually controlled by high-net-worth investors and institutions. Presale Success and Whale Interest The RXS presale has been a resounding success, underscoring the strong interest in its innovative model. Since its public presale launch in September, Rexas Finance has raised over $33 million across nine sold-out stages. It has already begun Stage 10 after successfully ending Stage 9. At this stage, RXS tokens are priced at $0.150, with the next stage set to increase to $0.175 before finally launching at $0.20. This progression promises early investors impressive returns of up to 566%. Boosting Investors’ Confidence Security has been a top priority for Rexas Finance, further solidifying investor confidence. The project has completed a rigorous Certik Audit that checks the reliability and safety of its code. This Certik Audit has given investors confidence in the project’s long-term viability. Rexas Finance has also been listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, allowing investors to track its progress in real time. Moreover, the project’s powerful vision and robust tokenomics fit the rising need for creative solutions in the financial industry. By tapping into the RWA market and leveraging blockchain technology, Rexas Finance creates a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized economy. As RXS approaches its official launch, its unique value proposition and proven success in presale stages make it a promising choice for investors. Experts believe it could rise sharply, surpassing $10 in the first few months. This makes it a lucrative investment to join. Conclusion Dogecoin’s rise to $1 is imminent, as analysts have pointed out several patterns supporting this. Meanwhile, DOGE whales are also accumulating another token, RXS. Rexas Finance’s captivating mission and presale success have attracted them. This has boosted investors’ confidence, marking Rexas Finance as one of the best projects to invest in right now. Twenty lucky winners will receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, and you can also enter to win.

Smart traders look for inexpensive assets with explosive potential, while investors seek high-priced tokens. This post will reveal five cryptocurrencies that are cheaper than your favorite fast food yet will provide massive rewards as the bull market takes steam. Regardless of your experience with cryptocurrencies or your inexperience, these affordable coins have the potential to lead you to financial prosperity. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is a promising crypto asset for investors seeking low-cost tokens with high growth potential. In its presale, RXS provides a pioneering platform for real-world asset tokenization at $0.15 per token. It allows users to fractionalize ownership of high-value assets, including real estate, gold, and collectibles. Rexas Finance brings blockchain and smart contracts to physical and digital markets, simplifying global asset transactions and opening avenues for investors. Asia investors can easily acquire a piece of a luxury property in Europe and generate passive income, overcoming geographical and financial constraints. RXS allows users to easily tokenize and exchange assets using tools like the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad and advanced automation features like the QuickMint Bot and GenAI. CertiK-audited smart contracts maintain security and transparency, building trust in the platform's growing community. RXS is attracting knowledgeable investors expecting big profits after raising $26.9 million in presale. Early adopters will profit tremendously from top-tier exchange listings and double-digit price estimates by 2025. Without startup money, the platform allows public engagement and rewards its community with a $1 million award. Ahead of the bull market, Rexas Finance's unique tokenization of real-world assets could turn small investments into large portfolios. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) has emerged as a cryptocurrency powerhouse, attracting attention from savvy investors because of its spectacular increase. On December 3, 2024, TRON's price rose 107.57% monthly to $0.4407. TRON trades at $0.2967, demonstrating its blockchain ecosystem's resilience despite price volatility. Beyond price action, TRON's strong network activity suggests a game-changing investment. TRON possesses all the characteristics of a portfolio multiplier and is a cost-effective cryptocurrency that has the potential to generate substantial profits by the conclusion of the bull market. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is a promising cryptocurrency that and has risen 258%, consolidating its status as an altcoin leader. It trades between $0.96 and $1.25, slightly below the $1.35 barrier. Analysts expect breaking this mark to spark a rapid rebound to higher prices, making it an excellent portfolio growth alternative. Technical indications support this optimism—ADA's 10-day moving average has surpassed the 100-day average, indicating strong upward momentum. A Russell's relative strength index (RSI) of 47 allows the currency to rise without becoming overbought. Cardano's capacity to surmount challenges and instill confidence in the market could transform the landscape during the peak altcoin season. ADA is an unmissable chance for investors seeking million-dollar returns from modest assets before the bull market takes off. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) is set to disrupt the cryptocurrency industry through its different partnerships and robust technical structure, which makes it ready for substantial growth during the next bull run. Stellar's breakthrough partnership with Félix and Bitso to revolutionize remittances for U.S.-based Latino immigrants is notable. This partnership addresses a fundamental financial need by using blockchain technology and the USDC stablecoin to move money to Latin America faster, cheaper, and more securely. XLM's recent rise is due to this initiative's increased utility and investor interest. Positive technical patterns like a symmetrical triangle and a descending wedge suggest a price surge to $0.90. After recent falls, purchase volume increased and $0.43 support strengthened XLM's rising prospects. Stellar's novel use cases and growing adoption provide investors with a compelling chance to turn a small investment into a $1 million portfolio before the bull market ends. Kas (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) trades at $0.1567, making it a strong contender for exponential growth in the bull market. The coin peaked above $0.19 before settling back to $0.16, indicating increased demand and volatility, typical of cryptocurrencies preparing for a large breakthrough. Kaspa's technical indicators are promising: a broadening wedge pattern breakout and a 64.84 RSI indicate bullish momentum. Kaspa's journey to $1, which would value roughly $25 billion, is ambitious but doable with a market size of $3.97 billion. Developers and investors are interested in its Proof-of-Work consensus process and fast transactions. Kaspa's ability to break its all-time high of $0.2075 and soar toward $1 offers early adopters a rare opportunity to multiply investments, making it a crypto gem that might turn a small position into a million-dollar portfolio before the bull market ends. Conclusion These five cryptocurrencies are leading the crypto market in turning little investments into big rewards. From Rexas Finance's groundbreaking asset tokenization platform to TRON's developer-friendly ecosystem, Cardano's bullish momentum, Stellar's transformative remittance solutions, and Kaspa's innovative consensus mechanism, each coin has a unique value proposition with exponential returns. Their low cost and disruptive potential make them must-watch assets for anybody looking to create a $1 million portfolio without breaking the bank as the bull market heats up. Take advantage of these hidden treasures before their value soars.

37673950,https://crypto.news/?p=14319574,1734267133,"Dogecoin vs Ripple: December’s best buy, and how each compares to Lightchain AI","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As December focuses on crypto, Dogecoin, Ripple, and Lightchain AI offer unique investment opportunities with strong growth potential. Table of Contents Dogecoin meme power and community strength Ripple institutional backing and cross-border payment dominance Lightchain AI unique features and long-term potential Head-to-head analysis utility, growth potential, and investor sentiment Why Lightchain AI stands out as the strongest contender Making the right choice for December investments As December brings a renewed focus on the crypto market , investors are carefully evaluating their options for profitable investments. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have long been favorites among traders, each offering unique appeals Dogecoin thrives on community support and memetic culture, while Ripple stands out for its institutional partnerships and dominance in cross-border payments. However, a new player, Lightchain AI , is emerging as a compelling alternative. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale phase , Lightchain AI is attracting attention for its unique approach to merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. This article explores how these three projects compare in terms of utility, growth potential, and investment viability, helping you make an informed choice for December. You might also like: Forecasts show SOL and Lightchain AI could explode: Here’s why Dogecoin meme power and community strength Dogecoin ’s rise to fame is a testament to the power of memes and community-driven momentum. Initially launched as a joke, Dogecoin has evolved into a mainstream cryptocurrency with a loyal following. Its popularity surged after endorsements from high-profile figures and its use for tipping and small transactions within its ecosystem. While Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its simplicity and vibrant community, it lacks substantial utility or technological features. The token’s reliance on market sentiment makes it highly volatile, with price movements often dictated by social media trends. For short-term traders, Dogecoin offers opportunities during bullish phases, but its lack of intrinsic value raises concerns about its long-term sustainability. Ripple institutional backing and cross-border payment dominance Ripple (XRP) is widely regarded as one of the most utility-driven cryptocurrencies in the market. Its primary focus is on solving inefficiencies in the global payment system, enabling faster and cheaper cross-border transactions. Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions and banks underscore its credibility and relevance in traditional finance. The ongoing legal battle with the SEC has introduced some uncertainty, but Ripple’s resilience and its potential for regulatory clarity make it an attractive choice for long-term investors. Unlike Dogecoin, Ripple’s value is tied to its real-world applications, particularly in facilitating seamless international transactions. However, Ripple’s centralized approach has been criticized for deviating from blockchain’s decentralized ethos, which may impact its appeal among crypto purists. Lightchain AI unique features and long-term potential Lightchain AI distinguishes itself from both Dogecoin and Ripple by integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain, creating a platform with unparalleled utility and creativity. At its core, Lightchain AI features the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for performing AI-specific tasks such as model training and optimization. This revolutionary approach ensures network security while contributing to advancements in AI. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) further enhances Lightchain AI’s capabilities, enabling developers to execute AI tasks seamlessly within a decentralized framework. These features position Lightchain AI as a versatile solution for industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, offering real-world applications beyond the speculative nature of many cryptocurrencies. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, Lightchain AI is not only accessible to early investors but also supported by a robust roadmap that includes a testnet launch in January 2025 and a mainnet activation in March 2025. Its focus on scalability, transparency, and utility ensures long-term relevance in the blockchain space. Head-to-head analysis utility, growth potential, and investor sentiment There is no denying that Dogecoin and Ripple have established a significant presence in the crypto market, but their appeal is primarily based on speculation and community sentiment. In contrast, Lightchain AI distinguishes itself with its focus on real-world solutions and technological creativity. When it comes to utility, Dogecoin falls short compared to Ripple and Lightchain AI. While it has found niche uses within its community, there are limited opportunities for mass adoption or use in practical applications. Ripple’s dominance in cross-border payments gives it a clear advantage, but Lightchain AI’s integration of artificial intelligence offers unparalleled potential for disruption in multiple industries. In terms of growth potential, all three projects have seen significant gains this year. However, Dogecoin’s lack of intrinsic value and reliance on market sentiment make it the riskiest option for long-term investment. Ripple’s ongoing legal battle may impact its trajectory, but its institutional partnerships and real-world applications offer a strong foundation for growth. Lightchain AI’s unique approach to merging blockchain with artificial intelligence makes it a compelling choice for long-term investors seeking innovative solutions. Investor sentiment also plays a crucial role in the success of these projects. Dogecoin and Ripple have strong, albeit different, communities backing them, while Lightchain AI’s presale phase has already garnered significant interest from early investors. As with any investment, thorough research and risk assessment should be conducted before making a decision. Why Lightchain AI stands out as the strongest contender While Dogecoin and Ripple each have their strengths, Lightchain AI emerges as the most compelling investment option for December. Its ability to integrate artificial intelligence into blockchain addresses pressing challenges in scalability, privacy, and real-world applications. The Proof of Intelligence consensus mechanism and AIVM ensure that Lightchain AI remains adaptable to industry needs, setting it apart from competitors. Furthermore, the ongoing Lightchain AI Presale, priced at just $0.003, provides a unique opportunity for early investors to engage with a project poised for significant growth. Its roadmap milestones, such as the mainnet launch and ecosystem expansion, demonstrate a commitment to continuous innovation and adoption. For those seeking a balance of utility, scalability, and long-term potential, Lightchain AI offers a more sustainable investment choice compared to Dogecoin’s speculative nature or Ripple’s centralized focus. Making the right choice for December investments In a rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, choosing the right investment requires a careful evaluation of utility, growth potential, and market sentiment. Dogecoin thrives on community-driven momentum but lacks the technological foundation for sustained growth. Ripple offers utility and credibility in cross-border payments but faces challenges from its centralized structure and regulatory issues. Lightchain AI , with its unique features, scalable infrastructure, and focus on real-world applications, represents the next wave of blockchain innovation. Its presale price of just $0.003 makes it an accessible and attractive option for investors looking to capitalize on a project with transformative potential. As December unfolds, Lightchain AI stands out as a forward-thinking platform that combines utility, scalability, and creativity, making it the strongest contender for both short-term gains and long-term success.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase Assets announces the addition of decentralized exchange (DEX) Parcl ( PARCL ) to its roadmap, triggering a nearly 50% rally in just 24 hours. Coinbase uses the listing roadmap for transparency and to prevent insider trading on coins prior to them being listed. Being placed on the listing roadmap means the firm has determined the asset will likely be available for trading in the future. Parcl is a platform that lets users trade and invest in real estate via synthetic assets without having to actually own any property. Synthetic assets are blockchain-based representations of real-world assets, such as stocks, securities and property. Parcl works by providing users with global city indexes and allowing them to acquire tokens that represent a stake in a specific index. “City Indexes represent the aggregate value of real estate in a particular city. Instead of trading individual properties, you can trade the index price that represents the median price per square foot or square meter, giving you diversified exposure to an entire city’s real estate market.” Some of the cities tracked for trading by Parcl include New York, Miami Beach, San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dubai and a lot more. At time of writing, Parcl is trading for $0.516, down over 5% on the day.

37673716,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27743,1734266660,Thailand Should Study Crypto to Remain Relevant,"Thaksin Shinawatra Encourages Thailand to get into Cryptocurrencies Former Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has urged Thailand to study cryptocurrencies so that they could be competitive in today’s fast-moving global digital economy. At the Intercontinental Hotel in Hua Hin, Shinawatra said, “We need to understand digital and its implication.”. “There are already so many cryptocurrencies. Some say in the future, we will have more currencies than countries. Thai people must think and understand this,” said Shinawatra. Without encouraging government investments in cryptocurrencies, Shinawatra urged that Thailand needed to move swiftly to be ahead of the digital race, particularly when international economies increasingly integrate blockchain and crypto technologies. Thailand’s Steps Towards a Digital Economy Regulatory Sandboxes for Crypto Innovation In August 2024, Thailand’s SEC unveiled a regulatory sandbox that would make doing business in digital assets more efficient. A regulatory sandbox allows the testing of new types of financial technologies in a controlled environment without being hit with immediate regulations. It’s a way to try and balance a strong digital economy with consumer protection. Digital Cash Distribution The ruling Pheu Thai political party decided to revive the economy in July 2024 by giving away 10,000 baht (around $280) to 45 million Thai residents. That digital cash initiative not only provided some instant financial respite but also showcased how the government is open to digital ways of solving economic issues. Crypto Adoption by Institutions Thailand is moving closer to institutional cryptocurrency adoption. In September 2024, Kasikornbank, the country’s second-largest bank, became the first licensed crypto custodian to offer its services to digital asset businesses with secure storage solutions. On the other hand, the SEC issued a proposal allowing mutual and private funds to invest in cryptocurrencies. This, according to Binance Thailand’s CEO Nirun Fuwattananukul, will significantly boost institutional participation in Thailand’s crypto market. Strengthening Global Crypto Partnerships Thailand is also actively collaborating with international entities to leverage blockchain technology. In October 2024, the Bank of Thailand partnered with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under Project Ensemble. The collaboration focused on testing tokenized cross-border settlements, reflecting Thailand’s commitment to aligning with global financial innovation trends. As the world increasingly adopts digital currencies, Thailand has much to do in research and regulation to keep up with the times. The Kingdom can further its position as a leader in the global digital economy by continuing sandbox experiments, supporting institutional adoption, and fostering international partnerships.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/thailand-should-study-crypto-to-remain-relevant/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

On Saturday night, his X account, followed by over 39 million fans, was hijacked and transformed into a billboard for a shady crypto memecoin scam. The fraudulent posts promoted a Solana-based coin called $ANITA, referencing Drake’s cartoon alter ego, Anita Max Wynn. The character is a nod to his well-documented love of gambling and the phrase “I need a max win.” The hackers weren’t playing around. They claimed $ANITA was officially launched in partnership with Stake, the crypto gambling platform closely associated with Drake. Screenshot of the suspended X account of the $ANITA memecoin. Source: X The timing couldn’t have been more strategic either, as Drake’s Anita Max Wynn Tour is set to take him back to Australia and New Zealand for the first time since 2017. The scam raked in $5 million in trading volume before people caught on to the con. DexScreener data showed the cash flow grinding to a halt once buyers realized they’d been duped. Hackers exploit trust in celebrity brands This is just the latest in a string of high-profile takeovers targeting celebrities and institutions to lend fake legitimacy to crypto scams. Last week, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked to promote another memecoin. That scam only pulled in $500,000, a fraction of the $5 million tied to ANITA. Other victims include Cardi B, Doja Cat, and even Metallica. Damage control came too late for those who’d already bought in, though. It’s unclear if Drake’s team or X were even aware of the hack while the scam was in full swing. Screenshot of Drake’s X account interacting with the now-suspended ANITA profile. Source: X This isn’t Drake’s first crypto controversy. Recently, a 20-year-old influencer accused him and an associate, Top5, of stiffing her on a $2 million crypto investment deal. The allegations, made during a livestream with DJ Akademiks, added fuel to the fire surrounding Drake’s crypto reputation. Whether this prior drama influenced hackers’ decision to target him is anyone’s guess. Crypto fraud isn’t slowing down. In October, the founder of Truth Terminal, Andy Ayrey, had his X account hacked to promote a scam token called IB. That one brought in $600 million in profits for the hackers. Meanwhile, the Cardano Foundation hack saw attackers spread lies about an SEC lawsuit to peddle another fake token. The tactics are the same every time: hijack a trusted account, pump out convincing lies, and count on followers to fall for it. Somehow, they always do.

Table of Contents Rollblock breaks new high – 310% gain, $7M raise, and analysts predict explosive growth BNB beats ATH? Can the price hit $800? Avalanche price adds 89% MoM: Will AVAX beat ATH? Conclusion The market is buzzing with exciting developments that hint at a bull run and potential ATH. BNB is nearing the $800 milestone, and AVAX’s price also made a comeback above $50, making analysts ponder whether it could reclaim its 2021 ATH of $144. But it’s not only the giants making waves – the crypto gaming sector is brimming with excitement from Rollblock’s GambleFi ingenuity. Its player-centric gaming ecosystem has continued to deliver excellence, and its impressive presale stats are proof of this. Read on to learn more. Rollblock breaks new high – 310% gain, $7M raise, and analysts predict explosive growth Rollblock has solidified its position as a strong force in the $500 billion gambling industry, achieving a remarkable 310% gain during its presale. The project has already raised $7 million, driven by overwhelming investor demand for its unique GambleFi ingenuity. At the heart of Rollblock’s success is its groundbreaking platform, which offers over 7,000 casino games and unique sports betting services—all powered by blockchain technology. Unlike competitors, Rollblock delivers unmatched speed, transparency, and convenience, making it the go-to choice for the modern gambler. Another thing that sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics, which focuses on users. Staking rewards, a revenue share program, and weekly buybacks/burns drive price appreciation and boost demand for RBLK. Currently priced at just $0.0415, Rollblock’s tokens are predicted to surge more explosively from current levels. You might also like: Cardano reaches $1 but experts believe Pepe Unchained and Rollblock have more potential BNB beats ATH? Can the price hit $800? Can BNB hit $800? What seemed impossible when BNB hit a gut-wrenching $218 in 2023’s crypto winter has now inched closer to reality. Just last week, BNB rallied an impressive 18% to a new ATH of $794, igniting speculation about whether the cryptocurrency could shatter the $800 milestone. Key factors driving this growth include anticipation of U.S. regulatory shifts: SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stepping down in January 2025 and a potential pro-crypto administration under Donald Trump in 2025. These changes could pave the way for new investment vehicles like crypto ETFs, further bolstering altcoins like BNB. Avalanche price adds 89% MoM: Will AVAX beat ATH? Avalanche , too, has been turning heads with a historic surge above $50 for the first time since March 2024. Bolstered by increased whale activity and rising transaction sizes, AVAX could be gearing up for another major breakout. Analysts are eyeing $65 as the next critical resistance level, and a break above that could propel AVAX to a new ATH. Onchain data shows whales now control 27.38% of the AVAX supply, a whopping 12.44% increase in just a week. Adding to the optimism and ecosystem growth is the recent Avalanche9000 upgrade, which saw TVL rise 66% to $1.5B. 81% of holders are “in the money,” and whales are accumulating aggressively; AVAX could surpass $65 and potentially aim for ATH. Conclusion The renewed optimism has proven that the future looks brighter than ever. Surprising rises like BNB’s ascent toward the $800 mark and AVAX price’s leap toward ATH have sent investors’ confidence to a fever pitch. As these established giants dominate, the new underdog, Rollblock, is proving that creativity isn’t limited to established players—its GambleFi ecosystem and record-breaking presale have set it apart as a true disruptor. Its presale is still ongoing—$0.0415 in stage 9. For more information, visit the Rollblock presale website and join the online community.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-musk-loves-usa-muskusa-will-skyrocket-over-16000-before-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37673362,https://nulltx.com/?p=135753,1734265850,Qubetics Pushes Blockchain Boundaries While Bitcoin Secures Market Trust and Chainlink Leads Data Integration,"Ever wondered which cryptocurrencies hold the best short-term potential? With projects like Qubetics shaking up the blockchain scene and established giants like Bitcoin and Chainlink continuing to evolve, the landscape offers a mix of fresh innovation and trusted reliability. The challenge, of course, is finding the one that fits your investment goals. Qubetics ($TICS) is particularly fascinating, offering practical solutions for cross-border payments, an area where traditional systems have consistently fallen short. While Bitcoin and Chainlink each boast unique value propositions, Qubetics takes a different path, focusing on solving specific challenges with real-world use cases. Let’s dive into what makes these the best crypto choices this December . Qubetics Offers a Real Solution for Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics ($TICS) is making a name for itself as a game-changer in blockchain innovation. Its presale success speaks volumes: more than $6 million raised, 324 million tokens sold to over 9400 holders, and a current price of $0.031 in the 12th stage. This presale system is designed to attract savvy investors, with each stage lasting seven days and a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. If you’re considering jumping in, now might be the time before the next surge. What sets Qubetics apart is its focus on facilitating seamless cross-border transactions . This isn’t just another generic blockchain use case—it’s a targeted solution for a real problem. International money transfers are often bogged down by delays, high fees, and outdated infrastructure. Enter Qubetics, which leverages blockchain to ensure that funds are moved swiftly, securely, and at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems. Picture this: A small business in Chicago needs to pay a supplier in Germany. Traditionally, they’d rely on bank wire transfers, which could take days and involve hefty fees. With Qubetics, the transfer is instant, cost-effective, and transparent. Similarly, an expatriate worker sending money to family overseas can ensure that funds arrive quickly and without losing a chunk to middlemen. Qubetics isn’t just for individuals—it’s a lifeline for businesses. Imagine a global e-commerce platform needing to process payments from international customers. Delays in payment settlements can disrupt cash flow, but with Qubetics, transactions are near-instant and frictionless. Curious to know more? This video dives deeper into the project and its unique features. Watch it here . Bitcoin Stays Dominant with Unmatched Market Trust Bitcoin’s name has become synonymous with cryptocurrency itself, and for good reason. It remains the most widely adopted and trusted digital asset, a go-to option for both beginners and seasoned investors. Its status as the first decentralised cryptocurrency gives it a level of recognition and credibility that others struggle to match. The Bitcoin network is secured by proof-of-work, making it one of the most secure blockchains in existence. While its primary use case as digital gold often steals the spotlight, Bitcoin is also being explored for real-world payments and as a hedge against economic instability. Imagine someone in a country facing hyperinflation—they could use Bitcoin as a way to preserve their wealth when their local currency loses value. Short-term investors might find Bitcoin appealing due to its large market cap and liquidity, which make it less volatile than smaller altcoins. That said, it’s not all about stability. Bitcoin’s periodic price spikes offer exciting opportunities for those who time their trades well. Chainlink Delivers Reliable Data for Smart Contracts Chainlink has carved out its niche in the blockchain world by providing secure and reliable data feeds for smart contracts. Its technology ensures that blockchain applications can interact with real-world data, which is crucial for a wide range of use cases, from DeFi to insurance. For instance, imagine a DeFi lending platform that needs to determine accurate interest rates based on market conditions. Chainlink’s oracles make this possible by delivering reliable, tamper-proof data to the blockchain. This level of trust and functionality has made Chainlink a critical component of many blockchain projects, solidifying its role as an industry standard. Investors looking at short-term gains might appreciate Chainlink’s growing adoption and its strong position in the market. Its ability to partner with both blockchain-based and traditional companies adds to its versatility and appeal. Conclusion: Make the Smart Move with Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Chainlink If you’re thinking about the best coins to join in December 2024, there’s no shortage of exciting options. Qubetics ($TICS) stands out with its cutting-edge solution for cross-border payments, backed by an impressive presale that’s gaining serious traction. Bitcoin, with its unmatched credibility and status as the market leader, remains a solid choice for those seeking stability and liquidity. Meanwhile, Chainlink’s innovative approach to connecting blockchain with real-world data positions it as a vital player in the decentralised world. Exploring projects like these can open doors to short-term gains while setting the stage for long-term potential. If you’re ready to dive into this dynamic space, Qubetics’ presale offers a unique opportunity to start at the ground level before the next price increase. Each project here offers something different, so choose the one that fits your goals and be part of the crypto wave.

37673717,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52159,1734265811,"Qubetics, Bitcoin or Polkadot? Which Blockchain Holds the Future of Smart Contracts This New Year?","Cryptocurrencies have grown beyond just speculative assets; they’re now powering some of the most groundbreaking technologies of our time. Blockchain networks like Bitcoin (BTC) and Polkadot (DOT) have proven their value by redefining financial transactions and creating interconnected ecosystems. But as we step into the new year, a new player, Qubetics ($TICS), is entering the stage with a focus on making smart contracts more accessible and practical for everyone. While Bitcoin continues to be the heavyweight champion of decentralisation and Polkadot excels at connecting diverse blockchains, Qubetics is solving critical gaps in real-world applications. This article takes a deep dive into these three projects, exploring how they shape the future of smart contracts and why they are among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): The Smart Contract Revolution for Everyday Life Qubetics isn’t just a blockchain project; it’s a transformative ecosystem that simplifies how businesses and individuals interact with smart contracts. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that require a steep learning curve, Qubetics is designed for seamless usability. Its real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT) feature allows people to digitise and trade tangible assets securely and transparently. Let’s say a coffee importer in Seattle wants to automate payments based on shipment arrivals. With Qubetics’ smart contracts, funds are automatically released once the shipment’s GPS confirms delivery. On the consumer side, someone purchasing a home in Austin can avoid escrow fees by using Qubetics to execute a digital, trustless agreement between buyer and seller. Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet takes functionality to the next level. By integrating with Apple Pay and Google Pay, it enables users to make crypto payments with the simplicity of everyday transactions. Whether you’re splitting a dinner bill or paying for office supplies, the wallet converts your crypto to fiat instantly, eliminating volatility and making blockchain practical for real-world use. Currently in its presale phase, Qubetics has already sold over 324M tokens, raising more than $6M from 9,400+ holders. At $0.0311 per token, it’s a golden opportunity for early investors. With analysts predicting a post-presale price of $0.25, the potential 900% ROI makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics’ innovative approach to solving real-world problems and its user-friendly applications make it a standout project in the smart contract space. Bitcoin (BTC): The Pioneer with a Decentralised Edge Bitcoin doesn’t need much introduction—it’s the OG of the cryptocurrency world. While it wasn’t designed specifically for smart contracts, Bitcoin’s immutable and decentralised nature makes it a trusted platform for executing basic contract functionalities through its second-layer solutions, like the Lightning Network. In 2024, Bitcoin has continued to grow as a store of value, with major institutional investors piling in. But its application in smart contracts is gaining traction, particularly with developments like Bitcoin Ordinals and Taproot. These upgrades have made it possible to deploy simple but effective smart contracts on Bitcoin’s network. For example, a charity organisation in South Africa could use Bitcoin’s smart contract capabilities to ensure funds are released only when specific conditions—like delivering meals to schools—are met. While not as robust as Ethereum’s capabilities, Bitcoin’s simplicity and security are its strengths. Bitcoin’s biggest challenge remains scalability. As the network grows, transaction fees and times can rise, making it less ideal for applications requiring frequent updates. However, its sheer dominance and reputation ensure it remains relevant in any conversation about blockchain technology. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bitcoin’s decentralisation and growing capabilities in smart contracts make it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for those who value security and simplicity. Polkadot (DOT): The King of Blockchain Interconnectivity Polkadot has positioned itself as the backbone of blockchain interoperability. With its unique parachain architecture, Polkadot allows multiple blockchains to operate together, sharing data and assets seamlessly. This makes it a natural choice for developers looking to build scalable and interconnected smart contracts. In 2024, Polkadot has expanded its ecosystem significantly, with more parachains going live and increasing adoption in industries like DeFi, healthcare, and supply chain management. Imagine a scenario where a hospital in Singapore uses Polkadot-based smart contracts to share patient data securely with a pharmaceutical company in Switzerland. Polkadot’s infrastructure ensures privacy and efficiency, making such use cases possible. Polkadot’s biggest strength lies in its scalability and ability to connect blockchains that would otherwise operate in silos. However, it also faces challenges, particularly as competition in the interoperability space heats up with players like Cosmos and Avalanche. Its long-term success will depend on its ability to attract developers and maintain its technological edge. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polkadot’s ability to integrate diverse blockchain networks and its focus on scalability make it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for investors looking at the future of smart contracts. Who Wins the Smart Contract Race? Each of these projects offers unique strengths that make them stand out in the world of smart contracts. Bitcoin is the reliable veteran, offering simplicity and unparalleled security. Polkadot is the visionary, building the infrastructure for a fully interconnected blockchain future. But Qubetics is the innovator. With its focus on usability, real-world applications, and transformative technology, it’s poised to make smart contracts accessible to everyone—from global corporations to individual users. Its presale momentum and promising ROI make it a compelling choice for anyone looking to invest in blockchain’s next big thing to invest in December 2024 . Based on the latest research, we recommend investing in Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin (BTC), and Polkadot (DOT) this December. Secure your financial future today by riding the wave of these groundbreaking projects.

Ethereum Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a unique platform that is changing how we use blockchain technology. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum introduced smart contracts and decentralized applications, opening up a world of possibilities. In 2022, it switched to a more energy-efficient system called Proof-of-Stake. Plans for “sharding” aim to make transactions faster and cheaper. While many tokens run on its network, ETH remains at the core, used for transactions and rewarding those who help secure the network. As the crypto market evolves, Ethereum stands out due to its ongoing improvements and wide use. Predictions suggest ETH could reach up to $6,580.53 next year and have a low of $2,700.31 in 2025, indicating potential growth. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s vast ecosystem and upcoming upgrades give it a strong position. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon make it even more efficient. In the current market, Ethereum’s advancements and solid foundation make it an attractive option to consider. XRP XRP is a digital currency gaining attention for its speed and low transaction costs. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it started with 100 billion coins. Unlike traditional systems, XRP operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. There is no need for a bank account to use it, which opens doors for many people around the world. Ripple, the company that was gifted 80 billion XRP, uses these coins to improve the network and support its growth. They have placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to release the supply carefully. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” highlighting its aim to make payments flow smoothly across different currencies. XRP’s technology focuses on speed and efficiency. Transactions on the XRP Ledger are quick and cost very little, which is a big advantage over some other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum that can be slower and more expensive to use. In today’s market, where instant and affordable transactions are in demand, XRP stands out. Its ability to facilitate cross-border payments without high fees makes it attractive. As the crypto market evolves, coins that offer practical solutions like XRP may become more prominent. Comparing XRP with other digital currencies shows its potential in providing a seamless payment experience, which could be appealing in the current market trends. Cardano Cardano is turning heads in the cryptocurrency world with its innovative approach to blockchain technology. At its core is ADA, a coin that not only stores value but also powers the Cardano network. Unlike some other platforms, Cardano is built for smart contracts right from the start. This makes it a hub for creating decentralized finance apps, new crypto tokens, and games. What truly sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly design. By using the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, it operates energy-efficiently, sidestepping the heavy energy use seen in traditional proof-of-work models. Plus, its unique two-layer system boosts transaction speeds, aiming to process up to a million transactions per second. In today’s market, ADA stands out as a strong contender against coins like Ethereum’s ETH. With growing concerns about sustainability and scalability in blockchain technology, Cardano’s solutions are timely. The introduction of its native tokens in March 2021 marked a significant step forward, allowing for secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. As the crypto landscape evolves, coins that address both efficiency and environmental impact are gaining attention. Cardano’s advancements position it well in current market trends, making it a noteworthy option for those interested in the future of decentralized technologies. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a fun experiment. Inspired by Dogecoin, it uses the same cute dog mascot. But SHIB is different because it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many Ethereum applications. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous person named Ryoshi, SHIB had a huge supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain trust, Ryoshi sent half of these tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin made headlines by donating a large amount of SHIB to help India fight COVID-19. He also “burned” 40% of the tokens, reducing the supply forever. SHIB’s connection with Ethereum opens up many possibilities. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can be used in decentralized apps. There’s already ShibaSwap, a platform where users can trade tokens without a middleman. Plans for a future NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on changes make SHIB even more interesting. In today’s market, SHIB shows potential because it combines the fun of memecoins with the power of Ethereum. While it’s still a risky investment, some see SHIB as more than just a joke, possibly offering real utility in the crypto world. Conclusion ETH, XRP, ADA, and SHIB are promising, but XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth, blending sports and meme culture into a community-driven project with a clear roadmap.

37674208,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319583,1734265002,Solana Confidence Surges Among Long-Term Investors – Is a Price Explosion Coming?,"New data from Glassnode highlights growing confidence among Solana (SOL) investors, with a significant increase in long-term asset retention. At its current price of $218.35, SOL continues to attract holders expecting higher valuations in the months ahead. Glassnode’s findings show that 27% of Solana’s supply is held by investors in the 6-12 month category, reflecting a strong belief in the asset’s potential. This behavior indicates that many anticipate a recovery or surge in 2024, positioning themselves accordingly. “The proportion of locked assets held by long-term investors is increasing, showing the conviction of buyers ahead of the 2024 rally,” Glassnode reported. Selling Pressure Continues to Decline Interestingly, investors who accumulated SOL during the 2022 market downturn have already realized most of their profits. Glassnode reports a sharp decline in the holdings of the 1-2 year group, dropping from 48% in June to below 5% currently. This suggests that sellers from the previous cycle have largely exited, leaving minimal immediate downward pressure on Solana’s price. “Investors from the previous bull market largely took profits during this year’s rally. For now, those wanting to sell SOL have likely already done so,” the firm noted. The diminishing selling activity aligns with Solana’s broader market sentiment, as long-term holders appear to be preparing for the next potential rally. Solana Price Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Solana’s price movement, however, remains constrained by immediate technical resistance and bearish indicators. Currently trading at $218.35, SOL faces significant downward trendline resistance at $227.28. The presence of a “three black crows” candlestick pattern highlights sustained bearish sentiment and the possibility of further short-term declines. Immediate Support : $211.62 Next Supports : $203.35 and $195.07 Resistance Levels : $227.28 (trendline) and $234.80 The 50 EMA at $225.84 continues to act as dynamic resistance, limiting upside momentum. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 39, signaling weak momentum and nearing oversold conditions. If bulls manage to break above the $227 level, Solana could target higher resistances, potentially reversing the current bearish trend. Solana Price Outlook Current: $218.35 Key Resistance: $227.28 (trendline), $234.80 Support Levels: $211.62, $203.35 RSI at 39.76 signals weak momentum. A breakout above $227 could reverse bearish sentiment and push SOL higher. #Solana #Crypto pic.twitter.com/KuXPT9hsW7 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) December 15, 2024 Why Investors Should Watch Solana 27% of SOL’s supply is locked by 6-12 month holders , showing strong market conviction. 1-2 year holder activity has declined, reducing selling pressure significantly. Technically, a break above $227.28 could open the path toward $234.80 and higher levels. Conclusion For now, all eyes remain on Solana’s ability to maintain support at $211.62 and challenge the downward trendline, potentially setting the stage for a price surge in early 2024. $BEST Wallet: Web3 Simplified, $4.4M Raised in Presale Best Wallet is a cutting-edge Web3 platform supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Speaking on the subject, Palihapitiya pointed out that Google is developing Willow quantum chips and suggested that these could challenge the security of Bitcoin's SHA-256 encryption algorithm in the next two to five years. “There is a Time of 2-5 Years to Take Precautions Against Breaking Bitcoin's Password” “When Sundar Pichai (Google CEO) shared this, I missed my next meeting because I had to figure out what this meant for Bitcoin’s encryption,” Palihapitiya said, noting the significance of the invention. Palihapitiya explained that Google’s Willow chips, which represent a major advance in quantum computing, could pose a potential threat to Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundation. According to Palihapitiya’s analysis, it would take around 8,000 Willow chips to break Bitcoin’s SHA-256 encryption. “For context, it would take about 4,000 of these chips to break RSA-2048 encryption,” he said. “With 8,000 chips, it would be possible to break SHA-256, which is Bitcoin’s underlying encryption structure.” Palihapitiya described the development as “a two- to five-year timeline” for blockchain networks to be ready. “Some of these chains will need to fundamentally reimplement new hashing algorithms,” he added. Related News: BREAKING: Trump's Cryptocurrency Project Allegedly Bought This Binance-Listed Altcoin! Price Pumped The implications of quantum computing advances like Google’s Willow chips have long been a concern in the crypto space. Willow chips reportedly improve error correction as more units are used together, potentially speeding up their effectiveness in cryptographic attacks. However, significant technical challenges remain, including interconnect issues between the chips. “This is a big deal,” Palihapitiya said. “There are still issues like logical interconnects and communication between chips, but the progress there is undeniable. The ability of the Willow chip to scale is a game-changer.” *This is not investment advice.

37672648,https://crypto.news/?p=14319125,1734264300,Tokenization is the inevitable future of real estate | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Elizabeth Sample and Brenda Powers with Sotheby’s International Realty in NYC told me in an interview that “in 2022, the global real estate market was valued at around $379.7 trillion. This makes it one of the largest markets in the world.” And they continued: “ We are all connected to the residential or commercial real estate world by owning or renting, etc. By using blockchain technology to create digital tokens for property rights, the buying, selling, and transferring of real estate can be automated. This approach allows investors to invest in real estate more efficiently and increases liquidity in this huge asset class .” You might also like: Tokenizing real estate is a gateway to affordable home ownership | Opinion Already, there is a rapidly growing market for tokenized real-world assets representing one of the largest market opportunities in the blockchain industry, with a potential market size—according to a joint study by 21.co, BCG, and ADDX— projected to reach between $10 trillion and $16 trillion by 2030. According to Statista, by 2030, real estate is predicted to account for around one-third of the tokenized asset market, making it the most prevalent category. Adding fuel to this growth is the US Federal Reserve’s continued efforts to restrain inflation through higher interest rates, which many experts believe will stay for a while. This has investors increasing their allocations in collateral-based cash flows backed by real estate assets that offer a compelling risk-adjusted yield that serves as a stabilizing income source in an investor’s diversified portfolio. Historically, real estate has been a reliable hedge against inflation, allowing investors to invest in traditional real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and maybe even real estate tokens. Recent reports state that pro-digital asset President-elect real estate tycoon Donald Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., are developing a new real estate token project tentatively called “World Liberty” to integrate real estate investments with decentralized finance using blockchain technology. Botto — Mist Over Mechanized Monoliths, AI Art at Sotheby’s Auction House NYC, Collection: Synthetic Histories; Origin Round: 142 How can blockchain be used in real estate transactions? Blockchain technology could serve as a transparent, reliable record-keeping system for real estate ownership and transfers at the city registry level. Smart contracts, programs that run on the blockchain, could be integrated with existing legal processes which govern property ownership, which could automate and record these transfers and ownership changes while the underlying legal processes for property ownership remain in place. This could lower transaction costs by removing dependency on intermediaries and automating many steps. For example, the Office of the City Register uses a software system called ACRIS to record and maintain New York City real property and certain personal property transfer records, such as mortgage documents for property in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. However, ACRIS is not a blockchain system; it is a software platform primarily used for managing and automating regulatory compliance processes that are not designed to operate on a decentralized blockchain network. Blockchain technology can also be used in the tokenization of real estate assets to digitally represent a form of proof of fractional ownership of these assets, which also manages transferability and provides a medium of exchange. The Digital Asset Tokenization System designed by the UDPN team “simplifies the investment process by creating virtual tokens representing rights to assets and providing comprehensive lifecycle services from ideation to trading to asset servicing,” explained Tim Bailey, the vice president of global business and operations for Red Date Technology. The primary services offered by an asset tokenization platform include the creation and management of digital tokens that represent ownership of physical assets. Other services include token creation tools, a storage wallet, and an exchange and payment gateway. With tokenization, one real estate asset/investment may be represented by 1,000 or more tokens minted on a blockchain platform, each representing a fraction of the overall real estate asset/investment. A real estate token can represent a variety of different fractional real estate interests—from a portion of a real estate deed, which could be in the form of a coop or a condo, or a standalone home or an office building built on land subject to a long term lease etc.; to an equity interest in a legal entity (such as an LLC or Trust as in the case of REITs); or ownership of collateralized debt that could be located in different geographic locations or subject to a variety of different laws and taxes. A token for real estate could be the equivalent of a nonfungible token (a specific unique identifier). Still, it could also be considered a fungible token or a security token as well. Through smart contracts (computer code that automatically implements and enforces agreements on a blockchain), these tokens can be programmed to make rent distributions to token holders. They can also be programmed to enforce legal compliance requirements, such as one-year lock-up periods in lease provisions, etc. Other advantages of tokenizing real estate property on a blockchain ledger could include faster processing times for token buy-sell transactions that could be validated and recorded almost instantly without the need for lengthy manual back office processes. While tokenization of real estate would not directly modify the legal concept of property ownership or make real estate cheaper to invest in, it could make real estate more accessible to a wider range of investors, thereby increasing liquidity in the real estate market by fractionalizing property ownership into tradable tokens, opening the doors to a wider pool of participants to participate in property ownership including small-scale, young retail investors who face record-high home prices, lack of inventory, inflation and high debt that serve as challenging barriers to homeownership globally. In the United States, an owner-occupied fractional equity residential real estate tokenization transaction has already been undertaken. As Scott Thiel, CEO and founder of Tokinvest, explained: “ The home was purchased for $740,000 in Longmont, Colorado, and was financed with third-party investors directly supplying 97% of the purchase capital as alternative financing to mortgage credit. This residential tokenization project represented tradable investment securities backed by the largest and most stable asset class on earth—owner-occupied homes. Real estate token investors will have the option to buy, trade, and sell tiny, passive positions of homes as an alternative to active, whole home investment. At Tokinvest, we are tokenizing commercial and residential; existing and planned global real estate projects .” In the Netherlands, Bart de Bruijn, co-founder of EstateX, is building a dedicated RWA blockchain real estate tokenization platform that is expected to launch in Q3 2025. He believes that PROPX security tokens could revolutionize the global real estate industry by transforming a traditionally illiquid and exclusive asset class into one that is accessible, flexible, and liquid, allowing investors worldwide to own small shares in specific real estate properties, invest with minimal capital, and trade these tokenized assets easily on a secondary exchange. Because EstateX will operate on the RWA blockchain, transactions (like buying or selling tokens) would incur gas fees in the range of 20-35% paid for via token ESX as it is the platform’s primary medium for transactions, governance, and staking, which would cover the computational cost of processing transactions. A comparison of real estate tokens and REITs The expected high interest rate environment will likely render REITs an established desirable investment product, while real estate tokens might pave the way for a more dynamic, accessible, and investor-friendly future. For your consideration, here is a comparison of how real estate tokens stand out in comparison to REITs. REAL ESTATE TOKEN REITs LIQUIDITY Tokens are traded on secondary digital asset exchanges frequently, subject to digital asset market valuations. REIT shares are traded on major stock exchanges subject to stock market valuations. DIVERSIFICATION Tokenization lowers investment entry barriers, making real estate investment accessible to everyone by allowing fractional investments in a variety of real estate properties across different regions and sectors. REITs often require significant capital investment by investors on commercial property. OWNERSHIP & CONTROL Tokens provide direct fractional ownership of real estate properties, granting investors more transparency and a sense of control over their investments. REIT shares represent ownership in the trust holding the real estate assets or real estate debt rather than the actual properties, resulting in no direct control over property management decisions. REGULATORY & TAX Tokens are subject to a more dynamic and evolving regulatory and tax landscape around the world. In the US, absent specific guidance from the SEC, real estate tokens are generally treated as securities subject to registration with the SEC. REITs benefit from well-established regulatory and tax-efficient frameworks that provide stability and robust investor protections. For instance, the offshore LP structures available in some private REITs can help clients reduce their tax burden significantly as they offer investors a 20% tax deduction on the income they generate, thus enhancing after-tax returns TRANSACTION COSTS & DIVIDENDS Tokens can charge a fee in the range of 20-35% of generated revenue in the form of blockchain gas fees that reduce returns. However, it could be structured to issue daily dividends and settlement fees to an otherwise illiquid asset class. REITS provide for quarterly dividend distributions and may carry management and transaction fees that reduce returns, as detailed in the investment offering document. REAL ESTATE TOKENIZATION PLATFORM Tokens are issued on a real estate platform. The technology risks and cybersecurity concerns associated with the platform should be considered to ensure asset safety. REITs are not issued on a blockchain platform. Because of the complexity and evolving nature of real estate tokenization, it would be prudent to consult with an experienced securities attorney, tax attorney and blockchain specialist before proceeding with a real estate token investment.

He was particularly astounded by the confusing criteria for winning the GOTY award. In the translated version of his statement on Weibo, he said, “This year’s nominated games are all outstanding, but I really couldn’t understand the criteria for selecting the Game of the Year this time. I came here for nothing!” Black Myth: Wukong won two awards in the Player’s Choice and Best Action categories out of the four categories it was nominated for. The remaining three nominations were Best Art Direction, Best Game Direction, and the Game of the Year. Also, Wukong was the lowest-rated game on Metacritic ever to be nominated for Game of the Year. The game’s producer, Feng Ji, expressed his gratitude for Black Myth: Wukong being the first game from China to receive four nominations and win two of them. However, he also shared his disappointment and confusion about the GOTY award’s criteria. The CEO also listed all of the efforts that went into creating the game in a long seven-point post. Black Myth: Wukong was a trendsetter for Chinese games Feng Ji addressed concerns from some who believed the team’s extraordinary success with its first single-player game was a fluke and that it was unlikely to repeat itself. He disagreed that it was just one-time luck. Rather, it was a product of several important factors coming together. He said the game’s success was the combination of Chinese interests, the country’s culture, the capability of its people, and the favorable business environment. He credited all these factors for the growth of the Chinese gaming industry. “I believe there will be more peers in the future, bringing better, more interesting, and more confident Chinese stories to the world.” – Feng Ji He said Black Myth: Wukong is the trendsetter for the Chinese games that will follow in the future. The CEO also noted that Game Science valued being part of this movement deeply, as it positioned the team at the forefront of a significant shift in the industry. Feng Ji shared the importance of games like Black Myth: Wukong According to Feng Ji, many people in the world are not lucky enough to play AAA games. These may include those who have never used consoles or computers, don’t understand what’s going on emotionally or physiologically, are confused and in pain, are desperate about the current world, and are victims of injustice. Therefore, “We need to create better games and content that allow more people to experience truth, goodness, and beauty,” shared Feng Ji. Feng Ji told Wukong fans that their dissatisfaction with the results comes from a place of confidence rather than anger. He added that he was even more confident than them that he had prepared a winning speech two years ago. However, it did not happen. “Today we lost, tomorrow we might lose again, but so what?” the CEO of Game Science added. He concluded, “You can’t be confident only when you’ve already won. That’s not confidence; it’s repeating the result.” He also said that factors for winning are always uncertain. He told his fans that confidence should come from, “Doing difficult things, doing things we believe in.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/black-myth-wukong-ceo-reflects-game-awards/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37672657.jpeg

Outperforming the broader market, AAVE has reached its highest levels since 2021, marking a remarkable recovery and reaffirming its dominance in the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: ONDO Exchange Inflows Grow – Volatility Ahead? Key metrics from IntoTheBlock underscore AAVE’s unmatched position in the lending sector. With an impressive 45% market share, it remains the top choice for users seeking decentralized borrowing and lending solutions. With AAVE trading at multi-year highs and on-chain data suggesting robust activity, the altcoin’s trajectory remains a focal point for investors and analysts alike. The question is whether the price can sustain this momentum and reach new all-time highs in the coming months. AAVE Keeps Growing Aave (AAVE) has shown consistent growth over the past year, solidifying its position as a market leader in the DeFi lending sector. Known for its innovative approach to creating non-custodial liquidity markets, Aave enables users to earn interest on supplied and borrowed assets at variable interest rates. This approach has made Aave a go-to protocol for decentralized borrowing and lending. For years, Aave has been at the forefront of DeFi innovation, continually enhancing its platform and user experience. Its success is evident in its market dominance. Metrics from IntoTheBlock highlight Aave’s unrivaled leadership, boasting an impressive 45% market share in the DeFi lending space. This dominance is further emphasized by Aave’s staggering total value locked (TVL), which stands at $21.2 billion—almost equal to the combined TVL of all other lending protocols. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Metrics Looking Strong – Momentum Building For ETH? Such figures underline Aave’s critical role in the DeFi ecosystem. Its established presence and robust infrastructure position it as a key player in the event of a broader DeFi resurgence. Should the sector heat up in the coming weeks, Aave is likely to attract significant attention from investors and traders. Price Targets Fresh Supply Levels Aave (AAVE) is currently trading at $366, following a surge to a multi-year high of $396 just hours ago. The altcoin continues its upward momentum as it approaches the critical $420 resistance level, a threshold last held in September 2021. This mark is seen as a pivotal area for AAVE’s next phase of price action, with many analysts expecting a significant reaction once tested. If AAVE manages to hold its current levels and sustain the bullish momentum, the next logical target would be the $420 resistance zone. Breaking above this level could signal a continuation of its multi-month rally, setting the stage for even higher price targets as investor confidence builds. On the downside, failure to maintain support above the $320–$340 range could lead to a broader correction. A move below this zone might push the price lower, erasing some of its recent gains and dampening bullish sentiment in the short term. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon – Top Trader Sets $2 Target AAVE remains in a strong position for now, but traders are closely monitoring its price action near these key levels.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE dominate memecoins, but a new token promising 1500x returns may redefine the crypto landscape. Table of Contents Catzilla: The monster meme coin ready to change the crypto scene Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Dogecoin: From meme to major cryptocurrency PEPE: A deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog Conclusion For years, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and PEPE have ruled the meme coin world, captivating crypto enthusiasts with their viral appeal and significant market presence. But a seismic shift may be underway as a new contender enters the scene. With whispers of a potential 1500x return, this emerging token is igniting excitement among investors eager to uncover the next breakout star of the crypto world. Could this be the game-changer the memecoin market has been waiting for? Catzilla: The monster meme coin ready to change the crypto scene In the dynamic world of meme coins, competition is fierce, and Catzilla is making its entrance with a roar. Inspired by iconic tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE, Catzilla brings a fresh twist to the genre, blending explosive meme culture with high-profit potential. Its Godzilla-like feline mascot, rooted in Japanese kaiju mythology, captures imaginations while positioning itself as a market disruptor. But Catzilla isn’t just about viral appeal—it’s a multi-layered project designed to captivate both gamers and crypto investors. Its narrative-driven, game-inspired ecosystem offers thrilling experiences while tapping into a growing audience of anime fans and digital asset enthusiasts. You might also like: PNUT, BRETT & CATZILLA flash bullish signals — poised to be the next millionaire makers The Catzilla advantage: Big returns, bold vision Unlike fleeting meme coins, Catzilla is building for longevity, promising serious returns and investor-friendly mechanics. Its presale is structured across 14 stages, each offering progressively higher token prices, giving early adopters the chance to secure maximum gains. Early projections suggest up to a 700% ROI, setting the stage for a potential breakout. Why Catzilla stands out Epic Gameplay: An action-packed gaming experience that doubles as a rewarding financial venture. Unifying Mission: A call to rally against centralized greed, bringing fairness and fun back to crypto. Vibrant Community: A blend of crypto enthusiasts, gamers, and meme culture fans driving a shared vision. Join the Catzilla Frenzy Catzilla is more than a token; it’s a movement. With its bold kaiju-inspired persona, the project aims to challenge the norms of the crypto world and restore the decentralized, community-first spirit of meme coins. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin but runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB’s profile. SHIB’s Ethereum integration allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans include a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. Its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem enhances its utility. These developments may impact its attractiveness in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: From meme to major cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2013 as a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. It features the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. Initially considered a “meme coin,” Dogecoin gained significant value in 2021, becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was influenced by social media, especially tweets from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s community-driven approach and viral nature demonstrate its potential in the crypto market. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to attract attention due to its strong community and social media presence. PEPE: A deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary meme coin launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. It aims to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE has a no-tax policy and openly embraces its lack of utility, focusing purely on its status as a meme coin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a high of $1.6 billion, creating millionaires among early holders. The roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover.” The coin’s potential lies in its strong community appeal and market momentum. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on continued interest in meme coins. Conclusion As SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE face growing competition in the meme coin market, Catzilla emerges as a powerful new player aiming to reshape the space with creativity, transparency, and community focus. With a fiery presale structure and projections of monumental growth, Catzilla promises not just financial rewards but a return to the playful, decentralized ethos that made meme coins iconic. For crypto enthusiasts, gamers, and meme lovers alike, Catzilla offers more than just a token — it’s an invitation to be part of a movement challenging the status quo.

37674207,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319576,1734263257,XRP Price Stalls at $2.41 – Could XRP’s Next Move Be a Surge to $3?,"Ripple’s XRP continues to consolidate around $2.41, testing the downward trendline resistance near $2.50. The price correction follows an impressive rally earlier in the year, where XRP climbed over 383%, briefly reaching $2.90. Now, with the year’s final Federal Reserve meeting on the horizon, XRP faces pivotal moments that could determine its trajectory into 2025. Fed Rate Decision and XRP’s Next Move The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting on December 17-18 is the primary focus for financial markets this week. With inflation data showing stability—0.3% CPI increase last month—analysts widely anticipate a 0.25% rate cut. This would mark the third consecutive reduction in over five years, signaling the Fed’s confidence in managing inflation without disrupting economic momentum. SUMMARY OF US NOVEMBER CPI REPORT: 1) CPI comes in largely in line with expectations. 2) US CPI rose 0.3% on the month, in line with estimates for a gain of 0.3%. 3) Headline CPI inflation increased 2.7% Y/Y, accelerating from 2.6% in October. 4) U.S. core CPI rose 0.3%… pic.twitter.com/ggI85MHiSX — Jesse Cohen (@JesseCohenInv) December 11, 2024 Historically, rate cuts have benefited cryptocurrencies like XRP. For instance: Last week’s CPI report led XRP to rally 21% in just days. Rate cuts tend to weaken the dollar, driving investors toward alternative assets like crypto. Should the Fed announce another cut, XRP could break above its immediate resistance at $2.50, opening the door to higher levels such as $2.65 and $2.86. XRP Price Consolidates at $2.41 – Will a Break Above $2.50 Trigger a Rally? From a technical perspective, XRP’s pivot point at $2.36 is critical . This level aligns with the 50 EMA, offering solid near-term support. A sustained close above $2.36 would likely attract buyers and position XRP for a breakout. Key technical indicators include: Immediate Resistance : $2.50 (downward trendline). Next Resistance Levels : $2.65 and $2.86. Immediate Support : $2.36 (50 EMA), followed by $2.22 and $2.04. RSI : Currently at 52 , signaling neutral momentum with potential for an upward move. If XRP fails to hold $2.36, selling pressure could drive a retracement toward $2.22. However, bullish sentiment remains intact if XRP manages to clear $2.50 convincingly. XRP Technical Outlook Pivot Support: $2.36 (50 EMA) Key Resistance: $2.50 → Breakout could target $2.65 & $2.86 RSI: Neutral at 52.55, room for upward move Fed's rate decision this week may fuel momentum. Eyes on $3 if $2.50 clears. #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/HqoBskTo5d — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) December 15, 2024 Conclusion: XRP Positioned for a Breakout The outcome of the Fed’s rate decision will likely dictate XRP’s next major move. With the price consolidating near $2.41 and testing key resistance at $2.50, investors should closely monitor whether a breakout materializes. A rate cut could serve as the catalyst needed to push XRP toward $3 in the coming weeks, providing renewed momentum for the broader crypto market. Key Insights : XRP consolidates at $2.41; resistance stands at $2.50. Fed’s expected 0.25% rate cut could drive bullish momentum. A breakout above $2.50 may target $2.65 and $2.86, with $3 within reach.

37672217,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627686,1734263035,Meta asks California’s Attorney General to block OpenAI’s for-profit conversion,"Facebook’s parent company Meta, has urged California Attorney General Rob Bonta to decline OpenAI’s request to convert to a for-profit organization. Meta is taking the side of Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, as Silicon Valley’s top artificial intelligence players drag it out in court. In the letter sent to the attorney general, Meta emphasized that a favorable verdict for OpenAI would set a dangerous precedent in the industry. According to the company, if OpenAI gets a favorable verdict, startups will assume a non-profit status and change to a for-profit venture anytime they want. In its letter, Meta highlighted what the precedent would do to Silicon Valley, calling it a “seismic effect.” “If OpenAI’s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government,” Meta wrote. Meta backs Musk’s lawsuit to stop OpenAI’s conversion Meta is not the only firm worried about the effects of a favorable ruling on the industry, as other industry players and investors have made their voices heard. Meanwhile, OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor has revealed that the company will continue to have a non-profit arm. He said the company will undergo a restructuring that will provide real value for its ownership in the for-profit stake while ensuring the company does not depart from its goal of benefiting humans. Meta is a major stakeholder in the artificial intelligence industry, pooling in millions of dollars to match up to or even surpass other players like OpenAI. OpenAI is also in bed with Meta’s big rivals. Its biggest investor, Microsoft invested about $13 billion in the firm. Apple also recently announced the integration of ChatGPT into its product. This is Meta’s first comment on the issue, taking the side of Elon Musk, who founded the company alongside current CEO Sam Altman. Elon Musk left the company in 2018, after a power struggle with Altman, the present OpenAI CEO. Musk also owns an artificial intelligence company xAI, whose Grok chatbot is easily accessible via his microblogging platform X or as a standalone application. The Tesla CEO filed a series of lawsuits against OpenAI, claiming that the platform is planning to abandon its non-profit vision. In one of the lawsuits, Musk claimed that the platform created a for-profit arm and is colluding with Microsoft to dominate AI development. Musk and Zuckerberg in an unlikely alliance In its letter to California’s attorney general, Meta claims it supports efforts made by Elon Musk and business associate Shivon Zilis, to represent the people of California. “Although we ask your office to take direct action, we believe that Mr. Musk and Ms. Zilis are qualified and well-positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter,” Meta said. Notably, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been at loggerheads with Musk over the last few years. Some years back, the two billionaires agreed to settle their beef in a cage fight, an event that did not later take place. Meanwhile, OpenAI published a series of documents to block an injunction filed by Musk to block its for-profit conversion. Musk said the firm manipulated him by making him believe that it would remain non-profit when he invested. However, OpenAI countered him, noting that he brought up and backed the idea in the past. “When he didn’t get majority equity and full control, he walked away and told us we would fail,” the firm said. OpenAI recently finalized a $6.6 billion funding round, taking its value to $157 billion. The company, however, assured the investors that it would return every cent should the for-profit move fail to happen in two years.

The coin, dubbed “$ANITA,” purportedly ties to Drake’s cartoon alter ego, Anita Max Wynn , and exploited his association with Stake, a popular crypto gambling platform he frequently endorses. The hack, targeting Drake’s 39 million followers, falsely claimed that $ANITA was launched in partnership with Stake and tied to his Anita Max Wynn Tour, which is set to bring him to Australia and New Zealand after a six-year hiatus. According to blockchain analytics platform DexScreener, the fraudulent coin recorded $5 million in trading volume before investors realized the scheme was a scam. The misleading posts have since been removed from Drake’s account. Rising Wave of High-Profile Hacks Drake’s compromised account is part of a troubling trend of celebrity-targeted hacks on X . Just a week earlier, the Cardano Foundation’s X account fell victim to a similar scam, promoting another fraudulent memecoin that garnered a fraction of $ANITA’s trading volume. Other celebrities, including Cardi B, Doja Cat, Metallica, and Wiz Khalifa, have also been targeted. Notably, Wiz Khalifa’s account, with its 35.7 million followers, was hijacked in early November to promote a bogus cryptocurrency token called “$WIZ” in what appeared to be a pump-and-dump scheme leveraging his brand recognition. These scams not only exploit the public’s trust in high-profile figures but also tarnish the already precarious reputation of cryptocurrency projects, making it harder for legitimate ventures to gain investor confidence. Crypto Investors Urged to Stay Vigilant The Drake hack highlights the urgent need for heightened security protocols for celebrity social media accounts and more rigorous scrutiny from investors when engaging with crypto promotions. Hackers are increasingly leveraging the trust and influence of well-known figures to propagate scams, luring unsuspecting individuals into pump-and-dump schemes. While the fraudulent $ANITA coin’s trading activity ceased relatively quickly, the incident underscores the risks of jumping into investments based solely on celebrity endorsements, especially when promoted on compromised platforms. As the cryptocurrency space continues to grow, protecting its integrity will require a concerted effort from both social media platforms and the broader crypto community.

This trend reflects growing confidence among retail investors, according to crypto analyst and CryptoQuant contributor Axel Adler . “Despite being labeled as “shrimps,” these holders are showing strong confidence in Bitcoin’s growth, continuing to accumulate coins even at current price levels,” Adler stated in a Dec. 14 post on X. Shrimp Wallets Key Metric for Gauging Retail Interest in Bitcoin Shrimp wallets, which hold less than 1 BTC each, are seen as a key metric for gauging retail interest in Bitcoin. According to Adler, there are currently 323,000 shrimp addresses, and this figure is expected to grow by 8.67% to reach 351,000 in the near term. Adler noted that the increase in shrimp wallets began when Bitcoin was priced at $61,000, with 265,000 addresses at that time. The average number of addresses holding less than 1 BTC currently stands at 323K (with BTC priced at $101K). This growth began when BTC was at $61K, at which point there were 265K such addresses.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $101,549, according to CoinMarketCap data. While small-scale investors continue accumulating, larger long-term holders—those who have held Bitcoin for at least 155 days—have been offloading their holdings. Reports from Dec. 9 reveal that long-term holders sold 827,783 BTC in the past 30 days, signaling a possible shift in market sentiment. Some analysts believe the recent sell-off by long-term holders could mark a market top, potentially turning sentiment bearish if buy-side demand weakens. However, Bitfinex analysts argue that Bitcoin’s near-term price declines are unlikely to be as severe as the 10% drop experienced in early December. They point to a reduction in realized profit-taking and sell-side pressure as signs of more moderate future corrections. “With such a decline in realized profit and sell-side pressure, we can expect future declines to be less abrupt than the one experienced last week,” Bitfinex analysts stated in a Dec. 9 market report . Vancouver Approves Motion to Become Bitcoin-Friendly City Just recently, Vancouver city council officially approved a motion to explore becoming a Bitcoin-friendly city. The motion, introduced by Mayor Ken Sim, was discussed and passed during a council meeting, marking a significant step toward integrating cryptocurrency into the city’s financial ecosystem. The proposal includes assessing the feasibility of accepting taxes and fees in Bitcoin and converting a portion of Vancouver’s financial reserves into the digital asset. The proposal came amid growing confidence in Bitcoin among corporate investors. On Monday, MicroStrategy revealed that it has made another significant move in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, purchasing 21,550 BTC for approximately $2.1 billion. With this latest purchase, the business intelligence giant now holds a total of 423,650 BTC, valued at around $42 billion. In a related development, the National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank advocating for free-market principles, has called on Amazon to consider adopting a Bitcoin-focused corporate treasury strategy.

37671628,https://finbold.com/?p=219546,1734262108,"‘We are in a 2-5 year shot clock’ to crack Bitcoin, warns billionaire C. Palihapitiya","Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm Social Capital, has offered a possible timeline for when the Bitcoin ( BTC ) encryption might finally be cracked, given the ongoing advancements in quantum computing. This projection follows Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Google’s parent company, announcing the introduction of Willow, a quantum computing chip with 105 qubits. Palihapitiya believes that the encryption framework underpinning Bitcoin—SHA-256—could be cracked in the next two to five years due to progress in quantum computing, he said during the All-In Podcast , published on December 13. “I had to figure out how long it will take us to crack the encryption standards we use for Bitcoin. We need about 8000 chips to break SHA-256. We’re in the 2-5 year shot clock for chains reimplementing new hashing algorithms,” Palihapitiya said. Willow, which Palihapitiya claims could accelerate the timeline for breaking the cryptographic standards that secure Bitcoin and other digital currencies, is a key development in this area. While the technology to achieve this quantum computing level is still in its early stages, Palihapitiya suggested that the chip is a significant step toward achieving this capability. However, Palihapitiya acknowledged substantial challenges, particularly in scaling the technology, are still ahead. The investor noted that Bitcoin and other blockchain networks must adapt rapidly, potentially reimplementing core cryptographic frameworks at a foundational level. At the same time, Palihapitiya expressed optimism about the future of the cryptocurrency space, noting that advances in quantum computing could lead to the development of new encryption methods resistant to quantum attacks. Debate on cracking Bitcoin Interestingly, not all crypto sector players believe that quantum computing threatens Bitcoin. In an X post on December 14, Ki Young Ju, founder of onchain cryptocurrency analysis platform CryptoQuant , stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to be compromised within this decade. #Bitcoin won’t be broken by quantum computers this decade—or likely even the next. Don’t fall for baseless FUD from people who don’t know what they’re talking about. FYI, Adam Back is a legendary cryptographer and the inventor of Proof-of-Work(PoW) algorithm used in Bitcoin. https://t.co/DilYOc4GNe — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 14, 2024 If Bitcoin’s encryption is cracked, a blueprint from its anonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, could provide a potential solution. Notably, in a June 2010 BitcoinTalk post , Satoshi suggested that if SHA-256 were ever compromised, the community could agree on the last valid blockchain snapshot and continue using a new hash function. “If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest blockchain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function,” Satoshi said. Satoshi Nakamoto’s sentiments of cracking Bitcoin. Source: BitcoinTalk On the other hand, some players view Satoshi’s early-mined Bitcoin as a possible vulnerability. To this end, computer scientist and Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer warned that the coins used the outdated Pay-To-Public-Key (P2PK) format, exposing the public key and giving attackers time to exploit it. “As quantum computing becomes a threat, the Bitcoin community may need to consider freezing Satoshi’s coins or setting a sunset date to freeze all P2PK UTXOs,” Sirer warned . Bitcoin’s reaction to quantum computing advancements The Google development briefly spooked the market , with fear, uncertainty, and doubt ( FUD ) hitting the cryptocurrency community. This led to the liquidation of about $1.6 billion within 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has since recovered, reclaiming the $100,000 resistance level. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,203, gaining almost 0.7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, BTC is up over 4.6%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-bitcoin-reserve-trumpres-memecoin-will-explode-over-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37671735,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627683,1734261796,US President Trump confirms Bitcoin reserve plans as Russia hints at crypto cold war,"President-elect Donald Trump has officially confirmed plans to create a US Bitcoin strategic reserve, a decision he’d been flirting with during the last few months of his campaign. This comes just as Bitcoin’s price exploded past $100,000, riding the wave of optimism following his re-election. Meanwhile, Russia, led by Trump’s frenemy President Vladimir Putin, is exploring its own Bitcoin reserve strategy, raising fears of an impending “crypto cold war.” The stakes? Global economic dominance and the future of money itself. Speaking at the NYSE last week, Trump said : “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else… but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead.” When asked directly whether this meant creating a reserve similar to the US oil stockpile, Trump responded, “Yes, I think so. That’s still on my mind.” Russia’s crypto ambitions heat up Russia has wasted no time signaling its intent to join the Bitcoin reserve race. After facing economic sanctions from the West and seeing its foreign currency reserves frozen, Putin publicly praised Bitcoin as a strong alternative to traditional financial systems. The reasoning is clear: Bitcoin offers a way to sidestep the global financial order dominated by the US dollar. If Russia succeeds, it could upend the current economic balance, creating new challenges for the US and its allies. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness Through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act to Congress. The bill proposes the US acquire 1 million Bitcoins over the next five years to tackle the ballooning $35 trillion national debt. Right now, the US holds about 200,000 confiscated Bitcoins, worth approximately $20 billion. These coins were seized in criminal cases and could form the foundation of the reserve. But Lummis’s bill takes things to another level, mandating the government to buy and hold Bitcoins for at least 20 years. The potential cost of this decision is chilling. With Bitcoin trading at over $100,000, acquiring 1 million tokens would cost around $100 billion at current prices. Critics argue this is an enormous gamble for a speculative asset with no industrial use or guaranteed returns. Yet, Trump’s supporters believe the idea is perfect. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it a hedge against inflation and government mismanagement—qualities increasingly appealing as the dollar faces mounting pressure from national debt and global skepticism. Critics sound the alarm Not everyone is cheering. Skeptics argue that using taxpayer money to buy Bitcoin is reckless. They point out that Bitcoin generates no income and relies entirely on speculative value. “The government would be playing the greater fool,” one critic noted. The cost of creating a reserve could run into hundreds of billions, either by borrowing or printing more money. Both options could worsen inflation and further weaken the dollar. And it’s not just the cost. A Bitcoin reserve could make the asset more attractive to banks, allowing them to use it as collateral for loans. If Bitcoin’s value plummets, the fallout could plunge the financial system, leading to yet another bailout — this time for crypto.

Speaking at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hua Hin , Shinawatra emphasized the need for Thailand to keep pace with global digital transformation. “There are already many cryptocurrencies. Some people say that in the future, we will have more currencies than countries,” Shinawatra remarked, urging Thais to understand and adapt to this emerging financial landscape. Shinawatra Advocates for Digital Asset Adoption According to a report by Money and Banking Online, Shinawatra did not advocate for Thailand to purchase cryptocurrencies but encouraged the nation to study and engage with digital assets. Shinawatra’s remarks come amid growing regulatory developments in Thailand’s crypto sector. In August 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a regulatory sandbox allowing select service providers to experiment with digital assets under relaxed regulatory scrutiny. In a move to boost the economy, the Pheu Thai political party, which is linked to Shinawatra, distributed 10,000 baht (roughly $280) in digital cash to 45 million Thai residents in July 2024. The initiative was part of the party’s campaign promise to stimulate economic growth. Meanwhile, Thailand’s financial institutions are also advancing in the crypto space.

Additionally, the SEC submitted a proposal on Oct. 9 to allow mutual and private funds to access crypto investments, signaling a shift toward institutional adoption. Cross-border crypto collaboration is also underway. In October 2024, the Bank of Thailand partnered with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to test tokenized settlements as part of HKMA’s Project Ensemble. Thailand’s One Asset Management Receives Approval to Launch Crypto ETF In June, Thailand’s One Asset Management (ONEAM) became the first company to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the country that offers exposure to cryptocurrencies. The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has endorsed ONEAM’s Bitcoin ETF, marking a milestone in the country’s evolving regulatory framework for digital assets. The newly approved fund, named the One Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds, will exclusively cater to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. Earlier this year, the SEC of Thailand updated the criteria for investing in digital tokens, easing some restrictions. At the time, the SEC Committee approved the principles for improving investment criteria and related criteria for digital asset business operations, aiming to establish effective investor protection mechanisms while considering the risks associated with digital assets. For one, the commission has lifted investment restrictions previously imposed on retail investors for digital tokens backed by real estate or generating real estate income streams (real estate-backed ICOs) and digital tokens with infrastructure operations or revenue streams (infra-backed ICOs). Previously, retail investors were limited to investing a maximum of 300,000 baht per offering. The SEC also reviewed the criteria for establishing custodial wallet provider businesses, enabling them to offer services to digital asset business operators.

Everyone from Wall Street brokers to regional fund managers is scrambling to reposition portfolios for what’s shaping up to be a rollercoaster year for Asia. Global funds are playing it smart. They’re blending old-school strategies with the new economy. The goal? To shield Asian assets from the fallout of America’s unpredictable policies. Dollar-denominated debt has become the darling of the moment, delivering stable returns despite the greenback’s rampage through 2024. Meanwhile, gold refuses to go out of style, holding tight to its reputation as the ultimate safety net for jittery investors. China: Stimulus-fueled bets and a tariff-shaped battlefield China is throwing money at its economic problems, and investors are paying attention. Beijing’s top brass pledged to pump even more fiscal stimulus into the system, ramping up government spending to counter the impact of looming U.S. tariffs. The Central Economic Work Conference set the stage, and the Politburo wasted no time committing to boosting consumption as a defense against export risks. For investors, the game plan is clear. Fidelity suggests betting on Chinese onshore equities, which are more tied to domestic policy than export risks. UBS strategists are all about bank shares. Why? They’re dirt cheap and pay solid dividends, making them a rare shelter in a stormy macroeconomic climate. But it’s not just stocks. Debt is back in the spotlight. Morgan Stanley likes Chinese debt swaps to dodge currency risks, while Goldman Sachs is calling dibs on mid-range sovereign bonds. These picks reflect expectations that China’s stimulus spree could flood the market with longer-term debt, creating opportunities in the belly of the curve. India: Manufacturing shift and strong growth vibes While China fights off slowing growth, India is becoming an alternative manufacturing hub. With its economy largely shielded from global risks, India’s domestic market is looking better than ever. Analysts at Eastspring Investments are betting big on large-cap stocks, particularly in healthcare, telecom, and financials. But they’re not ignoring the risks. High valuations and a recent earnings slowdown are casting a shadow over the optimism. Local bonds are the golden child here, thanks to low external debt and India’s inclusion in global bond indices. But the real kicker is the long-term game. Rising urbanization, ongoing reforms, and supply chain shifts are fueling optimism. India’s demographics and steady growth are doing the heavy lifting, even as short-term challenges linger. Crypto’s electric rise Now let’s talk crypto, the true wild card in Asia’s 2025 playbook. Central and Southern Asia, along with Oceania, have taken the global lead in crypto adoption just as king Bitcoin smashed past $100,000 for the first time ever. Seven of the top 20 nations for centralized and decentralized finance activity hail from this corner of the world. Indonesia is leading the charge. Between January and October this year, it racked up $30 billion in crypto transactions. That’s a jaw-dropping 350% increase over the same period in 2023. It’s not just about retail traders either. Institutional adoption is gaining traction, with ZA Bank in Hong Kong now offering direct crypto trading to retail clients. Meanwhile, Japan’s AEON is rolling out crypto QR payment systems on Binance’s BNB Chain. Southeast Asia: The quiet powerhouse Meanwhile, Southeast Asia is quietly stealing the show, thanks to its manufacturing boom and stable economies. Indonesia is the poster child here, with a strong domestic market, a resilient commodities sector, and a central bank laser-focused on keeping the currency stable. Sovereign bonds, particularly dollar-denominated ones, are getting love from big players like Amundi and Fidelity. Vietnam isn’t far behind. It’s carving out its spot as a global export powerhouse, and its potential inclusion in the FTSE Emerging Market Index is making investors sit up and take notice. This is a region where smart money sees long-term growth, even as global headwinds threaten to disrupt supply chains. High-yield bonds are the name of the game for risk-tolerant investors. Markets like Sri Lanka and Pakistan are drawing interest for their insulation from trade wars. UBS Asset Management says it’s all about finding credits that dodge tariff headlines, making frontier markets an unexpected haven. The dollar and the yen: A battle of currencies Let’s circle back to the dollar, Asia’s persistent headache. For the fifth year running, the greenback is dominating regional currencies, shaving off three percentage points from local currency bond returns in 2024 alone. The Bank of Japan’s divergence from G-10 peers has made the yen a standout trade for 2025. Portfolio managers like Carol Lye of Brandywine Global are betting big on this divergence, seeing it as a hedge against Trump-induced volatility. For other regional currencies, the picture is bleak. With limited room for further monetary easing, central banks in Asia are stuck between a rock and a hard place. It’s a problem with no easy fix, and investors are bracing for more pain as the dollar refuses to back down.

The firm invested over $600 million in Bitcoin within the past two months, according to a Dec. 2 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Thanks Fred. I expect $MARA will be the next. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 14, 2024 MARA’s stock has also experienced positive momentum. It closed at $22.73 on Dec. 13, reflecting a 16.74% increase over the past six months. MicroStrategy, meanwhile, ended the day at $408.67, up a remarkable 173.27% over the same period, according to Google Finance data. The addition of MicroStrategy to the Nasdaq 100 comes alongside two other companies, while Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna are being removed. The reshuffling of the index reflects its dynamic nature and the growing influence of Bitcoin-focused firms. MARA’s ambitions extend beyond stock market performance. On Nov. 26, the company called for stronger U.S. action to “secure dominant positions in Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining,” framing it as a national security issue. MARA Acquires Nearly 12K Bitcoin MARA Holdings (MARA) bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. The mining firm purchased Bitcoin using proceeds from its zero-coupon convertible notes offerings, paying approximately $1.1 billion at an average price of $96,000 per Bitcoin. This brings MARA’s total Bitcoin holdings to 40,435 BTC as of Dec. 9, valued at $3.9 billion based on the current Bitcoin price. MARA has also reported a 12.3% yield on its Bitcoin holdings quarter-to-date and a 47.6% yield year-to-date. Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, also announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further. Additionally, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and known Bitcoin advocate, further expanded its already substantial Bitcoin holdings. According to an official filing from Dec., 9, MicroStrategy acquired 21,550 BTC for approximately $2.1 billion between Dec. 2 and 8. This purchase, executed at an average price of $98,783 per Bitcoin, brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 423,650 BTC, valued at around $41.5 billion.

37670454,https://crypto.news/?p=14319533,1734259651,4 reasons why smart investors prefer this $0.15 coin over Solana for the 2025 bull run,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana surges 47.2% to $210.20 amid ETF buzz, while smart money eyes Rexas Finance at $0.15 for bull run potential. Table of Contents Solana’s bullish moment encounters opposition Rexas Finance: The smart money choice Quick acceptance and presale performance Large upside potential Managing the market timing Conclusion With a 47.2% price increase over the past month to reach its present level of $210.20, Solana has been a star player in the crypto market lately. Given Grayscale Investments’ Solana ETF registration, this positive momentum has spurred debates about its possible double in value. Although these developments create a lot of buzz, crypto investors — also known as “smart money investors” — are searching past Solana to find new prospects on the market. One such chance is Rexas Finance (RXS) , a $0.15 coin with great promise for the approaching bull run. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Solana’s bullish moment encounters opposition To make significant progress toward the $500 mark, SOL has to overcome a big obstacle represented by the crucial resistance range between $274 and $300. Given Solana’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is almost overbought territory at 54.81, market dynamics point to profit-taking, perhaps intensifying at these levels. This technical indication suggests Solana might lose momentum since buying pressure could fade. Solana indeed has excellent foundations and a vibrant ecosystem, but these challenges make its short-term price path unknown. This uncertainty has driven many smart-money investors to investigate alternative assets with more upside potential, like Rexas Finance. Below are four reasons why Smart Money prefers Rexas Finance to Solana. Rexas Finance: The smart money choice Drawing attention for their original value proposition in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance has become a major candidate for the 2025 bull run. This creative blockchain platform is meant to close the distance between traditional banking and distributed technology by allowing users to tokenize actual assets like real estate, art, and goods. Smart-money investors will find it interesting, given its modest entrance fee of $0.15 and unique methodology. Rexas Finance stands out for stressing the democratizing of asset ownership. Unlike Solana, which primarily targets decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications, Rexas Finance wants to transform how tangible assets are held and sold. This emphasis makes Rexas Finance unique in a crowded industry since it corresponds with the increasing demand for blockchain applications with pragmatic, real-world use cases. Quick acceptance and presale performance Rexas Finance’s presale has been an apparent hit, with each stage selling out faster than expected. At stage 10, the project has attracted more than $26,579,764 of its $33,125,000 target, demonstrating strong investor trust. This excitement reflects the increasing awareness of Rexas Finance’s ability to lead the unexplored RWA tokenizing industry, which experts estimate might become one of blockchain technology’s most important development directions. Moreover, the project team has obtained audits from Certik, one of the most reliable names in blockchain security. At this stage, openness and investor confidence are guaranteed key elements for every enterprise looking for long-term success. The anticipated IPO of Rexas Finance on three top-tier markets in 2025 at an estimated $0.20 also emphasizes its remarkable expansion path. Large upside potential Solana’s road to $500 shows a 138% rise from its present price, but Rexas Finance offers even more upside potential. With an astounding 19,900% increase from its price of $0.15, analysts predict that the RXS token may soar to $30 by the end of 2025. Because of its amazing expansion capacity, Rexas Finance appeals to investors looking for explosive gains during the next bull cycle. As the platform gains momentum in the RWA market, demand for RXS coins is also projected to surge. The platform’s user-friendly design, strong infrastructure, and dedication to creativity — all of which help Rexas Finance be a leader in its niche—will probably drive this demand. Managing the market timing Solana is still a fierce competitor with a proven ecosystem, but given its present price, it has less potential than newly proposed projects like Rexas Finance. Furthermore, the timing of the market is quite essential. Projects like Rexas Finance are ideally positioned to profit from the momentum as Bitcoin lately enters a bullish phase and prepares the ground for a more significant market rise. During bull markets, smart money investors prioritize assets with more growth potential. Rexas Finance is an excellent prospect for explosive gains because of its unique location in the RWA tokenization field; for investors searching outside the RWA tokenization field, well-known projects like Solana, with their low entry price, excellent presale performance, and ambitious roadmap, offer a convincing argument. Conclusion Solana’s recent performance and institutional changes make the 2025 bull run an intriguing possibility, but Rexas Finance ‘s projected profits far outweigh Solana’s. With its creative approach to asset tokenization, fast adoption, and enormous development possibilities, Rexas Finance is fast rising to be the chosen alternative for smart money investors. The decision between Solana and Rexas Finance reduces risk against reward as the crypto market prepares for its next bull phase. Rexas Finance could be a convincing substitute for Solana for people looking for exponential returns and an opportunity to participate in a groundbreaking project.

37670824,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319572,1734259326,Bitcoin Proposal to Eliminate Decimals – Could This Shake Up Prices?,"The Bitcoin community is evaluating a proposal that could reshape how its units are measured. Introduced by Bitcoin advocate John Carvalho, the proposal eliminates decimals by redefining 1 BTC as the smallest unit—currently known as 1 Satoshi. This change would turn what is now 0.00010000 BTC into 10,000 BTCs, fundamentally shifting how Bitcoin’s value is represented. Carvalho argues that this proposal simplifies Bitcoin’s usage and makes the system easier to understand, particularly for new users. Under the current structure, 1 BTC equals 100 million Satoshis, requiring users to interpret figures with up to eight decimal places. Today, I submitted a new BIP proposal for public review: Redefinition of the Bitcoin Unit to the Base Denomination Abstract This BIP proposes redefining the commonly recognized ""bitcoin"" unit so that what was previously known as the smallest indivisible unit becomes the primary… — John Carvalho (@BitcoinErrorLog) December 13, 2024 “The decimal system is a human-imposed abstraction that creates unnecessary confusion,” Carvalho explained. By eliminating decimals, Bitcoin would align more closely with its underlying protocol, which represents value as integers, not fractions. Supporters: Simplicity Can Drive Wider Adoption Proponents see the proposal as a solution to Bitcoin’s “unit bias”—a psychological hurdle where potential investors perceive BTC as expensive due to its large price per coin. By redefining the smallest unit as Bitcoin itself, the currency could become more accessible to smaller investors. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo , co-founder of Ledn, believes the change would positively influence Bitcoin’s adoption: Smaller whole numbers would reduce intimidation for first-time buyers. Investors could more easily grasp and communicate BTC values. Simplified units would align with rising market demand and price growth. Give it 5 to 10 years and we won’t use Sats anymore. Wallets are already implementing bitcoin, plenty of bitcoiners are advocating for the change and as the price soars higher and higher we will naturally gravitate to using the term bitcoin. Sorry if you’re married to the… — Joe Nakamoto (@JoeNakamoto) December 14, 2024 Joe Nakamoto , another advocate, highlighted that wallets are already shifting toward Satoshi-based displays, signaling that change is inevitable. He noted, “As Bitcoin’s value climbs, the preference for smaller, whole numbers will become more natural.” Opposition: Risks to Bitcoin’s Scarcity Narrative Not everyone agrees with the proposal. Critics like Clara Bitcoin caution that redefining Bitcoin’s units could disrupt its foundational narrative— scarcity . The current 21 million BTC cap is central to Bitcoin’s identity as a scarce asset. Redefining the unit to 21 quadrillion “Bitcoins” risks confusing users and making Bitcoin’s fixed supply less compelling. “The 21 million limit is critical to Bitcoin’s value. Reframing it in smaller units risks diluting this message,” Clara argued. Opponents also emphasize that shifting terminology could create inconsistency across educational materials, wallets, and exchanges. Conclusion: Simplicity vs. Narrative Preservation Carvalho’s proposal brings forward an essential question: Should Bitcoin prioritize simplicity for broader adoption or preserve its established identity? While proponents see this as a logical step toward usability, critics argue that it risks undermining Bitcoin’s scarcity-driven value. Key Points : The proposal eliminates decimals by redefining 1 BTC as 1 Satoshi. Supporters believe it reduces psychological barriers for new investors. Critics warn it could weaken Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative and create confusion. As Bitcoin adoption grows, the community faces a choice—modernize its unit system or maintain the status quo.

She sees artificial intelligence as an exceptionally huge. Naturally, therefore, stocks are unlikely to be the only asset class that gets to benefit from such tailwinds. AI-facing meme coins like iDEGEN could rally on the back of AI mania as well. iDEGEN to benefit as AI use cases expand Lisa Thomas expects the artificial intelligence debate to expand from computing to a lot of other use cases in the coming years, including autonomous vehicles. So, it’s conceivable that investors will remain focused on gaining exposure to AI plays as artificial intelligence continues to expand and disrupt a whole bunch of industries. This will likely create a fertile environment for the native iDEGEN coin to increase in price as it’s a project that relies entirely on artificial intelligence to grow its knowledge base. And you can benefit from that price appreciation if you opt to build an early position in iDEGEN. After all, if you’re a meme coin enthusiast, why not invest in one that offers exposure to artificial intelligence as well? Click here to explore ways to invest in iDEGEN’s ongoing presale. Is iDEGEN the next meme coin with 100x potential? Note that AI meme coins like Zerebro have previously offered lucrative returns to investors. If iDEGEN follows in its footsteps, it may just prove to be the next meme coin with 100x potential – and the presale is already suggesting that it will do well. iDEGEN presale has raised more than $500,000 in less than a month indicates its AI narrative is sitting well with the investment community. As capital continues to flow in iDEGEN, its price will likely hit several new milestones in 2025. iDEGEN has a mechanism in place that bumps up its price during presale as well, but the real and recognizable increase in its price will likely materialise once it goes live on a crypto exchange after the presale. A meme coin is typically more accessible after a listing and the related ease of investing in it tends to drive new money into it that pushes the price up. And you’d be able to benefit from that price surge in iDEGEN if you choose to invest in it today.

37669761,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627669,1734257838,CZ casually brags about helping Elon buy Twitter – “Happy to have contributed to the cause”,"When you’re a heroic billionaire who helped finance the most controversial tech acquisition of the decade, you might want to remind people about it. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, founder and former CEO of Binance, did exactly that. He posted a screenshot, showing an article about Binance throwing in $500 million to help Elon Musk buy Twitter (now X), and captioned it with a confident, “Happy to have contributed to the cause.” The response from Elon was: “Thanks!” The $44 billion journey: From shareholder to owner Elon’s road to owning Twitter was anything but smooth. It started in April 2022, when Elon became Twitter’s largest shareholder by purchasing a 9.1% stake. Shortly after, he made an unsolicited offer to buy the entire company for $44 billion, pricing the stock at $54.20 per share. The reasoning? Elon claims he wanted to transform Twitter into a haven for free speech, claiming the platform had fallen victim to excessive censorship. But things got bad fast. Elon tried to back out of the deal, citing concerns over spam accounts. Twitter’s board wasn’t having it and dragged Elon into court. After months of legal drama, Elon gave in and finalized the acquisition on October 27, 2022. The price tag? $44 billion. And let’s be clear, many thought it was an insane overpayment for a platform struggling to stay relevant. But not CZ, evidently. Chaos reigns at Twitter (or X, if you prefer) The moment Elon walked into Twitter’s headquarters carrying a sink, it was clear this wasn’t going to be business as usual. One of his first moves was to fire half the workforce, including entire departments like content moderation and advertising sales. Critics accused him of gutting the company’s infrastructure. Supporters called it necessary streamlining. Elon also rolled out major changes to the platform’s content policies. He promised a freer, more open platform. What many users got instead was an increase in hate speech and misinformation . Advertisers, the lifeblood of Twitter’s revenue model, started fleeing. A survey revealed only 4% of advertisers felt X (the rebranded Twitter) was a safe place for their brands. The result? A massive dip in ad revenue. Financially, things went from bad to worse. By late 2024, X’s valuation had plummeted to around $15 billion—down nearly 80% from the $44 billion Elon shelled out. Fidelity analysts argued that Elon had overpaid from the start, estimating Twitter’s actual value at the time of purchase closer to $30 billion. Add to that over $1 billion in annual interest payments on loans taken to finance the deal, and Elon’s acquisition was shaping up to be a financial nightmare. Who all bankrolled Elon’s X gamble? Elon didn’t pull $44 billion out of thin air. He relied on a mix of his own wealth, bank loans, and backing from high-profile investors. Binance’s $500 million was just one piece of the puzzle. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison was another major contributor, as was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who retained his stake in Twitter. Former CEO Jack Dorsey also joined the list of backers, investing through a private entity. Big-name venture capital firms jumped in too. Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Gigafund all pitched in significant sums. Even alleged pedophile and sex offender Sean “Diddy” Combs made the list, investing through Sean Combs Capital, something Elon is constantly criticized for. The eccentric billionaire also sold billions worth of Tesla stock to finance the deal, a move that didn’t sit well with Tesla investors. He secured roughly $12.5 billion in loans from banks, including senior secured loans and subordinated debt. This financing structure left X with massive debt obligations that continue to weigh heavily on its finances. Elon’s goal now is to turn X into an “everything app,” similar to China’s WeChat . But executing that vision has proven to be anything but smooth. And he keeps adding on to his responsibilities with his recent involvement in the incoming US presidential administration. User engagement has been a mixed bag. Some metrics show resilience, while others indicate declining activity due to policy changes and a rise in toxic content. Elon himself acknowledged the challenges, admitting the purchase brought him “mega pain” but insisting it was necessary for humanity to take the “good fork in the road.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cz-brags-helping-elon-buy-twitter/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37669761.jpeg

These wallets, holding less than 1 BTC, are projected to grow by approximately 9%, reflecting a robust retail interest in the leading cryptocurrency. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler highlighted this trend in a Dec. 14 post, noting the resilience of shrimp holders in the face of high prices. “Despite being labeled as ‘shrimps,’ these holders are showing strong confidence in Bitcoin’s growth, continuing to accumulate coins even at current price levels,” he stated. Currently, shrimp wallets amount to 323,000 addresses. Adler forecasts this number to climb to 351,000 shortly, marking an 8.67% increase. This growth momentum traces back to when Bitcoin traded at $61,000, during which the number of shrimp wallets stood at 265,000 — a 21.9% rise since that price level. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Adopt a Contrasting Strategy While shrimp wallets are growing, long-term holders — those retaining Bitcoin for over 155 days — have been offloading their assets. Data reveals that these investors sold 827,783 BTC over the past month , raising concerns about a potential market top. Some analysts warn that the sell-off could trigger bearish conditions, especially if buy-side demand diminishes. However, market indicators suggest the extent of any future corrections may not match the severity of Bitcoin’s recent 10% dip in early December. A Bitfinex report from Dec. 9 pointed to reduced sell-side pressure and declining realized profit-taking. “With such a decline in realized profit and sell-side pressure, we can expect future declines to be less abrupt than the one experienced last week,” the report stated. Resilient Retail Interest The expansion of shrimp wallets highlights the confidence of retail investors in Bitcoin’s long-term value. This metric serves as a barometer for understanding grassroots adoption of the cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin hovers at $101,549, according to CoinMarketCap, the diverging behaviors of shrimp investors and long-term holders underscore a complex market dynamic. While some are cashing out, smaller investors are capitalizing on opportunities to accumulate, suggesting a bullish sentiment persists at the retail level despite broader market fluctuations. Whether Bitcoin’s price will maintain its upward trajectory or face further corrections remains uncertain. However, the unwavering faith of shrimp wallets hints at a steadfast belief in Bitcoin’s potential among smaller investors.

Looking at Bitcoin itself, Negentropic says BTC has so far failed to launch a massive surge above $100,000 due to the selling pressure coming from long-term holders, entities that have held their BTC stacks for more than 155 days. The Glassnode executives believe that long-term holders are almost out of coins to unload, putting Bitcoin in a position to ascend at the start of 2025. “Long-Term Holders Selling Pressure Continues. Key Insight: Long-Term Holders (LTHs) have hit their lowest holdings of the year, marking the largest outflow in 2024. Triggers: Back-to-back liquidations contributed to significant selling, alongside the year-end profit-taking season. Looking Ahead: The start of the new year may signal the end of this selling streak, setting the stage for a potential shift in market dynamics. How will this trend affect Bitcoin in the end of 2024?” Source: Negentropic/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $101,893.

Supply chains, a backbone of the global economy, stand to gain immensely from blockchain’s promise of transparency, security, and efficiency. Projects like Filecoin (FIL) and ZIGnaly (ZIG) are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in supply chain management, but a newcomer, Qubetics ($TICS), is set to redefine the game entirely. While Filecoin focuses on decentralised storage and ZIGnaly transforms investment strategies with social trading, Qubetics is tackling multiple supply chain challenges with one smart, scalable solution. With its presale gaining traction, Qubetics isn’t just a crypto—it’s a complete ecosystem designed to revolutionise how businesses operate. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Supply Chains with Blockchain Qubetics is leading the charge in modernising supply chains, combining blockchain’s best features with practical solutions for businesses. A cornerstone of Qubetics’ innovation is its application of real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT). This allows assets to be digitised and tracked seamlessly on the blockchain, from raw materials to finished goods. Imagine a local farmer in Iowa supplying organic produce to markets nationwide. With Qubetics, they can tokenise their shipments, ensuring that buyers know the exact origin, quality, and route of their products. On the flip side, multinational corporations can use Qubetics to streamline logistics, reducing fraud and inefficiencies while boosting consumer trust. Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet takes blockchain usability to the next level. Whether you’re in New York or Nairobi, it lets you make payments in crypto with the simplicity of Apple Pay or Google Pay. A small manufacturer in Vietnam could pay overseas suppliers in stablecoins, avoiding currency conversion fees and delays. Additionally, Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism protects users from market volatility, converting crypto to fiat instantly at the point of sale. Currently in its presale phase, Qubetics is priced at just $0.0311 per $TICS token. With over $6M raised and 325M tokens sold, the project has already attracted 8,700+ investors. Analysts predict its value will soar to $0.25 post-presale, offering an eye-watering 900% ROI. For businesses looking to integrate blockchain into supply chains, Qubetics isn’t just an option—it’s a necessity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics stands out for its real-world applications and transformative potential, making it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for those ready to invest in the future of supply chains. Filecoin (FIL): Decentralised Storage for Smarter Supply Chains Filecoin is carving a niche as the decentralised solution for data storage, addressing a key challenge in supply chains: secure and transparent data management. By incentivising users to rent out unused storage space, Filecoin creates a distributed network where supply chain data—such as inventory levels, shipping documents, and quality certifications—can be stored securely and accessed globally. For instance, a pharmaceutical company in Boston could use Filecoin to store and track temperature logs for vaccine shipments. This ensures compliance with regulations while providing full transparency to stakeholders. Similarly, small businesses in emerging markets can leverage Filecoin’s cost-effective storage solutions to compete with larger players. Filecoin’s appeal extends beyond storage. Its robust ecosystem supports integrations with other blockchain networks, making it a valuable tool for creating end-to-end supply chain solutions. Analysts are optimistic about FIL’s growth, with predictions of strong adoption across industries in the coming years. Why did this coin make it to this list? Filecoin’s focus on decentralised storage and data transparency makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for businesses aiming to modernise their supply chains. ZIGnaly (ZIG): Empowering Supply Chain Investments with Social Trading ZIGnaly may not be the first name you associate with supply chains, but its innovative approach to social trading has major implications for this sector. The platform allows users to mirror the trades of successful investors, making crypto trading more accessible and efficient. For supply chain businesses, ZIGnaly offers a unique opportunity to grow their investment portfolios without requiring deep trading expertise. Consider a logistics startup in Austin looking to diversify its earnings. By leveraging ZIGnaly’s social trading features, the company can allocate a portion of its revenue to passive crypto investments, creating an additional income stream. On the individual level, supply chain professionals can use ZIGnaly to grow their personal wealth, reinvesting profits back into their operations. ZIGnaly’s transparent fee structure and risk management tools make it particularly attractive for cautious investors. With its growing user base and expanding integrations, the platform is poised to play a larger role in the crypto ecosystem moving forward. Why did this coin make it to this list? ZIGnaly’s ability to combine investment accessibility with growth opportunities makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for supply chain professionals and businesses alike. Conclusion: Qubetics vs. Filecoin vs. ZIGnaly—Which One Wins? Each of these projects offers something unique, catering to different facets of supply chain innovation. Filecoin excels in secure, decentralised storage, making it a go-to solution for transparent data management. ZIGnaly empowers businesses and individuals to grow their wealth through accessible social trading. But Qubetics is in a league of its own. By combining real-world asset tokenisation with user-friendly payment solutions, it’s addressing core challenges in supply chain management while offering unmatched growth potential for investors. For those looking to balance their portfolios, the smartest move is diversification. Filecoin brings reliability, ZIGnaly offers financial empowerment, and Qubetics delivers groundbreaking innovation. Together, they form a powerhouse lineup for 2025 . Based on the latest research, we recommend investing in Qubetics ($TICS), Filecoin (FIL), and ZIGnaly (ZIG) this December. Don’t miss out—secure your financial future and be part of the next wave in blockchain innovation.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA.

After a lightning-fast presale that raised an impressive $7 million and drew in nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is now gearing up for its listing on Gate.io and other major exchanges — and it’s happening on December 14th. During the presale, $CYBRO’s price surged 450% from $0.01 to $0.055 in its final stage. Now, with the token set to list at $0.06 on major exchanges, demand is through the roof. Many are predicting a 100x price surge once it hits the open market, thanks to the strong momentum and solid fundamentals backing the project. Join CYBRO Before the Listing Frenzy Drives Prices to the Moon What’s behind the hype? CYBRO combines cutting-edge AI with a user-friendly platform, offering tools like staking, farming, and lending that make DeFi investing accessible to everyone — from cautious newcomers to bold risk-takers. During its short presale CYBRO has already gone a long way in achieving crucial milestones: CYBRO App Launched: Users can now explore around 30 vaults offering competitive annual percentage yields (APY) to match their investment strategies perfectly First One-Click Strategy Introduced: The Blast Index, available in the Vaults list and on the One-Click page, simplifies investing by integrating with lending protocols Rapid Development Progress: CYBRO’s platform has laid the groundwork for seamless DeFi experiences, setting the stage for future growth and innovation. And there’s more to come. CYBRO’s roadmap through 2025 promises features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and even smarter AI tools, cementing its place as a game-changer in decentralized finance. With the listing just around the corner, $CYBRO is about to make its mark on major exchanges with all the momentum it’s built so far, this token looks ready to take off. Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It enables developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work model. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially handling up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Kaspa Explores GHOSTDAG in Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, it allows parallel blocks to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means more blocks can be processed at the same time. Kaspa’s blockchain is a blockDAG, which helps maintain high block rates. Currently, it processes 1 block per second and aims for higher. The confirmation times are very short, mainly limited by internet speed. Kaspa has features like Reachability to check the network’s structure, Block data pruning to save space, and SPV proofs. Sui: A New Layer-1 Blockchain Focused on Scalability and User Experience Sui is a new layer-1 blockchain platform designed to meet global adoption needs. It offers a secure, powerful, and scalable development platform. Sui uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address inefficiencies in existing blockchains. It prioritizes user experience by removing common barriers in blockchain interactions. Through features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui aims to make Web3 applications more accessible and user-friendly. Stellar Lumens (XLM): Connecting the World’s Financial Systems Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a cryptocurrency that powers the Stellar network, a decentralized platform for global payments. It allows users to transfer funds quickly and at low cost, regardless of the currency. Stellar supports transfers of any type of currency, including digital versions of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The network aims to improve existing financial systems by connecting them on a single platform. Individuals can send money worldwide using Stellar applications. Businesses can build blockchain apps or use the network for payments and currency exchanges. Backed by the Stellar Development Foundation, which maintains the network and fosters community engagement, Stellar offers a way to enhance how money moves across the globe. Conclusion While ADA, KAS, SUI, and XLM show promise for significant growth by December 2024, their short-term potential is limited. In contrast, CYBRO offers immediate opportunities for investors to maximize earnings. As a technologically advanced DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO provides AI-powered yield aggregation. Investors benefit from lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. The platform ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. With a strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project. Its appeal is evident in the strong interest from crypto whales and influencers.

37669135,https://thecoinrise.com/former-thailand-pm-urges-nation-to-embrace-crypto-innovation/,1734253809,Former Thailand PM Urges Nation to Embrace Crypto Innovation,"Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has called on Thailand to intensify its study of cryptocurrencies to keep pace with global financial trends. Addressing an audience at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hua Hin, Shinawatra underscored the growing prominence of digital assets in the international economic landscape. “There are already many cryptocurrencies. Some people say that in the future, we will have more currencies than countries. Today, Thai people must think and understand this,” Shinawatra stated, urging the nation to view cryptocurrencies as a crucial part of the evolving global economy. Shinawatra also highlighted geopolitical shifts, pointing to the potential implications of the Trump administration’s trade tariffs and discussions about using Bitcoin to manage national debt. While not advocating for Thailand to purchase cryptocurrencies, he stressed the importance of proactive exploration and regulatory experimentation in this domain. Thailand Already Advancing Crypto Adoption Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already taken significant steps toward fostering digital asset innovation. In August 2024, the SEC introduced a crypto regulatory sandbox, allowing selected service providers to test financial technologies in a controlled and supportive environment. This initiative reflects the nation’s willingness to experiment with blockchain and crypto applications. The Pheu Thai political party has also utilized digital cash distribution as an economic stimulus strategy. In July 2024, 45 million Thai residents received 10,000 baht (approximately $280) each as part of a campaign promise. This initiative demonstrated the potential of integrating digital solutions into national economic policy. Kasikornbank, the country’s second-largest bank, further became Thailand’s first licensed crypto custodian in September 2024. Its services are aimed at enabling digital asset businesses to manage their holdings securely, signaling an institutional shift toward crypto adoption. Building Bridges with Global Crypto Leaders In October 2024, Thailand’s Bank of Thailand partnered with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Project Ensemble to test tokenized cross-border settlements. This collaboration underscores Thailand’s intention to position itself as a leader in digital finance by leveraging global partnerships. As the Thai SEC explores new regulations to grant mutual and private funds access to cryptocurrencies, the nation is edging closer to institutional crypto adoption. With calls for deeper exploration and strategic regulatory moves, Thailand seems poised to balance innovation with security, shaping its role in the global digital economy.

Cardano (ADA) whales accumulate more coins and buy the dip to increase their holdings. These whales, whose wallets contain between 100 million and one billion ADA coins, bought more than 100 million ADA worth $110 million over the past few days, based on the data of Santiment shared by analyst Ali Martinez. Their cumulative holdings now stand at 3.26 billion ADA, suggesting a bullish outlook for the asset despite recent price corrections. ADA is trading at $1.06, down 4.16% in the last 24 hours. Whales Buying Big During ADA Dips Recent trends indicate that there is a deliberate plan among ADA whales. When Cardano temporarily pulled back from the $1 mark again, the whales took advantage of the situation to purchase even more. This pattern is similar to their action in November when ADA traded between $0.50 and $0.60. Whales bought tokens aggressively, followed by a cutback once the price spiked to $0.70 and $0.80. While the selling during pumps is notable, their net holdings continue to grow, reflecting an overall bullish stance. Over the past month, these investors have significantly increased their positions, capitalizing on market fluctuations. Whale holdings increased from October 18th to November 18th by 145%, reaching $12.11 Billion. ADA holders with more than $10 million increased this figure, while wallets with a $1-10 million balance increased 83% to $3.9 billion. Wallets with ADA ranging between $100,000 to $1 million also increased by 106% to $4.36 billion. On the other hand, the impact was less severe among retail investors who cut down their exposure by 39%, with only $285,490 invested. ADA holders with $10K – $100K also sold assets while reducing their holdings by 7.65%. Signals for a Potential Rally Whales’ buying activity often signals potential price momentum. The current accumulation trend hints at a possible continuation of ADA’s bullish rally in the coming days. Cardano may see increased market confidence as their holdings expand, driving prices higher before another correction. Cardano’s price movements and whale activity underscore a clear strategy: buy the dips and profit from the pumps.

According to the firm, this optimism could pave the way for a market decline that could provide a better entry point for new investments. Alphractal noted the historical correlation between market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price movements. “Negative sentiment on Twitter and news sites has often coincided with local price bottoms, particularly for Bitcoin,” the firm said. Sentiment analysis algorithms track and classify public sentiment as negative, neutral, or positive. When negative sentiment prevails, Bitcoin’s price often buck the trend and hit a local bottom before recovering, Alphractal explained. “This shift leaves many traders anxious and skeptical as prices begin to rise again,” the company added. Related News: Former Thai Prime Minister Announces Bitcoin Price Prediction, Calls for BTC in His Country The report also highlighted SUI, a layer-1 blockchain token, as it faces high risk in both the short and long term.

According to the firm’s analysis of 7-day aggregated liquidation levels, the price of SUI could rise to $5 to liquidate remaining bear positions.

Experts believe this is the start of the mega bull run, which usually lasts 1.5-2 years and presents opportunities in the market to create positions that can make six-figure returns. Ripple (XRP) is one of the large coins that has delivered tremendous returns; even in this bull market, it has performed exceptionally well. Even though the XRP price had significant momentum last month, it has already seen its largest upswing. To capitalize on this bull run, emerging opportunities like DTX Exchange (DTX) are better investment options than large-caps like Ripple. Ripple (XRP) Trades In Pennant Pattern, Eyes ATH Recent political events in the US have boosted the XRP price, sending it near its all-time high of 2018. Still, the regulatory challenges from the SEC have not been entirely resolved, but the resignation of SEC chairman Gary Gensler is positive news for Ripple investors. The XRP price has surged 262% in the last 30 days, which shows its high demand amid the bull market. Currently, the XRP price is trading in a triangle pennant pattern, which is generally the continuation pattern of the previous trend. This pattern’s upper resistance is at $2.50, the local major barrier. A breakout from this pattern could push the XRP price to uncharted territory. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) recently approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin for listing, bringing more positive news for the XRP price. This decision boosts Ripple’s role in the digital payments sector and marks an important step forward for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) Ripple ecosystem. For the XRP price to reach the much-anticipated ATH price breakout, consistent spikes in trading volume with price increases are important. DTX Exchange Presale Outpacing Crypto Giants DTX Exchange, a solid player in the DeFi market, has dominated the crypto market since the launch of its presale. Last week, with the $10 million milestone, it became the fastest presale to achieve the feat. According to crypto price analysts, DTX Exchange’s growth potential parallels Ripple’s price trajectory, making it a big competitor of the top altcoins. DTX Exchange has experienced high demand from investors because of its revolutionary offerings. This trading exchange introduces the first platform that combines the features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Investors can access 120,000 instruments along with exceptional 1,000X leverage. This diverse investment availability and the benefit of increasing profit give the DTX Exchange center stage. The VulcanX blockchain, specifically designed to bring traditional assets to the Web3 platform, enables the exchange’s hybrid nature. This blockchain is also responsible for reducing fees and increasing exchange speed. The blockchain’s testnet has already been launched, achieving a speed of 100,000 transactions per second, one of the highest in the industry. The DTX token is currently priced at $0.12, which projects a quick 300% upside potential before 2025 starts. Key Takeaways DTX Exchange presents a promising opportunity for investors eyeing transformative gains. Its innovative trading approach, hybrid blockchain, and strong growth potential position it to disrupt the market, making it a solid contender against major players like Ripple. DTX Exchange has quickly gained attention as a top choice for profit-driven investors. With its advanced technology and the buzz surrounding its listing, DTX stands out as an investment capable of delivering impressive six-figure returns.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. AVAX & TRX dominate trades, but Rollblock promises 1,000x growth by 2025. Table of Contents Imminent Avalanche upgrade drives record trade volume Tron’s price action begins to settle after week of volatile trading Rollblock: top altcoins with next generation crypto gambling and unique tokenomics Avalanche (AVAX) and Tron (TRX) are two of the most widely traded tokens right now. However, experts are focusing on the top altcoin in the crypto gambling sector for the biggest possible gains. Crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) has incorporated innovative tokenomics that could lead to growth in excess of 1,000x in 2025. With only a few weeks remaining in Rollblock’s crypto presale, experts are warning that there is little time left to get in before it explodes higher. Imminent Avalanche upgrade drives record trade volume The rapid rise in the Avalanche price comes as this top altcoin is dominating the headlines. Avalanche is up 5% today on its imminent upgrade and recent private funding. The highly anticipated Avalanche 9000 upgrade will launch on the 16th of December. Avalanche also recently announced $250 million in private funding from Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly to support this upgrade. However, expert forecasts only see another 10% to 20% increase for the Avalanche price in 2025. You might also like: Cardano reaches $1 but experts believe Pepe Unchained and Rollblock have more potential Tron’s price action begins to settle after week of volatile trading Tron continues to see a flurry of trading activity after a week of highly volatile price action. Tron’s price saw over 3% losses so far today as traders tried to time the bottom of its week-long round trip. This volatile Tron price action started last week when a declaration of martial law in South Korea sent investors fleeing from its exchanges. Tron’s numerous DEXs were the obvious destination, which sent its price soaring 100% in a matter of hours. Experts are noting that this volatile price action for Tron is mostly over now, with the price settling about 50% above its position before the initial surge. Rollblock: top altcoins with next generation crypto gambling and unique tokenomics With Tron’s and Avalanche’s rallies already nearing their peaks, experts are recommending Rollblock’s crypto presale instead. Rollblock is now the unchallenged top altcoin in the crypto gambling sector, which means that it is set to take a lion’s share of the $500 billion in revenue generated by this industry each year. The key to Rollblock ’s success is its unique take on tokenomics. Rollblock’s tokenomics is designed to drive massive player growth by generating value and income through its gambling tokens. This system is powered by weekly buybacks that employ a share of the casino’s own revenue. Weekly burn events are used to generate value for RBLK. Income is also generated by using the remaining buybacks as high-APY rewards for staking on Rollblock’s platform. This approach to driving player growth through unique tokenomics is built on a foundation of next-generation crypto gambling. Rollblock already has tens of thousands of players enjoying its platform of 7,000 casino games and global sports betting. RBLK’s current price of $0.041 is set to increase at least another three times through the remaining stages of its crypto presale. However, the real prize is the forecast for more than 1,000x growth once this top altcoin hits the open market in early 2025.

37667247,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98893,1734252546,Tron’s USDT Volumes Tap New All-Time High Above $587 Billion,"Tron’s stablecoin dominance has continued to surge in recent months, hitting a new all-time high. The influx of new crypto users and growing adoption has spurred the market to new levels. Like other assets, stablecoins soared based on utility to institutional and retail investors this year. A new market report shows the USDT transfer volume on Tron reached new highs in the last 30 days. The network recorded $587.2 billion in USDT transfer volumes last month. This jump added to the growth seen in previous months following the wider market rebound. Before this month, October and September tapped $489.3 billion and $424.4 billion, respectively. “ Stablecoins have seen remarkable growth, driven by strong interest in cryptocurrencies over recent months. TRON has emerged as the leading blockchain for stablecoin transfers. This chart highlights the monthly USDT transfer volumes. In November 2024, USDT transfers hit an all-time high of $587.2B, marking a significant increase compared to previous months. The growth of stablecoins continues to rise.” Stablecoin Adoption Soars The last 12 months have seen increased stablecoin adoption globally, with users pushing toward cross-border payments. While settlement and global transactions were key factors in the growth of stablecoins, institutional investors boosted all metrics. Most stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, giving investors confidence, unlike other volatile crypto assets. As gateway assets, stablecoins help onboard new entrants to the market, offering stability. Most platforms offer withdrawals and other benefits in stablecoins. The market benefited from the huge inflows, and stablecoins have become integrated into decentralized applications and as a way for investors to measure gains. Macroeconomic trends have pushed several consumers to web3, with users holders converting assets to stablecoins, adding to the growing volume. This month, the market cap of stablecoins moved past the $200 billion mark for the first time on the back of yield generation and payment factors. Tron (TRX) Records Sharp Growth Users traded stablecoin across Tron due to cost efficiency compared to other popular networks. These inflows have positively affected TRX’s general market performance. The asset gained over 160% in the last 12 months, notching huge gains after the U.S. elections in November. The asset’s market cap inched close to $39 billion due to the price rally that followed Justin Sun’s investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance.",POSITIVE,TRX | USDT,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TRX | USDT,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trons-usdt-volumes-tap-new-all-time-high-above-587-billion/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-bitcoin-reserve-trumpres-will-explode-over-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

BTC could surge higher as President-elect Donald Trump says the U.S. will do something great with crypto. This has prompted investors to flock to a new, promising real estate altcoin. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is a real estate tokenization platform. PropiChain is regarded as an undervalued gem with massive upside potential. This is because it has a price of $0.011 in the second round of its token presale . This is very close to its lowest-ever price. Currently priced at just $0.004 during its ongoing token presale, PCHAIN is seen as an undervalued gem. PropiChain uses blockchain, AI, and the metaverse to transform the real estate sector.

Namely, they lost almost $2 billion as many altcoins dipped. Cardano (ADA) also decreased in price. So, Cardano investors also lost money. NEIRO was also caught up. However, experts say that both ADA and NEIRO will bounce back. On the other hand, FXGuys ($FXG) has been doing really well. This new crypto trading platform is still in its public presale. It didn’t suffer during the recent dip. Instead, many invested in the FXGuys presale. With that in mind, experts say that FXGuys will outperform NEIRO and Cardano soon! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE NEIRO’s Price Is Down Amid a Market-Wide Sell-Off NEIRO also got swept up by the market-wide dip. A month ago, NEIRO’s price was nearly at $0.003. Now, NEIRO’s price is at $0.0016 . So, the decrease that NEIRO had in price was quite steep. At first, the dip in NEIRO’s price happened because of investors taking profits. However, NEIRO’s price dip got bigger due to the recent market-wide sell-offs. That’s why NEIRO’s price is at these levels now. Luckily, experts say that this isn’t that bad. They say that it’s normal for decreases to happen after large rallies. So, NEIRO and other coins are just balancing out after the recent post-US elections run. With that in mind, experts say that NEIRO will bounce back soon. They say this because NEIRO is still very popular. Also, it has a strong community. So, they say that NEIRO’s price can go back to $0.003 soon! ADA’s Price Dropped Below $1 During the Bearish Wave Cardano was another victim of the market-wide dip. During it, ADA’s price went below $1. Namely, ADA’s price dropped to around $0.90. However, it recovered quickly. Right now, Cardano’s price is at $1.08 . This is a great sign for Cardano. It shows that there’s a lot of interest in it right now. It also shows that Cardano investors are confident. A popular analyst agrees with this statement. Namely, Ali Martinez recently stated that ADA will bounce back soon. He said that Cardano is doing the same as it was in 2020. So, he sees ADA’s price going to $4-$6 in 2025! This would be an increase of up to 455% for ADA.

37668433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662613,1734251425,"Analyst Reveals Key Ethereum Support Zone Amid $4,000 Price Struggle","Following a market rebound, Ethereum (ETH) has shown only sideways movement in the past few days as the battle to break beyond the $4,000 price region continues. While investors continue speculating on the asset’s next movement, the recent development of a new support region hints at a continued upward trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Metrics Looking Strong – Momentum Building For ETH? ETH Bulls Form Strong Support At $3,700 – $3,810 In an X post on December 14, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed the formation of a critical support zone in the Ethereum market. Based on data from IntoTheBlock, Martinez shares that 3 million distinct wallets acquired 4.6 million ETH, valued at $17.6 billion, at prices between $3,700-$3,810 with an average market price of $3,751. Such high level of accumulation activity identifies this price range as a significant zone of investor interest. Importantly, this heightened buying pressure converts $3,700-$3,810 to a vital support zone as market bulls will be compelled to defend this price range in the case of a price decline. Furthermore, despite Ethereum’s struggle to make any meaningful breakout past $4,000 so far, investors purchasing massive amounts of ETH at high price levels indicates market confidence in the asset’s ability to move past the presented resistance and sustain its price growth. However, it is worth noting that Ethereum losing this support zone due to an overwhelming bearish sentiment will result in immediate substantial losses that can induce a further price decline. If this market scenario occurs, ETH could slide as low as $3,565, with the next available support level being $3,303.

In a recent X post, Santiment states that an average of 130,200 new addresses are being created on the Ethereum network each day in December – the highest ever since April. This rise in new wallets suggests an influx of retail and institutional investors as evidenced by multiple developments including Ethereum’s price performance in Q4 2024, a booming DeFi ecosystem as well as the recent bullish performance of the spot Ethereum ETFs. In terms of implications, this rapid network growth can boost network activity, transaction volume, and ETH demand thereby resulting in a further price increase. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,885 with a decline of 0.99% in the past day. Albeit, this loss only underscores the turbulent past trading week where Ethereum dipped by a cumulative 2.75%.

With countless options vying for investor interest, three cryptocurrencies are shaping up as standout contenders. While Monero and Kaspa are grabbing headlines for their unique attributes, Qukbetics ($TICS) is creating a buzz as one of the best altcoins to join in December 2024. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking Web3 vision, is catching the eye of early adopters and seasoned investors alike. The ongoing presale draws unparalleled interest, offering a rare chance to get in before its ecosystem redefines decentralised solutions. This article delves into the latest developments of all three coins: Qubetics, Monero, and Kaspa. Qubetics: Redefining Privacy with dVPN Innovation What if your internet browsing were not only secure but also truly decentralised? Qubetics ($TICS) has turned this vision into reality with its decentralised VPN (dVPN) service . Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralised systems, Qubetics leverages blockchain technology to offer unmatched privacy, transparency, and freedom. Imagine browsing the internet without fear of censorship or data tracking—this is precisely what Qubetics delivers. Key to its innovation is the peer-to-peer architecture, which eliminates the vulnerabilities of centralised systems. In this ecosystem, users share bandwidth and earn $TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining network that encourages active participation. Multi-hop routing and encryption further ensure that your online presence remains anonymous and your data is protected. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted a live AMA session , offering its community an opportunity to connect with the team and gain insights into its ambitious roadmap. These developments position Qubetics as the best altcoin to join in December 2024, promising transformative solutions for Web3 enthusiasts. Monero: The Pioneer of Privacy Coins Monero has long been recognised as a leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency. By prioritising user anonymity through stealth addresses and ring signatures, it offers unparalleled transaction security. This makes it a favourite among those who value confidentiality in their financial dealings. With no public transaction history, Monero remains a reliable choice for privacy advocates seeking a dependable crypto asset. Kaspa: Lightning-Fast Transactions with Layer-1 Innovation Kaspa is making waves for its ultra-fast transaction capabilities. As a Layer-1 cryptocurrency, it combines security and scalability without compromising on speed. Its efficient architecture allows for near-instantaneous confirmations, catering to a growing need for seamless transactions in the crypto world. For users and developers alike, Kaspa’s focus on speed and reliability positions it as a contender worth watching in the blockchain ecosystem. The Qubetics Presale Is Live: Why It’s the Best Altcoin to Join in December 2024 The Qubetics presale is currently in Phase 12, and the numbers speak volumes about this project’s enthusiasm. With a token price of $0.031 and over $6 million already raised, the momentum is building rapidly. Each week brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a final phase that promises a 20% hike. For those contemplating their next crypto move, this is a moment not to miss. With a post-presale target of $0.25 per token, the return potential for early investors is striking. The structured phases build excitement and reward those who act promptly. If you’re searching for the best altcoin to join in December 2024 , Qubetics offers an unmissable opportunity with its impressive ROI potential. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Among Top Altcoins As 2024 draws to a close, analysts closely watch projects like Qubetics, Monero, and Kaspa for their potential to redefine the crypto landscape. Monero remains the go-to for privacy-conscious users, while Kaspa’s speed-focused approach addresses scalability challenges. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands apart with its innovative decentralised VPN, which aligns perfectly with the future of Web3. The ongoing presale offers a rare window of opportunity, with prices poised to soar in the final stages. As the best altcoin to join in December 2024, Qubetics combines cutting-edge technology with tangible use cases, making it a compelling addition to any crypto portfolio. Don’t let this chance slip away—explore the Qubetics presale today and be part of a transformative journey.

37667121,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52215,1734250138,Updated Report About BlackRock’s Interest In XRP ETF,"Recent reports indicate that BlackRock, the global wealth management leader, does not plan to introduce a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on XRP or other altcoins. The company focuses on its current products rather than exploring new cryptocurrency ETFs. BlackRock Prioritizes Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently shared updates, citing Jay Jacobs, the head of BlackRock’s ETF division. Jacobs clarified that the firm’s immediate focus is on expanding the reach of its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which are still in the early stages of adoption among their client base. As such, BlackRock has no intention of launching new ETFs for XRP or other altcoins soon. Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Colin Wu also weighed in , reminding the community of the broader regulatory context in the U.S. He noted that while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve ETFs for altcoins like XRP and SOL by the end of next year, BlackRock remains committed to its current offerings. Rumors and Recent Developments Earlier in November, there were rumors regarding BlackRock’s interest in an XRP ETF after a false filing surfaced. This filing, labeled as a request to establish an iShares XRP Trust, was quickly debunked by BlackRock, which confirmed it had no association with the document. In contrast, other asset managers have moved forward with legitimate filings for XRP-focused ETFs. For instance, WisdomTree applied for a spot XRP ETF in late November. Other firms, such as Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, have also filed for XRP ETFs throughout the year, signaling a growing interest in the token as an investment vehicle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent Movements and Market Performance On the blockchain side, Ripple has been involved in significant transactions. Whale Alert, a prominent cryptocurrency tracker, reported a transaction involving 99 million XRP (approximately $234 million) transferred between two anonymous wallets. Data from Bithomp revealed that the sender of this transaction was a wallet associated with Ripple, while the recipient was the U.S.-based BitGo platform, known for providing custodial services to financial institutions. These movements follow two earlier transactions reported by Bithomp, in which Ripple transferred 380 million XRP and 200 million XRP—valued at a combined $1.5 billion in fiat. Despite these transfers, the token has shown resilience in the market. Over the past week, its value has increased by approximately 2.8%, and the token is currently trading at $2.49 While regulatory developments could pave the way for ETFs in the future, BlackRock’s decision to focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum reflects its current strategic priorities. At the same time, significant whale activity and Ripple’s involvement in large transactions suggest continued interest in the asset, which could influence its future adoption and market performance.

37666793,https://invezz.com/?p=2387734,1734250058,Bitcoin price prediction: The long-term bullish case for BTC,"Bitcoin price has held steady in the past few months, and is holding near a record high as demand remains high. The coin was trading at $101,760, which is about 570% from its lowest point in 2022, making it the best-performing major asset. Bitcoin demand and supply dynamics All signs show that Bitcoin has strong demand and supply dynamics, which explains why the price may continue rising in the near term. Bitcoin has a supply cap of 21 million coins and the total supply as of now is 19.79 million. This leaves about 1.21 million coins to be mined. At the same time, millions of coins have been lost permanently, while the amount of Bitcoins in exchanges has dropped to the lowest level in years. These coins stand at about 2.2 million, meaning that millions more are held in self-custody accounts. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has continued to rise, especially because of the halving events. It is unclear whether many mining companies will produce enough coins in the next few decades. Therefore, Bitcoin’s supply will continue being a big challenge in the next few years. At the same time, demand is expected to continue rising in the next few years. Recent data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing robust inflows. These funds have had over $35 billion in inflows this year, a trend that may continue in the next few years. Most importantly, companies will likely continue buying more coins in the future. Data shows that companies like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, Tesla, and Coinbase owns thousands of coins. Other large holders are firms like Block, Galaxy Digital, Semler Scientific, and NEXON have continued to buy more coins. The next wave of purchases will likely come from mainstream companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Amazon. These firms have seen MicroStrategy’s success and will likely want to replicate it over time. Countries to start buying BTC After that, countries will likely start buying these coins. Already, the US holds thousands of Bitcoins, which it has seized from criminal organizations. Donald Trump is considering converting these coins into a strategic reserve. If this happens, more countries will likely embrace Bitcoin as their reserve assets. Already, most countries like China, Russia, and Turkey have invested in gold, and many analysts see Bitcoin as a digital gold. If this happens, it will make Bitcoin, a rare asset, rarer. A main catalyst for such a move will be the soaring global debt, which has been in a strong uptrend. The US now has over $36.3 trillion in public debt, a figure that is growing by $1 trillion each quarter. This means that it will cross the $40 trillion mark in the next few years. Other countries are not doing well either. For example, China has over 71 trillion RMB in debt or 69% of the GDP, a figure that is growing. The same trend is happening in Europe, where a country like France is seeing a near 10% deficit. Therefore, there are chances that these countries will move to Bitcoin, which is seen as a good asset. Bitcoin price analysis The weekly chart shows that the price of Bitcoin has been in a strong bull run in the past few months. It has constantly remained above all moving averages and formed a cup and handle pattern. If we measure the depth of the cup, we can assume that the coin will rise to $122,000 in this bullish cycle. If this happens, it will then suffer a brief pullback and then resume the strong bullish trend in the next few months. Over time, Bitcoin may rise to over $200,000.

37665850,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374602,1734249898,Robinhood Recorded $119B in Crypto Notional Trading Volume This Year: Report,"The cryptocurrency arm of the American financial services company Robinhood has released its end-of-the-year report for 2024, outlining its growth and expansion to new markets over the past 11 months. Alongside the report release, Robinhood Crypto is celebrating the first anniversary of launching a digital asset trading division in Europe. Robinhood Releases End of Year Report According to the report , Robinhood Crypto recorded a notional trading volume of $119 billion and $38 billion in crypto assets under custody as of November 2024. The entity said 2024 was an important year for its business because of the milestones it achieved. Robinhood Crypto expanded its services in the United States by achieving full coverage in 50 states and territories, including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company increased the number of available cryptocurrencies in the U.S. to 20 by adding new assets like Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE), and dogwifhat (WIF). It also launched a new trading application programming interface for its U.S. users, offering tools to view market data, manage portfolios, and place advanced orders. In Europe, Robinhood added 14 new coins for local customers, bringing the number of supported assets to 40. The firm also launched SOL and ether (ETH) staking for its European users. Regulatory Challenges Furthermore, Robinhood’s crypto wallet saw notable developments. The crypto firm launched the wallet on Android and introduced advanced swapping features across several Ethereum-based networks, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Base. The company also redesigned its token discovery tab, making it easier for users to find and manage their assets. It is worth mentioning that Robinhood’s 2024 experience was not without challenges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) slapped the entity with a Wells Notice in May, indicating a threat of legal action over the firm’s securities law violations. While the SEC has yet to file the lawsuit, Robinhood’s crypto business has performed well for the year. Johann Kerbrat, vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, said: “2024 marked a significant year for the cryptocurrency landscape and recent developments suggest that 2025 is poised to be an even more transformative year, with broader adoption anticipated across the industry.” The post Robinhood Recorded $119B in Crypto Notional Trading Volume This Year: Report appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/robinhood-recorded-119b-in-crypto-notional-trading-volume-this-year-report/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37665850.jpeg
37665845,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312897,1734249880,"VanEck Predicts $4,000,000,000,000 Explosion in DeFi Volumes for 2025 – Here’s Why","Asset management giant VanEck is predicting a large surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) trading volumes next year. In a new report detailing its predictions for 2025, VanEck analysts say decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes will capture a fifth of centralized exchange (CEX) spot trading volumes. “Despite record-high decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes, both in absolute terms and relative to centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) remains 24% below its peak. We anticipate that DEX trading volumes will surpass $4 trillion in 2025, capturing 20% of CEX spot trading volumes, driven by the proliferation of AI (artificial intelligence)-related tokens and new consumer-facing DApps (decentralized apps). Additionally, the influx of tokenized securities and high-value assets will catalyze DeFi growth, providing fresh liquidity and broader utility. As a result, we project DeFi TVL to rebound to over $200 billion by year-end, reflecting the rising demand for decentralized financial infrastructure in an evolving digital economy.” The analysts also forecast that the broader crypto bull market will persist through 2025, with a correction beginning sometime in the first quarter. Once the correction is finished, VanEck has bullish price targets for some of the top crypto assets by market cap. “We believe the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle’s apex, we project Bitcoin (BTC) to be valued at around $180,000, with Ethereum (ETH) trading above $6,000. Other prominent projects, such as Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), could exceed $500 and $10, respectively. Following this first peak, we anticipate a 30% retracement in BTC, with altcoins facing sharper declines of up to 60% as the market consolidates during the summer. However, a recovery is likely in the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the end of the year.” The full VanEck report can be read here .

The region’s strategic economic and regulatory approach, paired with its special relationship with mainland China, has created a unique environment for both institutional investors and blockchain startups. Ivan Ivanov, global CEO of WOW Summit, attributed Hong Kong’s rise to a blend of progressive regulations and its role as a special economic region. “You get the excitement and potential of crypto, but with the stability and security of a well-established financial system,” Ivanov stated. He explained that Hong Kong’s stablecoin policy , which mandates issuers to secure licenses and hold fiat reserves in local banks, fosters transparency and trust in the sector. With deep connections to the global financial market, including a gateway to mainland China, Hong Kong offers a compelling proposition: cutting-edge technological innovation backed by regulatory oversight that minimizes risk and builds investor confidence. A Trailblazer in Crypto Regulation and Innovation In October 2024, Hong Kong’s Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) unveiled guidelines for integrating AI into financial systems, a move aimed at mitigating risks while enabling innovation. Around the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched Project Ensemble in collaboration with central banks from Brazil and Thailand, focusing on cross-border tokenized settlements. Further cementing its status, Hong Kong’s Cyberport Web3 network now hosts over 270 blockchain firms, with 120 joining in just the past 17 months. This state-sponsored digital asset hub underscores the government’s commitment to fostering Web3 and blockchain innovation. Adding to the momentum, Hong Kong’s largest digital bank ZA Bank introduced retail crypto trading for its clients in November 2024. To encourage institutional participation, the government proposed exempting institutional crypto investors from capital gains taxes, signaling its intent to become a haven for blockchain-related investments. The Road Ahead for Hong Kong Hong Kong’s robust regulatory framework and strategic initiatives have attracted global attention, creating a thriving ecosystem where financial stability meets technological advancement. With policies designed to balance innovation and investor protection, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a benchmark for crypto-friendly governance. As the region continues to pioneer initiatives in blockchain and digital finance, it is poised to remain at the forefront of the global cryptocurrency industry, shaping the future of financial innovation.

With a market offering countless options, the challenge isn’t finding coins but identifying the ones that can deliver real returns. Among the contenders, SUI and Bitcoin have their unique strengths, but one project is quietly taking the spotlight: Qubetics ($TICS). With its innovative marketplace and an exhilarating presale structure, Qubetics has emerged as the best altcoin to join in December 2024. This article dives into the developments and updates of these three cryptocurrencies—Qubetics, SUI, and Bitcoin—and why they deserve your attention this month. Qubetics: Unlocking the Potential of Tokenisation Imagine a platform where owning a fraction of a luxurious real estate property, a rare commodity, or even intellectual property rights is as simple as owning cryptocurrency. That’s the promise of Qubetics’ tokenised assets marketplace . By turning tangible and intangible assets into digital tokens, Qubetics breaks down barriers to ownership, enabling investors worldwide to access high-value opportunities that were once exclusive to a select few. Qubetics is creating a robust ecosystem where transparency and liquidity meet innovation. Its marketplace addresses challenges plaguing traditional asset markets, such as limited liquidity and transparency. Investors can trade, buy, and sell with unprecedented efficiency through a seamless secondary market for tokenised assets. This ensures faster appreciation of asset values while empowering users with greater control over their investments. What’s more, Qubetics recently held an AMA session to answer burning questions from its growing community. This interactive initiative demonstrates Qubetics’ commitment to fostering trust and openness, making it clear why It is being hailed as the best altcoin to join in December 2024 . SUI: A Rising Star in Blockchain SUI has emerged as a promising blockchain platform known for its scalability and innovative consensus mechanism. Designed to offer low latency and high throughput, SUI caters to decentralised applications (dApps) seeking efficiency. Thanks to its user-friendly tools and infrastructure, it’s particularly appealing to developers. While SUI is still gaining traction, its growing adoption in the blockchain ecosystem suggests it’s a project to watch. Bitcoin: The Crypto Pioneer Still Reigns Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, remains a cornerstone of the digital asset market. With its decentralised, peer-to-peer technology, Bitcoin is seen as both a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Despite market fluctuations, its widespread acceptance and institutional interest ensure Bitcoin’s place as a powerhouse in the crypto space. Whether as a long-term investment or a safe haven, Bitcoin remains a go-to option for seasoned and new investors. Presale Spotlight: Qubetics ($TICS) The Qubetics presale has captured significant attention thanks to its unique pricing strategy and impressive results. Currently, in Phase 12, the presale follows a structured model, with each weekly phase bringing a 10% price increase. By the final stage, prices are set to rise by 20%, creating a compelling incentive for early participation. Currently, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.031, and the project has already raised over $6 million—a clear indicator of investor confidence. For those looking to diversify their portfolios, this is the golden moment to join a project that’s redefining blockchain investments.

37667119,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52211,1734249085,Hoskinson Condemns Misrepresentation of Cardano as Centralized Blockchain,"Cardano creator Chares Hoskinson recently took to X to address statements made during a government hearing that misrepresented Cardano’s structure. The hearing, about Wyoming’s stablecoin project, incorrectly claimed that Cardano is based in Wyoming and operated by Input Output Global (IOG), the company founded by Hoskinson. In his response, Hoskinson clarified that Cardano is a decentralized blockchain network, not controlled by any single entity. The Cardano ecosystem is moving toward a more robust governance system to empower its community. Hoskinson also noted that the person in the video excluded XRP, ICP, Hashgraph, Bitcoin, and more from the Wyoming stablecoin project , but included Ethereum, noting that he previously worked at Consensys and implying that ETH was receiving some favorable treatment. This is the guy who made the decision to exclude Cardano, XRP, ICP, Bitcoin, Hashgraph, etc But he did include Ethereum. He knows a lot about it, given his former employer was Consensys… https://t.co/wfC2thhTB6 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 14, 2024 Hoskinson and ETH Gate While many in the blockchain community supported Hoskinson’s clarification, some noted a perceived inconsistency in his stance. Critics pointed to his previous comments regarding the XRP community’s allegations of bias against XRP, known as the “ETH Gate” conspiracy. ETH Gate is a controversy alleging Ethereum received special regulatory treatment during its 2014 ICO and later, with claims of favoritism by regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The biggest sticking point for the XRP community is the SEC’s attempt to go after Ripple and XRP while ignoring Ethereum. Many in the XRP community believe that Ethereum’s creators bribed the SEC for these class actions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hoskinson has dismissed claims that Ethereum received preferential treatment from regulatory authorities, stating that there is no proof that Ethereum bribed regulators to go after XRP. However, Hoskinson believes the regulator showed favoritism. He stated that this favoritism has extended to the Wyoming stablecoin project. Hoskinson’s recent remarks align with this belief. He suggests that Ethereum may have benefited from undue favor in the current context. He questioned why Ethereum was included in the regulatory discussion while other major blockchains were excluded but did not allege bribery or similar practices. Meanwhile, Cardano is moving forward with major upgrades of key parts of the ecosystem. The digital asset is in its Voltaire era, and gradually giving all the power to the people through governance voting. Hoskinson has expressed faith in the ecosystem, recently stating that the world will run on Cardano . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its support at $100,000, many other major cryptocurrencies are underperforming, showing a retreat across the altcoin market. ‘Tis the season for rallies, profits, and gains, but this weekend has failed to bring much-needed relief for retail investors. While BTC holds steady above $100,000, major altcoins, including Pepe (PEPE), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP) are facing bearish action resulting in price drops ranging between 5% and 8%. All hope is not lost as BTC maintains its position, trading around $101,700 . The upcoming weeks should result in recovery as President-elect Trump’s inauguration draws closer, along with the official resignation of current SEC chief Gary Gensler. Join us as we delve into four altcoin projects analysts predict will soon gain traction. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) is a notable underperformer of the past few days, losing nearly 5% in the 24-hour charts and almost 10% in the weekly charts. The much-beloved memecoin has lost almost 20% of its value since recently setting a new ATH and now trades for $0.00002299 . Pepe (PEPE) is a fan favourite among crypto investors, gaining a whopping 1,520% in the past year. The project is currently the third largest memecoin with a market cap of $9.64 billion. This popular memecoins quickly gained infamy for being a tribute to the 2000s internet meme sensation Pepe the Frog. Pepe has continued a reward streak driven by its robust community, rapid ascent and highly optimistic future projections. Analysts predict the memecoin will potentially increase by over 2100% by 2030, positioning it as a prime opportunity for those interested in meme coins' speculative aspects. Pepe has also handsomely gained since the Trump victory, gaining over 14% in the past month. PEPE’s popularity and value surged after exchanges Robinhood and Coinbase listed the memecoin for trading, skyrocketing the memecoin to a new ATH of $0.00002748 on December 9, 2024. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Floki Inu (FLOKI) also appears to be having difficulty over the past few days, resulting in a 6.8% decline in the 24-hour charts at the time of writing. Despite releasing a no-fee crypto debit card earlier this week, FLOKI’s price dropped nearly 14% over the past week. Floki Inu (FLOKI) initially came to market as a celebration of the meme culture but quickly rose through the ranks to become a serious investment opportunity. The project owes its success to a very active community and innovative marketing campaigns, allowing it to expand its utility. Floki Inu recently became a fully functional Web 3 service provider housing a range of Web 3 features. With its expansion, the Floki ecosystem now houses a range of Web 3 ventures, including TokenFi for NFT and asset tokenization, a P2E metaverse, a staking dApp, and a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) marketplace. While FLOKI’s recent underperformance is understandable, given the broader market downturn in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty, FLOKI will likely recover in the coming weeks. FLOKI’s zero-fee debit card allows users to spend Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), tether (USDT), BNB Chain’s BNB and FLOKI globally at merchants that accept VISA or Mastercard. There are zero transaction and exchange rate fees, and it is compatible with over eight blockchain networks. The card is currently available in 31 European countries with plans to expand the offering to other countries in future. Popcat (POPCAT) POPCAT is a recent addition to the crypto sector, aiming to revive the market still plagued by challenges such as inactive wallets and volatility. The memecoin addresses common issues like pump-and-dump schemes and rug pulls by promoting transparency and security. Utilizing innovative blockchain technology and leveraging the power of the Solana network, POPCAT seeks to provide fast and secure transactions. The project's goals are robust, and its potential to deliver significant returns makes it a coin of interest for those looking to explore new ventures in the digital asset space. POPCAT’s (POPCAT) market cap has grown to $1.05 billion, but its price has pulled back heavily following a good rally after Donald Trump’s election victory. POPCAT’s performance over the past week and month has been very bearish, resulting in a 35% drop in the 30-day chart. Despite its recent underperformance, the memecoin has been successful as the first-ever cat-themed token. POPCAT’s staggering 6,522% gain over the past year demonstrates that meme culture, backed by strong community support, can propel projects to the top of the market. Husky Inu (HINU) As BTC continues to trade around $100,000, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Powering up for an epic crypto rally! #HuskyInu pic.twitter.com/biysMWXfmx — Husky Inu (@huskyinureal) December 12, 2024 Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this robust blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Husky Inu (HINU) has exceeded its presale goals, smashing its $618,000 fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu’s presale success sets the tone for immense gains and is expected to skyrocket following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

37665551,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98886,1734248791,"Dogecoin Indicators Are Bullish Amid Whale Accumulations, DOGE Price To Explode?","Dogecoin (DOGE) bulls are recording massive purchases amid sideways trading, signaling an uptrend in the coming months. The asset’s on-chain factors are flipping green alongside top crypto on the back of institutional demand and Elon Musk’s influence. This scenario is similar to the 2021 bull run, which saw the asset soar to an all-time high. Data from crypto analytics from Messari shows that wallets with 1 million DOGE have amassed over 130 billion tokens. This all-time high acquisition indicates increased whale participation in the ecosystem as market confidence ticked upward. A similar situation occurred in the 2021 bull run, as whale addresses began accumulating assets, reaching as high as 110 billion tokens. Like in 2021, Elon Musk’s presence is also at the center of this rally. The billionaire’s famous appearance on Saturday Night Live was a huge development for Dogecoin at the time, with bulls projecting more adoption for the asset. After Donald Trump’s victory, the DOGE price surged alongside the wider market and Elon Musk’s participation. Musk’s nomination as joint head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led to more inflow to Dogecoin. The assets have been up 220% since the November polls, which has attracted bullish interest. A key factor for the DOGE price rise is the possible turn to the altcoin season and meme coin swings. Recent flows into the asset could ignite a similar run in previous bull cycles. On-chain Similarities Attracts Whales Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has soared above 70 into the overbought zone, often indicating a retracement. However, in 2021, a similar metric led to continuous bull pressure. While the RSI led to an upward swing three years ago, many remain skeptical about present market conditions. Furthermore, recent price consolidations after previous highs point to the last bull phase. Growth after the US election has stalled for most meme coins, and prices have begun a consolidation phase. A series of outflows mark this as volatility continues. However, the meme coin consolidation is usually followed by a breakout, leading to a frenzy as holders look to pick up huge gains. At press time, Dogecoin trades at $0.40, a 0.2% drop in the last 24 hours, taking weekly exits to 7.2%. Meanwhile, the total meme coin market cap is down 3%, with the market cap at $132.4 billion.",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-indicators-are-bullish-amid-whale-accumulations-doge-price-to-explode/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

The altcoins have performed a lot worse on a 24-hour scale, resulting in a growing BTC dominance. BTC Dominance Increases Monday and Tuesday saw a few violent price rejections for the primary cryptocurrency, which was driven to $94,400 on a couple of occasions during those days. However, the bulls managed to prevail and propelled a few leg-ups that helped BTC recover all losses and were quick to challenge the six-digit entry territory by Thursday. In fact, bitcoin indeed broke through that level and spiked to $102,000 on Friday and Saturday. It was stopped there at first but the bulls drove it even further hours ago to just under $103,000. Nevertheless, it couldn’t penetrate that line and now sits beneath $102,000. Nevertheless, its market capitalization continues to see new local peaks and sits well above $2 trillion. BTC’s dominance over the altcoins is also on the rise. The metric has jumped to over 53% on CG after dropping to 52.5% yesterday. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 15.12.2024.

37665450,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52209,1734247946,XRP Price at a Crucial Crossroads as Bull Flag Structure Nears Its End: Details,"XRP, one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the market, is currently at a critical juncture as its price action nears the culmination of a Bull Flag structure on the daily chart. Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) recently shared an in-depth technical analysis, highlighting the significant resistance and support levels that will determine the next phase of XRP’s price movement. Hi all. We gave XRP 24 hours on 11-Dec, almost 40 hours since then. Well, $XRP will decide where to go max. by tomorrow. There is no room left on the current Bull Flag. Resistances: $2.42, $2.52, $2.72, $5.85 Supports: $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, $2.02 #XRPArmy #Ripple pic.twitter.com/lHVFKxQIMn — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 13, 2024 According to the analysis, the Bull Flag, a continuation pattern indicating potential upward momentum, has reached its narrowing apex. With minimal room left for price consolidation within this pattern, a breakout or breakdown appears imminent. Dark Defender noted that XRP must make its decisive move as the formation cannot persist much longer without resolution. Key Resistance and Support Levels Dark Defender identified critical resistance levels that XRP must overcome to continue its upward trajectory. These include $2.42, $2.52, $2.72, and the major long-term resistance at $5.85. These levels will likely act as barriers if bullish momentum accelerates, requiring significant buying pressure to break through. On the downside, XRP has several support levels that could prevent a bearish breakdown. These levels include $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02. If the price falls below these levels, the current bullish outlook could shift to bearish sentiment, with traders potentially reevaluating their positions. Despite some bearish predictions , XRP has stayed above these support levels, currently trading at $2.37. The analyst noted that the asset’s closing price on December 14 could determine its direction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Technical Indicators and XRP’s Future The chart indicates that XRP has been consolidating within the Bull Flag since its sharp rally in November. While the Ichimoku Cloud beneath the price adds a layer of support, the narrowing consolidation signifies increasing pressure on the price to break out in one direction. The daily trading volume and overall market sentiment will likely play a pivotal role in determining whether XRP breaks upward or downward. Historically, Bull Flags tend to resolve in the direction of the preceding trend, suggesting a higher probability of an upward breakout. However, external factors could influence the outcome. XRP’s recent rally has been driven by increasing market confidence and the optimism surrounding its future under Donald Trump’s administration. If it can break above $2.72 and reclaim its recent peak of $2.86, it could trigger the price surge that Dark Defender and other analysts have predicted multiple times, and send the asset toward higher targets.

According to OneKey, this approach significantly minimizes risks by isolating crypto transactions from everyday device usage. Everyday devices like smartphones and personal laptops are vulnerable to cyberattacks because they are used for a multitude of activities that expose them to malware, such as downloading files, clicking on links, and opening PDFs. Hackers are exploiting these vulnerabilities, as seen in the $50 million Radiant Capital attack, where attackers used fake PDF malware to steal money. “A dedicated device is like putting your crypto in a safe instead of a drawer,” OneKey said. By using a device solely for cryptocurrency purposes, users can create a clean, focused, and secure environment away from the distractions and risks of general-purpose devices. According to OneKey's statement, the benefits of special devices can be listed as follows: Reduced Risk: Dedicated devices eliminate the installation of irrelevant software, significantly reducing the possibility of backdoor malware attacks. No Distraction: Streamline operations by only installing crypto tools, wallets, and exchange platforms. Enhanced Monitoring: Unusual activity is easier to detect on a device with minimal apps. Related News: Prominent Market Analyst Dennis Gartman Says ""I Will Not Buy Bitcoin"", Explains Why OneKey outlined a simple approach to creating a secure environment for cryptocurrency management: Start Fresh: Use a new or unused laptop or tablet. Perform a clean install of an operating system like macOS or Linux. No Extras: Restrict the device to crypto-related software only; no email, games, or random apps. Use a Hardware Wallet: Pair the device with a hardware wallet like Ledger or OneKey to keep private keys offline. Private Browser: Use a secure browser, especially for accessing decentralized applications (dApps) or exchanges. Add security extensions to block phishing sites. Private Network: Always connect to secure, private Wi-Fi. Avoid public networks and use open source VPN tools like Clash or SSR. *This is not investment advice.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

Cardano (ADA) has surpassed expectations over the past few weeks, and to see if the asset would give everyone a Christmas surprise in the form of a continued surge, we asked ChatGPT what its price would be by December 25. Current Market Performance At press time, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.05, marking a 4.06% decline over the past 24 hours. However, this is a minor downturn in a broader upward trend, as ADA has experienced an impressive 88% gain over the past month. This growth reflects increasing investor confidence and renewed market interest in the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano (ADA) Price By Christmas Day ChatGPT predicts that ADA could reach $3 on Christmas Day, a remarkable 185.7% increase from its current price. This would put the digital asset just below its all-time high of $3.1 and is a significant step toward a new all-time high for the digital asset. While ambitious, this prediction raises important questions about the factors driving ADA’s market performance. ChatGPT provided a detailed analysis of the factors that could help ADA reach this ambitious target. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ecosystem Development and Upgrades: Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem through regular updates and enhancements like the recently released Daedalus v.7.0.0 . ChatGPT highlighted the importance of this continued advancement, stating, “Cardano’s focus on scalability, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies positions it well for future growth, particularly as adoption increases.” Growing Institutional Interest: Institutional interest in blockchain solutions has been growing, and Cardano’s reputation as an energy-efficient and scientifically driven platform has made it attractive to larger investors. Earlier in the year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse listed Cardano among assets for which ETF approval is inevitable , and this puts the asset in a unique class that is highly attractive to institutional investors. Market Sentiment and Adoption: Positive market sentiment around ADA, driven by its expanding decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem and major advancements, could further fuel its rise. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Trends: Finally, broader market trends, such as Bitcoin’s price movements and increased adoption of altcoins, could also play a role. Bitcoin is currently experiencing a historic run, and the cryptocurrency market has historically seen seasonal surges in December, and credence to the belief that ADA will perform well this month.

In a world where utility-focused tokens have traditionally dominated, meme coins are staking their claim with viral potential, community-driven hype, and massive ROI potential. With the crypto market surging on renewed enthusiasm and fresh innovations, meme coins are proving to be much more than internet jokes—they’re serious contenders for big gains. From retail investors to crypto whales, everyone’s chasing the next big thing in meme coins. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Floki Inu (FLOKI)—three meme coins redefining the space with unique narratives, strong communities, and exciting developments. Let’s dive into why these coins are shaking up the scene and why they’ve earned their spot as the best new meme coins to invest in right now. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin That Means Business BTFD Coin is the new heavyweight champion in the meme coin arena, blending humour with real-world utility. Launched with a nod to the popular crypto slang “Buy The F***ing Dip,” this token isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s commanding it. With over $3.7 million raised in its presale so far, the buzz around BTFD is electric. Over 5,000 Bulls have joined the movement, grabbing up more than 53 billion coins and counting. Here’s the kicker: BTFD isn’t just about the memes. This project packs a punch with its upcoming Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, where players can earn BTFD tokens while diving into immersive gameplay. And if that doesn’t spark your FOMO, the staking feature will. Investors can lock their tokens to earn up to 90% APY—an unheard-of opportunity in today’s market. Plus, the Bulls Squad, an exclusive NFT-powered club, adds an extra layer of community-driven benefits. Let’s talk numbers. If you invest $5,000 at Stage 12, where the current price is $0.00013, you’d snag a whopping 38,461,538 BTFD tokens. Now, if BTFD hits its projected presale-end price of $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $23,076—an ROI of over 360%. That’s not just an opportunity; it’s a call to action. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin combines meme appeal with real utility, delivering unmatched growth potential, community perks, and a sense of belonging for its investors. Don’t miss out—this could be the next meme coin moonshot. 2. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): A Token with Charm and Cheek Peanut the Squirrel has stormed onto the scene, armed with one of the quirkiest mascots the crypto world has seen. Inspired by the everyday hustle of squirrels preparing for winter, PNUT’s branding taps into a sense of light-hearted fun and relatability. But make no mistake—there’s more to this coin than just cute cartoons. What sets PNUT apart is its focus on gamification and community-building. Holders gain access to a squirrel-themed universe filled with NFT collectibles, where they can participate in games and earn rewards. PNUT has also teased an ecosystem expansion that includes a charity initiative focused on environmental conservation—because who doesn’t want to save trees while stacking crypto? Investors are flocking to PNUT not just for its unique theme but also for its explosive growth potential. It’s already making waves on social media, with Gen Z and Millennials latching onto its cheeky charm and feel-good vibes. Plus, its relatively low entry cost makes it an easy addition to any meme coin portfolio. Why did this coin make it to this list? Peanut the Squirrel combines whimsy with purpose, offering a fun yet meaningful investment opportunity that appeals to both the heart and wallet. It’s quirky, it’s fresh, and it’s primed to ride the meme coin momentum. 3. Floki Inu (FLOKI): The Meme Coin with Real-World Utility Floki Inu isn’t just another dog-themed token—it’s a movement. Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, FLOKI has carved out a unique niche, blending meme culture with serious utility. And the results are stunning: FLOKI has already gained traction in NFTs, decentralised finance (DeFi), and real-world applications, proving that meme coins can be more than just a passing trend. What’s really exciting about FLOKI is its multi-pronged approach. From the Valhalla P2E metaverse to the FlokiFi DeFi suite, this token has diversified its offerings to ensure long-term relevance. FLOKI’s emphasis on education through the Floki University initiative is another feather in its cap, demonstrating a commitment to empowering its community with knowledge. Why did this coin make it to this list? Floki Inu has proven itself as more than just a meme coin, with its blend of innovative features and community-driven initiatives.

And leading the charge? BTFD Coin —breaking records with over $3.8 million raised and more than 54 billion coins sold! This project has captured the attention of seasoned investors and meme enthusiasts alike, and it’s only getting started. But hey, meme coins are never a one-size-fits-all deal. There’s a quirky mix of players in this space, and today we’re also diving into Cat in a Dog’s World—a sassy feline staking its claim in a pooch-dominated universe—and Gigachad, the coin for those who live and breathe alpha energy. Ready to find out what makes these coins stand out? Let’s dive in. BTFD Coin: Bulls, Dips, and Stellar ROIs If you’ve ever dreamed of catching the next big meme coin before it skyrockets, now’s your moment. BTFD Coin (short for Buy the Dip) has been on fire since its presale launch, and it’s easy to see why. With an ethos that blends financial opportunity with internet culture, BTFD Coin isn’t just another token—it’s what dreams are made of. This coin has crushed milestones: raising over $3.8 million, selling more than 54 billion tokens, and amassing a herd of 5,100+ Bulls in its ecosystem. Its presale price of $0.0001 is already causing a buzz, and the roadmap promises staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , and a powerful community-driven ecosystem. But it’s not just the features that make BTFD Coin pop. Its secret sauce is the Bulls Squad—a lineup of quirky characters like Baby Bull and Raging Bull, who give this project a unique identity. This kind of branding doesn’t just build hype; it creates loyal followers who’ll carry this coin into the stratosphere. Cat in a Dog’s World: A Feline Fighting the Pack Who let the cats out? This meme coin struts into the scene with the audacity of a tabby walking into a kennel, declaring, “This is my turf now.” Cat in a Dog’s World leverages the internet’s undying love for cats (move over, Doge!) to position itself as the ultimate underdog—or undercat, if you will. What sets this coin apart is its cheeky branding and a community that rallies around being unapologetically different. While it doesn’t have the history of Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, it’s carving out its niche with ambitious plans to create a DeFi ecosystem that rewards its holders with exclusive perks, like NFT drops and token airdrops. Cat in a Dog’s World thrives on the idea of being the rebel in a dog-eat-dog market, attracting investors who love a good comeback story. If you’re a fan of rooting for the unlikely hero, this cat-themed coin might just win you over. Gigachad: Meme Coin or Lifestyle Choice? If meme coins were gym bros, Gigachad would be the one bench-pressing twice its body weight while winking at the camera. Built for those who embrace hustle culture, alpha vibes, and the mantra of being unapologetically awesome, Gigachad has created a tribe of like-minded investors who live for high stakes. The coin’s branding taps into the internet’s obsession with “Chad” memes, celebrating confidence, dominance, and success. But Gigachad isn’t just about swagger. It’s backed by a roadmap promising innovative staking mechanisms, DAO governance for its holders, and plans for a metaverse crossover that will allow Chads everywhere to flex their digital muscles. While it may seem gimmicky to some, this coin has proven its ability to generate hype, and its fiercely loyal community ensures it’s not just a flash in the pan. If you’re drawn to big energy and even bigger ambitions, Gigachad might be your meme coin soulmate. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Dip—Grab the Bull So, what’s the move? If you’re scouting the best new meme coin presales to join for long-term ROIs, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. While Cat in a Dog’s World and Gigachad have unique appeals, neither matches the sheer potential that BTFD Coin offers.

37668257,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662606,1734246056,"XRP Set For Surge To $2.90, Analyst Explains How","Popular market analyst Egrag Crypto has tipped XRP to soon hit the $2.90 price mark. This prediction comes amidst little movement in the XRP market following a consolidation between $2.25-$2.50 over the past few days. The altcoin emerged as one of the biggest market gainers post-US elections rising by over 340% since November 5. However, XRP alongside crypto market leader Bitcoin has only seen little gains so far in December. Related Reading: XRP Price In Motion: Analyst Reveals The Next Major Supports And Resistances XRP’s Path To $2.90 In an X post on December 14, Egrag Crypto shares a potential price trajectory for XRP to reach $2.90. Firstly, the analyst notes the asset has been moving between $2.27-$2.50 confirming a market move to gather momentum for a major price breakout in an upward direction. This notion follows a previous prediction whereby a price fall below $2.27 could have set XRP for a decline to around $2.17. However, in order to initiate any uptrend, Egrag stresses it is important that XRP closes above $2.50 on its hourly chart, which should result in a significant price gain. Thereafter, the altcoin is expected to retest $2.60. This suggests the need for market bulls to mount high-buying activity at this price level which is to function as a strong support zone that propels future price gain. Following a successful retest at $2.60, Egrag predicts XRP will resume its bullish trajectory, reaching a local peak of $2.90, leaving the asset just 24.4% away from its all-time high. Related Reading: New Era For Crypto Regulation? SEC Chair Gensler Suggests He May Step Down XRP Potential 2017 Repeat Predicts New ATH In January Following XRP’s price surge in November, analysts have re-echoed the possibility of the altcoin mirroring its first-ever major bull run from 2017. X analyst Crypto Bull has most recently dropped a take on this discourse stating XRP could hit a new all-time high on exactly January 2 if the 2017 cycle repeat proves true. Furthermore, the crypto analyst also predicts altcoin to be trading at $10 on January 15 representing a potential 4.16x on XRP’s current market price. Interestingly, certain XRP enthusiasts such as X user XRPE_Nomad expect the altcoin to produce a better performance than from 2017 based on its increased utility and better regulatory clarity. Generally, optimism around the third-largest cryptocurrency has been high following Donald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential elections which guaranteed the replacement of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and a potentially swift end to the legal saga between the Commission and Ripple. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.40 reflecting a 1.18% loss in the past day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume valued at $7.48 billion has declined by 16.67%.

It enables smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. The network supports decentralized finance and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which enhance transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens for governance, utility, and value storage, but Ether (ETH) is still needed for gas fees. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, improving scalability and efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase aims to further boost these aspects. Ether remains central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. With its continuous developments and key position in the blockchain space, Ethereum holds significant potential in the current market cycle. Conclusion ETH and similar coins show less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, expects 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

With this remarkable performance, the asset is forming bullish patterns on its chart, and JD (@jaydee_757), a prominent crypto analyst, has spotted an important one. In a post on X, the analyst drew attention to a breakout from a descending flag pattern on the 4-hour chart. The chart shows that XRP is forming a classic bullish flag after a sharp rally from $1.40 to its recent peak of $2.86. #XRP (4hr) – If full candle closes above, this gives us a higher probability of a breakout! If not, expect bottom trendline to hit! Macro view, this chart is irrelevant! ATH is coming! Dumb Money who got REKT for 7 years will DENY! Retweet for updates! TA ALL DAY! $XRP … pic.twitter.com/zovN6Ulv2W — JD (@jaydee_757) December 13, 2024 The flag’s breakout point was identified around the $2.40 range, and at the time of JD’s analysis, XRP traded at $2.4298, in the early stages of the breakout. JD emphasized the significance of a full-bodied candle closing above the upper trendline of the flag. In his post, he noted, “The more full body close above the trendline, the higher the breakout probability.” Such a confirmation could indicate the resumption of XRP’s upward momentum. In a follow-up post , JD confirmed that XRP closed above the trendline, suggesting a bullish breakout could be underway. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Bullish Flag Pattern and Potential Targets The bullish flag pattern depicted in the chart is a well-known continuation signal. It typically occurs when a steep upward price movement, referred to as the flagpole, is followed by a consolidation phase that trends slightly downward. When the price decisively breaks above the flag’s resistance, it often signals the start of a new rally with a target price derived by projecting the length of the flagpole from the breakout point. JD did not provide a specific target in his analysis. However, based on JD’s chart, the implied target for this breakout is well above $3.8. JD noted that a new all-time high is coming, a sentiment shared by other experts . At press time, XRP had dropped slightly, now trading at $2.93, but many experts still believe it can easily close the 37.8% gap required to reclaim its all-time high of $3.84. JD also called out dumb money investors who doubt his analysis. The analyst has previously called out these dumb money investors who missed out on the 2017 rally. Expects expects them to miss out on the current one. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homo-shiba-inu-homoshib-solana-memecoin-will-skyrocket-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37663711,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52200,1734243825,Analyst Foresees Shiba Inu (SHIB) to Rally 150%. Here’s the Bullish Chart,"Despite a 10% dip in Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price recently, optimism remains strong among analysts who foresee a substantial rally for the token. Predictions suggest that SHIB could rise significantly, approaching its previous all-time high. Market analyst PouyanTradeFX has identified a crucial price level for SHIB that could determine its next significant move. According to a recent analysis shared on TradingView, the token is currently testing a longstanding trendline that has influenced its price movements since 2021. The weekly chart shows that the asset has been in a persistent downtrend since reaching its all-time high of $0.00008616 in October 2021. The token briefly challenged this trendline in March 2024 when it reached $0.00004567. Currently trading at $0.00002822, the digital asset could see a remarkable 163% surge to approximately $0.000074 if it breaks through this resistance level. However, failure to breach the trendline could result in a significant 62% drop to around $0.000011, the analyst warned. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 PouyanTradeFX’s analysis is part of a broader wave of bullish predictions for the token, even as the cryptocurrency market faces broader challenges. Potential to Erase Another Zero Another analyst, Crypto ELITES, has presented an even more ambitious outlook for SHIB. On December 11, they highlighted the possibility of the token climbing nearly 1,700% to reach $0.00047905, supported by a cup-and-handle pattern observed on its weekly chart. This optimistic forecast hinges on the continued decline of Bitcoin Dominance, which reflects the share of the total market capitalization held by Bitcoin. Bitcoin Dominance has dropped from 61.5% in November to 56.5% currently, indicating a potential shift of capital from Bitcoin to altcoins and meme coins. Recent Performance and Market Sentiment Shiba Inu has experienced a notable price increase of 200% over the past year, demonstrating strong performance compared to many other cryptocurrencies. Despite the current decline, analysts remain confident that the asset is well-positioned for future growth. As market conditions evolve, the asset’s ability to overcome key resistance levels will likely determine whether these optimistic projections materialize. While substantial gains are possible, investors should also be cautious of the risks highlighted by analysts.

PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched on Ethereum, it follows coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE has no transaction tax and keeps its meme identity without utility. It reached a market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, sparking interest in the crypto world. The roadmap aims to increase visibility through social media trends and exchange listings. It uses a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum’s security. PEPE is available on Uniswap and major exchanges like Binance. Its deflationary model and strong community may make it attractive in the current market. Dogwifhat (WIF): A New Meme Coin on Solana Inspired by Viral Dog Meme Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. It has gained popularity for its dog-themed concept and community-driven approach. Meme coins like WIF often build strong online communities and spread through viral trends. By operating on Solana, WIF benefits from fast transactions and low fees. The coin focuses on creating a fun and engaging experience for users. In the current market cycle, WIF may attract attention due to its unique theme and the growing interest in meme coins. Its potential lies in community growth and leveraging social media trends. Investors interested in meme coins might find WIF appealing. BONK: Solana’s Shiba Inu Memecoin Empowering the Community BONK is a Solana-based memecoin with a Shiba Inu mascot that aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. It surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing and serves as a “community coin,” airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of memecoins, BONK’s integration into the growing Solana ecosystem, including the launch of the decentralized exchange BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player. The coin looks attractive in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin Turning into a Crypto Contender Dogecoin (DOGE), launched in 2013, is a cryptocurrency inspired by the Shiba Inu meme. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit and adds 10,000 new coins every minute. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted alternative, it gained massive popularity in 2021. Social media influence, particularly from Elon Musk, propelled it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value exceeding $50 billion. Dogecoin highlights the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Its technology allows for fast transactions, and its active community continues to drive its relevance. The coin’s potential lies in its widespread acceptance and the enthusiasm of its supporters. Conclusion While coins like PEPE, WIF, BONK, and DOGE show less short-term promise, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those who aspire to luxury and success, DOGEN is poised for 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. It builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

37661920,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52168,1734240637,"Altcoins Are Soaring as Cardano, Sui and Rollblock See Double Digit Returns","Cardano’s large transactions have seen a notable increase as the token enters the second wave of its bullish rally. Sui’s DEX volume has also surged after an announcement from the Blackpack Exchange. Meanwhile, Rollblock is leading Q4’s altseason as analysts predict up to 880% ROI for early RBLK investors. Cardano (ADA) Whales Hold Long Positions During Impressive Rally Cardano’s price was in a brief corrective phase over the last seven days after recording massive 96.48% intra-month gains. Since Cardano’s concentration indicator has climbed by 0.26% already, analysts believe Cardano whales are holding long positions on the token before an anticipated surge. Cardano’s large transactions have also increased by 0.52% which suggests high network activity. Cardano is currently trading for $1.14 after an intraday increase worth 5.06%. Cardano’s volume has decreased by 22.72% which typically suggests decreased selling activity. Since Cardano’s Momentum and Bull Bear Power indicators are already suggesting bullish dominance, Cardano’s price could surge towards the $2.5 target before the end of Q4. Sui (SUI) Trading Volume Surges by More than 100% in a Single Day Sui’s price has rallied by a modest 55.21% over the last 30 days as the broader crypto market entered Q4’s bull run. Despite this slow growth, Sui has reached a new all-time high price of $4.9 on 12 December. This massive Sui rally is fueled by an announcement from Blackpack Exchange regarding a wallet integration with Sui which triggered a massive rise in Sui’s DEX volumes. Sui is currently trading for $4.71 after an intraday increase worth 21.85%. Sui’s volume has also rallied by a massive 113.87% as traders rush to purchase Sui tokens before the price skyrockets any further. Since Sui’s RSI suggests that there is still room for more growth, analysts expect Sui to reach $7.04 by early 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Early Investors Enjoy Massive 310% ROI Rollblock is skyrocketing through its presale stages with its viral GambleFi protocol. Not only has Rollblock raised more than $7 million in record time, but its early investors are already enjoying up to 310% ROI. If Rollblock can continue this pace until the end of Q4, analysts are expecting a total of 880% gains for the native RBLK token ahead of its official launch on DEXs and CEXs. The reason why traders are rapidly accumulating RBLK tokens is the project’s utility. Aside from powering the GambleFi ecosystem, Rollblock’s investors can also earn a weekly passive income through the platform’s attractive revenue sharing model. At the end of every week, Rollblock uses up to 30% of its gaming revenue to purchase RBLK tokens on the open market. These tokens are distributed in two categories: 40% are distributed as staking rewards while the remaining 60% are removed from the circulating supply forever. Since the scarce supply creates deflationary pressure on Rollblock, analysts expect the token’s price to keep increasing in value over time. Aside from reaping these massive rewards, Rollblock investors also get exclusive access to the platform’s massive gaming library that features 7,000+ AI-powered games. In addition, Rollblock has also announced a new upgrade to its ecosystem which features a betting option. As of last week, Rollblock users can place bets on top sports leagues such as the NBA, NFL, UFC, F1, MMA, LaLiga and more. Even with these exciting features, Rollblock is still selling tokens for a low price of just $0.0415 in stage 9 of its presale. Since analysts are already expecting another price jump before the end of this week, now is the best time to invest in Rollblock at the lowest price it will ever be.

Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, recently accused the SEC of a harassment campaign against Musk and his companies, including Neuralink. The SEC has given Musk a 48-hour ultimatum to settle and has issued subpoenas. In response to the SEC’s actions, Musk has gained support from industry leaders. Vivek Ramaswamy, recently appointed to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), criticized the SEC for wasting government resources and frequently losing court cases due to their illegal and unconstitutional rule interpretations. He argued that the SEC’s actions are undermining public trust in the law. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, also weighed in, claiming that Ripple had exposed the SEC’s lawless tactics early on. Reflecting on their own court case, he pointed out that the SEC has been using litigation to push its own agenda, rather than faithfully following the law. He added that the real issue is how to hold the SEC accountable under its current leadership. He wrote, “The question isn’t whether the SEC under Gensler is rogue—it is. The question is how we hold them accountable?” Ripple’s top leaders, along with the crypto industry, celebrated SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s upcoming departure. Gensler confirmed he will leave on January 20. Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty believes that once the regulatory issues are cleared, Ripple will become the top provider of crypto solutions for businesses in the U.S. For the unversed, the SEC has been investigating Elon Musk for delaying the disclosure of his 9.2% stake in Twitter. He only revealed his stake on April 4, 2022, about ten days after surpassing the 5% disclosure threshold required by law.

37667870,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662602,1734238858,Chainlink Price Hits $30 For The First Time Since 2022 — What Next?,"The Chainlink price has been on quite a run in the past few months, but so has the entire cryptocurrency market. While the general market has somewhat cooled off in recent weeks, the price of LINK has continued to impress at the end of the year. As it looks to reclaim its current all-time high, the Chainlink price has returned to around the $30 mark for the first time in more than two years. According to a prominent analyst on the social media platform X, the altcoin’s rally is only just beginning, with a new price target already in sight. How Chainlink Price Can Move Up To $34 In a recent post on the X platform, popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez shared an interesting prognosis for the price of Chainlink over the next couple of days. The analyst explained that LINK’s current price layout suggests a bullish breakout might be on the horizon for the altcoin. Related Reading: XRP Price In Motion: Analyst Reveals The Next Major Supports And Resistances This bullish prediction is based on the formation of an ascending triangle pattern on the 1-hour timeframe of the LINK price chart. The ascending triangle is a chart pattern used in technical analysis that is characterized by a horizontal line connecting the swing highs and a rising trendline along the swing lows. Typically, ascending triangles are regarded as continuation patterns, as the price often breaks out in the same direction as the initial trend forming the triangle. While a break out of the horizontal line is the most likely scenario, a breach of the trend line is also possible. As observed in the highlighted chart, the Chainlink price has been hovering around the upper horizontal line, just above the $30 level. According to Martinez, if the price of LINK does break this upper line, an hourly candlestick needs to close above the $30.4 mark, for it to be considered a successful breach. The crypto analyst noted that if the Chainlink price does successfully break above the upper horizontal line, it could travel as high as $34 in the next couple of days. This would represent a 15% surge from the altcoin’s current price point. LINK Price Overview As of this writing, the Chainlink token is valued at around $29.25, reflecting an almost 5% price increase in the past 24 hours. The altcoin’s performance on broader timeframes is even more impressive, surging by over 17% in the past week. Related Reading: Bull Flag Formation Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.15 This Cycle According to data from CoinGecko, the LINK price has skyrocketed by more than 120% in the past 30 days.

The ongoing Qubetics presale is catching a lot of attention for good reason. Currently in its 12th stage, the token is priced at $0.031, and over 324 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to more than 9,000 holders. The project has raised an impressive $6 million so far, and with each stage lasting only 7 days, the clock is ticking. When this stage ends on Sunday at midnight, the price will jump 10%, moving to $0.0341. Arweave Shows the Value of Timing and Patience Arweave has carved out its own niche by offering a permanent data storage solution, setting it apart from other blockchain projects. Its early supporters got in at an ICO price of just $0.74. Over the years, the value of its token has grown considerably, showcasing what’s possible with the right timing and patience. Arweave’s focus on long-term data storage means it’s ideal for developers, content creators, and anyone looking for a reliable way to preserve information. Its innovative permaweb concept has attracted a growing community, and its success serves as a reminder of how early investments in unique projects can pay off. While Arweave has achieved a lot, the missed opportunity for many is clear. But with projects like Qubetics entering the scene, there’s another chance to find a blockchain with significant potential.

The altcoin is down by more than seven percent in the last seven days. XRP is still technically within a larger bull market, with no confirmed lower highs or lows on the weekly time frame. Over the last couple of weeks, XRP has experienced a short-term bearish trend within the larger bullish market. Price Prediction Currently, XRP is testing the support levels between $2.33 and $2.40. There is potential for a short-term bounce from this range, but if the price fails to hold above these levels, it may drop to the next support area between $2.00 and $2.23. If XRP manages to hold above $2.40, a break above the $2.62 level could trigger a rally toward $3.00 and possibly test the all-time highs near $3.25. Support and Resistance Levels The main resistance zone is between $2.90 and $3.00, which is the level to watch for potential price rejection. On the downside, the first key support lies between $2.33 and $2.40. If XRP drops below this level, the next support is between $2.00 and $2.23. The upper boundary of the trend channel is also acting as support. A break above this level could lead to a more aggressive breakout, but it will depend on how the price moves in the coming days. Analyst Weighs In According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, if XRP closes below $2.40, especially under $2.29, it could signal a drop toward support levels around $1.90. Strong support is found around $2, where previous resistance is now acting as new support. If XRP maintains this support, it could continue its upward movement.

This surge highlights Bitcoin’s resilience and growing institutional acceptance and casts a spotlight on emerging altcoins poised to disrupt the market. Among these is RCO Finance (RCOF) , an undervalued altcoin that investors are beginning to recognize for its potential to skyrocket by an astonishing 50,000%. As the market evolves, Bitcoin and innovative altcoins like RCOF are poised for a major market bull run that aims to push the crypto market cap to a new ATH. Bitcoin Price Targets 120,000 Amid Market-Wide Crypto Surge Bitcoin price has once again captivated the financial world, breaking the $102,000 barrier as the cryptocurrency sector reached a valuation of $3.5 trillion. This rally comes amid significant developments, including bullish comments from President-elect Donald Trump. Trump’s suggestion of adding Bitcoin to a strategic reserve and unveiling a crypto-friendly agenda spurred market optimism. The crypto market’s performance over the last 24 hours highlights the space’s sheer volatility, with $298.5 million liquidated across long and short contracts. While institutional players continue to embrace Bitcoin, this surge reflects renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency’s role as a hedge against economic instability. The Bitcoin price climb has set the stage for an altcoin boom, with innovative projects like RCO Finance (RCOF) poised to ride the wave of bullish sentiment. As the Bitcoin price builds up toward the $120,000 mark, the race for the next breakout star intensifies, and RCOF’s explosive potential cannot be overlooked. RCO Finance: The Undervalued Altcoin Set for a Meteoric Rise RCO Finance (RCOF) is not your average altcoin. While many altcoins rely on hype, RCOF is carving its niche with robust use cases and an ecosystem for long-term growth. Its decentralized services platform offers unparalleled scalability, lower transaction costs, and groundbreaking liquidity protocols. At the heart of RCO Finance’s appeal is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, a groundbreaking tool designed to tailor investment strategies to individual users. This advanced system analyzes vast amounts of historical and real-time market data, allowing it to provide personalized recommendations based on each investor’s financial goals and risk tolerance. Unlike traditional platforms that leave users to trade alone, the Robo Advisor is a trusted companion, continuously adjusting portfolios in response to market fluctuations. This feature mitigates emotional biases often associated with trading and empowers investors to make informed decisions confidently. Another key feature distinguishing RCO Finance is its Automated Market Making (AMM) mechanism. This fully automated trading platform utilizes cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies to optimize trade execution. RCO Finance also addresses one of the major challenges in the crypto space: the disconnect between DeFi and TradFi. Through its Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, RCOF allows users to use cryptos to invest in tangible assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. This capability broadens investment opportunities and simplifies transactions by eliminating the need for fiat conversions. As a result, RCOF users can diversify their portfolios across various asset classes without facing the typical barriers associated with traditional investing. RCOF prioritizes security by conducting regular smart contract audits by SolidProof and adopting a non-KYC approach, which provides privacy while ensuring compliance with necessary regulations. With a secure no KYC debit card, investors can access their holdings for daily transactions anywhere in the world. RCO Finance Promises 500x ROI for Investors The current Bitcoin price rally, with its target of $120,000, has injected positive momentum into the altcoin and presale sectors, significantly benefiting RCO Finance (RCOF) . Sales of RCOF tokens have surged, crossing the $9 million milestone and boosting investor confidence in the project. The presale is currently in Stage 4, with each RCOF token priced at $0.0778. Users can also apply the code RCOF25 to receive an additional 25% in tokens with their purchase. With the anticipated listing price of $0.60, investors will gain over 700% ROI once the token hits the market. Analysts predict a 50,000% bull run as RCO Finance gains traction and expands its market presence. Investors participating in this presale will acquire tokens at a fraction of their anticipated future value and access exclusive benefits within the RCO Finance ecosystem. Holding RCOF altcoins grants users voting rights on key platform decisions and eligibility for community rewards exceeding $100,000. This creates an engaging environment where investors can actively participate in shaping the future of RCO Finance while reaping potential financial rewards. As the Bitcoin price aims for new heights in its rally, altcoins like RCO Finance are emerging as promising contenders ready to capture investor interest. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this exciting journey. Instead, invest in RCO Finance today and position yourself for potential generational wealth!

This development is expected to enhance Shibarium’s utility and accessibility for the broader crypto community. Integration Confirmed Bitget Wallet recently added Shibarium to its list of supported blockchains. The news came to light through a post shared on X by Shibarium Update, a channel dedicated to Shiba Inu developments. The post included a screenshot as evidence of the integration and confirmed that users can now access the blockchain’s features through the wallet. Notably, Bitget has not released an official statement regarding the integration. Furthermore, while the blockchain is supported on the Bitget Wallet, it has not yet been incorporated into the Bitget exchange. Great news for the #BoneArmy and #SHIBARMY ! Shibarium has now been integrated into the Bitget Wallet (not the exchange yet). #Shibarium #Bone #ShibEcosystem pic.twitter.com/UOdDYILmd7 — Shibarium Updates (@Shibizens) December 11, 2024 Expanded Functionality for Users The integration allows Bitget Wallet users to interact with it in various ways, including storing, transferring, swapping, and staking assets within the ecosystem. This new functionality is expected to encourage greater participation in the blockchain network, potentially boosting transaction volumes and user engagement. Bitget Wallet, launched in May 2018, has established itself as a trusted platform for storing and managing cryptocurrency assets. Its significant user base provides an opportunity to expose Shibarium to millions of new users, further expanding the reach of the Layer-2 blockchain. Recent Milestones The Shibarium network has demonstrated consistent growth since its launch in August 2023. Recently, the blockchain surpassed two major milestones, including reaching over 2 million wallet addresses and exceeding 600 million total transactions. As of now , the transaction count has risen to approximately 645.74 million, with an average daily transaction volume of 4.58 million. These statistics highlight the growing adoption of Shibarium, underscoring its potential as a major player in the blockchain space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adoption Among Wallets and Exchanges Despite its progress, the integration into major crypto platforms remains limited. Only a few leading exchanges, such as Gate.io and BluBit , have incorporated Shibarium into their services. Additionally, wallets like Frontier and GroveX have integrated Shibarium into their platforms, while MetaMask users can access the blockchain via the Chainlist feature. The community continues to advocate for broader adoption of the blockchain, urging major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Ledger to offer support. These efforts are part of a larger push to establish Shibarium as a widely accessible and versatile Layer-2 solution. The integration of Shibarium into Bitget Wallet represents a pivotal step forward for the ecosystem. With Bitget’s extensive global user base, the move has the potential to drive significant growth and activity on the network. As the community continues to push for broader adoption across exchanges and wallets, the network’s trajectory remains promising.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

37657946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662605,1734233432,National Bitcoin Reserve Initiative: MP Satoshi Hamada Urges Japan To Take Action,"In a notable development for the cryptocurrency landscape, Japanese Member of Parliament Satoshi Hamada has urged his government to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, aligning Japan with a growing global trend where nations like the United States are exploring similar initiatives. Bitcoin Adoption Surges Among Nations And Major Corporations Hamada’s proposal reflects a broader interest in diversifying national reserves with cryptocurrencies, particularly following recent discussions in the Japanese parliament about reserve movements in the US and other countries. This surge in interest comes on the heels of Texas’s significant legislative efforts. The Texas House of Representatives has introduced a bill aimed at creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, spearheaded by Republican state Representative Giovanni Capriglione. Related Reading: Australia’s Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First The proposed legislation seeks to enable the state to accept taxes, fees, and donations in Bitcoin, with a commitment to hold these assets for a minimum of five years. Capriglione, who announced the bill during an X Spaces event, emphasized the potential benefits of such a reserve in enhancing Texas’s fiscal stability and reinforcing its leadership in Bitcoin innovation. “Probably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation,” he stated, highlighting that a strategic Bitcoin reserve could provide a win-win scenario for the state. The legislation, titled “An Act Relating to the Establishment of a Bitcoin Reserve within the State Treasury of Texas and the Management of Cryptocurrencies by Governmental Entities,” underscores a significant trend of increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Notably, this movement is not limited to nations; following President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve at the National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville earlier this year, there has been a marked uptick in BTC adoption among various countries and private companies. Bitcoinist previously reported that in just the past month, nine major firms from sectors including finance, healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) have embraced the market’s leading cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset. October 2025 As Next Major BTC Market Top? As these developments unfold, BTC has recently closed the week above the $100,000 mark, fueling speculation about its future trajectory. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that if Bitcoin adheres to historical trends observed in previous market cycles, the next market peak could occur in October 2025. The analyst noted that in the last two cycles, from market bottom to market top, it took approximately 1,065 days, while the duration from one market bottom to the next was around 1,430 days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon – Top Trader Sets $2 Target Martinez also identified a critical support level for Bitcoin at $96,870, where approximately 1.45 million addresses accumulated around 1.42 million BTC.

Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based token, recently skyrocketed by an incredible 12,000%, grabbing the attention of investors everywhere. While such explosive growth is not uncommon in the crypto space, it raises questions about the sustainability and true value of these tokens. Amidst the hype, the Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Presale stands out as a compelling opportunity, merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver a project focused on real utility and long-term growth. This article takes a closer look at Dogwifhat’s recent success and dives into whether Lightchain AI has the potential to match—or even outperform—this level of remarkable growth. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Rise of a Meme-Inspired Token Dogwifhat is a cryptocurrency operating on the Solana blockchain, celebrated for its meme-driven identity and community-centric growth strategy. Unlike traditional blockchain projects with clear utility or technological innovation, Dogwifhat thrives on the viral nature of its brand, leveraging social media and community engagement. Factors Behind Dogwifhat’s 12,000% Growth Community Engagement: Dogwifhat’s growth has been driven largely by its passionate community, which fuels its momentum through viral campaigns and online promotions. Low Entry Barrier: The token’s affordable price before its surge made it an attractive option for speculative investors. Speculation and Hype: Like many meme coins, Dogwifhat’s meteoric rise can be attributed to speculative trading, with investors hoping to capitalize on short-term gains. Challenges Ahead for Dogwifhat Sustainability: Meme-driven tokens often struggle to maintain their value over the long term without tangible utility. Volatility: The token’s reliance on market sentiment makes it prone to sharp declines once the hype subsides. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Built for Long-Term Growth While Dogwifhat’s rise is a testament to the power of community-driven tokens, Lightchain AI presents a stark contrast with its focus on utility, innovation, and real-world applications.

Sustainability: By minimizing wasteful computations, Lightchain AI ensures energy efficiency, aligning with global environmental goals. Lightchain AI’s Real-World Applications Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Enhancing predictive analytics for risk management and investment strategies. Healthcare: Enabling AI-powered diagnostics and personalized medical solutions. Supply Chain Management: Improving transparency and accountability in logistics. Can Lightchain AI Replicate Dogwifhat’s 12,000% Success? Comparing Growth Drivers Hype vs Utility: Dogwifhat’s growth is fueled by social media buzz and speculative trading, whereas Lightchain AI’s value lies in its tangible applications and technological advancements. Community Engagement: Both projects benefit from strong community support, but Lightchain AI’s decentralized governance model ensures active participation in shaping its ecosystem. Scalability: While Dogwifhat relies on Solana’s infrastructure, Lightchain AI’s innovative consensus mechanism and AIVM offer unparalleled scalability and efficiency. Factors Favoring Lightchain AI Sustainable Growth: Lightchain AI’s focus on utility and innovation positions it for consistent growth, avoiding the pitfalls of speculative bubbles. Market Differentiation: By addressing real-world challenges, Lightchain AI appeals to a broader range of investors and industries. Presale Opportunity: The ongoing Lightchain AI presale offers early investors a chance to participate in a project with significant growth potential, starting at just $0.001125 per token. The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities For Dogwifhat (WIF): Sustaining Momentum: Maintaining its community-driven momentum will require innovative strategies to keep investors engaged. Expanding Utility: Developing tangible use cases could help Dogwifhat transition from a meme coin to a more sustainable asset. For Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Scaling Adoption: Building partnerships across industries will be crucial for demonstrating the platform’s utility. Navigating Competition: Competing with established blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana will require continuous innovation. Educating Investors: Communicating the value of its technology and applications will help attract a diverse investor base. Which Is the Better Investment? Why Choose Dogwifhat (WIF)?

As the industry evolves, projects like Lightchain AI are likely to lead the way, offering solutions that address real-world challenges and drive meaningful change.

MicroStrategy joins Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) as new additions to the index, according to a Dec. 13 statement from Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Illumina, Inc. (ILMN), Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI), and Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) will be removed. MSTR Now Among Nasdaq’s Largest Companies MicroStrategy, originally a software company that pivoted into becoming a de facto Bitcoin hedge fund in 2020, is now among Nasdaq’s 100 largest stocks by market capitalization. Its inclusion also means that the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), an ETF managing $322 billion in assets, will add MSTR to its portfolio. Crypto Industry Reacts to the News The announcement sparked excitement across the crypto community. Crypto analyst Will Clemente commented on X, “Now that MSTR is getting added to the Nasdaq, every large pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, and individual retirement account in the world is going to have Bitcoin exposure.” Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, declared, “The trade of the decade is just getting started. Buckle up.” Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, added, “This news is not priced in until public markets open,” predicting active managers benchmarking against Nasdaq would adopt direct exposure to Bitcoin or MSTR to stay competitive. Saylor’s Bitcoin Push Extends to Microsoft This development follows Michael Saylor’s recent attempt to persuade Microsoft’s board to embrace Bitcoin. During Microsoft’s annual meeting on Dec. 10, Saylor proposed that adopting Bitcoin could add nearly $5 trillion to Microsoft’s market cap. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor argued.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/microstrategy-joins-nasdaq-100-index-amid-btc-buzz/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

With their hilarious names, strong communities, and potential to skyrocket, meme coins are every investor’s favourite way to mix fun with financial risks. These coins embody internet culture, memes, and unpredictability—all while offering incredible opportunities to those who know where to look. One meme coin that’s been making waves is BTFD Coin . This bad boy has already proven its power by raising over $3.8 million in presale funding. It hit the $1 million mark in under 10 days and crossed $2.5 million just two weeks into its presale journey—showing the kind of momentum that only comes from strong community backing and hype. With over 54billion $BTFD coins already sold and over 5,100 Bulls in the Bulls Squad community, this is one meme coin that’s already a force to be reckoned with. Alongside it are Brett and ActI: The AI Prophecy—two other meme coins that have their own unique angles and communities aiming to make their own splash. So let’s dive into the lowdown on these three contenders—the best new meme coin presales to join this weekend. BTFD Coin: A Presale That’s Hitting All the Right Notes Let’s talk about BTFD Coin first. With its current stage in the 10th phase, this meme coin is clearly a well-oiled community movement with momentum behind it. It’s currently priced at just $0.0001, and the numbers prove its presale is absolutely crushing it. The presale has already hit $2.8 million, with over 54 billion $BTFD coins sold and a thriving army of over 5,100 enthusiastic Bulls. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a phenomenon. BTFD Coin combines meme magic with real-world utility through its staking rewards, P2E gaming elements, and strong community leadership. Its Bulls Squad represents the community’s heart and soul—four iconic bulls that embody optimism, strategy, and ambition. There’s Baby Bull, Nerdy Bull, Raging Bull, and Peoples Bull—each part of a narrative that’s making this coin even more engaging to investors and users. What really sets BTFD Coin apart is the 90%+ average APY staking rewards and its P2E game, which allows players to earn BTFD tokens through gameplay while building long-term engagement. With these features and its proven presale performance, BTFD Coin offers more than just meme potential—it offers a full-fledged ecosystem investors can trust. If you haven’t checked it out yet, BTFD Coin is the epitome of a strong meme coin with real potential. It’s not just hype—these numbers back it up, and the excitement is only growing. With its presale continuing to perform well, there’s no better time to consider hopping in. Brett: Meme Madness with a Narrative Twist This is another meme contender that’s heating up the presale space with its own meme-based storytelling and unique narrative angle. Think of Brett as the “creative cousin” of traditional meme coins—less about randomness and more about storytelling. Brett isn’t just throwing memes at the wall and hoping they stick. Instead, this coin leverages a story-driven approach that draws investors into its world with engaging lore and strategic meme-gaming mechanics. Every meme has context, and every investor becomes a part of an evolving story. The narrative focus gives Brett an edge, creating a shared journey investors can participate in as they ride the meme market waves. Brett is a great choice for anyone who values narrative-driven hype in their meme investments. Act I: The AI Prophecy—Where Crypto Meets the Future Now let’s switch gears and talk about Act I: The AI Prophecy. If you’re a sci-fi fan, you’re going to love this one. Act I combines crypto with cutting-edge AI narratives and speculative storytelling to create a meme coin that feels like something straight out of Westworld or Black Mirror. It combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, creating a crypto experience unlike any other meme coin out there. This meme coin leans heavily into innovation, symbolism, and themes that make it perfect for those fascinated by the merging of AI and blockchain. With the growing trend of decentralised AI solutions and blockchain innovation, Act I taps into that zeitgeist while using its meme energy to amplify investor engagement. If you’ve ever wondered how AI might fit into the meme market, Act I: The AI Prophecy offers a very exciting glimpse into that future. For investors seeking a different flavour of meme coin excitement—something that’s equal parts sci-fi and crypto—the Act I presale is the perfect ticket. It’s unique, mysterious, and absolutely dripping with future vibes. Bottom Line: Don’t Miss Out This Weekend!

37656191,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662469,1734229848,"Crypto Market Outlook: VanEck Issues 10 Predictions, Including Bitcoin Nearing $200,000","As speculation swirls around the future trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market, asset management firm VanEck has released a set of predictions that bolster optimism for continued upward momentum. VanEck Forecasts Bitcoin Soaring To $180,000 VanEck predicts that the crypto bull market will reach a “medium-term peak” in the first quarter of 2025, followed by new all-time highs by the year’s end. The firm estimates Bitcoin could soar to approximately $180,000, while Ethereum (ETH) may exceed $6,000, Solana (SOL) could surpass $500, and Sui (SUI) might reach over $10. The report further suggests that the United States will begin to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, as President-elect Donald Trump promised, anticipating an increase in overall crypto adoption. Related Reading: Australia’s Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First With anticipated changes in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), numerous spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) are also expected to be approved. This includes Ethereum ETPs featuring staking options, as well as in-kind transaction capabilities for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Per the report, the asset manager forecasts that the value of tokenized securities will exceed $50 billion in the coming months, following a 61% growth to $12 billion throughout this year. Most of this value currently resides on permissioned chains, but 2025 is expected to be a breakthrough year, particularly as organizations like the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) explore bridging public and private blockchains. The firm projects that stablecoins will revolutionize payment systems, with daily settlement volumes potentially tripling to reach $300 billion by the end of 2025. This growth, driven by increased adoption in global commerce, remittances, and integration with major technology and payment networks, would position stablecoins to handle transactions equivalent to 5% of DTCC’s daily volumes. DeFi To Hit All-Time Highs Another intriguing prediction is the rise of one million new AI agents, which VanEck describes as “digital workers” that autonomously execute tasks or make decisions. These agents are expected to generate significant on-chain activity as they expand their roles beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into areas such as social media, gaming, and consumer applications. VanEck anticipates that Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions will accumulate a total value locked (TVL) of 100,000 BTC, building on an impressive 600% growth in 2024 that brought the TVL to 30,000 BTC. The report forecasts that Ethereum’s blob space will generate $1 billion in fees, spurred by the rapid adoption of Layer-2 solutions, rollup optimizations, and high-fee use cases such as tokenized assets and enterprise applications. VanEck predicts that decentralized finance (DeFi) will hit all-time highs, with decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes reaching $4 trillion and total value locked in DeFi rising to $200 billion. This growth will reportedly be fueled by AI-related tokens, consumer-facing decentralized applications (dApps), and the tokenization of assets that drive liquidity and user adoption. Related Reading: Solana Price On The Rise: Key Resistance At $235 Could Spark Major Breakout The non-fungible token (NFT) market is expected to rebound, with trading volumes projected to reach $30 billion in 2025. Despite recent downturns, standout projects like Pudgy Penguins and Miladys have managed to thrive by leveraging strong community ties and transitioning into consumer brands. Finally, VanEck forecasts that decentralized application (dApp) tokens will narrow the performance gap with Layer-1 tokens. In 2024, Layer-1 blockchain tokens outperformed dApp tokens by a factor of two, but innovative dApps in artificial intelligence and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are anticipated to drive a shift in performance dynamics. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto has managed to reclaim the $101,820 level, recording a 2% increase in the 24-hour time frame.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR.

Over the past few days, while the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, appear to be struggling to rally, HNT has gained 30% in value following a recent decline. Helium (HNT) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, HNT’s recent upside momentum has brought it to a crucial resistance level at $9.5. However, this marks the third time HNT has tested this level, and it appears to be weakening. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if HNT breaches this level and closes a daily candle above $9.85, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar by 22% to reach the $12 level in the near future. Despite a notable rally, HNT’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 65, which is below the overbought region, suggesting that the asset has enough room to continue its upward movement in the coming days. On the positive side, the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe indicates an uptrend, as it lies below HNT’s current price. HNT’s Rising Open Interest HNT’s technical analysis is further supported by on-chain metrics. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , HNT’s futures open interest has surged by 24%, reflecting traders’ strong interest and confidence in the token as it approaches a crucial breakout. When combining on-chain metrics with technical analysis, it appears that bulls have entered the market and could support the altcoin in breaching the resistance level this time. Current Price Momentum Currently, HNT is trading near $9.47 and has experienced a price jump of over 13.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume skyrocketed by 265%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors driven by HNT’s bullish outlook.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL | HNT,ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | HNT,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/helium-hnt-poised-for-20-rally-can-bulls-break-9-85/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The analyst also suggested that XRP’s next move could happen sooner than expected. Next Major Support And Resistance Levels For The XRP Price In an X post, Dark Defender mentioned $2.42, $2.52, $2.71, and $5.85 as the next major support levels for the XRP price. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst highlighted $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02 as the next major support levels for XRP. The analyst made these remarks while also alluding to a bull flag structure that had formed on XRP’s daily chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market Dark Defender asserted that the XRP price would make its next move by tomorrow, noting that the current bull flag had reached its limit. The crypto analyst had recently highlighted a weekly bull flag on the XRP chart, which showed that the crypto could reach double digits in this market cycle. In his most recent X post, Dark Defender also provided an update on his XRP/BTC pair analysis. He stated that what was expected from the XRP price was coming and suggested that it might have already begun. Before now, the analyst predicted that XRP would record “tremendous” gains against its Bitcoin pair. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted a bull flag forming on the XRP price’s 4-hour chart. Based on this pattern, the analyst stated that XRP could experience a brief correction, then break out above $2.46 and rally to $4, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP. Two Possible Scenarios For The Third Wave In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined two possible scenarios for the third wave of the XRP price’s move to the upside. In the first scenario, XRP could record a typical move, extending to the 2.618 Fibonacci level. This puts the price target at $3.82, the crypto’s current ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Bollinger Bands Expand, Why BTC Price Could Rise To $120,000 As Early As Next Week Meanwhile, for the second scenario, CasiTrades stated that if this third wave doesn’t extend, the XRP price could record the extension play in the fifth wave. If the third wave doesn’t extend, the price target will be $3.23 instead of $3.82. She added that this target is near XRP’s current ATH, so the extension play might not occur. CaiTrades cautioned that these are just projections and that the XRP price could adjust with the actual highs. However, she is confident that a big move is coming, as XRP has consolidated with minimal movement over the last day. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.51, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

37654158,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/bitcoin-navigating-the-bullish-battle-above-100k,1734225216,Bitcoin: Navigating the Bullish Battle Above $100K,"Bitcoin: Navigating the Bullish Battle Above $100K This weekend has failed to deliver the relief retail traders hoped for, bringing more retracements and the emergence of bearish patterns. The highly anticipated ""Santa rally"" seems increasingly out of reach as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs heavily on the market. Several major cryptocurrencies are underperforming today, with notable losers including SUI ( $SUI ), down 6.5% after peaking at its all-time high of $4.89 last Friday, along with PEPE ($PEPE ), BONK ($BONK ), and Polkadot ($DOT ), all dropping roughly 6%. Adding to the downturn, Cardano ($ADA ), Fantom ($FTM ), and Hedera ($HBAR – click for full insight) have each fallen by over 5%, reflecting a broad retreat across the altcoin market. The global crypto market cap currently sits at $3.6 trillion, marking a 1.2% decline in the past 24 hours, while trading volume has dropped sharply by 23.93% (typical for Saturday). Bitcoin 's dominance has increased slightly to 55.74%, as investors shift toward safer bets amid the growing uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCapsuggests Bitcoin remains firmly in control of the market, leaving altcoins struggling to gain traction. It’s easy to feel pessimistic in moments like these, but seasoned investors know the drill. After all, if you’ve been through a few of these wild four-year cycles, the strategy remains the same: zoom out, ignore the noise, and prepare for strategic buying opportunities. Let’s break down the market leader, the king of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ($BTC): The Rectangle Pattern and $74K Support Let’s first address the elephant in the room: the rectangle pattern that formed back in February this year, shortly after the spot ETF approval in January 2024. This pattern broke to the upside on the election results, hitting its full target of $99,000 perfectly before becoming a strong resistance level (now flipped into main short-term support). Now, the rectangle’s upper edge at $74,000 is playing a critical support role, often considered the “line in the sand” for many BTC investors. Adding further support to this rectangle is the 200-day moving average (green line), which currently sits at $69,000 and is gaining upside momentum. Historically, the 200-day MA serves as a strong dynamic support in bull markets. However, Bitcoin’s significant decoupling above this level also raises concerns of a potential return-to-mean scenario, which could see the price retrace to align with this long-term trend. Have a good look at 1d: If $74,000 were to break with confirmation, it could trigger a wave of exits, with the next logical stop being a test of the rectangle’s bottom around $49,000–$50,000. While such a correction doesn’t have to happen (or at least not until the next bear market), it’s worth noting that a breakdown to $74K would represent a 27-28% retracement from the ATH. Brutal as it sounds, this would be a relatively normal correction within a BTC bull market. The $107K Bull Flag: Still in Play? One of the most significant bullish macro formations for Bitcoin this year began with the SEC’s groundbreaking ETF approval. The January–May 2024 bull flag (green on the 1D chart) remains active, with a clear target at $107,000. This target is no joke, especially since the flag’s lower trendline extension has acted as a reversal point three times, reinforcing its significance. Interestingly, on the 4-hour chart, another bullish pennant pattern (purple) mirrors this flag’s target at $107,500. Two independent patterns aligning at the same price level give further weight to this target, making it a key projected take-profit zone. This alignment of patterns illustrates Bitcoin’s broader bullish potential, provided short-term challenges don’t derail momentum. The Rising Wedge and Current Challenges While the long-term outlook points higher, BTC is currently trapped in a rising wedge on the 4-hour chart, a bearish pattern by classical charting standards. Notably, the wedge’s bottom was formed by two significant December flash crashes, which now act as critical levels to watch. $101,000 is holding—for now. While Bitcoin briefly broke above six figures, the breakout lacked volume confirmation and momentum, leaving the price vulnerable to a pullback. By the time you read this, the $100K+ price might already be history. If the rising wedge breaks down, the target aligns almost perfectly with the 0.382 Fibonacci level just below $87,000. A close below $90,000 would also invalidate the bullish pennant pattern, significantly weakening the bullish case. Momentum Check: RSI Signals Mixed but Worrisome The daily RSI remains relatively ‘bullish’, currently holding just above 64 after cooling down from an overbought period in November. This steady position is supported by a strong RSI trendline that has been rising since August 2024 (visible in the chart as the red trendline). As long as RSI respects this trendline and continues its gradual upward movement, Bitcoin retains the momentum for further gains. However, concerns arise when we analyze the 4-hour RSI, which reveals signs of exhaustion. The RSI only reached 76 during BTC’s December 5 ATH of $103,700, forming a lower high compared to earlier overbought readings. This is an example of bearish divergence, where price makes a higher high while RSI makes a lower high. In simpler terms, this means that while the price climbed, the underlying momentum weakened—a classic red flag that often precedes corrections or consolidations. Adding to the mixed sentiment, volume during BTC’s breakout above $100,000 was lackluster, a classic red flag for sustainability in bullish price action. As of now, Bitcoin remains bullish as long as it holds above the 50-day SMA (yellow line) on the daily chart, currently sitting near $99,000, which also aligns with a key horizontal support level. For bulls to regain full control, the wedge must be invalidated by a strong daily close above $103,000, preferably with a notable volume spike. Key Ideas to Trade This Breakout Above $103K: A strong daily close above $103,000 with a clear volume spike would invalidate the wedge and signal momentum to target $107K. Watch for follow-through on the 4-hour timeframe to confirm the breakout. Trading the Wedge: Use the lower trendline of the wedge for potential long entries on price reversals. Confirmation can come from bullish candle patterns (e.g., hammers) or RSI rebounding from oversold zones. Do Nothing: The safest strategy is most likely to just wait. With the FOMC meeting looming on Wednesday, markets are likely to remain hesitant. Instead, consider scouting for entry points to capitalize on a likely retracement (Sunday to Monday night would be my guess). Summary: A Complicated Saturday Night As of Saturday night, Bitcoin remains in a delicate situation. Trading above the short-term bullish 50 SMA (yellow line) on the daily chart and holding the horizontal support at $99,000 keeps BTC in a bullish posture. However, for the king to truly stay strong on this timeframe, the rising wedge must be invalidated with a strong close above $103,000, preferably backed by a significant volume spike. Adding to the complexity, the Fear & Greed Index has returned to Extreme Greed (80) territory, following a brief dip during recent liquidations. Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ The problem? Those liquidations failed to reset sentiment properly, leaving the market overly optimistic without clearing enough leverage. This makes the current setup even more perilous, as excessive greed often precedes sharp corrections. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 60, signaling a phase of indecision. While the index remains above neutral territory, the sharp drop from last week's 83 confirms what we’re seeing across the market: altcoin season is suspended—not entirely called off, but certainly losing steam. Altcoins will likely continue struggling until Bitcoin (and $ETH – link to analysis) either consolidates with strength or resolves its current patterns. Let’s be real—this article could feel outdated by Monday if BTC does print a decisive candle soon to target the bullish patterns described. December, despite Moonvember’s fantastic run, has been tougher than expected. The crypto market is undoubtedly more complex now than last month—or even last weekend. The easy part of this bull market is over. Santa or no Santa, things are about to get wild. And when Trump takes office alongside the new, allegedly crypto-friendly leadership, we’ll be in for a market environment no one’s truly prepared for.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homo-shiba-inu-homoshib-solana-memecoin-will-rally-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 98,500 followers on the social media platform X that social volume and positive sentiment around Aave’s native token are skyrocketing. “With the crowd’s growing focus on AAVE, a brief pullback might be on the horizon, as markets often move against popular sentiment.” Source: Ali Martinez/X AAVE, the 34th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $384.85 at time of writing. Turning to Litecoin, Martinez says that LTC is “irrelevant, both fundamentally and technically.” The analyst argues that Litecoin hasn’t added anything significant to the crypto industry in terms of innovation. “And let’s not forget: [Litecoin creator] Charlie Lee famously sold all his Litecoin at the top in 2017. If the creator doesn’t believe in his project enough to hold it, why should I? If the fundamentals don’t convince you, the technicals should. Litecoin is trading at the same price today as it was in 2017. That’s seven years of going nowhere. In an industry defined by innovation and growth, LTC stands out as a project stuck in time. It hasn’t made a new all-time high since its peak in 2017 and has been consolidating in the same range ever since. Sure, there’s potential for a short-term pump here or there, but that’s purely speculative. If I’m putting my money into crypto, I’d rather back projects with innovation, strong fundamentals, and a clear future – not a relic of the past.” LTC, the 26th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $123.07 at time of writing. Martinez also updates his outlook on the real-world asset (RWA) project Ondo Finance ( ONDO ), which he says could soon be dealing with some price volatility amid increased crypto exchange inflows. “Historically, every spike in exchange inflows has triggered both price corrections and surges.

The analyst suggests that if XRP’s price movement continues to mirror its 2017 trajectory, the cryptocurrency might be on the cusp of a significant breakout. However, it may follow a brief period of consolidation. fyi, if $XRP does still continue to follow 2017, we likely continue to consolidate for another 2 weeks until Christmas time then, we make our face melting move up for about a month until late January pic.twitter.com/E9MH8ljNXG — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) December 13, 2024 Analysis Overview Charting Guy highlighted that XRP might consolidate until Christmas. Following this, a dramatic upward movement, similar to the one observed in late 2017, could occur, lasting about a month until late January. This projection aligns with historical trends where XRP experienced sharp rallies after periods of accumulation and low volatility. This perspective is supported by the historical price chart included in the discussion. The chart showcases key moments in XRP’s price history, including its massive rally in late 2017 and its similar, although shorter-lived, rally in early 2021. The ongoing consolidation period in late 2024 and early 2025 appears to fit the cyclical behavior seen in previous market cycles. Community Commentary Adding to the analysis, an X user, Bassi, provided further insight into how the timing of these potential movements could align with broader narratives. Bassi speculated that a rally around December 30 could be attributed to Christmas hype or Ripple’s stable coin (RLUSD) related developments. Furthermore, they projected January 20 as a potential peak, coinciding with the U.S. Presidential Inauguration Day. This date could mark a turning point for XRP, with the community likely labeling any subsequent downturn as a “sell the news” event.

Market Sentiment: Speculative narratives, such as the holiday season or major institutional developments, often play a role in driving short-term price movements in the cryptocurrency market. Macro Events: Broader market conditions, including regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and Bitcoin’s price performance, are likely to have an indirect impact on XRP’s trajectory.

37673478,https://nulltx.com/?p=135732,1734221737,5 Best New Meme Coins for Significant Returns [Financial Freedom Has Never Looked So Accessible],"5 Best New Meme Coins for Significant Returns [Financial Freedom Has Never Looked So Accessible] If meme coins were a movie genre, they’d be a blockbuster comedy-action film: hilarious, explosive, and full of unexpected plot twists. From humble beginnings as internet jokes, these coins have grown into investment powerhouses, delivering chef’s kiss gains to lucky holders. Financial freedom? It’s never looked this approachable—or this much fun. Leading the pack is none other than BTFD Coin, the rallying cry of every trader who knows how to “buy the dip.” The coin’s presale has bulldozed through the market, with a jaw-dropping $3.7 million raised, over 53 billion coins sold, and more than 5,000 holders locking horns for their share of the action. Don’t wait too long to grab yours, though—the bulls aren’t slowing down! 1. BTFD Coin: Where the Bulls Play to Win BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a movement. Inspired by the legendary trading mantra, “Buy the Dip,” this meme coin embraces chaos and turns it into opportunity. Built on Ethereum for rock-solid security, it offers insane features like staking rewards with an average APY of 90% and a play-to-earn (P2E) game that’s already got gamers sharpening their horns. The ongoing presale is the real star of the show. In just weeks, BTFD Coin has raised $3.7 million, proving that the bulls are stampeding to get in. At its current presale price of $0.00013, it’s still early enough to lock in life-changing gains before the herd catches on. Let’s say you decide to invest $300 in BTFD Coin today. At the presale price of $0.00013, that gives you 2,307,692 coins. If BTFD Coin soars to $0.0006 as predicted, your investment could balloon to $1,384—over a 361% return. Add staking rewards into the mix, and you’re not just investing; you’re building wealth like a bull in a china shop. Why this meme coin made it to this list: BTFD Coin stands out with its innovative ecosystem, high staking rewards, and community-driven approach. Combine that with its rapidly growing presale success, and it’s no wonder analysts are bullish on this token’s short- and long-term potential. 2. Neiro: The Doge Legacy Lives On Neiro isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a story, a legacy, and a movement wrapped in wagging tails and blockchain brilliance. Think of Neiro as the spiritual successor to Dogecoin, carrying forward the meme magic while adding a heartwarming twist. Here’s the kicker: Neiro was adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu, the iconic dog behind the Doge meme. It’s like Doge’s little sister is stepping into the spotlight, and she’s not here to play small. Launched on Ethereum at the precise moment of the New Moon on August 4th, 2024, Neiro caught the attention of none other than Vitalik Buterin. Yes, the Vitalik Buterin. Days later, he publicly confirmed a $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund inspired by Neiro. But the journey doesn’t stop at celebrity nods. Neiro’s origin story is as heartfelt as they come. Originally abandoned by her owner and placed in a shelter, Neiro’s tale mirrors the coin’s trajectory. After being rugged by its initial developer, the community banded together to breathe new life into the project. Now, Neiro is 100% community-owned and driven, embodying a true decentralised ethos. And in a poetic twist, Neiro has already made donations to the very shelter that once housed her real-life namesake. More charitable initiatives are in the pipeline, proving that this coin doesn’t just make wallets happy—it warms hearts too. Why this meme coin made it to this list: Neiro is more than a token; it’s a tribute to resilience, community, and giving back. With a legendary lineage, Ethereum roots, and a mission that blends profits with purpose, it’s a must-watch in the meme coin world. 3. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): The Meta Commentary Hero Non-Playable Coin (NPC) takes the internet’s fascination with gaming and meta jokes to the next level. This token thrives on the idea of being self-aware, poking fun at crypto culture while delivering substantial returns to its holders. NPC’s roadmap is packed with community-driven events, meme competitions, and a unique staking programme that offers double-digit APYs. Why this meme coin made it to this list: With its witty branding and robust staking rewards, NPC is more than a joke—it’s a statement. Its community engagement strategy ensures it stays relevant and profitable. 4. Simon’s Cat: Purr-fectly Positioned for Gains Inspired by the viral cartoon series, Simon’s Cat taps into a global fanbase that’s already smitten. This meme coin combines adorable charm with solid fundamentals, including token burns, charity initiatives for animal welfare, and NFT integrations featuring Simon’s Cat art. It’s a feel-good investment with claws. Why this meme coin made it to this list: Simon’s Cat combines pop culture appeal with a strong use case, making it a standout in the crowded meme coin market. Its charity partnerships add an extra layer of goodwill to your gains. 5. Osaka Protocol: Crypto Meets Community Osaka Protocol is the community-driven meme coin that’s all about putting power back in the hands of the people. With decentralised governance, holders vote on key decisions, ensuring the project evolves with its users. Add in regular airdrops and a P2E gaming feature, and Osaka Protocol is a package deal of profitability and engagement. Why this meme coin made it to this list: Osaka Protocol’s emphasis on decentralisation and community makes it a prime example of where meme coins are headed.

37653291,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52171,1734220853,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Target Is Not Out Of Reach, But This Rival Is Set To Rally 12,000% To $4 First","As the last quarter of the year pans out, several cryptocurrencies are meeting up with their predictions for the end of the year. With over 60% month-long profit, the Dogecoin price is also showing bullish strength as many expect the token to meet higher price targets this year. On the other hand, ETFSwap (ETFS) is taking full advantage of its fresh Uniswap listing to rival Dogecoin and deliver 12,000% more profits to its investors, taking its value to $4. Dogecoin Price Prepares For Further Upsurge As Its Price Consolidates The Dogecoin price impressed meme coin enthusiasts and investors by rallying over 100% in the past few weeks. However, the Dogecoin price is starting to consolidate, forming a bullish flag and settling around a weekly price range of $0.3947 – $0.4758. Although the monthly gains the Dogecoin price accumulated have dropped from over 150% to a current 60%, analysts like Ali Martinez have hinted that the Dogecoin price could hit a target of $18 if the bull cycle gets wild in 2025. As this prediction adds to the optimism around Dogecoin, confidence is starting to brew for the Dogecoin price. Although, technical analysis for Dogecoin on TradingView hints at a neutral signal. This means that Dogecoin price could either surge further or drip from here. However, the Dogecoin community remains positive as CoinMarketCap reflects an 87% bullish sentiment for the token. ETFSwap (ETFS) Readies Itself For A Further 12,000% Pump As It Gains Uniswap Listing After already securing a listing on CoinMarketCap, ETFSwap (ETFS) has now made a notable debut on Uniswap , where investors are quickly moving to seize its new opportunities. After completing over 575% pump in its presale, where it sold over 900 million of its tokens and accumulated nearly $10 million in revenue, ETFSwap (ETFS) is presenting a fresh new chance for both old and new investors to reap higher ROI. Considering its wider audience on a prominent exchange platform like Uniswap, ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to utilize this opportunity to deliver 12,000% more returns to its investors. This surge is slated to raise the value of the ETFS token to $4, potentially giving early investors ROIs in multiple folds. Beyond ETFSwap’s potential for a massive price surge now that it has listed on Uniswap, the platform offers even more lucrative opportunities, as well as unique features that could spark an unprecedented upsurge for the token. For starters, this newly listed altcoin project functions as a fully decentralized platform that allows investors to trade tokenized ETF assets from several financial markets. These include cryptocurrency, commodities, bonds and amplified-based ETFs. Aside from this, all of its ETF products have been backed by Real World Assets, with its smart contract already audited by CyberScope. With an additional KYC verification by SolidProof, ETFSwap (ETFS) not only captures investors’ trust but also shows its potential for a large adoption rate due to its diverse investment options. To top it off, ETFSwap’s native token, ETFS, offers even more benefits and lucrative opportunities that investors can take advantage of. In addition to being able to buy, own and swap ETFs with cryptocurrencies, users can earn rewards up to 87% APR yield through its staking opportunities. Additionally, there’s a 36% passive income set aside for those who stake their tokens. ETFSwap (ETFS) also offers distinct AI-powered tools that help investors filter, track, and screen ETF assets so they can make smart ETF investment decisions. Conclusion Although the Dogecoin price is set to reach new price targets in this bull cycle, ETFSwap (ETFS) stands as a better investment option. The platform offers some of the best features for an ETF and crypto trading platform, including 24/7 ETF trading access and live price tracking. These capabilities enable users to make significant profits. With its recent Uniswap listing , massive adoption for the token is expected, making now the perfect time to invest in the ETFS token. According to market experts, investors stand a huge chance to earn big when the token rallies by 12,000% to $4. So, savvy investors should do well to buy now when the price is still affordable and position for ROIs up to 12,000%.
