42429239,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwzZh,1530044113,US Senators Discuss Crypto Threat to Domestic Elections,"Cryptocurrencies are ""tailor-made"" for foreign powers hoping to influence American elections, a security consultant told a group of U.S. senators on Tuesday.  Scott Dueweke, director of threat analysis company DarkTower, was one of several witnesses appearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism to discuss the potential use of cryptocurrencies by foreign agents in order to influence American elections. He argued that lawmakers must focus on identity solutions to prevent undue foreign influence on upcoming elections.  ""There is a global shell game being played now,"" by people hoping to bypass financial disclosure rules, he said. As a result, they are purchasing political advertisements and donating to certain parties in efforts to influence elections.  Dueweke added:  ""They exchange one form of money for another … fiat currency in and fiat currency out, but in between you're going to have these multiple layers of cryptocurrency that are going to be impossible to track.""  Another witness, Financial Integrity Network vice president David Murray, noted that cryptocurrencies can be used by foreign entities to avoid detection when donating to political parties or politicians.  He contrasted the use of cryptocurrencies with donations made through financial institutions.  ""When donors use financial intermediaries such as banks to execute donations, the location of the financial intermediary is a data point that campaigns can use to identify foreign donors,"" he explained.  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee who lead the questions during the hearing, said that ""cryptocurrency can be used for money laundering in elections,"" and therefore pose a ""host of challenges for Congress and regulators.""  He considered the idea of using legislation to enforce more stringent identity requirements on individuals donating to a political campaign – a push that Dueweke argued is crucial.  ""Combining better forensics to understand the source of funds, tied to stronger identity attribution for those placing political ads is critical,"" Dueweke said.

The social media giant has launched a ""cryptocurrency products and services onboarding request"" form that will allow some companies to get their ads on the platform, according to a blog post published Tuesday.  Facebook, however, won't allow advertisements for initial coin offerings or binary options. The prohibition on these remains in effect months after Facebook first took action against crypto-ads in a move that was followed by similar actions by Twitter, Google and other major sites.  The request sheet shows that the social media company wants specifics on the kinds of services companies wishing to advertise offer. For example, Facebook asks whether companies have the relevant licenses in order to operate, or if they are a publicly-listed company. Facebook has also published a legal addendum outlining its policy toward cryptocurrency ads.  Notably, the social media company suggested that its policy could see additional tweaks in the future.  Rob Leathern, product management director for Facebook, wrote in the blog post:  ""Given these restrictions, not everyone who wants to advertise will be able to do so. But we'll listen to feedback, look at how well this policy works and continue to study this technology so that, if necessary, we can revise it over time.""  The move has won early plaudits from the cryptocurrency PR space.

42429263,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx07h,1530034516,Korea's Exchange Hacks: What the Country's Crypto Scene Is Saying,"The past two weeks have seen two South Korean exchanges get attacked and robbed, sparking commentary and critique among the country's local cryptocurrency community.  It began with the Coinrail hack on June 9. At the time, the popular South Korean cryptocurrency exchange tentatively announced a ""cyber intrusion"" that saw the loss of $40 million worth of cryptocurrencies.  The exact number and amount of tokens taken from the exchange have yet to be confirmed by the company itself, though a third-party firm assisting Coinrail gave a few estimates in a blog post the following day.  If that wasn't enough, on June 20, Bithumb – South Korea's largest by trade volume – also announced a major security breach in which $31 million was reported to be lost. In a post published on their official website the same day, Bithumb reassured customers that their assets were now securely stored in offline ""cold"" wallets unreachable to hackers and the stolen funds would be fully reimbursed.  Combine this environment with a recent bearish market trend taking the price of bitcoin down in a way not seen since 2014 and you get the kind of social media uproar that questions just about everything.  As one Korean cryptocurrency skeptic tweeted:  Along the same lines, @marco20bil mocked a past Coinrail advertisement boasting its security by uploading a picture of the ad and tweeting at the company:  ""Anyone would look at this and see it as an insider act, no? Please catch the culprit and restore the platform back to the original state as soon as possible…You said there is no vulnerability of being hacking in an advertisement. Are you joking me right now?""  Digging Deep  For most, it's not a matter of tech security – that's a given for those that care – but rather about the people who operate the exchanges behind the scenes.  As @leejongsul78 puts it:  Indeed, much of the community's ire has been pointed toward those operating the exchanges.  One user, @dongjinkim5, addressed Bithumb directly in light of their urgent notice Twitter announcement to users on June 19, pleading:  Another accused Coinrail of withholding information about what actually went down during the hack.  As might be expected, some of the furor devolved into the downright conspiratorial. For example, one user emphasized the possibility Bithumb may be creating a cover-up by claiming it had been robbed through a hack.  No strangers to risk  As far as answers go, the community can only watch and wait as the investigations unfold.  And as it stands, the government of South Korea is doing some of the heavy liftings there: the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) and the Ministry of Science, Information, and Communication Technology are currently in the process of investigating both hacks, but have yet to make any public disclosures on their findings.  But South Koreans are no strangers to the riskiness of crypto markets, as just last year, another notable cryptocurrency exchange, Youbit, was hacked for a reported $73 million worth of bitcoin, and subsequently, filed for bankruptcy last December.  Nor are South Koreans quick to accept these incidents as merely cyber-related heists by criminals out for the money.  As reported by the Wall Street Journal, speculation arose around the possibility of the true culprit behind the Youbit hack being none other than their adversarial counterpart, North Korea. It has been reported from other sources that this is by no means the first time the South Korean National Intelligence Service has suspected North Korea to be behind cryptocurrency hacks as a method to evade financial sanctions.  One of the alleged targets was Bithumb, which reportedly saw $7 million pilfered during a string of attacks last year.  Still, the avid support of cryptocurrencies in South Korea remains strong, and while the fallout of past weeks events is still taking shape, eyes are not only looking to South Korea, but to the world.  As one South Korean cryptocurrency trader, @sunghq2, put it:  ""The price impact that the Bithumb hacking will have is determined by the West's reaction to the incident amplifying Asia's reaction, which then impacts Asia's reaction, impacting the West's reaction, and back and forth.""  It's just like that (slightly amended) famous saying goes: Back and forth the crypto markets go – where it'll stop, nobody knows.

42429253,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwzzh,1530025255,Overwinter Is Here: Zcash Claims 'Successful' First Hard Fork,"Privacy-focused cryptocurrency zcash executed its first and long-awaited hard fork on Tuesday morning.  Called Overwinter, the upgrade was activated at 00:42 UTC on June 26 – the moment the network mined block 347,500, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  The event is primarily aimed to gear up the zcash code for its massive Sapling hard fork, currently scheduled to occur in October, and includes changes including versioning, replay protection for future forks and some performance improvements.  Josh Swihart, marketing director for the Zcash Company, explained in a blog post after the fork that the ""successful"" event was helped by the network's first implementation of a two-tiered governance model for such upgrades.  The first tier is an optional upgrade, which aims to ""remove chaos introduced by other governance models where users are forced down a certain path, potentially without their knowledge or consent,"" he said.  The second tier is ""advocacy and education,"" helping node operators make ""well-informed decisions"" about future hard forks prior to their execution.  While it was not immediately clear how many nodes executed the Overwinter fork, zcash engineer Simon Liu previously told CoinDesk that there was ""unanimous support from all parties"" for the upgrades. Indeed, 12 exchanges were listed as supporting the fork on the zcash website, while other mining pools publicly expressed support for Overwinter elsewhere.  In the wake of Overwinter's activation, the Zcash Company also published a proposed two-year roadmap. Most notably, this would direct research into ""privacy-by-default,"" Swihart wrote in a separate post.  This could see users by default using the platform's shielded ""z-addresses,"" meaning that their balances and transactions are not visible to observers of the blockchain. Currently, the default is for unshielded ""t-addresses,"" meaning that their transaction data is publicly on show.  Swihart expanded:  ""The Zcash protocol and supporting tools, like the reference wallet, need to support broad-based privacy adoption. ... We will track and measure adoption through a number of means including the number of shielded transactions, the number of third parties supporting shielded addresses, and the number of third parties supporting shielded addresses by default.""  Zcash also plans to carry out market research on the issue, including a study of global users and use cases, to ""better understand both current use and identify opportunities for improvement,"" Swihart wrote.  Other proposed efforts include creating a reference wallet for third-parties, scalability research, business and marketing pushes, ongoing maintenance and decentralization support, according to the announcement.

Data from China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) revealed two new patent applications on Friday, pushing the total number submitted by the lab to 41 over the 12 months since its launch.  Each of the 41 patent applications focuses on a certain aspect of a digital currency system, and, when combined, would create a technology that issues a digital currency, as well as provides a wallet that stores and transacts the asset in an ""end-to-end"" fashion.  For instance, the most recently revealed patent application explains how the envisioned digital wallet would allow users to check any transactions made through the service, while earlier documents offered details on how the wallet can facilitate transactions.  The ultimate goal, according to PBoC's patents, is to ""break the silo between blockchain-based cryptocurrency and the existing monetary system"" so that the digital currency can sport cryptocurrency-like features, while being widely used in the existing financial structure.  Last week's patents further explain that the envisioned wallet would not be limited, like a typical cryptocurrency wallet, to merely storing the private key to a certain asset. Nor would it be like another mobile payment service that only reflects a number on an application's front-end interface without users actually holding the assets in a peer-to-peer manner.  Instead, the patents indicates the wallet would store a digital currency issued by the central bank or any authorized central entity that is encrypted like a cryptocurrency with private keys, offers multi-signature security and is held by users in a decentralized way.  The research lab said in one of the documents that it believes it is building a mechanism that makes a crypto-featured digital currency more applicable in the financial world.  The hybrid approach is also in line with opinions shared by the PBoC's vice governor Fan Yifei and Yao Qian, the head of the research lab, who have both argued for a balance between the two polars of centralization and decentralization.  Overall, the patent applications filed so far signal the continuous efforts made by China's central bank to develop its own central bank digital currency, as well as to potentially widen the application's role among other central institutions.  The lab notably commented in a patent application released in November 2017:  ""The virtual currencies issued by private entities are fundamental flaws given their volatility, low public trust, and limited useable scope. ... Therefore, it's inevitable for the central bank to launch its own digital currency to upscale the existing circulation of the fiat currency.""

42429241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwzdh,1530014424,Privacy Is Vital to Crypto – And the Global Economy,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Imagine if flour millers insisted on knowing the precise identity and originating farm of each grain of wheat delivered to them.  It would render the global wholesale crop market dysfunctional. That market depends on buyers accepting products from warehouses and shippers even though they don't know their origins.  At the heart of this system is the ancient principle of fungibility: the idea that one unit of a particular product is perfectly interchangeable with another.  This principle depends upon an unspoken agreement between market participants that information about a product's history is not only hidden but is actually lost. A product having this quality is, more or less, the very definition of a commodity.  Fungibility is even more important to money. Our system of money requires that each dollar be completely interchangeable with any other dollar. For it to function perfectly, users can have no knowledge of the history of each of those dollars.  I like to define money as a communication system that uses a commodity (the currency) to convey information about transfers of value. If the commodity's fungibility is challenged, the power to communicate that information is diminished.  You could say that assuring the fungibility of a currency is a matter of free speech. Just as importantly, the breach of freedom means that the system of exchange itself breaks down.  It's all about privacy  It boils down to privacy. Without the history of transactions being obscured, money doesn't function so well.  If we knew where every distinct unit of currency had been, it would assume the quality of a distinct, identifiable form of property. And that would leave our money subject to liens and asset seizures by creditors or law enforcement agents taking actions against other people.  This is critical to the argument around privacy in the blockchain and cryptocurrency communities.  Unless you're listening to the outdated, false talking points of some anti-crypto crusaders, you'll know by now that bitcoin, which keeps a record of every single input and output, is not very private. (If you're going to do a giant drug or arms deal that you want kept out of view, it's much better to use a briefcase full of Ben Franklins, not bitcoin.)  This aspect of bitcoin raises serious questions about its fungibility.  The same questions will arise around the myriad new blockchain platforms for exchanging digital assets. For these systems' crypto-economic incentive and governance models to fulfill a promise to resolve trust problems and enhance community coordination, their tokens must be fungible. (Note: this interchangeability is required even when the token represents a claim on a piece of distinct, underlying property, such as a share in a piece of real estate.) And that means that they too must address the privacy dilemma.  Even as the understanding of bitcoin's privacy limitations improves, and as mathematicians such as Blockstream's Andrew Poelstra seek to overcome them, the public debate over this matter still mostly misses the bigger point of fungibility.  As cryptographic tools for enhancing privacy have been incorporated into cryptocurrency projects, including zero-knowledge proofs (zcash), ring signatures (monero) and bitcoin mixers, the debate over their value to society is too narrowly viewed as a battle between privacy as a human right on the one hand and society's need to prevent criminality on the other.  But serious cryptographers working on these tools make a bigger and more important claim: privacy is needed to enhance the ""moneyness"" of cryptocurrency.  It is a vitally important task, because, as it is, our entire global system of money has also seen its fungibility deteriorate, precisely because privacy has been eroded.  Even though, for the most part, a dollar is still treated as interchangeable with any other dollar, increasingly stringent anti-money laundering rules are undermining that system.  The cost of compliance  It began well-intended, with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, which requires banks to identify customers before permitting them to use their services and to, effectively, monitor their behavior.  The BSA became a powerful weapon in the U.S. in the War on Drugs, and its principles became ever-more ingrained into our financial system. There's now an elaborate global system of outsourced monitoring aimed at using money trails to catch bad guys.  It's debatable how successful these programs have been. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that up to $2 trillion is laundered annuallyhttps://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/globalization.html, or 5 percent of world GDP. Governments' answer to that problem has, predictably, been to add even more surveillance and compliance requirements.  What is clear is that all these rules end up curtailing the flow of money around the world, especially that of honest actors.  Since the 2008 financial crisis, and following some heavy fines against banks that serviced drug cartels or dealt with sanctioned entities on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list, ""know-their-customer"" (KYC) identification requirements have become a major cost drain for most banks.  These compliance costs are now so burdensome that many have been pulling back from perfectly reasonable businesses that their compliance officers deem ""risky."" Entire regions such as the Caribbean have suffered debt crises because of this ""de-risking"" problem.  Banks might still function somewhat like those grain warehouses, bundling deposits in a way that doesn't distinguish one dollar from another. But I would argue that this excessive compliance process has, in effect, made the global monetary system less fungible. A dollar transmitted by an ""unbanked"" individual in the Bahamas is now worth less than a dollar wired by a fully ""KYC-ed"" U.S. bank client.  Bitcoin's limitations  Bitcoin promised a way around this problem. There was no need to personally identify oneself to gain access to bitcoin currency; you merely had to download the software and generate a public key that contained no identifying information. Many of us saw it as a solution for the unbanked of the developing world.  But since bitcoin wasn't widely used by the general public, users inevitably had to interchange coins with fiat currency, which meant interfacing with the banking system. Once bitcoin wallets and exchanges were subject to KYC rules, they created identifiable on- and off-ramps, which, when combined with bitcoin's permanent, immutable, blockchain ledger, created a clearly traceable record of every bitcoin transaction.  This is how the U.S. Department of Justice caught those rogue Secret Service agents who thought they could abscond with bitcoins seized in their investigation of Ross Ullbricht, the convicted founder of the Silk Road marketplace.  We've already seen how bitcoin's traceable history undermines fungibility. When the FBI launched a series of auctions of bitcoins seized in that same investigation, it attracted giant bids that put a higher price on bitcoin than that quoted on exchanges.  Why? Because these were ""whitewashed"" coins; no FBI agent would seize these again. It turns out that one bitcoin can be more valuable than another.  Imperfect fungibility means that people will tend toward holding bitcoin as a speculative asset rather than using it as a medium of exchange. Speculation is all well and good, but if bitcoin can't be used for purchases, it's an impractical form of money.  Privacy = freedom = a healthy economy  Yet because governments are unwittingly creating the same problem with their own money, cryptographers working on privacy solutions for cryptocurrencies have an opportunity to enhance economic activity, not only in the world of crypto, but the world over. In doing so, they're also striking a blow for freedom.  That's because privacy is not only critical for monetary fungibility, it is the foundation of freedom. In the years ahead, as economic activity becomes increasingly digital, I believe this duality of privacy and freedom, measured by how easily our value exchange systems allow us to transact with each other, will become the defining differentiator between economic systems.  Consider China. The rapid expansion of digital payments there, led by Alibaba's Alipay and Tencent's WePay, has caught the world's attention. It's driving other governments to vow to create ""cashless societies.""  But as the Chinese government expands its surveillance state, replete with its ominous ""social credit score"" measuring and incentivizing citizens' behavior, the traceability of those digital payments looks quite worrying.  At what point does a digital transaction model's threat to privacy, fungibility and economic activity outweigh its ease-of-use advantages? This, I believe, could be the defining issue in a global competition between open versus closed economic models.  So let's applaud and support the work of these pro-privacy cryptographers. They are building out a core feature of our future digital economy's infrastructure, one that's needed to both protect human beings and enable exchange among them.

In a speech on Tuesday, Tony Richards, head of the payments policy department of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), said while his institution feels there is little demand for a CBDC, should the public move to adopt a new e-money in numbers, there could be ""significant implications for the bank's financial stability mandate.""  Richards – who explained that he has owned bitcoin and used it in retail transactions since 2014 – further argued that the cryptocurrency also still has ""structural flaws"" that put limitations on its potential. He continued to say that ""the scalability and governance problems of the bitcoin system"" put it far behind traditional payment methods such as Visa.  ""The transaction fees and the queue of unconfirmed transactions [during the December 2017 price peak] raise the broader question of how well bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) perform when we look at the key attributes of money – namely that it should represent a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Here, I think there is fairly substantial agreement.""  Subsequently, he reiterated the RBA's stance that issuing a central bank digital currency – or an ""eAUD"" as the bank's governor Philip Lowe called it in a previous speech – is not necessary within the existing financial system.  Richards commented:  ""So for the time being at least, consideration of a possible new electronic form of money provided by the Reserve Bank to households is not something that we are actively pursuing. Based on our interactions with our counterparts in other countries, it is also not front of mind for most other advanced economy central banks.""  Taking a similar tone, Geoff Bascand, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, also argued in a speech today that a central bank-issued cryptocurrency would not be financially stable given its existing scalability constraints and lengthy transaction confirmation process.  ""At this stage it is yet to be seen that a central bank digital currency will bring conclusive benefits. ... Currently, it is too early to determine whether a digital currency should be issued,"" Bascand argued.

42429236,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwsBh,1530007205,"Bitcoin Price Building Relief Rally, But Resistance Hurdles Await","Bitcoin (BTC) narrowly missed scaling a key resistance level on Monday, but remains on the hunt for a corrective rally, the technical studies indicate.  The cryptocurrency flashed signs of bearish exhaustion yesterday, having defended the $6,000 mark over the weekend. As discussed, a close (as per UTC) above $6,250 (Doji candle high) yesterday would have likely set the tone for a stronger corrective rally.  While prices did reach a high of $6,341 yesterday, BTC closed (as per UTC) at $6,247. So, technically speaking, the short-term bull doji reversal is yet to be confirmed.  However, a rally may still be on the cards, as prices are holding well above the key support of $6,000 (February low) and the indicators have diverged in favor of the bulls.  On the other hand, stiff resistance lined up in the $6,400–$6,800 range could complicate the recovery.  At press time, BTC is trading at $6,220 on Bitfinex, having clocked a high of $6,281 earlier today.  Daily chart  Although BTC failed to close above $6,250 yesterday, the green candle has established a bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence (lower lows in price and higher lows in the RSI).  Meanwhile, the money flow index (MFI) – a momentum indicator that incorporates both price and volume into its calculations – has also created a higher low as opposed to lower lows in price (bullish divergence). The MFI is rising too, indicating an increase in buying pressure.  Clearly, the indicators are aligned in favor of a corrective rally in the short-term. That said, the bulls face an uphill task as a number of key resistance hurdles await:  $6,417 (10-day moving average)  $6,425 (April low)  $6,500 (April 6 low)  $6,533 (March 30 low)  $6,680 (falling channel resistance)  Still, the longer outlook remains bearish, with bitcoin still trading in a falling channel.  Below $6,000 (February low), major support levels are located at:  $5,755 (Sunday's Doji candle low)  $5,400 (November low)  $5,090 (rising wedge breakdown target)  So, there is a lot of room to the downside and plenty resistance to the upside, and the bulls' task doesn't look an easy one.  View  BTC remains on the hunt for a corrective rally to $6,680 (falling channel hurdle). A daily close (as per UTC) above that level would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and would open the doors to the 50-day moving average, currently located at $7,464.  On the downside, a close below $6,000 (February low) would put the focus back on the long-term bearish technicals and boost odds of a drop toward $5,40 (November low).

42429226,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwrrh,1530003657,A New Business Model Is Shaking Up the Crypto Exchange Rankings,"The recently introduced ""trans-fee mining"" revenue model is starting to change the cryptocurrency exchange landscape, despite some criticism of the method from industry insiders.  According to CoinMarketCap, two exchanges have just shot to the top of the 24-hour trading volume rankings after rolling out trans-fee mining for users.  The data shows that 24-hour trading volume on Singapore-based CoinBene is now almost $2 billion, while on Hong Kong's Bit-Z the figure is close to $1.5 billion – both well ahead of the $1 billion in volume posted by the previous leader, Binance.  First featured by FCoin, a new exchange launched in May by a former chief technology officer of Huobi, the trans-fee mining model sees crypto exchanges issue their own tokens as a means to incentivize users to trade on the platform.  In Bit-Z's example, according to its white paper, the platform plans to produce its BZ token with a capped total issuance of 300 million. For every transaction fee a user pays to Bit-Z in the form of either bitcoin or ethereum, the platform will reimburse the user 100 percent of the value in its token.  Based on announcements from the two companies, CoinBene launched its offering on June 18, while Bit-Z started on Monday. Notably, the sudden spike in trading volume seen as a result pushed them to become the top two global platforms within days of their respective token issuances.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, one of the controversies associated with the nascent model is that it could incentivize users to create fake transactions using automated bots in an effort to obtain the tokens issued by exchanges.  After FCoin's trading volume first spiked in the last month, the Chinese cryptocurrency media, as well as Binance, also weighed in with allegations that the model is, in essence, an initial coin offering (ICO) and that the token's price could be manipulated by exchanges.  Zhao Changpeng, founder and CEO of Binance, further questioned whether the model is sustainable in the long-term.  Related news indicates that the criticisms may not be deterring exchanges from adopting trans-fee mining, however. BigONE – an exchange backed by Chinese crypto investor Li Xiaolai – is also moving to adopt the model, according to the company's website.

42429235,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLws9h,1530000038,Banks Are Trying to Launch Crypto Assets with R3 Tech,"It may have seemed unthinkable four years ago, but crypto tokens might be coming to R3's Corda.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Cordite, an open-source community that's independent from R3, but building solely on the code it pioneered, is about to come out of stealth mode. Cordite promises to do for enterprise blockchains what the ERC-20 standard did for ethereum: allow the creation of different tokens representing various kinds of assets on the same network.  The difference is that Cordite is designed specifically for use by the banking industry. Indeed, the main contributor and community leader of the project is one of the world's 30 largest financial institutions, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS).  So whereas ERC-20s unleashed the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, enabling startups across the globe to bypass the usual fundraising hurdles and raise billions from the public by creating exotic new tokens, Cordite will allow digital representation of mryiad assets traditionally held and traded by highly regulated institutions.  In this way, blockchain networks could become more useful to these large companies, since they could track both sides of a trade – cash for securities, for example, or one type of foreign exchange for another – on the same ledger, rather than having one leg of the transaction occurring off-chain.  Richard Crook, the head of emerging technology at RBS, told CoinDesk:  ""As we move to the next level of building distributed apps in the enterprise space, there is going to be a need for tokens and units of value on these ledgers.""  For example, Crook said, ""if I am building an invoice platform for trade finance, when the invoice goes one way, I need a digital asset that you and I agree is worth something coming back.""  Nevertheless, there's a certain irony here.  Founded in 2014, R3 was designed to be the regulation-friendly shared-ledger provider, one that drew a contrast to cryptocurrency chains and their ""anarchic"" approach to governance.  Now, with this new project, it will technically become possible to run an ICO on R3's flagship Corda software, albeit unlikely. Rather, Cordite is being positioned as an answer to a range of challenges facing the developers of distributed ledger technology (DLT) inside banks and corporate entities.  Corda community  The arrival of enterprise tokens on Corda comes at a stressful time for R3, which has been the subject of varying degrees of speculation of late regarding its financial health.  But whatever the truth may be about the privately held firm's cash position, the emergence of initiatives like Cordite suggests that there's a vibrant open-source community growing around the technology R3 developed. According to R3, Cordite is just one of many ""CorDapps"" about to be released.  ""Cordite is not something that R3 invented, it's something that the community itself saw a need for and went to build,"" said Richard Gendal Brown, R3's CTO.  He added:  ""People building stuff on Corda that didn't have to ask permission tells me we are succeeding and that Corda is developing as a genuine platform.""  Indeed, Crook at RBS said Cordite was underway before he got involved. He happened upon the project about six months ago and found there the answers to many of the challenges facing firms building enterprise DLT projects.  ""I won't name them, but it's the same sort of companies that are members of R3 who are contributing to Cordite,"" he said, adding that the project remained in private alpha mode for the last six months as everyone involved wanted to get the testing right.  Enterprise tokens  Stepping back, Cordite is also one of several examples of corporate technologists experimenting with fiat cash on distributed ledgers in one form or another. Also, some very large firms are looking at internal tokens as a way to connect their treasuries or move money across the world without doing currency conversions.  Yet, beyond such potential efficiency gains, Crook sees tokenization as key to making the economics of shared ledgers workable.  The RBS banker believes that firstly the token will provide a way of distributing fees among participants in the incipient world of enterprise blockchains.  ""In the DLT projects that are going live, some of the participants are providing services, some of them are consuming services,"" he said. ""The people that are providing services need to be paid for providing those services and the people who are using them need to pay them.""  That said, broader applications overlap with the traditional banking world, such as potentially a standard way to represent a bank's deposits in the form of digital tokens.  ""So if NatWest [a subsidiary of RBS] were to issue a token that said we would promise to pay the bearer – a promissory note – I'm pretty sure that most of our customers and clients would find that very useful; it's analogous to an ATM, a digital cash machine,"" said Crook.  And of course, introducing an ERC-20 equivalent within Corda would presumably mean you could conduct a token sale.  ""Technically you could if you wanted to,"" said Crook, adding that the way this is done in the public arena is not something he's interested in.  However, a token does have some lapel-grabbing possibilities for capital raising within a bank.  For example, the equity and debt trading desks of banks could start to look at the issuance of debt or equity in the form of digital assets.  ""That's not dissimilar to the ICO market, but could bring the ICO market into a very regulated space,"" noted Crook.  ""You now have capabilities to do what you are doing with an ICO – i.e., create digital assets that flow back and forth all over the world with no paperwork and everything else – but you are doing it out of a regulated entity.""  Digital mutuals  One more use case for Cordite tokens that RBS and NatWest are interested in exploring is the concept of what Crook called digital mutuals.  In a recent blog post titled ""The Return of the DAO,"" Crook compared decentralized autonomous organizations to mutuals, member-owned entities whose profits are usually re-invested to help improve the organization. Historical examples include building societies in the U.K. and savings and loans in the U.S., as well as mutual insurance companies.  Cordite, he told CoinDesk, ""can bring membership, proposals and voting and can create mutual societies, to use the legal term, on the blockchain.""  Digital mutuals, in Crook's conception, may require a new form of legal structure in which ownership, management and control become encapsulated in code, while some aspects of the existing rulebook become redundant (annual shareholder meetings, for example, would be unnecessary).  But they may also map directly on to the existing legal structures — co-operative societies, building societies and credit unions to name a few – and regulatory framework, requiring no legislative changes.  And speaking of regulation, it's notable that Crook and his team at RBS were behind a Corda-based mortgage reporting prototype developed in collaboration with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.  Crook hinted that the new bee in his bonnet could get similar regulatory support, saying:  ""The FCA may also be interested in the concept of digital mutuals. But that's another story.""

42429218,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwrbh,1529992821,Exchange Leak Puts $620K-Worth of Customer Crypto at Risk,"A South Korea-based exchange has inadvertently leaked sensitive information about 19 of its users, potentially putting some $620,000 worth of cryptocurrency at risk.  According to a report from CoinDesk Korea , an employee of Bitkoex, an exchange launched in May, posted information on how much of the Karma (KRM) cryptocurrency was held by 19 users on the platform in a social media chat last Friday  The report said the leaked message contained the email addresses associated with the users as well as the wallet addresses and private keys to the KRM token in their accounts, which could allow anyone with the information to access the assets.  The total amount of the token owned by the users worth 750 million won, or around $620,000, the report said.  Following the event, Bitkoex said the employee posted the message by accident and the exchange has moved the exposed assets to a cold wallet, which is not accessible through the internet. As such, the company asserted no assets have been lost.  Yet, this is not the first time that user information had been leaked from a Korean crypto exchange.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the computer of an employee from Bithumb, one of the largest crypto exchanges in South Korea by trading volume, was hacked earlier last year. Information of as many as 30,000 users on the platform was subsequently leaked.  In fact, yesterday's report said the country's Ministry of Science and ICT inspected the information security level of 21 crypto exchanges in South Korea from January to March and confirmed that most companies have security vulnerabilities.

42429233,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLws7h,1529985639,A Long-Secret Bitcoin Key Is About to Be Revealed,"A long-held bitcoin secret is about to be revealed.  No, it's not the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a private key the cryptocurrency's creator entrusted to several bitcoin developers that activates the protocol's so-called ""alert system,"" once used to flash a text warning to those running the software in case something happened that could impact the security of their funds.  If you didn't know bitcoin had a warning system like this, that's because it was retired in 2016 due to security concerns and frequent confusion about its use.  ""The alert system was a frequent source of misunderstanding about the security model and 'effective governance,'"" well-known Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell wrote in a public email from September 2016.  In short, some in the bitcoin community thought it could be used to change that network rules that unite users, which isn't really the case. For example, a BitcoinJ developer once wanted to use the key to control fees, while a Bloq staffer pressed for Bitcoin Core developers to use the key to change the network's mining difficulty.  Plus, developers were worried that if the wrong person got ahold of the key, they could broadcast false messages or potentially cause panic.  As such, to some, the reveal – being undertaken by Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop – is a long time coming.  ""Folks, it's going to be an interesting show,"" Bishop tweeted, followed by a string of tweets cryptographically proving he's in possession of the secret key, without fully revealing it quite yet.  The reveal is the final step to destroying the system. After Bitcoin Core developers released new code in 2016 without the alert system, in January 2017, a ""final alert message"" was broadcast, which – by law of the code – made that message unable to be overridden by any other messages in the future.  Still, the private key needs to be displayed publicly so there's no possibility of reputation attacks against those developers that hold it.  Bishop told CoinDesk he plans to release it soon, though he's not sure about the exact date, adding:  ""It's time. I'm thinking about releasing the private key early July at Building on Bitcoin, though it's not finalized yet.""  Danger for altcoins  Still, it isn't as easy as it sounds.  Revealing the key is potentially dangerous for any cryptocurrencies that used an older version of bitcoin's code to create their cryptocurrency and have not disabled the alert key mechanism in their own code.  ""If the copycats have not disabled the alert system, nor changed the alert key [public key], and if they have not sent what's known as a final alert message, then once the [bitcoin] keys are released, anyone will be able to send alerts on those [other] networks,"" Bishop told CoinDesk.  It's happened before actually. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee recounted on Twitter just last week how the lesser-known Feathercoin protocol (which copied litecoin's code) received litecoin's alert about upgrading to the latest litecoin client.  And while that isn't a particularly nefarious example, Bishop said, controlling what alert messages are sent on various networks ""sounds dangerous.""  As such, in Maxwell's 2016 email, he said he had spent and would continue spending some time searching through other cryptocurrency codebases. If they were found to contain the alert key code from bitcoin, he vowed to notify those projects to remove that code.  Maxwell concluded:  ""At some point after that, I would then plan to disclose this private key in public, eliminating any further potential of reputation attacks and diminishing the risk of misunderstanding the key as some special trusted source of authority.""  Reputation on the line  But, two years later, neither Maxwell – nor any other Bitcoin Core developer - has revealed the key.  ""It's something we have wanted to release for a few years. Nobody took any action, though,"" Bishop said.  But by now, the projects susceptible to this vulnerability have had time to remove the code and upgrade. Although, some of those projects might not have developers anymore, even though users and still trading and using the cryptocurrencies, which could mean there's been no update.  That said, Bishop's giving these projects one last chance by sending messages on Twitter and through other channels.  Adding pressure that could prioritize the reveal, though, is that Bishop and others are worried about attacks on their reputation. For instance, if the private key was compromised and used to sign a message with bad intentions, it could be blamed on one of the Bitcoin Core developers who's known to have the key.  ""Nobody knows the full list of people that have access to the private key. A message could be signed by the private key, and the secrecy is a liability because some of the people who have the key are known in public to have the key,"" Bishop said, pointing to the fact that those with the key that are unknown could blame people who are known to hold the key for nefarious messages.  Bishop recently used the alert key (without revealing it) to sign a simple text message that he then tweeted out, displaying how it could be used to trick users or cause confusion within the community.  Plus, he told CoinDesk, there are other long-standing vulnerabilities within the alert key setup that he plans to disclose when he reveals the key to the public.  As such, Bishop concluded:  ""It would be better if the key was released.""

42429222,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwrjh,1529979018,Secret Service Calls for 'Congressional Attention' on Privacy Cryptos,"An official for the U.S. Secret Service last week called on Congress to weigh potential legislative action on cryptocurrencies that boast privacy-enhancing features.  Speaking before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, Robert Novy, deputy assistant director for the Service's Office of Investigations, stated that ""congressional attention"" on the issue is needed.  ""We should also consider additional legislative or regulatory actions to address potential challenges related to anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies, services intended to obscure transactions on blockchains (i.e. cryptocurrency tumblers or mixers) and cryptocurrency mining pools,"" Novy said, according to published testimonyhttps://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-115-ba01-wstate-rnovy-20180620.pdf.  While Novy didn't mention any specific privacy-focused coins, but U.S. officials have raised concerns in the past. In January of last year, Joseph Battaglia, a special agent working at the FBI's Cyber Division in New York City, cited the cryptocurrency monero as one that has other officials concerned.  Given the slow pace of proceedings in the U.S. national legislature, it's not likely that lawmakers would move toward any concrete steps anytime soon. Even still, Novy asked that they keep the issue in mind moving ahead.  ""As such, continued Congressional attention is warranted to ensure law enforcement agencies maintain lawful access to critical sources of evidence, regardless of where, or in what form, that information is stored,"" he stated.
