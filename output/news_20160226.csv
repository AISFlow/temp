42426661,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvHh,1456522075,Court Documents Show Cryptsy CEO Predicted Exchange Would Fail,"Weeks before disclosing that the digital currency exchange Cryptsy was insolvent, CEO Paul Vernon told a Florida divorce court in a financial affidavit that he expected the operator of the exchange to fail.  The affidavit  was filed on 22nd December – less a month before Cryptsy would go on to claim that it had been the target of a debilitating hack in 2014 that left it insolvent and with millions in customer liabilities.  At the time, Vernon said that the exchange, which largely focused on alternative cryptocurrencies, had been able to stay afloat thanks to fee income, but that profits had dried up, leading to the exchange’s collapse. Activity on Cryptsy remains frozen, with no customer update since 1st February, according to a notice on the exchange’s website.  The affidavit, filed amidst a months-long divorce case, shows that Vernon indicated his belief that Project Investors, the operator of the exchange, would ""dissolve"" in the near future because of a drop in exchange income.  He wrote:  ""Due to downturn in profits, not currently taking a salary. Expect corporation to dissolve due to economic conditions.""  The existence of the affidavit features in an amended complaint filed on 22nd February by two Florida law firms currently pursuing a class action lawsuit against Cryptsy, an action that came after months of customer complaints about withdrawal delays and mounting allegations that the exchange was insolvent or on the verge of collapse.  At the time, the withdrawals and related platform issues were largely blamed on technical problems. Vernon, however, would later tell CoinDesk that the theft was hidden from customers because the exchange ""did not want to cause a panic"".  A major change in the amended complaint is the inclusion of Lorie Ann Nettles, Vernon’s ex-wife, as a defendant. It is alleged that customer funds held by Cryptsy were diverted to pay for personal expenses for Nettles and Vernon, including the purchase of a roughly $1.4m waterfront property in Palm Beach County, Florida.  The filing states:  ""Upon information and belief, the Marital Settlement Agreement which VERNON and NETTLES devised to distribute between them their marital assets was, in whole or in part, a sham and was fabricated by VERNON and NETTLES as a means of unlawfully and improperly transferring to NETTLES many of the assets secreted away from the CRYPTSY customers.""  Attorney David Silver said that his firm has filed a motion to appoint a receiver for Cryptsy, and to date, has been unable to serve Vernon, who told CoinDesk in January that he was traveling in China.  ""A legitimate company would be addressing these issues head-on, and my question is, where is anyone from Cryptsy to address this lawsuit that has been going on for a month now,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Where is Paul Vernon?""  Vernon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42398909,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhICf,1456513717,Brexit Rumors Fail to Boost Market as Bitcoin Price Steady at $420,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  Despite periods of volatility, the global bitcoin market remained calm this week, gaining 1% while fluctuating between $410 and $450.  The digital currency was trading at $423.52 at 00:00 (UTC) on 26th February, up from $421.16 at 00:00 (UTC) on 19th February, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  What may be most notable, however, is the lack of a price increase given potential macro-economic instability in the eurozone.  One geopolitical development that coincided with bitcoin’s price volatility was the possibility of a Brexit, which would see the UK leaving the 28-nation European Union (EU). The event is of interest to traders given bitcoin’s historical response to similar events, rising substantially on the rumored 'Grexit' in 2015 and emerging as an asset class in 2013 given its strong climb in response to economic uncertainties in Cyprus.  Still, there were periods of turbulence in the latest trading cycle.  The currency rose sharply on 20th February, appreciating to $443.02 by 18:00 (UTC), up from $421.33 at 00:00 (UTC) for a more than 5% gain. Bitcoin also climbed the following day, rising from $436.13 at 00:00 (UTC) to $446.74 at 07:00 (UTC). However, by 14:00 (UTC), the digital currency had fallen to $429.99.  This price turbulence continued later in the week, as bitcoin dropped from $423.34 at 00:00 (UTC) on 24th February to $411.77 at 05:00 (UTC). The digital currency quickly recovered from this dip, rising to $424.45 by 15:00 (UTC).  This compared to the seven-day period between 12th February and 19th February, when the digital currency rose from $377.82 to $421.69.  Brexit fails to stir market  While UK citizens have long been skeptical of the EU, the tension surrounding the country’s participation in the political and economic partnership has thus far not been strong enough for the nation to break free.  However, disrest has been growing, and a survey conducted in September showed 43% of participants thought the UK should remain in the EU and 40% believed the nation should leave. A separate poll done in February indicated 38% of respondents wanted to exit the 28-nation partnership, while 37% wanted to stay.  Now, the nation is looking ahead to June 23, when voters will go to the polls and participate in a referendum to decide whether the nation stays in the EU or goes its own way. The anticipation surrounding this event has created significant uncertainty, which may be providing tailwinds for bitcoin prices.  In times of market turmoil, bitcoin frequently enjoys a bump in price, as some consider it a safe haven. While the chance the UK might leave is likely placing upward pressure on the digital currency’s price, a Brexit would probably fuel sharper gains.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of digital currency exchange BitMEX, commented on how this event could affect bitcoin prices, telling CoinDesk:  ""If by June the odds of Brexit occurring are substantial, we could see a Grexit sized pump in the bitcoin price.""  Hard fork uncertainty lingers  Another high-profile matter that is coinciding with bitcoin’s price volatility is ongoing debate on how the bitcoin network should be scaled, which has been creating substantial uncertainty for the digital currency’s future.  Earlier this week  , developers and representatives of the bitcoin industry arrived at an agreement to keep working on Segregated Witness, a proposed change to bitcoin’s code, as a soft fork, with the goal of a hard fork to increase capacity in 2017.  While advocates maintain that the plan would increase the capacity of blocks in the bitcoin network to as much as 4MB, Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin wallet and exchange service Coinbase, has been highly critical of the plan, writing in a blog post that it would not do enough to increase capacity.  Armstrong is one a number of proponents of Bitcoin Classic, a proposal that would attempt to execute a hard fork sooner, a development some fear could split the network, creating two separate classes of tradable bitcoins.  No matter how bitcoin’s stakeholders decide to organize, there will be challenges involved. Currently, the network is highly decentralized, which could be fueling inaction.  Tim Enneking, the chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, spoke to this uncertainty, telling CoinDesk bitcoin is a ""pure democracy"" and predicting that ""the bitcoin community is going to wait until the last minute and then compromise"" on the hard fork.  He stated that market optimism regarding addressing the hard fork helped fuel rising bitcoin prices, but the cause of this improvement was a press release stating the matter would be addressed. Later, the price pulled back 5% because no real progress has been made.  While this volatility may seem undesirable to some, Enneking emphasized that it provides trading opportunities.  Charles L.

42398910,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhIBg,1456506004,Intel is Testing a Blockchain it Built With a Fantasy Sports Game,"IT giant Intel is running an internal blockchain trial centered on a fantasy sports market.  The proof of concept works by enabling the exchange of digitized assets that represent shares of different sports teams. Each contestant is given a set of shares, as well as a quantity of in-game currency called ""mikels"".  Participants can then sell or trade the shares with the league or other players, with buyback offers for shares tied to the number of points scored by teams during games they win. At the end of the trial, the user with the most currency is declared the winner.  The concept was presented earlier this month by Intel during a closed-door meeting for the Hyperledger Project, the Linux Foundation-led open-source blockchain initiative that includes 30 members from major tech institutions, international banks and industry startups.  An Intel representative said during that meeting that the game is currently open to anyone at the Santa Clara-based company for participation, remarking that the company sees the trial as a way to test the strength of its internal blockchain technology.  The representative explained:  ""We’re actually taking that marketplace out and we’re running an internal trial … which is a football exchange, but it will be an NCAA basketball pool kind of game where you exchange shares of teams. Our expectation is that it’s going to give us expectations of real workloads running in the wild in consumer applications.""  Notably, the representative said it’s blockchain is not yet ""production quality"" and that it is currently being optimized for performance.  Though the company has been quiet about its work, Intel’s involvement with bitcoin and blockchain tech is not new, and can be traced back to its work with 21 Inc, the bitcoin startup for which it developed mining chips.  As reported by CoinDesk, staff within Intel had expressed interest in developing mining chips – computer components used to verify bitcoin transactions – for deployment in consumer products, though the status of such efforts is unknown.  When reached for comment, Intel said it is not seeking to provide more details on the trial at this time, stating:  ""Intel explores the potential of new technologies on a regular basis.""  'Complete ledger'  Now, Intel has what it called a ""complete ledger"", though the representative indicated that the current design is subject to change and final approval.  The initiative is said to have grown out of the firm's in-house research efforts, during which time was spent experimenting with consensus algorithms, including bitcoin’s.  During the meeting, Intel's representative offered details on some of the approaches the company has taken in its research and development work, with the rep explaining that its consensus protocol ""looks an awful lot like what’s in use in bitcoin’s blockchain"".  However in Intel’s design, bitcoin’s proof-of-work verification, which finds a decentralized network of computers securing the blockchain with computing power, is replaced a system Intel has dubbed ""proof-of-processor"".  Decentralized markets  Intel is also interested in the various types of blockchain technologies so far developed, with the rep noting that the company sees value in ledgers that do not restrict access to participants as permissioned ledgers do.  ""We at Intel are concerned about usages where, not necessarily cryptocurrency kinds of things, but open market and consumer applications,"" said the rep.  Intel said it experimented with a number of consensus algorithms and variations on features within these designs, and that the company’s researchers have focused on scripting languages, transaction rule-making and APIs.  As for the status of Intel’s blockchain tech, the current implementation is said to be written in Python, a choice made due to the firm’s desire to focus on extensibility and modularity.

42398911,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhIDe,1456494265,ChangeTip Launches ‘Decentralised’ Wallet in Bid for New Bitcoin Users,"Social tipping service ChangeTip has announced a new ""decentralised"" wallet service, citing demand from the bitcoin community.  Called ChangeTip Wallet, the service is said to let customers more easily use the platform's social media integrations to send funds, while allowing users better controls over their account and funds.  For example, users of the wallet will hold their own private keys, and be able to initiate and approve payments using web-based and mobile apps.  ""We’re really excited to launch something that’s pure bitcoin,"" said Nick Sullivan, Founder and CEO of San Francisco-based ChangeCoin – the company behind the ChangeTip platform.  He explained:  “Many in our community like ChangeTip, but shy away from the service because it’s centralized. We talked for a while about creating this product, and ultimately, we decided it was something we really wanted to build.”  ChangeTip Wallet is currently in closed beta and is available by invitation onlyhttps://www.changetip.com/wallet.  Shift from centralisation  Until recently, customers were required to store their funds with ChangeTip to use the service. However, the firm said, bitcoin users have been requesting that the platform move to a more decentralised model.  As a result, the team decided to work on the new ChangeTip wallet, allowing users to manage their own private keys and to more ""fully experience the benefits that bitcoin offers"".  The firm's new product is a ""regular"" bitcoin wallet with ChangeTip services tied in, said Sullivan. ""Your private keys never leave your phone and you can still send tips on Twitter.""  ""Listening to users' feedback and making changes that the majority of your user base wants to see is always a good idea for business,"" he said, adding:  ""We listened to feedback, learned lessons, and now we really want to build and deliver something valuable that people feel good about using.""  Users will enjoy more financial freedom compared with the standard ChangeTip service, the firm said, since account sizes, transaction amounts and user locations are ""unrestricted and unlimited"".  ""Now we are [launching] an API that enables any wallet to pair with ChangeTip and receive payment requests (initiated by you from a social network),"" Sullivan said. ""This will be an open API, so ChangeTip social services can empower other wallets as well.""  The company also explained it is still exploring the feasibility of launching on a Lightning Network payment channel or a sidechain – other technology options that would make its platform less centralized, and that it would ""continue to explore"" these options.  Rekindling growth  Launched in 2013, ChangeTip raised more than $3.5m for its social tipping service on the strength of strong growth in user metrics. However, the company soon found itself embroiled in controversies surrounding its business practices, with community members questioning its use of customer data, reliance on off-blockchain micropayments and ability to restrict user transactions in line with relevant regulations.  Since then, ChangeTip has shown a willingness to experiment with its offerings in an attempt to rekindle the user growth that turned it into one of the industry's hottest startups at the beginning of 2015.  ChangeTip introduced the ability for users to tip US dollars in September of last year, a move that coincided with the launch of Tipworthy, a news aggregator designed to inspire tipping's use case in content monetization.  Earlier this month, it also launched a new product called ChangeTip Contribute that makes it possible for publishers to charge micro-payments for ad-free access to articles and other content.  Reaffirming the firm's belief in the technology, Sullivan said:  ""If you have 200k people sharing bitcoin everyday, that's not just 'good for business', it's good for other people, and, we believe, ultimately good for the world.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group which has an investment stake in ChangeTip.

42398902,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI4n,1456482614,"Bitcoin Has No Leader, and Maybe That's a Good Thing","Brian Hoffman is the CEO of OB1, the startup overseeing development of blockchain-based marketplace project OpenBazaar, and a former lead associate at Booz Allen Hamilton.  In this opinion piece, Hoffman discusses the ongoing debate over how bitcoin should be scaled, and why the network's lack of leadership may be both a blessing and a curse.  It seems fairly obvious that in the world of open-source software development that anyone, anywhere can start reading code and start doing whatever they want with it.  But, where it gets complicated is when that modified code wants to come back into the source repository. When a programmer starts to actually engage the project community with any ideas or code contributions that reaction can range from admiration and acceptance all the way to flat out denigration.  That’s because every project has a certain culture that is created by it's members and cultivated by the project's leader or leaders.  But, what happens if that project has no leader?  An airplane with no pilot surely crashes into the ground or ocean. But open-source projects are not run by machines that simply fail, they are more resilient and, just like a country whose leadership has been forcibly removed, a vacuum is created and a power struggle emerges when there is no one at the top.  Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin and stayed around long enough to ensure it was in good hands and making progress. Or maybe he or she didn't. Maybe they left for other reasons.  Regardless of his or her motivations for moving on, the bitcoin community was left searching for the next Satoshi to tell us exactly what should happen next and we’ve spent the last several years trying to tell each other what Satoshi would do if they were still pulling the strings.  Crowded room  I’m absolutely convinced that part of the issue is that bitcoin as an idea is so revolutionary and controversial that it not only attracts the smartest and the brightest, it also appeals to scam artists, idiots, politicians, economists and anyone with an Internet connection who thinks they have something to say.  But who should control the future of bitcoin? Are we expected to believe that this amazingly diverse set of actors are going to somehow get together at a roundtable or chat room and just come to agreement on every issue?  I would argue it's an approach that's ultimately destined to fail.  We should not be trying to emulate existing development models, because there is no existing model that fits what is happening. There hasn't been a project so large and so important that didn’t have someone or some organization controlling it directly.  I think that we don't need Bitcoin Core Developers; we need Bitcoin core developers.  Everyone from individual users to miners to the core developers themselves need to stop pretending like bitcoin is theirs.  Us versus them  Bitcoin is permissionless so why are we all so obsessed with figuring out who owns it? Why are we giving it to the core developers? Why are we capitulating to the Chinese miners? Why are we getting rattled by uninformed users who couldn’t even read the source code let alone submit a pull request?  The fight between these interest groups has gotten so nasty that when you step back from it for a moment you might ask yourself 'What the fuck did I get myself into?' I don’t blame anyone for walking away shaking their head or whiny rage-quitting, but I also don’t believe that it’s all a lost cause.  [post-quote]  If bitcoin is going to survive then we must not be afraid of the principles that underly open source itself.  The three buttons on GitHub ask us to watch, star or fork the project. It’s that last one that we all want to pontificate on. The nuclear option. Fork… it’s what happens when you’ve finally decided that whomever owns this repository is no longer willing to work with you and you have no other option but to separate.  We shouldn’t be afraid to let our paths diverge.  If we can’t work together and find a way to accommodate new feature requests or modifications then maybe we’re better off with two instead of one. If we can’t find a way to work it out then maybe there is justification for having two separate bitcoins.  For those that say a fork is no longer bitcoin, I’d say you’re both no longer bitcoin. None of you can claim to be the true bitcoin.  That possibility ended when Satoshi stepped away silently. It’s nothing but a white paper now.  If you look at the icons for the Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic Slack groups. You can’t tell the difference because they’re the same. Both groups think they represent the one true bitcoin, but it’s an illusion  It’s two different windows looking out onto the same green fields in crypto world.  Path forward  I think there is a possibility for all those working on bitcoin to get together and fix the problems that threaten to tear us all apart, because they’re mostly human problems.  We constantly get brilliant engineering solutions, but it’s the social problems that hurt us the most.  If we can’t figure out a way to deal with those issues then I’m glad we have multiple teams working on their own vision of bitcoin. I don’t care who you are, how long you’ve contributed, how many lines of code you wrote or who your dad is, you don’t own bitcoin. And neither do I.  In closing I believe there are several guidelines to follow to ensure a promising future for bitcoin:  Don’t be an a******  Don’t be afraid to speak your mind  Don’t let others stifle your innovation or your excitement  Write code  Realize you don’t know everything (no matter who you are)  Use your bitcoin so you understand what it is and what it isn’t  Work together, not against.  If we can make progress on these guidelines and learn to shut out the noise, I know we can prove to the world that bitcoin isn’t just an experiment resigned to failure and plagued with infighting.
