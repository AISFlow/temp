42425901,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Nh,1406066160,Japan's BitFlyer Raises $1.6 Million for Bitcoin Exchange Expansion,"A former Goldman Sachs employee has raised $1.6m in funding to power a new Japan-based bitcoin exchange, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.  Called bitFlyer, the exchange aspires to recapture the market position vacated by Mt. Gox, the Japan-based exchange that was once the ecosystem's largest trading platform. BitFlyer is seeking additional capital from overseas VCs and hopes to launch in markets outside of Japan before 2015, the report says.  The exchange is the brainchild of 38-year-old former derivatives and convertible bonds trader Yuzo Kano, who left his job at Goldman Sachs in December to start his own bitcoin project.  He told the Bloomberg that as a result of the collapse of Mt. Gox he feels an increased pressure to deliver a quality product to market, saying:  ""That’s one less competitor for us, but it also left many Japanese with a very negative impression of bitcoin. We already had a company then and felt it was up to us to rebuild the trust.""  BitFlyer, which has been live since April, is not alone in its desire to attack the now-growing Japanese market. Earlier this month, China-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitOcean announced it would partner with New York-based exchange technology provider Atlas ATS to launch an exchange in the Asian market.  BitFlyer's advantage  Kano told Bloomberg that bitFlyer will act as the counterparty for buyers and sellers, a decision it says will allow it to streamline the way it finalizes transactions.  With that, Kano aims to eliminate complex price-setting mechanisms, thus appearing more consumer friendly. However, he acknowledges the difficulties of the decision, stating:  ""That’s a major advantage we have over other exchanges, but it also means we take on the risk. Controlling that risk is something you can’t do without experience.""  Kano said he launched the venture due to the upside he sees in the bitcoin market, and because of his interest in complex systems.  Japan heats up  Though not as influential a bitcoin market as China, recent news events suggest consumers and government officials in Japan are beginning to become more interested in bitcoin.  Japan announced in May that it would put off regulating bitcoin in order to consider measures that would help digital currency boost the nation's overall economy.  Further, a government-backed industry association, the Japan Authority of Digital Asset (JADA), launched this month with the goal of helping the country's businesses establish their own regulations.

42425896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Hh,1406063751,Israeli Bitcoin Conference Postponed Due to Gaza Crisis,"The Inside Bitcoins conference in Tel Aviv has been postponed due to logistical problems resulting from the ongoing military action in the Gaza Strip between the Israeli military and Hamas.  The postponement stems from the cancelation of international flights to Israel in response to rocket attacks launched against Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv. Due to the international profile of many of the conference’s speakers and attendees, the conference is being moved forward to an as-yet-undisclosed date.  CoinDesk spoke with Alan Meckler, chairman and CEO of Mediabistro Inc, which operates Inside Bitcoins. He said that the military crisis – and concerns that the conference would not function without its global guest list – prompted the delay.  Additionally, Meckler noted the fact that several conference participants are currently on active duty with the Israeli Defense Force during the operation in the Gaza Strip.  Meckler explained:  “We had planned to go ahead with the show while missing some of our partners due to military service. But once the airlines canceled all flights we were faced with losing speakers and paid attendees and exhibitors. We had over 15 exhibitors and sponsors and would have had over 200 paid attendees but for the conflict in Gaza.”  Flights to Tel Aviv called off  Ben Gurion International Airport was forced to close to incoming flights after a rocket struck nearby. The rocket was fired from the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces bombed scores of Hamas targets and left hundreds of people dead or wounded.  Several major US carriers issued temporary flight suspensions, and according to press reports at least one American aircraft had to redirect to another nation after approaching the airport.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a 24-hour ban on flights to Tel Aviv, set to expire at 12.15 pm EST on 23rd July.  In a notice to air carriers in the US, the FFA said that the “hazardous” situation in Tel Aviv had prompted the temporary ban. The agency is expected to update airlines in the next 24 hours on what may lie ahead.  However, the FAA made no indication whether or not it would lift or extend the flight ban after the initial period expires.  Setting the date  According to Meckler, a new date for the Tel Aviv conference has yet to be chosen. However, given the volatile situation in Israel and the Gaza Strip – and throughout the entire region – it remains unclear when the bitcoin gathering will take place.  He went on to suggest that the conference situation is unfortunate, given the diverse set of speakers and the exhibitors set to take the stage in Tel Aviv. Meckler predicted that the conference, whenever it does take place, will still be a success.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as the story develops.

42425890,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh17h,1406052323,WinkDex Bitcoin Price Index Launches Developer API,"UPDATE (22nd July 20:15 BST): The article has been updated with comment from Cameron Winklevoss.      WinkDex, the bitcoin price index created by bitcoin investors and entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has launched a new API for developers.  As first reported by Fortune, the WinkDex API was made available today. The API page on the index’s website outlines key information, as well as suggestions for application development.  Cameron Winklevoss told Fortune that the benefit of the API release would help both the index itself, as well as the broader bitcoin community, saying:  ""We’ve spent a lot of time trying to build a really cool tool. Obviously the index will be big for us because it will be used to price any future ETF. But, we also wanted to build on this for the betterment of the bitcoin community.""  The WinkDex, known formally as the Winklevoss Index, launched in February of this year and compiles price data from a number of key bitcoin exchanges throughout the space. The index will act in conjunction with Winklevoss Capital Management's plan to offer a bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) by providing price information to that investment vehicle.  Building trader tools  The WinkDex aims to provide up-to-date price data that will serve as the foundation for both the proposed bitcoin ETF and other applications of the index.  Winklevoss told Fortune that the API launch opens the doors to unexpected use cases. While suggesting that the primary focus will be the facilitation of price data, it’s very possible that other uses may come into focus, he said, adding:  ""That’s the fun part a little bit, is not knowing what the hell people are going to do on it. It’ll be really interesting to see what people do. And even though ostensibly an API of a pricing product is not super sexy, this matters to the bitcoin community.""  With the bitcoin ETF - which is expected to trade under the ticker symbol ‘COIN’ - still awaiting regulatory approval, the WinkDex API launch suggests that the Winklevosses intend to push the platform beyond price indexing.  Looking ahead, the initiative will see the launch of Android and iOS mobile apps, as well as the expected influx of developer-created apps.  Winklevoss told CoinDesk:  ""Over the next year, we’re going to continue to refine WinkDex for its use as a leading data tool for the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Budding bitcoin magnates  The API launch is one step in a broader move by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Winklevoss Capital Management to stake a serious claim in the digital currency world.  As it stands, the two brothers are visible members of the bitcoin community, having made significant early investments in the currency. The pair plan to speak at the Money2020 2014 conference in November, and appeared in May at a startup trade show in Seoul, South Korea.  No indications have yet been made as to when the ETF may launch.

42425898,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Jh,1406049188,OKCoin Wants to Rule the International Bitcoin Exchange Market,"Changpeng Zhao is chief technology officer at OKCoin, a China-based bitcoin and litecoin exchange that is now seeking to extend its services to the international market.  OKCoin is one of the largest exchanges in the world by exchange volume, according to data from Bitcoinity, and boasts more than 90 employees. The company raised $10m in Series A funding in March as part of a round led by Ceyuan Ventures, Mandra Capital and VenturesLab.  Zhao attended The North American Bitcoin Conference in July, where he introduced his exchange to the international bitcoin audience and announced the launch of the firm's USD and HKD deposits and withdrawals. At the conference, CoinDesk sat down with Zhao for a conversation that aimed to assess why OKCoin believes it will succeed in the international market.  CoinDesk: Earlier this year, you joined OKCoin following a stint at Blockchain and after what had really been a long period of uncertainty in China relating to bitcoin regulation. What made you decide that you wanted to leave what is maybe a more stable market for China?  Changpeng Zhao: Blockchain is a great company, and I think it is a privilege for anyone in the bitcoin ecosystem to be working for that company. But, Blockchain’s core product is not my core strength. I have worked there as a technologist. They have a very simple, very good wallet product, and they have a lot of traction. But, I thought I could leverage my experience more on the financial trading side, this is where most of my experiences are.  OKCoin is the best exchange in the world so I joined them. They also happen to be Chinese, which is coincidental[laughs]. If I felt another company was the best company, I would have come there.  That seems like a strong statement. What is about OKCoin that gives you the confidence to make that claim?  There are more bitcoin exchanges in China than anywhere else in the world. There are about 30 bitcoin exchanges in China and, because there are so many, competition is very fierce. Given that competition, the best rise out. Not only OKCoin, but all the China exchanges have the best customer service.  OKCoin has a 24/7 customer support line you’ll call and find somebody real. You don’t find that on any exchange right now. You don’t find that anywhere else. OKCoin’s technology platform is very, very stable. Some other platforms in China have issues, even as of yesterday, pricing issues.  So, I just really love the team, I met a couple of clients and I was excited.  One of the reasons OKCoin brought you on was to appeal to Wall Street investors by using your experience at Bloomberg – something a lot of exchanges are looking at right now. How do you plan to attack this market?  We are going to make a huge international push, which is going live within the next 24 hours, and we’re going to start accepting USD deposits and USD withdrawals.  The international play is a huge play for OKCoin, but the international site is going to be separate from the Chinese site. They are going to be managed by the same team, but the international site will be geared very heavily to international users. The customer credibility, we need to establish that over time, but I think that’s going to come when you have a superior product.  How will the sites be different? Or, in other words, what's an example of a concept that appeals to western bitcoin users versus Asian bitcoin users?  Western people like clean interfaces, they like the Google-type search bar. Chinese people like a lot of things on one page. How do you combine those two things together? [laughs]  I’m not kidding, the western mentality, when I saw a page like that, I hated it. But, it’s those little things that matter, so we are actually still trying to figure out how to best satisfy both worlds, while not having two separate products.  We may later have different things for different reasons. Chinese people like to buy and sell. Futures is very active in China, whereas options might be very active outside of China. That’s also another reason I joined OKCoin is the complementary skills, we have very different skills. Having a diverse management team on the senior level works quite well.  How much of the market do you anticipate OKCoin will be able to capture? Do you see the current international market as being weak?    We want to take all of it if we can [laughs]. We feel like our product is superior to any other exchange in the world right now, in terms of time for deposits and withdrawals, being able to talk to a real person with customer service.  From a product perspective, we think we are far ahead of any competitor. Nobody has a mobile app where you can trade and view candlesticks. We launched the Android version maybe two to three weeks ago, the iOS version went live two days ago. Nobody has that. We have a PC client that supports multiple screens, so you get a Bloomberg-type experience, nobody has that.  We have algorithmic trading, some people have some of that. Nobody has icebergs. We never have price jumps, random bugs, all that never happens on the exchange. Our product is very stable and its very fast. We're confident our product is superior.  Of course, even if you have a better product, you have to ensure it gets to consumers. Are you looking to move past the PR slip-ups you guys have had in the past?  You're talking about 'The China King of Bitcoin' [laughs]. That release is going to be the last of its kind, it had grammar errors, we laughed at it. Internally, we rationalized it by saying it's publicity, you're creating a buzz.  But, the image that we want to build, and we will build, is that of a professional financial services company. It's not just an Internet company, it's not just a bitcoin company. We are an exchange. By every measure, bitcoins are very valuable. They're worth a lot more than the US dollar right now. So, we are in most respects a financial services company.  We're going to be very serious about that and follow that image. I brought in the PR firm that will help us with that, and we're going to change. That was fun, but that stage is over.  Now, that you're moving internationally, do you plan to engage with US regulators to enter the market?  Sooner or later, we'll have to go through that. We have not started [the process] yet. Even though we're going to accept US dollars, we're going to accept it internationally in other countries, mainly Hong Kong, which is easy from a financial transaction point of view.  We're probably going to attack some of the other markets which are easier than the US first. The US is a big market, but it takes a lot of money and a lot of energy to crack that nut. We're OK to be the second exchange to crack that nut.  When we feel we can navigate that process quickly and without too much trial and error. Even if it's costly, we will go through it. We have money, we can raise more money if we want to. We're OK with someone trying first and us coming later.  Historically, Asian brands have had some issues gaining a foothold in America, but there are some big success stories. Are there any in particular you look to as ones you'd like to emulate?  That's precisely why we picked the OKCoin name. In China, we don't have a Chinese name. Compared to Huobi and BTC China, they are very China specific. We picked OKCoin to be very neutral.  Historically, there hasn't been too many. Well, Samsung and Sony did that really well. A lot of Japanese companies did it really well, but those companies are not doing well at the moment. Sony, Panasonic, all of them did really well in the US.  With bitcoin it helps a lot, since bitcoin is cross border anyway, and the industry is new.  A lot of companies in the US – Coinbase and Circle, for example – are trying to be more than exchanges. Is OKCoin looking to make a similar shift, especially as it enters new markets?  For the moment, we're very focused on the exchange product, and that itself can go really deep. Algorithmic trading is really deep. All these other things, futures, options ... we're really just on the tip of the iceberg. So at the moment, we don't have any time to do things like wallets or payment processors.  We have partners who want to work with us, and we may leverage some of that, but our core focus is on exchange, we're not doing anything. Huobi wants to be the Coinbase of China now. We just want to do exchange products.

42425899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Ph,1406034102,Gliph iOS Messaging App Reinstates Bitcoin Functionality,"Privacy-focused messaging app Gliph once again supports bitcoin functionality in its newest iOS release. The announcement follows Apple's recent reversal of its ban on bitcoin apps, which meant Gliph was forced to disable bitcoin sending late last year.  Now, with its latest version and the revised set of rules from Apple, Gliph is promoting itself as one of the easiest ways to both obtain and use bitcoin, integrating, as it does, two of the industry's most popular wallets: Coinbase and Blockchain.  Gliph  CEO and co-founder Rob Banagale believes the combination of Apple, Coinbase and Blockchain makes his product a powerful app that will help increase the number of transactions in the bitcoin ecosystem, he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Gliph is leading the way in providing solutions to take bitcoin mainstream.""  Building in bitcoin  Gliph is primarily a messaging app. However, unlike other options on the market today, it gives users who have linked bitcoin wallets to their accounts the ability to send bitcoin to one another.  Banagale said he believes Gliph's inclusion of bitcoin functionality provides an effortless way of transacting with the cryptocurrency.  He noted:  ""The other [iOS] apps we’ve seen so far are locally hosted wallets. That’s great for advanced users. But managing your own private key and holding onto your own bitcoin is too overwhelming for most folks.""  Every bitcoin function on Gliph is pulled from either the Coinbase or Blockchain API – including the new QR code-generating feature that has made an appearance in this new release. According to Banagale, this makes Gliph an extremely practical way of sending and receiving bitcoin, removing the need for a wallet app.  However, it is worth noting that two-factor authorisation must be disabled to allow integration with the blockchain wallet, due to limitations of the API.  See an overview of Gliph in the video below:  Gliph Commercial Export 5  from Gliph on Vimeo.  Privacy tool  Gliph's primary purpose is as a privacy-enhancing messaging application. It provides one-to-one capabilities, group messaging and something called 'cloaked email', which allows users to send messages to email recipients without revealing their true identity.  Banagale says that to provide advanced privacy, Gliph only temporarily stores messages on its servers, after which they are deleted.  He pointed out:  ""We offer data impermanence – kind of a hot topic. [Some apps] will say that they are deleting stuff when they aren’t actually deleting stuff.""  Another new feature in the latest version is its optional 'profiles'. The reason Gliph is called Gliph comes from the way it enables a series of symbols - or hieroglyphs - to identify someone, rather than revealing their name.  However, profiles provide the option to offer more identifying information - such as name, email address, phone number, bitcoin address, etc - should a user feel it is desirable to do so. Each item can be made public or private with a quick tap on the screen.  ""We also provide really strong privacy around the personal information that you put in and we’ve included that with profiles. You can more easily identify people using the services – makes it easier than before,"" said Banagale.  Apple appeal  Bitcoin sending and receiving functions included in the iOS version of Gliph were removed in late 2013 at the behest of Apple. Subsequently, a number of other apps ended up being removed from the App Store - including the wallet apps from Coinbase and Blockchain. Some other wallet apps are now starting to return to the online store.  Banagale believes that part of the reason Apple ended up revising its policies towards virtual currencies – which has led to bitcoin-related apps being accepted back into the App Store – is because Gliph appealed Apple's decision to remove bitcoin functionality from its app.  He told CoinDesk:  ""When we were asked to remove the bitcoin sending, I asked for clarification. And the way to do that, I was told, was to write an appeal letter.""  Banagale did that, and he's convinced that this is the reason why Apple eventually acquiesced.  ""I took [the appeal letter] seriously as the only real recourse that we had. When push came to shove, we just were really transparent and offering feedback instead of trying to point fingers,"" he said.  Gliph is currently available for iOS and Android.  iPhone image via Dedi Grigoroiu / Shutterstock.com",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/22/gliph-ios-messaging-app-reinstates-bitcoin-functionality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/878c574a4c52973e8b7fbfedc21e3c2851640286-1300x863.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425895,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Fh,1406030473,The Real Reason Banks Don't Like Bitcoin,"Banks are reluctant to work with bitcoin, that fact has been well known in the community for some time. Until now, though, few concrete reasons have been given as to why.  New statements from a senior banking practitioner in Australia working in anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF), compliance could go some way to providing an explanation.  Banks around the world, particularly in the US, have been closing down accounts of bitcoin startups and even bitcoin-accepting businesses for over a year now. Even those that do work with bitcoin businesses are reluctant to be named in the media.  More conspiratorial theories say bitcoin's destiny is to replace banks, and banks fear the competition. The real answer, however, could be the more mundane one of regulatory risk.  Worldwide regulatory environment  Australia's banking and investment laws are similar to those in other Western, developed economies, so the reasons presented here are likely to be similar around the world.  The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF/GAFI) is an intergovernmental organization started in 1989 by the G7, and now has 34 members plus several regional associates.  Tasked with combating the financing of terrorist organizations, it is a key factor in AML/CTF regulation and policy setting among its members, meaning banks in those countries face similar legislative environments.  A banker gives reasons  The senior banking practitioner, who asked not to be named, attended a recent Bitcoin Professionals meetup in Sydney, organized by lawyer Reuben Bramanathan and entrepreneur Jason Williams of the Bitcoin Association of Australia. The banker explained the following: It is extremely risky and costly for banks to have bitcoin businesses on their books at the moment.  In addition to existing know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, the banker said, banks in Australia have a ""know your customer's customer"" requirement.  New Customer Due Diligence rules, which started 1st June this year, impose a high standard on banks to identify their customers (including the difficult process of identifying beneficial ownership and control) and to maintain ongoing customer due diligence (CDD) and monitoring.  There are additional CDD requirements for accounts concerning ""politically exposed persons"", or individuals with prominent public functions and their associates who may be susceptible to corruption.  Bitcoin and the definition of money  The problems for bitcoin begin with its legal status as 'money' or otherwise.  At present, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act in Australia does not include bitcoin businesses under its 'designated services' category. As a non-national currency, bitcoin would likely be defined as 'e-money' – and this is limited to ""an internet-based electronic means of exchange that is backed by bullion or precious metal and is issued by a government body"".  The current law was written in 2006, before bitcoin had been released.  This limited definition of e-money means there can be no regulatory oversight from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), Australia's primary regulator for AML/CTF issues.  This, in turn, means banks must play the role of regulators themselves, creating an enormous amount of extra work as they monitor and supervise their own due diligence.  More work, higher costs, bigger risks  The anonymous banker explained that extra work creates extra costs and, from a commercial point of view, the profit banks make from businesses does not cover the compliance costs.  Add to that the significant penalties they face if anything goes wrong, the lack of oversight increases risk levels to a point where banks consider it extremely dangerous to have a bitcoin business on their books, unless that business can show it is itself voluntarily compliant with all the AML/CTF rules.  If large banks struggle to deploy these kinds of resources, bitcoin startups will too.  Lawyer and digital currency specialist Amor Sexton told CoinDesk that, given all this, banks take the simpler option of just avoiding bitcoin altogether.  She said:    ""Some, but very few, of the banks, are taking a rational and fair approach by assessing each businesses on a case-by-case basis. Others have decided that it is easier to exit all bitcoin businesses.      This is a very real and urgent concern for the bitcoin industry, as access to banking is an essential requirement for any business.""    The wall facing bitcoin  Banks in smaller countries, like Australia, must also comply with regulations in larger ones if it maintains relationships or has subsidiaries in other countries. Non-US banks must comply with US regulations if they have customers who are US citizens or formal relationships with US businesses, all of which adds another layer of compliance – and its associated costs and risks.  Although these reasons may not come as a surprise to many bitcoiners, especially those from the traditional finance industry, hearing them directly from a banking representative could help startups understand the prevailing attitude.  Bitcoin businesses, still a new phenomenon in the economy, have some way to go to prove their industry is every bit as trustworthy as others, and that will take time as well as campaigning.  In the meantime, industry groups like the Bitcoin Association of Australia and the newly-formed business lobby Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) will be pressing the case locally, sharing their experience with associates worldwide.

42425893,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh19h,1406026133,Hailo CEO: Bitcoin Could Benefit Our Customers and Taxi Drivers,"Taxi app Hailo is “actively” looking into allowing its customers to pay with bitcoin, according to company CEO Jay Bregman.  The company, which lets users hail taxis via its own app, could even allow bitcoin to be sent directly to drivers, he said in an interview with CoinDesk, a move that would set the company apart from other bitcoin-accepting businesses.  To-date most merchants have chosen bitcoin payment solutions that convert bitcoin directly to fiat currency.  “We have [always] sought to find independent ways to provide benefit to our drivers and our passengers. I believe strongly that bitcoin is one of these ways. Absolutely, like many other things, we actively looking into it,” said Bregman.  Payment option  Stressing that his comments were made in a personal capacity, he said that bitcoin could become an optional way of settling your bill with Hailo, but that it wouldn’t replace the current user-authorisation process, which requires a credit or debit card.  “I don't envisage [bitcoin] to be necessarily a primary way of people accessing the service [...] but it would be your optional way of settlement. We would be able to take the money from your bitcoin wallet and transfer it to us, or even the driver directly.”  To set up such a service, he said, Hailo would seek to connect with an existing bitcoin wallet provider instead of hosting wallets itself. The experience would be similar to paying with a credit or debit card, where the bill is settled automatically by pulling money from the customer’s account, said Bregman.  This would require partnership with a bitcoin wallet service that holds their users’ private keys.  Driver boost  A major advantage of accepting bitcoin payments, Bregman said, was the potential to help some drivers avoid remittance fees when sending their income to family or friends abroad.  “Bitcoin could provide benefit to our suppliers as well as our passengers. If you think about the way to do this, you might do it in such a way that you opened up a bitcoin wallet for your driver at the same time as connecting one for your passenger.”  Drivers who then chose to receive bitcoin directly could transfer that bitcoin internationally, virtually for free, or use one of a handful of new bitcoin remittance companies, which convert into local currencies and charge far lower fees than legacy payments companies like Western Union.  “Some of our drivers are spending significant amounts of their income remitting money,” said Bregman. “What if we could help them solve that problem and therefore change their cost structure by 10, 20%, that would be huge. So why wouldn't we? That's the real question.”  Disrupting an industry  As well as fierce competition from rivals like Uber, Hailo has faced opposition from London black cab drivers in recent months. The app, founded by Bregman and two other black cab drivers, previously only allowed users to hail black cabs, but has now extended its service to private hire vehicles also. In May, the company’s offices in London were vandalized.  Bregman rejected the suggestion that bitcoin payments were a distraction when Hailo has more important challenges to address, saying, “I don't think anything that could provide that substantial level of benefit to our drivers alone is a distraction.”  He declined to comment on when Hailo would begin accepting bitcoin payments, but said he wasn’t concerned about beating Uber or Lyft to being the first taxi app to accept bitcoin.  “We roll out things because it's the right time and it's right for our focus on our priorities, not just because we want to beat the other guy.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/22/hailo-ceo-bitcoin-could-benefit-our-customers-and-taxi-drivers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bdcba4ec7a358f603f4c46519545c7e60c01e60-1260x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
