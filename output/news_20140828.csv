42397909,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWqG,1409252410,Simon Fraser First Canadian University to Accept Bitcoin Donations,"Simon Fraser University (SFU) became the first Canadian university to accept bitcoin today, announcing it will now take donations in digital currency.  Founded in 1965, the British Columbia-based university boasts more than 35,000 students, and was recently named as one of the top global universities under 150 years old.  Simon Fraser Bitcoin Club president Mike Yeung, who together with SFU alumnus Scott Nelson provided the first bitcoin donation to the school, explained that bitcoin is a way for the university to bolster its perception as a forward-thinking institution.  Yeung said:  ""SFU is looking to be really innovative and really edgy, and bitcoin is one of those things that is perfect for that.""  Yeung and Nelson, who now serves as chief technology officer at crowdfunding startup dana.io, contributed $6,000 in bitcoin for the new initiative.  SFU students Laurie Macpherson and Lauren Shandley will use the donations for a co-op project to be completed during the upcoming fall term. The students will visia Kolkata, India, where they will work with Destiny Reflection, a non-profit organisation that seeks to provide support for victims of human trafficking.  In conjunction with the announcement, the university has added a ""Donate with Bitcoin"" option to its official donations page. Contributions can also be made through employer matching, recurring monthly gifts and cheques.  SFU will use BitPay as its official bitcoin merchant processing partner.  SFU embraces bitcoin  The news is the latest from SFU, which has been increasingly vocal about its support for bitcoin in recent weeks.  For example, Mark McLaughlin, SFU’s executive director of ancillary services, suggested on 20th August that the university could soon launch a pilot project to use bitcoin in its dining services and incorporate bitcoin ATMs into its bookstores.  McLaughlin told Vancouver-based news source Straight.com:  “It would be about creating somewhat of an ecosystem on our campus. It’s one thing to accept bitcoin. If there were some ATMs around the campuses, at least it’d make it easier for students to obtain bitcoin.”  At the time, McLaughlin suggested the school had ""no plans"" to accept tuition payments.  Bitcoin club influence grows  University groups continue to be an important part of pushing bitcoin use forward, with the MIT Bitcoin Project and College Cryptocurrency Network perhaps providing the most notable success stories to date.  Yeung, who has worked closely with the latter group, founded his school's bitcoin club in early 2013, after two years of mining and researching on his own. However, he says other students and university officials weren't initially enthusiastic about his ideas.  ""When I first started the club, I tried to scour for support from faculty or support from students, and it was really hard to even get 10 people, nobody knew what the heck bitcoin was,"" he said.  Today, the club boasts a mailing list of more than 175 members and holds successful events on a range of topics. For example, the group put on COINFEST 2014 in February of this year, an event featured panel sessions from local industry businesses, including Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum and CoinTrader founder Paul Szczesny.  Humble origins  Yeung told CoinDesk that it was Nelson who first encouraged him to begin bitcoin mining in 2011, and that this hobby later became his obsession.  The business administration major recalls:  ""I spent that entire summer 2011, I had no interest in anything else other than learning about bitcoin, trying to figure out what this thing is.""  Though he did have periods of doubt about the long-term impact of the technology, he said his passion has carried through to his pursuit of higher education, noting that the process helped him persevere through rejections from classmates and university officials. In his spare time, Yeung also serves as the founder and CEO of Saftonhouse Consulting Group, a local bitcoin consulting agency.  Today, Yeung asserts that his intention is to pursue a career in the bitcoin industry, concluding.  ""I'm definitely trying to do this as a career.""

42397914,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWuC,1409250016,What Makes Bitcoin Exchanges Tick?,"Exchanges play a central role in the bitcoin ecosystem. In addition to facilitating trade, they set exchange rates between bitcoin and fiat currencies such as the US dollar or the euro.  Rates can vary widely from exchange to exchange (which is where the arbitrageurs come in) and from minute to minute (where the other traders enter).  By now, long-time bitcoin traders are well acclimatised to this volatile landscape. Take, for example, the wild price swings at the middle of this month. From a high of $596.00 on 8th August, the price tumbled 15% to a low of $503.96 just six days later.  But what makes bitcoin’s price move in the first place?  Intro: the order book  Let’s start by examining the inner workings of a digital currency exchange.  First, there’s the electronic order book, which keeps track of buyers’ and sellers’ interests. At every price level, this book records open 'buy' and 'sell' orders, including their cumulative sizes.  Often you’ll see order books displayed as tables showing open buy orders (known as 'bids') and sell orders (known as 'asks') at price levels below and above the last market price:  The next trade in the example above will execute either at the bid of $96.281 in case of a seller stepping in, or at $98 if a buyer is willing to pay the ask; more on this later.  It's important to note that transactions between sellers and buyers only occur if there are open bid and ask orders at the same price level.  You will never see this happen in an order book though, so there must be a piece missing in the puzzle. To better understand how exchanges really work, we also need to know about two basic types of orders.  Limit orders vs market orders  Orders in the book are all 'limit orders', meaning they will only be executed if anyone is willing to trade at the requested price level.  ""Sell BTC 2.3 at $593.18"" is an example of a limit order asking for $593.18 per 1 BTC. ""Buy BTC 0.32 at $592.03"" would be a limit order bidding for $592.03 per 1 BTC.  On the other hand, 'market orders' are orders without a price tag attached. For this reason they don’t show up in order books. Instead, they are immediately executed at the next best limit order in the book.  Traders who place market orders are eager to have their orders executed ('filled’ in trader jargon) as fast as possible, so the price is secondary.  So, what makes price move?  Let’s assume for a moment that there are no matching limit and market orders at the exchange.  There are a lot of limit orders in the order book – as shown in the example above – but no market orders are triggering any transactions.  Clearly, the order matching engine is out of work. No transactions will take place and the exchange rate will stay at the price of the last transaction in consequence.  This will apply until the exchange receives a new market order, in which case one of two things will happen:    a) If there’s still enough limit order volume at the latest transaction’s price in the order book, the new market order gets filled at the same price as the last transaction again, so bitcoin's price doesn’t change.      b) If there’s not enough order volume to fill the market order, the exchange will fill the rest of it using volume from the next best price level in the order book. In this case, the price changes to the next best price level and – volià – price has just moved.    So, the (very) short answer to the question would therefore be: buyers and sellers placing market orders do move price.

42397919,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWz7,1409240808,Which Nation Will Lead South America's Bitcoin Revolution?,"Many bitcoin proponents share the belief that digital currency and its underlying technology can radically transform how the world transacts.  They believe the technology can remove the restrictions that have long prohibited economic development in emerging markets: high remittance costs, volatile government-issued currencies and capital controls.  One area that has been of particular interest to the community is South America, where supporters say bitcoin can offer real utility to consumers and business owners. Both groups have long sought alternatives to local fiat currencies and better ways to spend money online, given the region's relative lack of bank card penetration.  However, despite the community's hopes that digital currency will thrive in South America, real challenges to bitcoin's long-term success in the region remain.  Furthermore, unlike the US on the global stage, none of the region's 14 member nations have yet emerged as a clear leader in terms of setting official policy and promoting job creation by supporting the industry.  Analyzing adoption  One way to determine the frontrunner in the region's ecosystem would be to assess overall bitcoin adoption, and publicly available data on Bitcoin-QT wallet downloads reveals that Argentina and Brazil have emerged as the clear leaders.    Bitcoin-QT Wallet Downloads in Latin America | Create Infographics    The free wallet has been downloaded nearly 90,000 times in Brazil, where bitcoin penetration is twice as high as in Argentina. Chile, Colombia and Venezuela also show small, but notable, bitcoin user populations.  Although these figures sound impressive, combining recent population estimates together with this data reveals a market penetration rate of less than 1% in both Argentina and Brazil.  However, it's important to take into account that this data does not include all of the many bitcoin wallets available so the currency's overall penetration may be higher.  The case for Brazil  Regardless of the high number of wallet downloads in Brazil, leading bitcoin community members believe that the region's lone Portuguese-speaking nation could be poised to lead the local bitcoin movement, both in terms of adoption and on matters of regulation.  Steven Morell, chief programming officer for Moneero, is one local entrepreneur that sees a bright future for bitcoin in Brazil, although his stealth bitcoin startup is based in Uruguay.  Morell suggested that bitcoin could solve real problems for Brazilians, telling CoinDesk:  ""Brazil has one of the worst situations for people with their money. Brazilians cannot send money abroad without being taxed horrendously.""  Matías Bari, co-founder of Argentina-based bitcoin brokerage SatoshiTango, similarly believes the country's sheer size and economic power will make it a market leader in the region. Although Brazil's forecast for economic growth has seen setbacks in recent months, it remains a regional powerhouse and the seventh-largest global economy.  ""Brazil will have more influence because they are 200 million people and one of the largest economies in the world. Internet penetration and e-commerce volume are growing really fast in this country as well,"" Bari told CoinDesk.  Still, others aren't so certain. In addition to the lack of overall bitcoin news that has emerged from the region, some experts have pointed to the current economic situation in Brazil as cause for concern.  Ana Pereya, who offers financial advisory services for local bitcoin startups through her firm AMP & Associates, for example, cites the influence of the country's traditional financial institutions as a potential roadblock.  She told CoinDesk:  ""Because of the power of the financial entities [in Brazil], I don’t think it will be possible to trade bitcoins unless the banks participate in some way. It is just my feeling from experience. Countries sustained in the exchange control are never safe.""  Argentina's early lead  Although Brazil may be the region's sleeping giant, so far Argentina has been the most prominent country in Latin America within the bitcoin community. This is, in part, due to the number of startups seeking to serve the Argentinian market.  Notable businesses targeting the area include Bitex.la, BitPagos, SatoshiTango and Unisend, though not all are based in Argentina due to concerns about working with local banking partners. For example, Unisend, the region's only order-book exchange, had its accounts closed this July.  Given Argentina's traction, however, a number of experts in the region believe that the country will lead the charge for bitcoin use. Furthermore, many in the industry believe Argentina will have the biggest effect on regional policy.  BitPagos CEO Sebastian Serrano went so far to suggest that Argentina is already serving as a successful model for its neighbours. In particular, he noted how the country's community was able to educate local lawmakers about bitcoin early on, thereby avoiding the kind of restrictive policies passed in Ecuador and Bolivia.  Serrano said:  ""Argentina's central bank didn't ban it because they noticed that the community was big and they got educated from the community.""  Still, there are those who aren't as optimistic. Bitcoin investor and part-time Ecuador resident Paul Buitink suggested that ""things look more grim every day"" in Argentina, citing the issues Unisend reported.  Unlike his peers, Moneero's Morell was emphatically opposed to the idea that Argentina could become the region's digital currency leader.  Calling it ""a crazy idea,"" he told CoinDesk:  ""They're taking away economic freedoms not by the day, but by the hour. They're confiscating accounts and money, they have an artificial exchange rate, it's a highly restricted country.""  Such concerns aside, consumers in the country are turning to bitcoin for economic protections, meaning the people may have the final say on bitcoin's future. On 21st August, the Argentine peso hit a record low against the US dollar, and the currency is devaluing quickly.    Argentine peso drops to new low, -50% since jan 2013: pic.twitter.com/Mm0Prppb47      — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) August 26, 2014      Venezuela's ALBA influence  Although much conversation is centered around the countries that could positively impact Latin America's bitcoin ecosystem, Venezuela is often cited as a force of the opposite effect, influencing countries to adopt bitcoin bans.  Rodrigo Batista, CEO of Brazil-based bitcoin exchange Mercado Bitcoin, noted that Venezuela could greatly influence the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) nations, which include Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and six others.  Batista explained that the cultural and historical differences between these countries and others in Latin America are vast, and that this could have a stifling effect on bitcoin adoption, saying:  ""[ALBA] countries have high level of government intervention in the economy and companies, so they surely feel threaten by bitcoin and any other type of decentralized technology.""  He also pointed to the region's virtual currency, the SUCRE, as evidence of its economic controls. In the late 2000s, the SUCRE was introduced to replace the US dollar as a medium of exchange, and Batista cited it as a contributing factor to bitcoin bans observed in Bolivia and Ecuador.  Given this history, many of the experts CoinDesk spoke to said they believe Venezuela is a country that could soon ban bitcoin, though Argentina, Colombia and Peru were also cited.  Notably, however, the nation received its first exchange, SurBitcoin, earlier this August. The country's central bank has also yet to adopt a formal stance on bitcoin.  Regulation far from certain  Of course, while the local industry speculates about future regulatory decisions, regional central banks have already begun to weigh in on the subject, issuing warnings that echo the sentiment of many other governments around the world.  For example, amid fears that Colombia's central bank would ban bitcoin, the central bank issued a warning against digital currency use. Argentina and Brazil have also issued consumer warnings this year. Bolivia and Ecuador, on the other hand, have moved to ban bitcoin's use entirely.  Serrano noted that Argentina's policy is still in its early stages, and that it remains too early to tell just how the nation's lawmakers will regulate bitcoin. Two more local government organizations are expected to soon issue opinions on the matter that could influence the nation's eventual policy, he said, adding:  ""I don't think they are happy that bitcoin exists. There is going to be regulation but not a complete ban.""  Still, Morell notes the larger issue is that it remains unclear what authority the region's central banks have to ban bitcoin use, suggesting its too early to say whether any country in South America has yet closed the door to bitcoin entirely.  He concluded:  ""The central bank of Bolivia is not a lawmaker. Is their opinion an opinion? Or is this a directive? Does it have the force of a law? I doubt so. Laws are made by lawmakers. Banks sometimes think they are lawmakers, but they are not.""  Additional insight was provided by Bitcoin Colombia's Carlos Mesa, Bitcoin Suramérica's Roman Parra, and Bitex.la's Fran Buero.

The deal means BitPay will provide the company with bitcoin integration for its e-commerce platform, giving merchants that use Demandware’s Link Technology system the capability to accept the digital currency.  Demandware  senior vice president of corporate development Tom Griffin said that the move offers its customers the chance to tap into a young but growing payment method, adding:  “The BitPay integration gives Demandware customers access to another innovative solution to effectively meet evolving consumer demands. With BitPay, our joint customers can offer another payment option to their customers, further enhancing the consumer shopping experience.”  'Simple' bitcoin integration  Demandware’s service is built on the provision of pre-built integrated e-commerce systems, an arrangement that would allow participating merchants the ability to quickly onboard bitcoin payments.  BitPay co-founder and executive chairman Tony Gallippi said the company’s partnership with Demandware puts simple bitcoin integration into the hands of more merchants.  He explained:  “Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for merchants around the world to add bitcoin into their payment systems. Our Link cartridge offers retailers a quick and easy way to accept bitcoin as part of their payment options.”  The move suggests a trend among merchant-facing services providers that have integrated bitcoin. In recent months, companies like Square and Digital River have added support for the digital currency.  About Demandware  Demandware, founded in 2004, focuses on the public enterprise cloud market. The Burlington, Massachusetts-based company posted $36.1m in revenue for the second quarter of 2014, according to recent data published by the company.  The past year has been a period of significant growth for the company. The data shows that as of the end of June, the company increased the number of its merchant clients by 40%. Additionally, the number of websites utilizing Demandware’s service rose 39%, increasing from 667 to 924 sites.  The company has more than 200 enterprise-level customers in its network and derives much of its income from platform subscriptions. Customers include German toy brand Playmobil and famed New York-based food store Zabar’s.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42377567,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727Fp,1409228888,Coinbase Names Aon as its Bitcoin Insurance Broker,"UPDATE (28th August 15:00 BST): CoinDesk has reached out to Coinbase for clarification on whether the company's policy excludes bitcoin held in cold storage (offline wallets).      Coinbase has revealed that its users' online wallets are being insured through top broker Aon.  The news came in a surprise blog post in which the company announced it has been insured against the theft or loss of bitcoin since November 2013, stressing that its users are not being charged for the cover.  The wallet and merchant services provider said it teamed up with Aon, one of the world’s largest insurance brokers, to further protect its users' bitcoin funds.  Aon uses underwriters with high credit ratings, Coinbase explained, such as an Standard & Poor's rating of 'A+' or AM Best rating of 'A XV' or higher.  Protected against theft and hacking  The company said its policy provides sufficient insurance to cover the company's average online holdings at any time and protects against a variety of potential causes of loss:  “Coinbase is insured against theft and hacking in an amount that exceeds the average value of bitcoin we hold in online storage at any given time. The insurance covers losses due to breaches in physical or cyber security, accidental loss, and employee theft.""  There is one significant caveat, however:  ""It doesn’t cover bitcoin lost or stolen as a result of an individual user’s negligence to maintain secure control over their login credentials.”  The policy comes with industry standard policy exclusions that apply to most policies around the world. Additional details are available on the Coinbase FAQ page.  Coinbase vs the competition  Coinbase went on to warn against claims made by some other companies in the bitcoin industry.  The company pointed out that some bitcoin wallets claim to be fully insured, but in reality are not working with accredited carriers or are self-insuring. Others claim to be fully insured currently, but only because they hold very few bitcoins which can be covered by a small policy. Once the operator grows, the cover would not be adequate, Coinbase said.  Although blog post did not specifically name the bitcoin companies in question, there are relatively few operators offering insured bitcoin services.  Elliptic Vault launched in January, with insurance underwritten by Lloyd’s of London. However, the company’s deal with Lloyd’s broke down and it was forced to look for a new insurance company shortly after it launched. It has since made a deal through broker CBC Insurance.  Xapo is another bitcoin company claiming to have insurance cover, stating that all bitcoins in its vaults are covered. However, the company is insured by Bermuda-based Meridian Global Insurance Limited, which is wholly owned by Xapo.  CoinDesk took a closer look at the issue of insurance in a recent feature which examined why insurance companies are reluctant to cover bitcoin operators.

42377570,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX727Jb,1409219268,Should Bitcoin Groups Be More Transparent?,"How much transparency should bitcoin users demand from their local representative groups' decision-making processes, and how far should those groups go to win and maintain their members' trust?  The Israeli Bitcoin Association (IBA) says it has a model it would like to see spread around the world, in which board meetings are completely open and published for all to see.  The IBA says it's the best way to ensure decisions are made in the best interest of its members, and bitcoin itself. But it's a controversial move that others aren't rushing to embrace.  Critics say it could prevent participants from speaking openly and honestly, or reveal sensitive or confidential information about individual business concerns.  At the very least, the Israeli group would like to stir some debate among bitcoin advocacy groups over standards of openness, even if their own radical example isn't followed.  Proliferation of bitcoin organizations  There are now numerous local not-for-profit bitcoin advocacy groups worldwide, with new ones appearing every month. At least seven have official affiliations with the original Bitcoin Foundation, while the Global Bitcoin Alliance lists 19 member groups on its site.  There are countless other groups ranging from independent officially registered organizations representing whole countries and continents, to physical 'embassies' and interest groups gathering via meetup.com or social networks.  As well as coordinating outreach and educational campaigns, the major groups are expected to lobby and liaise with local regulatory authorities and step in when actions of members, individuals or others might adversely affect bitcoin's image.  Transparency showcase  However, transparency of bitcoin groups has not always been a high priority, something that has brought occasional criticism from the community. Meetings are often held behind closed doors, with the publishing of minutes being a route that not all follow.  The IBA however, video records its meetings in their entirety, after which it posts the results on its public YouTube channel. That way there can be little confusion about what the body stands for or its motives.  See the video of the first recorded meeting below (in Hebrew):  IBA chairman Meni Rosenfeld and board member Ron Gross spoke to CoinDesk about the initiative. According to Gross, public openness has been one of the organization's promises right from the beginning.  He said:  ""The point is to showcase this as an example of transparency, how these organizations run themselves.""  The IBA has always published notes immediately after board meetings. While the meetings were initially held in private offices, after the founding of the Bitcoin Embassy in Tel Aviv, the group decided to conduct the meetings there and also allowed guests to listen in.  ""Pretty much anyone who walked in the door could listen to the meetings. So the next step for us was to videotape and release the meetings.""  'Nothing to hide'  The original plan was to conduct discussions off-camera for one hour, and then record the decisions. In the end, however, the IBA decided to just video and release the entire meeting.  The IBA also recorded two more board meetings. While the videos are over an hour long and have only been viewed about a hundred times each, Gross said the actual content of the meetings was less important than the act of recording them.  He added:  ""Basically, it's saying that we're all here, we're all present, we have nothing to hide.""  The group's finances are also an open book, which was again part of the original plan but needed to be cleared with the IBA's accountants first. It includes a complete (English language) live report of revenues and expenses, at a per-transaction level of detail, including employee salaries.  Shift in balance  Not all board members thought the video idea was a good one, and Gross said it took the IBA a while to get to the position where it recorded everything.  Objections included the fact that some discussions are just easier when specific people are not held acountable for every detail of everything they say. Objectors wanted to create an environment where confidential information could be more easily shared.  For that, though, Gross continued, there were other more confidential communications channels outside of meetings that could be employed when appropriate. As it turned out, though, almost all the group's communications have been out in the open.    ""We're still getting used to the format – it's not easy having everything you do and say being made public on such short notice, and sometimes there are slip-ups. We do reserve the right to censor the video after, but we haven't had to use it yet.      ""There was a shift in balance between 'everything is confidential, except what we choose to make public', to 'everything is public, except what we choose to make confidential.' The defaults really matter.""    The Bitcoin Foundation  Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director Jon Matonis said video-recording meetings ""is a great idea for the IBA"".  The Bitcoin Foundation, he said, also recorded its own annual meeting in Amsterdam in May. While live recordings currently aren't planned for regular board meetings, the board already produces transcripts.  In the spirit of transparency, Matonis continued, the Bitcoin Foundation board voted late last year to make its member-only forums open and readable by the general public.  Open-door policies  Richard Kohl is a board member of the Netherlands Bitcoin Foundation, which is formally affiliated with the international Bitcoin Foundation and also a member of the Global Bitcoin Alliance. The group organizes 'Bitcoin Wednesday' meetings on the first Wednesday of every month, which are open to the public.  Kohl told CoinDesk that one of the central goals of Bitcoin Wednesday is to bring the community together to raise awareness, and encourage free debate from all sides on all developments related to cryptocurrency.  An open door policy really helps, he added. National journalists, policymakers, and representatives of the city's economic board have already attended.  ""We've experimented with audio and video coverage, and plan to shift to live streaming of every event just as soon as we have enough volunteers and sponsors. Members of all bitcoin foundations and associations are invited to speak and conduct their business here live and in front of the camera, so this is a trend we'd definitely like to encourage.""  Why the need for transparency?  For all the talk of decentralization and cryptographic proof replacing the need to trust humans, whether as individuals or in organisations, the fact remains that many key decisions affecting bitcoin's future rest with small handfuls of influential and technically capable people, whose integrity is relied upon.  Endorsements and recommendations coming from certain names who have worked hard to build a reputation still carry far more weight than those of outsiders or newcomers. Furthermore, perceived misdeeds by senior organization members may attract unwanted attention for the organisation or even bitcoin itself from the mainstream media.  CoinDesk also contacted a number of other advocacy groups internationally who declined to comment on this issue.

Scheduled to take place on 14th March, 2015, The Bit Drop will feature an island-wide party boasting 'celebrities, musicians and supporters of bitcoin', as well as education booths and free giveaways. The event will also coincide with Pi Day, an annual celebration of the mathematical constant π (pi).  Speaking to CoinDesk, project manager Sarah Blincoe suggested the ambitious project started with a simple question: how do you get bitcoin into the hands of as many people as possible? From there, she explained, a plan was launched to distribute an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to island residents via text messaging.  While the event has serious goals, Blincoe said the group decided to adopt a lighthearted tone for the project, adding:  ""Who doesn't like a party? No one in the Caribbean, that is for sure.""  Project partners include bitcoin wallet and merchant processing provider Coinapult, international non-profit the College Cryptocurrency Network, women's industry group Bitcoin Beauties and bitcoin-friendly insurance provider Aspen Assurance.  The 'perfect location'  Dominica, with its relatively small population and gross domestic product (GDP), proved an ideal location for the event, according to Blincoe.  The country's high mobile penetration rates, however, may have been the most compelling factor. Blincoe believes Dominica's smartphone users will be able to solve real-world problems using bitcoin, adding:  ""The island has opportunities for remittance due to many islanders moving for work to [other] islands, as well as the local medical university with students from around the globe. Dominica citizens also face currency exchange issues when traveling to nearby islands.""  Data from Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL), a regulatory body overseeing telecommunications in Dominica, bolsters this claim, suggesting there were roughly 100,000 mobile subscriptions active in the country in 2012. Additionally, bitcoin penetration is comparatively low in Dominica.  There, the official Bitcoin-Qt wallet has only been downloaded roughly 160 times, suggesting bitcoin use is not widespread.  Island-wide support  Notably, this is not the first time that a group has sought to spread bitcoin use by targeting residents in a specific country with free digital currency. Iceland's auroracoin project, for example, similarly sought to distribute a new digital currency to each one of the country's citizens.  Though that project was ultimately stymied by speculators, The Bit Drop could yield different results in that it will be using an already popular and comparatively stable currency. Further, Blincoe notes that the local government has given the project its full support.  Describing feedback from the government as ""highly positive"", Blincoe added:  ""The young forward-thinking administration sees the long-term benefits in the block-chain technology and is eager to support our project in any way possible.""  Two of the country's five telecommunications providers will also be providing their support for the bitcoin distribution, Blincoe noted.  Lasting impact  Blincoe indicated that The Bit Drop project plans to extend its support to Dominica even after the festivities next March. In particular, she said it will provide bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) systems to merchants and install bitcoin ATMs on the island.  Jeremy Gardner, executive director of College Cryptocurrency Network, said his group will also seek to foster a lasting home for bitcoin in Dominica, saying:  ""We will be providing the educational materials and resources necessary to educate the people of Dominica about bitcoin, and hopefully, as a result, leave a lasting economic and social impact on the island.""  Gardner added that College Cryptocurrency Network intends to start a bitcoin club at the island's state university, and that CCN members will visit the country to help educate local bitcoin users.  He concluded:  ""I expect lasting relationships to be spawned from this undertaking and can only imagine the scope of our impact will broaden as time goes on and we become more involved.""
