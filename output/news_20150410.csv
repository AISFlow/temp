42426329,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPrh,1428682213,State of Bitcoin Q1 2015: Record Investment Buoys Ecosystem,"CoinDesk    CoinDesk is pleased to announce the latest quarterly State of Bitcoin report, sponsored by Gem.co, a bitcoin platform for developers.  This article runs through some key findings from the new report, which focuses on events in the bitcoin ecosystem since the beginning of 2015.  All-time bitcoin startup VC investment reaches $676m  The first quarter of 2015 saw a record-breaking amount of venture capital invested in bitcoin startups: $229m.  Q1's deal activity was led by 21 Inc and Coinbase, companies that received $116m and $75m respectively. These are the two largest bitcoin investment rounds made to date.  With a funding total of $121m, 21 Inc has now surpassed Coinbase as the best-capitalized startup in bitcoin. However, very little information is available about the firm beyond its confirmation that it meets the definition of a 'universal' bitcoin company* (Slide 27).  Since 2012, a total of $676m (Slide 29) has been invested in bitcoin startups, with a 51% increase from the end of 2014.  The number of countries that received VC investment also grew from 18 to 22 in the first quarter of 2015.  The four new countries are Barbados, France, Kenya and Switzerland. Remittance platform BitPesa also became the first bitcoin startup based in Africa to receive VC funding.  Since the start of our State of Bitcoin reports, we have aimed to quantify the well-worn statement that 'bitcoin is like the the early Internet' by comparing levels of VC interest between the two.  Our last report indicated that total VC investment for bitcoin companies in 2014 well exceeded the $250m invested in first-sequence Internet startups in 1995.  Looking ahead (Slide 30), this year’s total VC investment in bitcoin startups is currently projected to surpass the $638m invested in first-sequence Internet startups in 1996.  Bitcoin's price stabilizes after rocky start  Overall, the bitcoin ecosystem showed robust growth in the start of 2015, despite the price plunge in the first half of January. Bitcoin’s price surprised many by breaking below $200, considered to be an important psychological marker.  On 14th January, the CoinDesk BPI dropped to $177, and is down 24% in 2015 (Slide 11).  Although bitcoin saw a significant decline at the start of 2015, its price has since stabilized around $250. In turn, the upward trend in monthly trading volume has not been negatively impacted by bitcoin's price decline (Slide 12).  This could be a reflection of expanded opportunities to trade on both bitcoin's upward and downward volatility.  Bitcoin's price action appears to be attracting less attention. For example, the number of price-related stories in the 10 most popular articles on CoinDesk has dropped significantly, from seven in Q3 2014 to only two in this quarter (Slide 21).  Bitcoin struggles to gain mainstream consumer traction  The rate of growth in the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants continued to taper off this quarter (Slide 47). Discussions around the slowdown of merchant adoption suggest the fundamental problem is not a lack of merchant interest in bitcoin, but rather the lack of consumer adoption.  There were 1 million new bitcoin wallets created in Q1, representing 14% growth quarter-over-quarter. The total number of Blockchain wallets passed three million in February.  The pace of wallet growth is almost constant over the past year, leading to some concern about the credibility of these numbers and questions about how many wallets are actively used for bona fide transactions.  CoinDesk is forecasting 12 million total bitcoin wallets by the end of 2015 (Slide 53).  Technology  The technology underpinning bitcoin is beginning to be deployed in many non-currency applications like property rights, smart contracts, notary services and voting.  Companies both in and outside these industries are seeking to understand how the properties of the blockchain could help reshape these services and improve efficiency (Slide 61).  A new update to Bitcoin Core Protocol was successfully released this quarter with new efficiency-enhancing features, such as a consensus library and headers-first syncing (Slide 72).  Positive signs from Wall Street and regulators  Wall Street's interest in bitcoin expanded this quarter as more financial services executives moved to bitcoin startups (Slide 77).  Leading financial institutes like Citi and UBS are also starting programmes to explore the use of blockchain technology. These developments may have bitcoin companies secure partnerships with traditional finance.  The latest revision to the New York BitLicense regulations was released this February (Slide 80). While there were some positive developments, some of the requirements are still being viewed as ‘redundant and duplicative’.  The UK Treasury also announced a new cryptocurrency regulatory framework this quarter. The proposal is generally being viewed as positive and in-line with the UK's hallmark ‘light touch' approach to financial regulation.

42426319,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPXh,1428673358,Secretive Startup 21 to Sponsor Silicon Valley Bitcoin Job Fair,"Secretive bitcoin startup 21 Inc has announced it will be the lead sponsor for the upcoming Bitcoin Job Fair, taking place in Sunnyvale, California, on 18th April.  With the move, 21 joins a string of frequent industry event sponsors including BitPay, BitGo, ChangeTip and ShapeShift, which will support the annual event, produced by FinTech accelerator Plug and Play Tech Center and digital currency job posting resource Coinality.  Plug and Play director Scott Robinson indicated that he expects this year’s Bitcoin Job Fair to attract a similar audience to last year’s event, which saw participation from approximately 30 startups and 400 attendees.  Robinson suggested that this year’s iteration of the Bitcoin Job Fair, however, will likely reflect recent changes in the space, with more jobs emanating from a smaller group of well-capitalized industry participants.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Last year, there was a larger emphasis on engineers and developers, I think this year it has widened. You see a lot more marketing and business development opportunities, because they can afford to pay somebody with those responsibilities.”  After first raising $5m in 2013 as a bitcoin mining firm, 21 Inc reemerged this March, revealing it had raised $116m over the course of its absence from the industry's spotlight.  Asked for comment about its first high-profile public sponsorship, a representative for 21 revealed that the reason for the move is an unsurprising one, stating only: “We’re hiring.”  The event will be free for job seekers. Additional companies with an on-site presence will include 37coins, Airbitz, Bitwage, Blockcypher, Ciphrex, Coinbeyond, Mirror, Pavilion and Purse.io.  The Wall Street Journal’s Michael J Casey and Paul Vigna, authors of ""The Age of Cryptocurrency"", will also headline a panel.  Industry consolidation  In an interview, Coinality CEO Daniel Roseman echoed Robinson's forecasts for the event, noting that the larger VC rounds, such as those recently closed by 21 and Coinbase, are impacting the hiring market.  “Last year, there were more venture capital investments in different companies rather than massive rounds. Obviously jobs come from those VC rounds,” Roseman stated, adding that legal and compliance are now areas of focus for more mature startups.  Still, this expansion hasn’t come without a contraction for earlier stage startups, according to Robinson, who added that he believes the space has matured to a point where the “winners” in the bitcoin space are now being decided.  “We saw the Coinsetter acquisition of CAVirtex, we saw Buttercoin shutter its doors. What’s really happening is the winners are sticking around and buying other teams that are losing,"" he said, adding:  ""We’re starting to see the main players of the space, at least those that will be for the near future.""  Outside interest  Despite a contracting market within the industry, Robinson hinted that interest in bitcoin jobs is expanding.  Citing recent announcements by companies such as Intel and IBM, Robinson suggested he had been contacted by mainstream companies that are seeking to better understand the technology.  Though the presence of such names won’t be visible at the event, Robinson said “major financial entities” were inquiring about the job fair, a development further spurred by the recent wave of former Wall Street employees associating themselves with the space.  “We’re watching great talent be plucked away from financial institutions, and they bring with them that validation from experience at mainstream positions,” Robinson added.  Campus involvment  Yet another key member of the event will be the College Cryptocurrency Network (CCN), which will host a 72-hour hackathon in conjunction with the event. Sponsored by BitGo, ChangeTip and ShapeShift, the event aims to expose younger developers to the APIs of the sponsors, and by extension, bitcoin itself.  CCN’s Max Wilson, who operates the network’s Berkeley chapter, expressed his hope that the event will draw the interest of those with a more general tech background.  “Our target for this is people who know nothing about bitcoin at all, to bring these people to Plug and Play, give them a quick bitcoin 101, introduce them to the APIs and then have them go from there,” Wilson said.  Wilson said he hopes to build off the momentum of the group itself, which launched in September comprised mostly of grad students, but that now is predominately attended by younger members.  Wilson also spoke to the intended scope of the event, concluding:  “This isn't just finding the next app, this is the intersection of technology, politics, finance and everything else.”  Job search image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/10/secretive-startup-21-to-sponsor-silicon-valley-bitcoin-job-fair,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecf530ddb2db69dea80c54ed33f34cf63f95759c-1246x605.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426325,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPfh,1428664475,JPMorgan CEO: We Can Learn From Technologies Like Bitcoin,"Jamie Dimon, chairman and president of JP Morgan Chase, says his bank can learn from disruptive payment systems like bitcoin.  Dimon, famously dismissive of the digital currency, made the commentshttp://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ONE/15660259x0x820077/8af78e45-1d81-4363-931c-439d04312ebc/JPMC-AR2014-LetterToShareholders.pdf in his annual letter to JP Morgan shareholders, noting:  ""You all have read about bitcoin, merchants building their own networks, PayPal and PayPal look-alikes. Payments are a critical business for us – and we are quite good at it. But there is much for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques and a reduction of costs and 'pain points' for customers.""  The letter, which flagged the bank's recent ""record results"" and incoming competition in the payments space, suggested JP Morgan would seek to monitor these competitors – and outpace them.  ""We need to acknowledge our own flaws ... Rest assured, we analyse all of our competitors in excruciating detail – so we can learn what they are doing and develop our own strategies accordingly.""  Bitcoin on the radar  The CEO has made headlines with his remarks on bitcoin's disruptive potential before.  Speaking on a panel at the Institute of International Finance's annual conference in 2013, he said: ""Bitcoin developers are going to try and eat our lunch and that's fine,"" adding, ""that's called competition and we will be competing"".  During an interview with CNBC reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin, Dimon also stated that the digital currency was ""a terrible store of value. It could be replicated over and over"".  He also expressed scepticism that the digital currency could face up to regulatory scrutiny, stating:  ""It doesn't have the standing of a government. And honestly, a lot of it — what I've read from you guys [CNBC] — is being used from illicit purposes. And people who will get upset with it is governments. Governments put a huge amount of pressure on banks: know who your client is, did you do real reviews of that. Obviously, it's almost impossible to do with something like that.""  Traditional financial institutions have been paying increasing attention to developments in the bitcoin space. In turn, a flurry of Wall Street execs – including ex-JP Morgan employees – are now jumping ship to bitcoin startups.  Last month saw the departure of ex-JP Morgan Chase executive Blythe Masters to join bitcoin trading platform Digital Assets Holdings LLC as its chief executive. A former JP Morgan commodities trader, Daniel Masters, set up the first regulated bitcoin fund, GABI, in Jersey last year.
