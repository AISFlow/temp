42397341,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfN0,1388077227,Indian Bitcoin Exchanges Suspend Operations Following RBI Warning,"Several Indian bitcoin exchanges have pulled the plug and halted trading following a statement issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday.  The RBI warning advised consumers and investors to steer clear of bitcoin, citing numerous risks associated with digital currencies. The list of concerns outlined by the RBI was more or less standard – lack of regulation, security issues, rampant speculation and volatility. The RBI also pointed out that Indian bitcoin exchanges are operating without regulatory approval, which is hardly surprising given the fact that India does not have a regulatory framework that would encompass digital currencies.  Services suspended temporarily or indefinitely  Just two days later several bitcoin operators in India chose to play it safe. They suspended trading, either temporarily or indefinitely. Bitcoin trading platform INRBTC said it was suspending services indefinitely in light of RBI’s warning. It pointed out that RBI’s warning states parties involved in digital currency transactions could be subject to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering legislation and counter-terrorism laws.  INRBTC said:    ""The only option left now is suspend the services until further arrangements can be made,"" INRBTC said, while adding that all trades which have been executed till December 26, 2013 will be processed completely.      All pending orders will be cancelled and the deposits on those orders will be refunded 100 per cent to the users.”    Another operator, buysellbitco.in, informed investors that it is suspending buy and sell operations until it can outline a clearer framework with which to work.  “This is being done to protect the interest of our customers and in no way is a reflection of bitcoin’s true potential or price,” buysellbitco.in said in a statement posted on its website.  The Hindu  reports that many other bitcoin services in India have gone down. Some of their websites appear to be gone, too. However, other operators are carrying on and they are still offering rupee to bitcoin services.  Limitations  In its statement of 24th December, the RBI said it is examining issues associated with digital currencies, namely trading, holding and use of digital currencies in India. However, the RBI is limited by existing legislation and since there is no indication that India will enact any new digital currency regulations, it is unclear what the RBI can do.  Essentially if the RBI chooses to apply India’s existing regulatory framework to bitcoin, that may entail the use of standard foreign exchange regulations. This might force bitcoin exchanges to start operating in much the same way as traditional currency exchanges, but there is a problem. The average bureau de change deals only in national currencies, backed by central banks, using spot prices derived from large interbank transactions. It would be extremely difficult to apply regulations crafted for traditional currency exchanges to digital currencies like bitcoin and it might even be impossible altogether.  The RBI is examining India’s payment system laws, too. It is obvious that it will face similar challenges if it tries to apply existing payment laws. The vast majority of international transactions are handled by banks and they rely on SWIFT standards. Legislation tends to reflect this fact and legislation in this heavily regulated industry is not what we would call flexible when it comes to international standards.  What next?  At this point it is hard to say whether Indian exchanges that have decided to suspend trading will find a way of getting back into the game. Furthermore it is unclear whether the exchanges that are still working will stay open. Although the RBI said it is looking into the matter, the fact that India does not have digital currency legislation remains a problem, especially if existing legislation is not practically applicable to digital currencies.  These events will undoubtedly create even more volatility and uncertainty, especially in light of China’s clampdown earlier this month. It remains to be seen whether the RBI and the Indian Ministry of Finance will push lawmakers to enact viable digital currency legislation.  As we reported earlier this month, India has a few region-specific concerns that it would like to address, namely e-ponzi schemes and multi-level marketing schemes involving bitcoin. Using unregulated digital currencies for such activities might make it extremely difficult to prosecute or even identify the culprits.  If plenty of people fall victim to such schemes, they might have quite a few questions for regulators and lawmakers, provided digital currencies remain unregulated. The potential political fallout of doing nothing might be embarrassing and too much to stomach for many lawmakers.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/26/indian-bitcoin-exchanges-suspend-operations-following-rbi-warning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cf523563eed6adda2c97976c5dbc1d10de90125-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397340,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfM1,1388062507,Poker Champion Launches Real-life Bitcoin Scavenger Hunt,"Mauro Velazquez, a former professional poker player, is planning to use his winnings to develop a new game that will allow players to collect bitcoin from real-world locations.  The game, Coinding, is designed to be virtual scavenger hunt (much like Geocaching) with players finding and collecting bitcoin from locations around the world. Players will be able to retrieve bitcoin deposited on the streets by the game's developers, or collect them by completing challenges. Mauro Velazquez, Coinding's Argentinean founder, said:  ""We're leveraging the ability to give away fractions of bitcoins so that more people can get into the bitcoin economy before going through the barrier of actually risking money to buy them.""  Velazquez said he had a team of eight working on the game, which is scheduled for release in three months. It will be available on iOS and Android.  Coinding is scheduled to enter a closed testing phase in three weeks, Velazquez said. Currently, users can join the startup's mailing list and place bitcoin in locations of their choice. The game will be rely on CoinMap to supply its information. CoinMap is a popular open-source map of real-world locations that accept bitcoin.  According to Velazquez, Coinding's stash of bitcoin will come from a variety of sources, including contributions from the developers and businesses who want to attract bitcoin users to their establishments.  Coinding is unusual, as it's a bitcoin startup that isn't directly involved in the storage, production or distribution of bitcoin. Velazquez said:  ""All of that is necessary, but there is now a need for second-level startups that take advantage of the benefits that these core businesses are providing.""  A lucky hand  Velazquez was working on Battlepro, a company combining games and money, when he discovered bitcoin. Battlepro, which was still being tested, was designed to let professional video gamers compete for money. It was touted as a ""universal skill-based betting site"".  However, two months ago, Velazquez learned about bitcoin from Wences Casares, the chief executive of Lemon Wallet, a mobile digital wallet app.  ""We started getting more and more involved in the bitcoin world and seeing how it could change how almost everything works,"" Velazquez said.  Velazquez decided to abandon Battlepro and focus his team's efforts on a bitcoin-related product, which became Coinding. He said his team is currently funded by his winnings from playing online poker professionally for two years.  He claims he made $250,000 over the course of his poker career. After leaving online poker, he coached several players.  Coinding appears to have received a relatively positive reception from reddit's bitcoin community so far. A thread started by Velazquez attracted comments like this one, for example:  ""I really like this idea. Better ways to get bitcoin into the hands of first-time users are needed. This looks like a fun way to do it.""  Velazquez said that linking games to money set up an ""interesting dynamic"" that could get players more deeply involved.  ""I don't think profit needs to be linked to playing games … but people always get more excited when there's something at stake,"" he said.  Bitcoin gambling  Game developers have been taking to bitcoin in a big way recently, often with gambling thrown in the mix.  German game developer Bigpoint allowed users to buy in-game virtual goods with bitcoins in September. Bitchicken and Coinbomb are two casual games that let players wager bitcoin in tests of mathematical ability and trading ability.  Leetcoin  is a service that lets players on Steam, the digital game distribution platform, win bitcoin for achieving kills in Counterstrike and other games.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/12/26/poker-champion-launches-real-life-bitcoin-scavenger-hunt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b96e0f39e256193e021acbbc555becc964bd659-1241x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397338,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfK3,1388053227,BitHub Pays Open-Source Developers in Bitcoin,"Privacy software provider WhisperSystems has announced that it is integrating bitcoin with open-source code hosting site GitHub to launch a new service, Bithub. This service will offer the company's developers an easy and fair way to fund their work on its open-source security systems.  WhisperSystems  runs multiple free encryption applications for storage, messaging and calls on both Apple and Android platforms. Once such application, TextSecure, replaces a device's default messaging service so that SMS messages sent and received by the user are encrypted.  All the company's applications are created via open-source repositories – meaning that their code is public, and belongs to everyone and no one at once. Consequently, the security of WhisperSystems' applications can be verified by anyone at any time, and users are not charged for downloads, nor will they ever be.  Because open-source projects often rival bigger corporate efforts (and are free to use), those who are interested in using the final products must fund them themselves.  Allocating and tracking funds  In the past, WhisperSystems has had great difficulty tracking exactly who was working on what. Thus, money donated to the TextSecure project, for example, could be allocated to a developer working on RedPhone instead. BitHub is the solution to this discrepancy.  Bitcoin donations made through BitHub are collected and held in one large fund, which is then divided up and allocated to those who commit to working on a specific application.  WhisperSystems has set up five repositories on BitHub which reflect the various projects currently underway: Android RedPhone, Android TextSecure, TextSecure Server, iOS TextSecure and BitHub.  This system allows for donations to be assigned to a specific project more easily. For instance, a developer who completes work on RedPhone will receive a portion of the project's large fund of donated bitcoin.  Transparency  WhisperSystems has also taken steps to ensure all their activities remain transparent. Donators are able to see how their donations are being utilized, as the resource allocations are clearly displayed on BitHub.  In addition, the organization is currently working on a feature which will allow donations to be given to specific issues faced when building each application.  GitHub has a webpage for each project where developers can post questions, comments, and issues they are facing and interact with other coders to help solve these problems.

42425229,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUXh,1388037909,5 of the Biggest Bitcoin Startup Investments of 2013,"As increased exposure hits bitcoin in the form of mainstream attention, the more interest in its business potential.  As a result, 2013 was by far the biggest year for venture capital funding in the bitcoin space. And while some have proclaimed that next year will be even bigger, this past one has been pretty heady.  Let’s take a look at five of the biggest bitcoin venture capital deals of 2013.  5. itBit  Total VC to Date: $3.25m  Major Investors: Canaan Partners, RRE Ventures, Liberty City Ventures  Access to bitcoin in the form of an investment-grade trading platform still eludes the virtual currency. Singapore-based itBit plans to change that by bringing NASDAQ’s stock trading exchange to bitcoin. The company’s recent funding of $3.25m from a number of VC firms should help it to do that.    The company also plans to apply for regulatory approval in all fifty states, likely to be an expensive proposition. itBit CEO Rich Teo and CTO Jason Melo told CoinDesk back in November that the company chose Singapore as its base because it “has regulatory and banking systems in place that are friendly to a bitcoin-related business such as ours”.    4. BTC China  Total VC to Date: $5m  Major Investors: Lightspeed Venture Partners, Lightspeed China Partners  BTC China is currently one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the world. Although recent governmental policy in China has affected BTC China, the potential the country holds in the bitcoin market is huge. While no official statistics exist, officials from BTC China have said that the country is likely the largest bitcoin mining nation in the world.    David Chen, a partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners that led the BTC China investment, recently said that it was “dangerous to speculate” what regulation in China will do to bitcoin there. Venture capital investing is a long view business, and it’s clear that Lightspeed is into bitcoin for the long haul.  3. 21E6  Total VC to Date: $5.05m  Major Investors: Unknown  If you have never heard of 21E6, you’re in the vast majority of those who follow bitcoin. The company, which is supposedly named after the total supply of BTC to ever be in circulation, is a mining hardware company. But little information regarding its business strategy is available. An SEC filing in November that makes notice of its $5.05m in funds is one of few official records that the company even exists.            What is known is that the company is based in San Francisco with Matthew Pauker as its CEO. A Businessweek article says that 21E6 is “is believed to be backed by some of the wealthiest people in Silicon Valley“. The article also states one of the cofounders is Balaji Srinivasan, a former Stanford University professor who is an expert in data mining.  2. Circle Internet Financial  Total VC to Date: $9m  Major Investors: Accel Partners, General Catalyst Partners, Jim Breyer  Boston-based Circle Internet Financial has grand designs on making bitcoin easy for the mainstream user. CEO Jeremy Allaire, who testified during the congressional virtual currency hearings, has come out as a figurehead for both bitcoin and its potential for it as a tool in financial services.    While no specific product has been announced by Circle yet, the idea is to build a BTC-based product that is easy to use like Skype or email. But doing that is going be expensive for the company to pull off. Allaire has told CoinDesk that $2m of the $9m Circle raised will likely be spent on achieving regulatory compliance.  1. Coinbase  Total VC to Date: $31.7m  Major Investors: Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, Ribbit Capital  San Francisco-based Coinbase is one of the most popular companies in the bitcoin space. It’s sheer numbers prove it: Not only has the company raised over $30m in venture capital, it recently announced that it had surpassed the 650,000 users mark, an amount that has clearly accelerated in the past few months with the rise in BTC’s price.    Aiming to be the “Gmail of bitcoin”, Coinbase is a processor for both bitcoin merchants and the average user. Those with a US-based bank account can easily obtain BTC after going through the company’s verification procedures; as it stands today Coinbase is one of the easiest ways for people to convert USD into bitcoin in the United States.
