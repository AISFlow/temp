42425314,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw5xh,1390423860,Sweden Likely to Regulate Bitcoin as an Asset,"An official from the Swedish Tax Agency has revealed it is drafting rules for bitcoin users and programmers that would treat bitcoins as assets.      In an interview with Bloomberg released 22nd January, Swedish tax official Olof Wallin spoke about the proposal, stating why he believes bitcoin fails to meet Sweden's definition of a currency:      ""Currencies are traditionally tied to a central bank or geographic area,"" Wallin stated.              Because of this distinction, Wallin said Sweden is likely to regulate bitcoin ""like art or antiques"". Under the proposal, bitcoin would fall under the same asset class as antiques, copyrights, jewelry and stamps, and be subject to capital gains taxes.      Wallin stated that Sweden is also considering whether to tax bitcoin miners as businesses, stating only that his agency is considering its position on the matter.      The unconventional classification divided Bitcoin Talk forum commentators, with some finding it to be a level-headed approach, while others struggled to digest the comparison between bitcoin and creative works of value.      Regardless, with the announcement, Sweden becomes the latest Nordic country to update the world on how it is seeking to oversee virtual currencies.      On 20th January, the Bank of Finland took similar action, moving to classify bitcoin as a ""commodity"", indicating that lawmakers across the Nordic region are working fast to set domestic precedents for virtual currencies.    Implications    Sweden's interpretation of bitcoin would allow its government to charge Swedish users capital gains, breaking from Germany's decision last year to exempt alternative currency actions from such taxation.      Seen in concert with past announcement, though, the proposal can be viewed as a positive for bitcoin. Just last April, Sweden warned its citizens against using bitcoin, choosing to focus its statements on bitcoin's uses in money laundering.      However, comments from Sweden's Financial Markets Minister Peter Norman suggest this viewpoint is still common among the country's regulators:      “If we end up with artificial or virtual currencies, there is a risk that they could slip through the cracks and that would be serious. I don’t think Bitcoins are at that stage today, but if they were to grow into a big virtual currency that’s being used a lot, that would result in risks that we don’t want,"" Norman told Bloomberg.              Jonathan Fors, a bitcoin researcher and Ph. D. student at Linköping University sees the announcement differently, arguing that Sweden should classify bitcoin as a ""foreign currency"".      ""In my opinion, classifying digital currencies as assets could hinder adoption here in Sweden. Digital currencies have many promises in store for the future, and I think the Swedish government should think carefully before placing such restrictions on this technology,"" Fors said.            Regional consensus    Despite differences in how regulation could take shape in Finland and Sweden, the Nordic nations do have a commonality: They agree that bitcoin should not be treated as a currency.      In December, Norway's director general of taxation stated that bitcoin does not ""fall under the usual definition of money or currency"". Finland went one step further, suggesting that in addition to failing the definition of a currency, bitcoin does not qualify as a payment instrument under Finnish law.      The decision could also impact ongoing discussions in major markets like the United States and United Kingdom, which have still yet to declare how bitcoin will be taxed.    Since 2006, Sweden has seen steady economic growth after decades of economic struggles. As such, it has emerged as a country with what some consider is a proven model for steady economic growth at a time when other nations are struggling with debt and unemployment.

42425350,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Th,1390413657,"The CoinDesk Mining Roundup: 21e6, KnCMiner Profits and New Hardware","Bitcoin mining continues to be a popular, albeit contentious topic.  On one hand, the mining process is conducted via a distributed network, which gives it a lack of centralized control. Yet on the other, the ASIC hardware required to perform the SHA-256 hashing needed for the Bitcoin protocol is becoming increasingly expensive.  Let’s take a look at the mining news stories that have made headlines in recent weeks:  Dreaming in bitcoin  In what may be the highest-profile piece on bitcoin mining to date, BusinessWeek’s recent cover article offers some new insight on the companies in the mining scene.  Butterfly Labs, HashFast Technologies and KnCMiner are just some of the companies featured in the story.  The most intriguing part of this story concerns the secretive Silicon Valley startup 21e6, which apparently plans to build mining hardware – and keep it all to themselves. 21e6 reportedly received $5m in venture capital last year, which made it one of the largest bitcoin-based venture investments of 2013.  HashFast is being sued  San Francisco-based HashFast Technologies is facing a lawsuit based on its failure to ship its miners on time.  The issue in contention is clearly the price of bitcoin since it has risen so dramatically since July. According to the Bitcoin Price Index, the aggregate value of bitcoin was quite low at that time, bottoming out at $66.34 per BTC.  HashFast had guaranteed Baby Jet miner shipments by 31st December 2013. Since it has apparently failed to do so, customers who pre-ordered in July are demanding refunds in bitcoin. However, the company is adamant that they have been shipping.  Butterfly labs at CES  Butterfly Labs  is officially bringing new hardware to the market. The company's products were on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas at the beginning of the month. This included a 600 GH/s card that can be configured as either an external unit or a PCI express card.  The company was also showing off a hardware-based wallet, BitSafe. The device is able to store private keys securely and away from networked threats.  Check back with CoinDesk soon for more detailed coverage regarding Butterfly Labs’ new lineup of products.  KnCMiner making a mint  A representative from Stockholm-based KnCMiner recently told Forbes that the company has made $25m selling its bitcoin hardware in the last two weeks of December alone.  Interestingly enough, KnCMiner told Forbes that it names its products after planets because of its global customer base: planets translate easily into other languages.  The article also takes an in-depth look at KnCMiner's Jupiter; currently Neptune is the only device available for preorder on its website, a whopping 3 TH/s for $9,995.  Cointerra testing Goldstrike ASICs  Austin, Texas-based Cointerra recently put up a blog post updating their progress. They are currently in the process of testing their latest GoldStrike ASICs.  The testing process entails running the chips through its cooling paces, which uses a liquid-based system. The company writes that it has achieved 132GH/s on a single die.  Cointerra’s April batch of TerraMiners has already sold out. But the second batch of Cointerra’s TerraMiner IV will be available in May, and pre-orders are still available on its website. The units are 2 TH/s for $5,999 a piece.  Bitmain selling blades and USBs  China-based Bitmain is a new hardware company on the scene, clearly leveraging Chinese manufacturing contacts to offer bitcoin mining products. The company appears to be shipping devices, as one customer has posted a Bitmain Antminer on YouTube.  The company has two different miners available right now. One is the AntMiner S1 dual blade miner that produces 180 GH/s for 1.9 BTC.  The other is a USB miner called the AntMiner U1. That unit performs at 1.6 GH/s – but the company has a minimum order quantity (MOQ) of 500 units for 22 BTC.  ASICMiner announces Generation 3 tapeout  One of the earliest ASIC producers, ASICMiner recently announced on the Bitcointalk forums that it has submitted its newest chip design to a manufacturer, known as a “tapeout”.  The company is utilizing 40 nanometer chips in this design – which is a middle-of-the-pack specification in terms of what other producers are now doing.  Yet it appears that ASICMiner’s future plans simply involve fabricating chips: the company says that it “will be moving more to pure chip distribution” going forward.  Wrapping up  The divisive nature of bitcoin is thus: yes, it's decentralised – but in order to own a portion of the network infrastructure, one has to have powerful machines that can only perform one function: operate on Bitcoin or another SHA-265-based cryptocurrency network.

42425320,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw69h,1390408315,Microsoft Destroys Bitcoin Mining Botnet Sefnit,"Microsoft has gone on the offensive against the 'Sefnit' botnet and it has remotely removed Sefnit from many computers. But, contrary our original report, it left the Tor clients behind.  Sefnit is a curious form of Tor-based malware that managed to infect millions of computers and turn them into zombies for click fraud and bitcoin mining.  It was first detected last summer, after the Tor Project noticed a 600% increase in Tor use. The spike coincided with the highly publicised revelations about NSA’s snooping programmes, namely Prism.  However, privacy concerns and paranoia had nothing to do with the surge. In September it became evident that the cause of the massive increase in Tor users had nothing to do with the NSA and whistleblower Edward Snowden: the culprit was Sefnit.  Remote solution  Sefnit was propagated in several ways, and it quickly found its way to several software bundles – complete with a vulnerable version of the Tor Browser. The malware installed the Tor client in the background, and even when Sefnit was removed the infected computer would still connect to the Tor network. Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) has protections to remove the services started by the Sefnit malware, but it does not uninstall Tor, remove any Tor binaries, or prevent users from using Tor, said Microsoft.  Since Microsoft had no way of reaching the affected users, it decided to wipe the infections remotely, reports Hacker News. Microsoft updated definitions for its anti-malware suites and the new signatures allowed Microsoft Security Essentials, Windows Defender, Microsoft Safety Scanner and other tools to detect and remove Sefnit malware.  Bitcoin mining botnets  have been around for a while. The most recent case of mining malware propagation involved Yahoo’s European servers, which served infected ads for a few days before the company identified the breach. Several mining botnets were identified and put out of action in late 2013.  Rising hash difficulty  However, bitcoin mining botnets are starting to look like dinosaurs. PCs have not been used for bitcoin mining for months and even a huge botnet is an extremely inefficient way of mining. As the hash difficulty goes up, returns go down. In other words, malware designers will simply stop bothering with bitcoin mining malware altogether.  There is a problem though. Some PCs can still mine scrypt-based currencies quite efficiently. If litecoins or other altcoins based on ASIC-proof algorithms ever become popular, they could present a tempting target for cyber criminals.

42425327,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Nh,1390402823,Marc Andreessen Explains Why 2014 Will be the Year of Bitcoin,"Marc Andreessen, co-founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, has praised the virtues of bitcoin, in an essay published by The New York Times.  In the piece, entitled “Why Bitcoin Matters”, Andreessen outlines what drew him to bitcoin and raises some interesting points, along with new questions.  Andreessen’s company is heavily invested in bitcoin startups, so it is understandable that he offers a very positive perspective. He argues that technologists (or nerds) are transfixed by bitcoin, as they see enormous potential in digital currencies. He concludes that popular products and services are eventually commercialised by mainstream companies and industries.  Tech analogies abound  Andreessen's article compares bitcoin to other technologies that changed the way we do business in the past: personal computers in 1975 and the internet in 1993. He echoes a similar argument from venture capitalist Chris Dixon, who recently compared bitcoins to domain names in the early days of the internet, proclaiming that 2014 will be bitcoin's breakthrough year.  The trouble with such broad analogies is that they tend to work both ways. Proponents of digital currencies can use them to prove their point, but critics can do the same – and both will have plenty of good arguments on their side.  However, Andreessen stresses that bitcoin is somewhat different, as it has a lot to do with public perception: “The gulf between what the press and many regular people believe Bitcoin is, and what a growing critical mass of technologists believe Bitcoin is, remains enormous.”  Getting the message across  Andreessen tackles a very basic problem faced by many bitcoin enthusiasts: he explains how it works and what makes it so radically different.  [post-quote]  The emphasis is not on the currency itself, or even the existing protocol, but rather the way digital currencies have managed to resolve a problem in computer science called the Byzantine Generals Problem.  In essence, the problem revolves around different individuals agreeing with each other and cutting out those with a malicious intent. It is all about creating trust between different parties over an untrusted network.  “The practical consequence of solving this problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user.”  “The transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate,” Andreessen concludes.  Currency vs payment system  Andreessen goes on to explain the key difference between bitcoins and Bitcoin (ie between the currency and the protocol). Bitcoin is described as a bearer instrument that allows parties to exchange assets with no pre-existing trust. The value of the digital currency depends on the volume and velocity of payments running through the ledger and of course on speculation. He noted:  “It is perhaps true right at this moment that the value of Bitcoin currency is based more on speculation than actual payment volume, but it is equally true that that speculation is establishing a sufficiently high price for the currency that payments have become practically possible.”  However, Andreessen also points out that companies can use bitcoin as a new payment system without holding any bitcoins in the process, thus eliminating many volatility concerns.  Furthermore, he describes bitcoin as a very interesting way of boosting margins for online and brick-and-mortar businesses. Interestingly, Andreessen quotes Chris Dixon to get his point across:  “Let’s say you sell electronics online. Profit margins in those businesses are usually under 5 percent, which means conventional 2.5 percent payment fees consume half the margin. That’s money that could be reinvested in the business, passed back to consumers or taxed by the government. Of all of those choices, handing 2.5 percent to banks to move bits around the Internet is the worst possible choice.”  “Another challenge merchants have with payments is accepting international payments. If you are wondering why your favorite product or service isn’t available in your country, the answer is often payments.”  Andreessen points out that bitcoin transactions are handled with practically no fees, or very low fees. This is not the case with existing payment systems, as they charge a couple of percent to process the payment. In many parts of the world the fees are much higher. In addition, bitcoin transfers can be faster and more secure, as they do not have to contain sensitive personal information.  Bright future for bitcoin, gloom for altcoins  One of the more interesting assumptions made by Andreessen is that bitcoin has a classic network effect, backed by a positive feedback loop.  “The more people who use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin is for everyone who uses it, and the higher the incentive for the next user to start using the technology.”  This phenomenon has been discussed in the past, and it is more or less a standard argument for bitcoin advocates. However, he also points out that the rise of bitcoin may doom competing digital currencies. With thousands of businesses and programmers using developing new bitcoin products and services, any future challenger to bitcoin will have a hard time gaining traction.  “If something is to displace Bitcoin now, it will have to have sizeable improvements and it will have to happen quickly. Otherwise, this network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance.”  Andreessen also sees a lot more potential in remittances, public payments, micro-transactions and monetization. In all four scenarios bitcoin makes a lot of sense and beats traditional payment methods on many levels.  What about the critics?  Commenting recent criticism of bitcoin from prominent economists, Andreessen says they might be correct today, but in the long run it has a lot of potential, a view shared by former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and to some extent Milton Friedman.  On the whole, Andreessen paints a very rosy picture, but he fails to address many concerns raised by the critics. Tech analogies like the “Internet anno 1993” argument tend to work both ways – just ask anyone who was burned in the Dot-com bubble of the late nineties.  Arguing that bitcoin is leaner and cheaper than existing payment systems makes more sense, but the real question is whether it will be as cheap a couple of years down the road, with more demand and fewer bitcoins to be mined.  Perhaps the biggest issue revolves around regulation. Bitcoin is secure, and is a great way of ensuring the validity of various transactions.  On the other hand, bitcoin transactions do not enjoy the same level of legal protection as traditional transactions. There is practically no recourse, bitcoin payments cannot be reversed and disputes are bound to end up in court.  Regulatory ambiguity is great for speculators, but it is not as good for businesses and consumers willing to embrace bitcoin – it is slowing adoption and it does not bode well for the ""positive feedback loop"" argument.  It's a catch-22. The same thing that makes bitcoin so alluring in some circles is, in fact, slowing down the development of the bitcoin economy.

42425315,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw5zh,1390397432,NYC Bitcoin Center Hosts its First Hackathon,"The NYC Bitcoin Center held its first hackathon over the weekend.  An educational hub for the cryptocurrency, the Center hosted a developer event to further educate the technically inclined about the power of distributed money.  James V Barcia, the Center's Communications Director, said: “Hackathon participants worked on ways to improve cryptocurrency exchanges and streamline bitcoin-related apps, making them more efficient and user friendly.""  Some of the featured projects included various types of wallets for bitcoins and altcoins, including Coinbase. A walkthrough of what it takes to build a bitcoin ATM was a population demonstration.  ""One of the more noteworthy presentations was on a bitcoin ATM model including a discussion of the hardware and software,"" said Barcia.  Another intriguing project was Miningbot, a mining hardware that finds and mines the best cyprocurrency opportunities based on a number of daily metrics. During the hackathon, it became clear that Miningbot may be a viable business to pursue. “It’s a company formed as a result of our hackathon,"" Barcia said.  Another potentially viable venture Barcia described was a hardware project that uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino to allow travellers to automatically check in to their rooms: virtual currency solving a common travel problem.  ""Basically, every doorknob at every vacation rental can be a hotel front desk. You check into a vacation rental with a QR code at the door, the door opens as you pay with bitcoin, and when you leave it pays the cleaning service with bitcoin.""  The event lasted over a 72-hour period, and ended on the US holiday commemorating Martin Luther King, Jr.  Going forward, the NYC Bitcoin Center plans to host these types of hackathons once every month.  The Center is located on Broad street in Manhattan, a location that is in close proximity to the New York Stock Exchange. It's no wonder, then, that it plans to educate investors with a bitcoin-based curriculum.  Bitcoin 101, digital currency, mining classes, cold storage classes and an internship program are all educational opportunities available to at the NYC Bitcoin Center, according to Barcia.  The NYC Bitcoin Center first opened on New Years Eve. Interestingly enough, the inaugural event there to celebrate the New Year featured a Republican primary candidate for US Congress wearing a QR code to elicit bitcoin donations for his campaign.

42425329,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Rh,1390392002,"Smart Property, Colored Coins and Mastercoin","Cryptoledgers, such as those utilized in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and litecoin, have the ability to be employed in other capacities. They are not merely one-dimensional, one-trick ponies relegated to simple fiat-only exchanges.  For example, last week Kyle Torpey published an overview of several upcoming projects that utilize the Bitcoin block chain to provide new features and financial instruments for users globally.  While it is uncertain that any or all will be successful in accomplishing their goals, these new innovations, like Namecoin before them, show that cryptoledgers can be integrated to provide rich functionality beyond the current token system.  For those unfamiliar with Namecoin, it currently acts as a decentralized DNS system that makes domain name censorship difficult, if not impossible. It was created in 2010 as a modified version of Bitcoin, and in 2011 the mining of Namecoins (after block 19,200) was effectively merged with Bitcoin through a software update (eg pools had to use a new software release).  While Namecoin provides DNS functionality it can also be utilized to be used as a messaging system, torrent tracker and even as a notary (which other cryptocurrencies can do as well).  The next release of Bitcoin currently being developed, version 0.9, will include a number of changes. In the words of lead developer Gavin Andresen, it includes the ability for “developers [to] associate up to 80 bytes of arbitrary data with their transactions by adding an extra 'immediately prune-able” zero-valued output.”  What this allows for is a little more space in the output section to provide users the ability to add some new data (such as a distributed contract) to be included via a hash.  Why is this important?  In 2012, Mike Hearn (a Bitcoin developer now on the board at Circle) gave a presentation in London in which he describes other financial instruments and practical business uses that a cryptoledger can provide through the use of “timelock” (technically referred to as nLockTime).  [post-quote]  This makes it possible to build ‘smart property’ or contracts that, in turn, create a distributed digital verification system that bypasses the need for a central repository.  A couple examples Mike gives are the transfer of goods (such as a car) and the execution of a trust fund (through a will), both of which can be conducted without many additional intermediaries.  For example, if a car ignition system is reengineered to connect with a cryptoledger protocol, it could enable car owners to buy and sell vehicles remotely via trusted timestamping.  The execution of a will (eg disbursement of a trust fund) is also possible, albeit slightly more complicated, in that someone would need to build a system that could scan obituaries for deaths and notify the block chain of any changes.  In actuality, the potential applications can be expanded to anything that involves rights verification (such as stocks, titles to houses, digital media – as well as the keys to houses and cars). In fact, this past fall Mike gave another interview describing these potential applications in more detail.  Coloring within the lines  Another potential way to utilize a crypto block chain to verify wares is through a process being developed called Colored Coins. In a nutshell, this endeavor allows users to “color” a token to represent a specific asset such as a car, home, boat, commodity, shares, bonds – virtually any type of asset (eg 0.5 BTC colored green to represent your home).  These tokens can then be exchanged, just like bitcoin tokens, by anyone anywhere. This enables a decentralized, trustless form of asset management that uses a block chain as both a ledger and transportation mechanism.  I spoke with Alex Mizrahi, who is leading the development of the Chroma Wallet used by the Colored Coin project.  According to him: “It is going to be very easy for the asset management industry as a whole to use Colored Coins. For example, some of the first places we are going to have adoption will likely be real-estate and portfolio management. In fact, for any type of asset management it's going to be simple to issue his own color that represents his goods.”  “A portfolio manager can issue one color that represents a portfolio of stocks backed by the real holding and sell it globally. If he is savvy and his products are good, his colors are going to have demand. So transferring ownership is very easy, quick and safe – just like bitcoins.”  “In the real estate industry, someone can issue their apartments using colored coins and have them float on the block chain, or manage time-sharing based on color,” he added.  I also spoke with Amos Meiri, head of dealing at eToro and also a member of the development team for the Colored Coin project. I specifically asked him if it would be easier to simply conduct all trade privately at the centralized exchange where it will be more scalable and private.  In his view: “Centralized exchanges definitely have their advantages, but colored coins can be useful [...] users do not need to trust their bitcoins to a centralized exchange. Companies cannot manipulate ownership records (to commit fraud, for example). So basically, if somebody gives you an IOU, it isn't a good idea to leave it with the person who issued it or to affiliated parties.”  “Companies cannot control how its shares are being traded, thus it cannot block trade. And lastly, there is no need to maintain servers or manage security due to its integration with the block chain.”  While this is obviously easier said than done, as noted above, this idea of using cryptoledgers to manage smart property has inspired and motivated numerous other groups to work on similar efforts.  For example, Counterparty.co was recently launched this month. Its mysterious, relatively anonymous development team has released similar open-source applications, documents, binaries and tools that allow users and entrepreneurs to build smart property functionality such as derivatives and dividends in a decentralized manner.  Just last week, Jon Southurst discussed several other groups including Reality Keys which can utilize a crypto protocol to build a predictions market or a way to hedge against currency fluctuations.  Masters of the cryptoverse  This past week I spoke with Taariq Lewis, the founder and CEO of BitcoinBusiness, a Bitcoin Advisory firm and he is also the Smart Property and Business Development Lead of the Mastercoin Project. Mastercoin is a crowdfunded, non-profit endeavour to create an open-source distributed exchange protocol for Bitcoin. The MC project has received more than $3m in crowdfunding which has been used to pay for bounties, build tools and write documentation all of which is ultimately released open-source. According to Taariq:  “We are on the tip of the iceberg of the democratization of upper level finance and investment management. One apt analogy is that the current system involves a highly siloed, highly centralized organization reminiscent to the music industry prior to P2P innovations. We are now approaching the first wave of people being able to distribute financial products to each other on a peer-to-peer basis.”  “While this obviously has regulatory repercussions such as the SEC and CFTC oversight in the US, there is no ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ in crypto. In fact, projects like Colored Coin, Counterparty and Mastercoin will create applications that will decentralize stock and bond exchanges allowing individuals and entrepreneurs to build dividend products and distribute the assets without middlemen.”    David Johnston, managing director of BitAngels and a board member at Mastercoin, has a similar perspective on cryptocurrency: “It is more than a new type currency or store of wealth. It is a whole new platform and is a way for people to now make programmable money and that gives rise to smart contracts. Now that this money is programmable I can put it into applications, I can create other digital tokens. That's what really gets me excited where anyone can build anything.”      The Mastercoin platform is still a work in progress, and has gone through several iterations based on community feedback. It also faces market competition from several others in this space such as Open-Transactions, Invictus (formerly BitShares) and potentially many others that learn of the potential business opportunities. And as a consequence, it looks like a promising area for Christensen-style innovation.    Outside the dev world  To put this in perspective, I had an email exchange with Ryan Orr – a professor at Stanford University (teaching Global Project Finance and Infrastructure Investment) and co-chairman at Zanbato.  He noted that: “With the recent wave of regulatory actions, I am personally feeling quite excited about how the “smart property” projects evolve in 2014. It is starting to feel like smart property could be a much lower path of resistance for the bitcoin protocol as it establishes a ""non-monetary"" form of use that fulfils a valuable social purpose.”  “And thus it should not be viewed as a direct threat by regulators who are afraid of losing monopoly control of money. It is the 'duality' of purpose of gold, where people can hold it under the auspices of non-monetary purposes, but also hold it for monetary purposes (eg a hedge against inflation), that makes it so difficult for the governments to totally eliminate it as a form of money (even though the US government did try to do so in 20th Century).”  “If bitcoin can develop a similar duality, where the 'smart property' use makes it legitimate, and then people also can secretly hold it as an uncorrelated hedge against government dysfunction, then that could be pretty interesting. In sum, it feels like the 'smart property' could become the 'formal, legal, legitimate' face to the project that can develop independent of how the regulators rule on the use of Bitcoin for monetary purposes.”  In addition, I also spoke with Ben Davenport, an angel investor and a member of the monetization team at Instagram. While he does not necessarily endorse one specific project, in his view: “Colored coin technology allows such centralized assets to be traded in a completely decentralized way. Every single equity in the world has a central issuer – the company itself.” He added:  “But imagine the power of being able to make a trustless trade of stock for bitcoin with a stranger, at a distance, with no third party involved. With colored coins, I can construct a single atomic transaction which encodes such an exchange. That, to me, is the most important basic thing that colored coins can enable.”  The disruptive potential of smart property for the entire financial industry, not just fiat credit facilities, is enormous. Charles Stross, the British sci-fi author, recently criticized Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency endeavour, wishing that it die a quick death (in fire no less).  While his contentions were fallacious on a number of counts (especially regarding the environmental impact), ironically, he previously predicted seven years ago that near-future sci-fi authors are still probably missing something disruptively as large as the Internet 20 years ago or the smartphone was this past decade.  In other words, just as rewatching older sci-fi films that failed to foresee drones and self-driving automobiles seems dated, the portrayal of centrally managed financial products may one day be viewed as an anachronism of our not-so-quaint analog past.  Thus, Stross’ prediction of another unforeseen invention could very well be these smart property applications and digital financial instruments that are managed and transported by the very same cryptoledgers he dreamt of burning.

42425324,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Dh,1390384804,Startups Race to Install London's First Bitcoin ATM,"Three companies are competing to install London's first bitcoin ATM in the coming weeks.  The firms, all startups, are awaiting the delivery of their machines from manufacturers Robocoin and Lamassu. They say they have locations staked out, but are keeping mum until they are ready to make an official public announcement.  The firm with the most ambitious plan is Global Bitcoin ATM Ltd. The bootstrapped startup plans to install five machines per month in the UK, starting in London. It eventually plans to install machines globally, according to its spokesperson, Terry James.  Global Bitcoin says it has a high street location somewhere in central London in mind for its first machine, a Robocoin unit, which it expects to receive and install in early February. James said:  “The first machine is due in February, and we've got two machines already paid for. We're hoping it will be the first of its kind in the UK.""  The Robocoin ATM is capable of two-way conversions between bitcoin and fiat currency, and includes a feature which can identify users via a biometric reader.  New business model  James' firm has a unique take on the ATM operator business model. Instead of owning and operating the machines itself, it plans to operate the machines on behalf of their individual owners.  The firm maintains the machines and finds venues to install them. The owners pay Global Bitcoin ATM for the service on 24-month contracts. Thus, the firm acts as a service provider for a network of ATM owners. James said:  ""We think there's a niche for people who want to get involved [in bitcoin ATM ownership] but don't have the time or resources.""  James said his firm intends to use Robocoin machines for the time being, adding that the company is also joining the Bank to the Future incubator for bitcoin startups in London. The firm is bootstrapped and has no institutional funding at the moment.  The accidental operator  Another individual with designs on making history with London's first cryptocurrency ATM is Joel Raziel. The boutique real estate developer is awaiting delivery of his Lamassu unit, which is also due in early February.  Having found a location in East London to install his ATM, Raziel is currently in the process of confirming it. He said he bought the machine – which costs about $5,000 – on a whim.  ""This is completely out of the ordinary for me, it is very much an impulse buy. I'm kind of biting my nails over it.""  However, since CoinDesk spoke to him in early January, a spate of bitcoin ATM installations around the world have been announced. Raziel now thinks his ATM could be a viable business. ""I think there's definitely commercial value to it and I'm sure it could turn a profit,"" he said.  Neither Raziel nor Global Bitcoin ATM have said what they will charge customers who wish to use their machines. ATMs elsewhere, like Canada, for example, typically charge a 5% fee per transaction.  Satoshipoint enters the fray  The third player in London's bitcoin ATM race is Satoshipoint Ltd. The firm's co-founders are Hassan Khoshtaghaza and Jonathan 'Jonny' Harrison. The firm has two Robocoin machines on the way, but they're lagging the competition with a delivery date scheduled for early March.  Satoshipoint will install its Robocoin ATMs at bureaus d'change on Oxford Street and in Notting Hill, both popular tourist destinations in Central London. Khoshtaghaza would not say exactly where the machines would be located, although he did say fees would be 3 to 5%.  Khoshtaghaza said the firm is planning to buy more machines if the first two prove to be popular.  The ATM operators contacted said there are currently no specific laws or regulations in place to govern bitcoin ATMs in the UK. However, Satoshipoint and Global Bitcoin ATM said they preferred Robocoin machines partly because of the units' 'Know Your Customer' features, which allow the operator to maintain a record of the machine's transactions, along with identifying information.  Booming global ATM business  Bitcoin ATM installations have boomed in the last two months. Manufacturer Lamassu announced it had received its 100th order at the end of December, while three Canadian cities had their first bitcoin ATMs installed last week.  Attracted by the opportunities emerging in the space, new manufacturers, from open-source projects like Skyhook ATM, to firms planning to scale globally like Ottawa's Bit Access, have entered the space.  The first bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver at the end of October. That Robocoin unit reportedly accepted more than CA$1m in deposits in its first 29 days of operation, putting the business in the spotlight.

42425310,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw5rh,1390362065,Humint Hopes to Custom-Build Altcoins for Brands,"We've had peercoin, feathercoin, worldcoin, and a host of others. How about WholeFoodscoin, CocaColacoin, or McDonaldscoin? A group of social entrepreneurs is hoping to bring branded coins into existence, and is chasing unidentified potential partners as we speak.  People might be forgiven for thinking that the whole altcoin scene is getting a little silly. In a world where dogecoin - a six week-old coin launched from a dog joke - has a larger hash rate than Litecoin, things are clearly moving in a strange direction. And we're already starting to see coins trying to capitalize on existing brands. For example, Kanye West recently squashed a coin that tried to cash in on his name.  Wendell Davis, CEO of recently-formed crypto currency marketing and consulting company Humint, thinks that the time is right for custom coins developed for specific brands.  The case for branded coins  Why would a company want its own coin? Davis gives a grocery story as a hypothetical example:  ""There's a 40% pre-mine of this coin. 20% of that goes to you, and you're going to give this away to your customers for free with every purchase that they make,"" he suggests.  Humint takes some of the coin as its fee, because it doesn't charge the brand to create the coin. Another fraction is distributed to people in the grocer's supply chain, including the food producers, in emerging countries. ""Maybe you give the rest away to some causes that you want to support.""  The rest of the coin is then mined, in the traditional way, and is then traded by the miners.  ""What happens of course is that once this thing hits the market, there is a value that is assigned to this coin that was previously generated from nothing,"" Davis predicts. ""In that moment, what happens is that the entire supply chain, the causes that they want to support, the customers, and the company, are all enriched.""  A brand's customers wouldn't need to understand cryptocurrency (thankfully), or to trade it. The coins would be awarded, like loyalty points, when they purchased items, just as conventional points are today. They wouldn't have to do anything with the coins, Davis argues, until the cashier told them that thanks to an increase in market value, the coins on their loyalty card just paid for their week's groceries.  That assumes that market value will increase. Which assumes that there's a market. Which means a trading platform, which the miners would use. ""The way I see it is that they should all be fungible,"" Davis argues.  Quite how that will pan out, Davis isn't sure, but it's no coincidence that one member of his team is Jesse Heaslip, co-CEO of Vancouver-based Bex.io, which has written its software enabling companies to create their own crypto currency exchanges. Davis also openly admires Ripple, a payment network (not a trading exchange) that enables currencies to be sent easily between members.  CoinDesk generally tries to steer away from vaporware. Everyone in the crypto currency world has a neat idea, but few have the commitment to execute them. However, this team has a track record in getting things done. Heaslip recently scored $525,000 in funding for Bex.io, and has beta code running. And Davis is no dilettante, either. He is CEO of Hive, which has a beta version of a OS X-based bitcoin wallet with embedded links to a variety of online cryptocurrency services.  But the idea has its critics. One of them is serial bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees, who labels himself 'highly skeptical' of the concept.  ""Why would someone want a Whole Foods coin? If I received such a thing when I shopped there, I'd instantly convert it to bitcoin,"" he says (these are hypothetical examples - there's no suggestion that Humint is working with any of brand names mentioned in this article, or that any of them are developing coins).  ""Money competes with money,"" Voorhees asserts. ""Why would I want to hold a Whole Foods coin when I could instead have the equivalent value in bitcoin, which is accepted all over the world?""  On the other hand, just look at dogecoin, which hoisted itself up by its own bootstraps and became its own phenomenon, with no cohesive brand to speak of, and no apparent reason for there to be a demand. If memes are powerful, then so are brands.  There's also the loyalty point argument. Gabe Zichermann, chair of the Gamification Summit and an expert in social marketing and loyalty rewards systems, thinks that altcoins trading as loyalty points could satisfy a strong demand among brands.  ""There is market demand for alternatives to the dollar on the one hand, and alternatives to walled garden loyalty programs on the other. There's a demand that something is convertible, and adopted by lots of peers, but isn't tied to a company or a country,"" he says.  Once scenario could see, say, a Whole Foods coin and a Lulu Lemon gymwear coin (both hypothetical examples) traded on the open market, possibly paired with an independent asset such as bitcoin, says Zichermann. Imagine an urban hipster receiving an altcoin reward for buying yoga pants, and then trading or converting them to the other's altcoin, to get discounts on their groceries with.  Presumably, in that ideal world, there would also be room for complementary brands to partner with each other on campaigns and award each other's coins.  If coins could be traded like loyalty points, it may give them more liquidity, and create demand, but it needs that framework. ""If an ecosystem develops then value will be created for both the buyer and the seller. Until then, nothing really happens,"" posits Bill Warelis, VP of marketing for loyalty points service LoyaltyMatch.com. The company recently launched a bitcoin-based loyalty service, which awards points for purchases made in bitcoins.  There are inertial challenges, says Zichermann. Getting brands to accept this might be difficult. Someone has to take the plunge - and companies with control over their own deeply entrenched loyalty programs might be hard to shift.  One concern is whether the current uncertain regulatory landscape would scare off companies with a lot to lose.  ""They'd either put so many restrictions and terms on the coin that it became pretty useless, or [they] would risk becoming a money transmitter,"" Voorhees says. ""That is not their business.""  Davis admits that this is a potential problem. But then, half of the bitcoin world is currently traversing a landscape where regulations are uncertain. He says that he's already negotiating with multi-national brand customers.  Smaller companies, daunted by the cost and complexity of launching and managing a loyalty program, might like the idea of a quick on-ramp, especially if outsourced to an expert firm, Zichermann suggests.  Something else is going on at Humint, connected to this, but they're not telling. It's some kind of platform, and it will open up the concept of coins to non-brands. That's all that sources are saying at the moment. You'll know when we know.  Would you mine or trade a branded altcoin?
