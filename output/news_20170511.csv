42399848,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvQW,1494524085,Ex-FBI Chief: Virtual Currencies Hinder Criminal Investigations,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation's work is being hampered by the criminal use of virtual currencies, the agency's now-former director said last week.  James Comey, who was first appointed to the position in September 2013 by former President Barack Obama, spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3rd May, discussing the issue as part of a broader conversation about the agency's efforts.  His appearance came just days before he was fired from his position on Tuesday night by President Donald Trump, setting off a firestorm in US political circles given that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign and its connections to the Russian government.  What he said: During his testimony, Comey discussed how an increasing number of criminals are ""going dark"" - that is to say, obscuring their paths using technology. As a result, federal investigators are feeling the pinch - ""[affecting] the spectrum of our work"", according to Comey.  Here's where he specifically mentioned virtual currencies:  ""Some of our criminal investigators face the challenge of identifying online pedophiles who hide their crimes and identities behind layers of anonymizing technologies, or drug traffickers who use virtual currencies to obscure their transactions.""  What's the impact: According to Comey, the agency is trying to find solutions - but thus far, these efforts aren't bearing much fruit.  He called the hunt for fixes ""a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process"", going on to say even the possible approaches they've found are imperfect at best.  ""Even when possible, such methods are difficult to scale across investigations, and may be perishable due to a short technical lifecycle or as a consequence of disclosure through legal proceedings,"" Comey explained.  Nor is the FBI the only agency of its kind to voice this concern. In March, two leading law enforcement bodies from the European Union published a statement which acknowledged that the tech is making it hard to ""follow the money"" during investigations.

London-based Cobalt has inked a deal with Citadel Securities, one of the world's largest firms of its kind - according to data from the Financial Times, Citadel accounted for nearly 35% of the US wholesale market body of market makers. The firm also forms a notable segment of the high-frequency trading (HFT) ecosystem.  ""We support efficient, fair and transparent markets and believe that Cobalt's platform is an important step in enhancing FX market efficiency, particularly around credit and clearing,"" Kevin Kimmel, Citadel Securities' head of electronic foreign exchange, said of the deal.  Along with Citadel, Cobalt signed on XTX Markets, an electronic market maker, which like the startup is also headquartered in London.  Cobalt is moving toward a platform launch for sometime this year, although the startup hasn't yet given a firm release data. In a blog post detailing the integrations with Citadel and XTX, the company said that it is beta-testing its platform with 22 partners.  The announcement comes months after Cobalt netted an undisclosed amount of funding from Citi, according to Business Insider.

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) revealed its ""Cryptocurrency Investigation Train-the-Trainers"" this week, partnering with law enforcement officials from 22 countries on the sessions.  What's happening: According to UNODC – which has taken part in similar discussions in the past – the initiative is centered around ""[conducting] bitcoin tracing as a part of a wider financial investigation"". A follow-up training was specifically dedicated to improving institutional knowledge of the tech.  The agency also worked with blockchain analytics startup Chainalysis to develop the program.  ""It's thanks to donor Governments such as the UK, USA, Norway that UNODC GPML has been able to develop and deliver this innovative course,"" Neil Walsh, UNODC's point person on cybercrime, said of the venture.  The bigger picture: With the launch of the trainings, yet another UN agency is expanding into blockchain.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, various elements of the UN are testing the tech to see if it can help with sending remittances, delivering financial aid and ending child poverty, among other areas.    Some of those UN agencies are even moving toward more collaborative efforts, signaling that the organization sees a positive role for blockchain in its global operations.

42399863,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvfH,1494505810,ICOs Are Changing the Way VCs Deal With Startups,"Gone is the time when investing in a bitcoin company was enough to make you cool.  Now, the really hip kids are into initial coin offerings, or ICOs, sales of cryptographically scarce data that offer the promise to raise millions of dollars in minutes, often with little more than a white paper and pictures of their technical team. In the first five months of this year alone, $136m has been raised in 37 token sales, according to ICO data firm Smith + Crown.  But these two worlds are colliding as some leading blockchain VCs show an increasing willingness to participate in the funding mechanism, even if the exploding price of their corresponding cryptocurrencies brings new variables into the age-old investment equation.  In conversation with CoinDesk, several leading investors in startups working with bitcoin, ethereum and other tokenized assets almost universally agreed that the explosion in cryptocurrency values has led to even more opportunity, not less, for their existing investment model.  Seeking resources beyond just capital, these crypto-startups are increasingly coming to venture capitalists in search of veteran partners and experience.  The result is not only more investment opportunities for traditional VCs, but changes to the firms' overall strategies ranging from a complete rethinking of how they serve startups to a doubling-down of existing practices.  Perhaps the most conservative of those polled, Union Square Ventures partner Albert Wenger, described the changing investment landscape to CoinDesk:  ""We are definitely seeing more and more cryptocurrency businesses, but that was well underway before the current run-up in prices. It is not changing how we feel about the sector.""  An early investor in firms such as Coinbase, OpenBazaar, Blockstack and Polychain Capital, Wenger has already helped his New York firm grow from one of the earliest traditional investors in bitcoin to an industry mainstay.  Going forward, though, Wenger said USV plans to continue investing ""at a steady pace"" in spite of the growing popularity of ICOs – a decision placing him largely in alignment with several other investors.  Investment hybrids  One such investor is Brock Pierce, co-founder of San Francisco-based Blockchain Capital, who was among several VCs who also confirmed he has seen an ""accelerated"" rate of firms entering his company's pipeline as a result of increasing attention from rising cryptocurrency prices.  In fact, Blockchain Capital and USV portfolio company Polychain Capital are both examples of one of the new ways VCs are experimenting with the ICO model, having both participated as early investors in the 0x token sale by buying in early at a 30% discounted rate.  Similarly, the co-founder of Menlo Park-based DFJ, Tim Draper, earlier this week participated in another hybrid investment round, this time in Tezos, by agreeing to participate in its ICO.  Pushing the concept of hybrid investments even further, Blockchain Capital’s Pierce showed another way VCs are working with ICOs when he made headlines by announcing that his firm had raised $10m in an ICO comprised of tokens designed to comply with securities regulations.  Beneath these changes, though, Pierce's investment strategy stayed the same.  With existing investments that already include Abra, Blockstream, BTCC, Ripple and Xapo, Pierce described why he believes the cryptocurrency price increase will likely only have minimal impact on his strategy.  ""If anything, our risk appetite tends to be counter-cyclical to crypto prices in that we like to deploy capital in times when other investors are nervous,"" said Pierce. ""And, conversely, we tend to be more skeptical when unbounded enthusiasm sets in and valuations get stretched.""  Growing interest  Also experiencing an uptick in startups looking to raise capital is Digital Currency Group (DCG), the New York-based investment firm behind startups such as Axoni, BTCC, Coinbase and Kraken.  DCG investing associate Travis Scher reported that the increased popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to what he termed a ""modest but not significant increase"" in VCs backing digital currency firms.  But he cautioned that the increased popularity has its limits, adding that the ""run-up won’t last forever,"" even if he believes it validates his company's strategy.  Scher said that, while most VCs still don't know which type of blockchain companies to invest in, they are increasingly becoming ""believers in the technology"" and are looking for new ways to get involved.  He said:  ""VCs all over the world are seeing the explosion in the value of cryptocurrencies and the innovation that is happening in the space, and many are now exploring how they can invest directly or indirectly in tokens.""  VC disconnect  The co-founder of Boost VC, Brayton Williams, explained the colliding worlds of venture capital and ICOs a different way. While other investors' strategies may stay largely the same, he reported that his is evolving in response to the changing landscape.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Williams compared the current increased interest to the 2013 bitcoin rally that helped contribute to the venture capital community investing in bitcoin companies, but not necessarily in bitcoin itself.  An early investor in Veem (formerly Align Commerce), Blockcypher, Ripio and others, Williams said that, this time around, that trend has continued and ""a large disconnect"" exists between firms willing to invest in cryptocurrency startups and those willing to invest cryptocurrencies.  Williams lists his own firm, along with USV, Blockchain Capital and Pantera, as among those who have been more quick to invest directly in tokens.  To demonstrate his point, Williams said he’s currently in conversations with multiple entrepreneurs looking to take advantage of the access to capital provided by ICOs. In exchange for early access, Williams said potential portfolio companies would receive help building a team and developing a strategy leading up to the token sale.  He concluded:  ""Because our goal at Boost VC is to fund and accelerate cryptocurrency and blockchain founders, we are not trying to fight this new trend, we are ready to play our role.""

42399864,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvgG,1494502214,Intel Quietly Demos New Digital Asset Exchange,"Intel has unveiled a new proof-of-concept tied to its Sawtooth Lake distributed ledger project.  The latest prototype from the tech giant is a marketplace for the exchange of digital assets, a demo version of which has been posted on the Intel website. The release follows similar demos focused on bond trading and tracking seafood as it moves through the supply chain.  Sawtooth Lake was first unveiled in April 2016 as part of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project.  How it looks:  As the screenshot above shows, the Sawtooth Lake-based marketplace lets you view lists of available assets. Users can also add their own – this reporter added one for 'lembas bread' – which can then be listed for sale or exchanged for other assets.  How we got here: Past observers may note that the marketplace isn't the first instance in which Intel has designed a digital asset exchange, of a sort.  In February of last year, CoinDesk reported that the tech firm had developed a fantasy sports game through which assets, representing shares in sports teams, were exchanged in a marketplace setting.  The goal of the game, the company said at the time, was to accrue the most 'mickels' by selling shares tied to successful teams.  While there’s no clear relationship between the two projects, one of the assets listed on the new digital asset markets, 'mickels', is likely a reference to that earlier initiative.

42399874,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvaM,1494496813,Tokenized Bitcoin Mines? New Startup Giga Watt Unveils ICO Plan,"It's been a long road for Dave Carlson.  One of the world's more recognizable bitcoin miners, Carlson gained global attention for his multimillion-dollar mining venture MegaBigPower during the bitcoin boom of 2014 only to almost lose the business when would-be franchise partners failed to come through on hardware purchases.  Despite professing to own tens of thousands of bitcoins and litecoins at various times, he now looks back at what he could have made if only he waited to sell.  ""I worked for free for a year,"" Carlson said. ""Sometimes, that's what you have to do to survive. People appealed to me to trust them and you get taken advantage of.""  But Carlson now sees new opportunity in the booming market for initial coin offerings (ICOs), the process by which technologists are creating cryptographically unique data sets, linking them to a blockchain and selling them to investors as a fundraising tool.  In this seemingly ever-expanding market, Carlson is launching a new venture. Called Giga Watt, the startup aims to fulfill Carlson's long-time goal of democratizing access to bitcoin mining, this time by enabling investors to buy a stake in his company's services.  At a high level, the idea is that Giga Watt is tokenizing the power infrastructure that supports the facilities that host and operate equipment.  ""We're building and reselling crypto-mines. If you want a big mine, you buy a lot of tokens. If don't want to buy miners, then you let us put somebody else's miners in your spot and get paid. You don't have to concern yourself with how blockchains work,"" Carlson explained.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You can look at it as you're acting as a power landlord, and people will pay to rent your power infrastructure.""  In this way, the idea is the latest and perhaps one of the more ambitious attempts to capitalize on the access to capital provided by the ICO mechanism. Though, it's important to note similar ventures so far have produced varying results for their initiators.  For example, when bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem sought to tokenize shares in companies this year, the ICO was eventually scrapped after months of promotion. Others have fared better with the model, with startup Gnosis raising over $12m in just under 15 minutes by selling 5% of the tokens that will power its in-development prediction market.  According to Carlson, Giga Watt has raised over $1m from undisclosed investors to build out the facilities that would be used as part of the initiative.  Terms of the deal  Scheduled to open to the public on 2nd June, Carlson said that Giga Watt is already exploring a pre-sale (and a pre-pre-sale) of its token while building up his team to offer support.  For Carlson, the idea is aimed at solving a long-standing conceptual issue for the bitcoin network – namely, that the economics that make bitcoins valuable have created economies of scale that made it impossible for smaller miners to compete for the rewards produced by the protocol.  At the heart of the issue is that, many enthusiasts believe decentralized access to the network is the key differentiator of bitcoin when compared to the centralized online money services it was designed to compete against.  In this way, Carlson sees Giga Watt as a managed services provider selling its professional abilities and the cheap power resources that make Washington state one of the more profitable areas of the world to operate equipment.  Those who participate in the sale, Carlson said, will have funds placed in escrow until Giga Watt delivers on supplying the power infrastructure. Giga Watt will, in turn, invest the funds it makes into its own mining capabilities.  ""We would have facilities that are occupied for token holders, then we have facilities that are wholly owned by Giga Watt,"" Carlson explained.  Uncertain economics  For now, even Carlson is a bit unclear on how the economics of the model will play out.  While the idea is to sell the tokens for $1 at launch, he conceded that it's possible the market could drive up the price of the asset in such a way that the value could conflict with their utility. Already platforms like ethereum, designed itself to enable the launch of ICOs and other tokenized assets, are facing challenges related to this difficult dynamic.  Still, Carlson said that this is simply a factor that the market will need to take into account as it participates in the offer.  ""People need to understand that our token is something that works best when it's combined with mining or its buying into a co-location facility or a landlord of power,"" he said.  He further said that investors shouldn't conceive of the token as an asset with boundless utility, or that the token would necessarily provide outsized returns directly.  ""I don't want people to buy the token thinking it's going to do the moon,"" he said. ""People are going to be willing to pay more than what we're selling for, but it's not a share ownership of a company.""  Another factor to keep in mind is that token owners will be served with mining power in a first-come, first-serve manner, meaning those who buy earlier will have access to the token's real-world utility, and the potential earnings from the mining operations.  Launching point  Carlson also stressed the legal work underpinning the offering, which is being issued by Giga Watt's Singaporean entity. (It worked with US law firm Perkins Coie on the structure to ensure that the token wouldn't be deemed a security.)  Carlson said Giga Watt plans to sell 30 million tokens as part of the sale, and he remains confident that potential buyers will capitalize on the opportunity.  ""We can offer this to anyone. You can buy one token if that's meaningful to you. A household could buy a few hundred dollars of tokens and buy more tokens later,"" he said.  For now, Carlson is launching a website to support Giga Watt, which lists its available plans and the costs associated with the purchase. (In a bid for transparency, the firm lets buyers schedule an open house to see the facilities).  On display also are its planned 'Giga Pod' units: mining warehouses that Carlson said have been optimized for efficiency with the years of expertise gleaned in the operation of MegaBigPower, his former operation.  Until the launch, though, he acknowledged that the market needs to now digest the deal and understand how it works. But he believes, if successful, it could be beneficial for the bitcoin network and investors at large.  Carlson concluded:  ""I firmly feel that every household in America could have a small mining operation. It's a vision and it's possible. But, if the non-miner doesn't understand what the opportunity is, that's the hurdle.""

42399866,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvjD,1494493227,PBOC Researcher: Can Cryptocurrency & Central Banks Coexist?,"Yao Qian works in the technology department of People's Bank of China, the country's central bank and financial market regulator.  In this feature article, Qian discusses the relationship between digital currencies and bank accounts, proposing a design concept where bank accounts and digital currency wallets coexist.  While technological direction, risk control and security measures are all important, the effectiveness of digital currency ultimately relies on its successful application.  For a digital fiat currency (DFC) to show vitality and supplement or even replace traditional currency, it has to be user friendly and well received by the public. Currently, the issuance of fiat currency in China follows the 'central bank-commercial bank' system, and most of the social and economic activities are based on the commercial bank account system.  Therefore, if digital currency can leverage existing IT infrastructure with a variety of applications and services, the costs of promoting digital currency would be significantly reduced and its use would be more convenient and flexible, facilitating the wide adoption of digital currency by the public.  In addition, the incorporation of digital currency into existing applications would generate more diversified scenarios, which would contribute to greater competitiveness of digital currency, providing better services.  Breaking ground  The most straightforward way to leverage the bank account system is to expand the scope of central bank's balance sheet.  In fact, claims on central bank of commercial banks and other financial institutions in the form of central bank deposits have already been digitized. However, should the central bank provide such services to broader counterparties? Should non-financial institutions such as households be allowed to open accounts at the central bank?  These questions have triggered a lot of discussions. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Sveriges Riksbank have already studied this topic. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has pointed out the concerns of commercial banks who worry that it would result in a transfer of deposits from commercial banks to the central bank, thus causing the entire banking sector to shrink.  In fact, this is also a common concern of the regulators.  Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), made an incisive yet illuminating comment on this issue, stating:  ""The technological route of digital currency can be either based on bank account system (account-based) or not based on bank account system (non-account-based), and the two approaches may co-exist and operate at different layers.""  However, there are various interpretations on how to implement the design idea. I would like to share some of my thoughts on this.    Digital currency attributes    To offset the shock to the current banking system imposed by an independent digital currency system (and to protect the investment made by commercial banks on infrastructure), it is possible to incorporate digital currency wallet attributes into the existing commercial bank account system so that electronic currency and digital currency are managed under the same account.  The management of digital currency and that of electronic currency have some similarities in areas such as account usage, identity authentication and money transfer, but there are also differences.  Digital currency should be managed in compliance with the standards on wallet design specified by the central bank. The wallet is similar to a safe box which is managed by the bank based on agreement with the customer (eg it requires both keys from the customer and the bank to open the safe box). All the attributes of digital currency and cryptocurrency would be preserved to enable customized application in the future.  One of the merits of the aforementioned approach is that it leverages the current 'central bank–commercial bank' system for currency issuance.  Digital currency, categorized into M0 (a measure of money supply in a central bank), is the liability of the currency-issuing bank (referred to as the issuing bank) and is not on the balance sheet of the bank providing the account (referred to as the account bank).  The approach would not lead to the commercial banks being channelized or marginalized because customers and their accounts are still managed by the account bank. Unlike money transfer, digital currency does not completely rely on bank accounts and the ownership of digital currency can be verified directly by the issuing bank, so as to realize peer-to-peer cash transaction via digital currency wallet on user's end.    The issuing bank could be the central bank or banks authorized by the central bank (as in the Hong Kong dollar issuance model, for example). Determining which model to follow should be based on actual situation. This article is only for the purpose of academic discussions.  Below is an elaboration on the two models.  In the first one, the central bank is the only issuer of digital currency, and in the second one, banks are authorized by the central bank to issue digital currency.    It should be pointed out that the issuing banks are interconnected with the central bank and among themselves on an infrastructure designed by the central bank.  Whether the infrastructure should be migrated to a distributed ledger architecture would be a huge topic for the industry.    To follow the customer-centric strategy of commercial banks, digital currency wallet ID fields could be added to the bank account to enable the account-based and non-account-based models to co-exist and operate at different layers. The wallet serves as a safe box and is not involved in activities such as day-end counting and reconciliation, so as to minimize the impact on the existing core banking system.  The ownership verification of digital currency relies on the issuing bank. The combination of traditional bank account and digital currency can significantly enhance the bank's KYC and AML capabilities.  The digital currency wallet should be designed in compliance with standards specified by the central bank.  The wallet at the bank end is 'lighter', as it only provides security control measures and features at the account level. The wallet offered by the application service providers at the user end would be 'heavier', as the functions of such wallet would extend to the presentation and application layers.  At the user end, the role of smart contracts can be played to the fullest and it would also become one of the core competitive advantages of the application service providers.                    Imagine a scenario where earmarked subsidy is distributed by a central government authority to enterprises or individuals through multiple levels of government. It would be very difficult to track the distribution of the money in the traditional way because it heavily relies on data reported by the local governments at various levels, which usually leads to mismatch between information and cash flow due to poor execution or the lack of procedural compliance.  With the traceability of digital currency and support from access management of smart contracts, the authority would be able to directly oversee the distribution status without relying on other parties. Misappropriation on the part of local governments would be prevented and the money would be assured for dedicated purposes.  If digital currency wallet attributes are not embedded into the bank account system, government agencies at various levels and all the beneficiaries would have to activate and use digital wallets, which would make the adoption of digital currency very complicated as it requires the selection of physical media of digital wallet and the involvement of various parties.  Moreover, the central bank would have to deal with users directly. On the contrary, by leveraging the commercial bank account system, the applications can be upgraded at the backend of commercial banks.  And by using existing accounts, the user experience would remain the same in a sense that users can enjoy digital currency service through existing channels such as bank counters, online banking and mobile banking.                    In a digitalized world, the economic and financial implications of the digits should by no means be confused simply because they are presented in the same numeral form. The same digits may represent different types of assets – a notion that we should keep in mind when designing digital currency.  In terms of the conversion of physical currency into M1 or M2, it's easy to distinguish between physical form and digital form. However, the digital M0 money supply may make people ignore such a distinction.  Does the faster conversion between digital assets mean that the distinctions between different types of digital assets are disappearing?  Fan Yifei, vice governor of PBoC, once wrote:    ""Digital fiat currency would certainly be influenced by [the] existing payment system and information technologies, but it should be distinguished from [the] current payment system so as to focus on service delivery and play its role in replacing traditional currency. Theoretically, the payment system mainly deals with the portion of current deposits in 'broad money', while the digital currency serves as part of M0 money supply.""    By incorporating digital currency attributes into the commercial bank account system, the DFC is integrated into the 'central bank-commercial bank' system by leveraging existing financial infrastructure.  More importantly, this approach takes into account the role of digital M0 in commercial banking system and enables digital currency to either operate independently or run in an environment where bank account and digital wallet co-exist and operate at different layers.  This approach ensures clear division of duties and clarifies roles of different parties, where the issuing banks are responsible only for digital currency itself, the account banks conduct specific business and the application service providers enable the realization of functions. With the adoption of other measures, for example collecting management fees (which practically means negative interest rate), the emergence of 'narrow banking' would be less possible.                  The incorporation of digital currency attributes is also an innovative step for the commercial bank account system. Commercial banks would be able to not only provide digital currency services based on existing infrastructure, but also explore new service models that leverage features of digital currency, which will enhance their service quality and competitiveness.  This article is only a beginning of a series of discussions.  Further studies may focus on standards of wallet design with possible questions to think about as follows:  How to set differentiated currency usage cost and asset pricing policies so as to strike a balance among banknotes, DFC and commercial bank deposits during the transition period?  How to build an ecosystem that involves the central bank, issuing banks, commercial banks, wallet service providers, payment service providers and digital currency users?
