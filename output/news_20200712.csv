42384101,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SVT,1594589400,"Crypto Long & Short: Dogecoin, Market Manipulation and the Downside of a Coinbase IPO","This week saw a 125% rise in the price of dogecoin, a cryptocurrency based on a popular 2013 internet meme, created in the same year as both a parody and a “let’s see if this sticks” experiment. Much to even the founder’s surprise, it has not only survived, it has accumulated a loyal following. Clearly.      A group of teenagers on the extremely popular but recently beleaguered social platform TikTok decided to use their voice and audience to move the price of dogecoin up. It has nothing to do with fundamentals, potential or even government handouts – most participants probably don’t even understand what cryptocurrency is (many of the videos refer to DOGE as a “stock”). It’s about manipulation, just because.      Why is this relevant? Because it is an irresistibly fluffy yet alarming symptom that trust is fundamentally broken in markets.      You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.      When you have the next generation of investors blatantly flaunting that markets are a meaningless casino, when you have them advertising that markets can be manipulated, then you do have to wonder what role markets will have in their lives as they get older.      And much like the day traders picking stocks from a bag of Scrabble tiles, this does raise questions about the role of facts in our interpretation of value.      When markets don’t make any sense, when fundamentals no longer seem to matter, it becomes clear the rules are being rewritten or even thrown out the window. We could be in the creative destruction phase that will give way to a new wave of innovation. And in that wave, new types of assets could have a respectable place in new types of portfolios.      Meanwhile, however, the untethered nature of current price logic is disconcerting, and a reminder that creative destruction can be vicious to those caught in the transition. Uncertainty is not good for trust, and a lack of trust is not good for progress.      So, while I can chuckle with glee at the adorable takes that I can’t resist sharing with you here…      …I’m also wondering what will have changed most in markets two to three years from now. Maybe sanity will have been restored. Or maybe this is sane in comparison to what’s coming.    A Coinbase listing would not necessarily be good for the market    We can’t not talk about the unconfirmed rumors that Coinbase is planning a stock market listing. These rumors are not new, but they have suddenly taken on a renewed relevance. Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the plans, citing sources familiar with the matter. And Coinbase has called an investor meeting, sparking speculation as to why.      Should this happen, it would be a big deal for the cryptocurrency industry, but not necessarily the boost many seem to think.      It would be a big deal for three main reasons:      1) It would focus a lot of mainstream attention on the industry as a whole, as financial reporters throw around the word “crytpo,” as equity analysts scramble to produce reports and as investors are taken aback by the sheer numbers at play in these relatively overlooked markets.      2) We the public would finally get detailed insight into the inner workings and accounts of one of the industry’s most prominent businesses (as an analyst, I’m really looking forward to that).      3) It would provide a listed and liquid opportunity for investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrencies. This could put crypto, albeit indirectly, within reach of any investor, retail or institutional, and possibly give it a home in pension funds, exchange-traded funds, 401(k)s, etc.      How would this boost the cryptocurrency markets?      Increased mainstream attention could encourage more people to learn about cryptocurrency fundamentals, and possibly trigger a wave of new investment. Also, new funding from an initial public offering could mean further growth for Coinbase through a broader reach or a more extensive service.      Now here is where the “buts” come in.      Rather than an IPO, the move could merely represent a handsome exit for the initial investors through a direct listing. Even if so, however, it would set up a pipeline for further financing, which could influence growth further down the road.      And, this is even more important, a public listing of a significant company such as Coinbase would not necessarily encourage mainstream crypto exposure. Investment would be going into a company, not the cryptocurrency market. True, the investment in that private company could encourage more investment in the cryptocurrency market further down the line, but the effect would not be linear.      It could even be a self-defeating proposition. Investors en masse could choose to buy shares in Coinbase instead of buying cryptocurrency directly, which ironically could end up hurting Coinbase’s prospects.      Ok, that’s an extreme extension of the theory, but it’s not totally out of the question.      The net effect of a Coinbase listing, or any other significant cryptocurrency business heading to the frothy stock markets, could be net positive for crypto assets. But it may not be the investment trigger many are hoping for.    Hashrate highs    Bitcoin’s hashrate has hit an all-time seven-day moving average high, less than two months after a miner reward halving led to a 40% drop as unprofitable mining equipment was switched off. The hashrate metric is significant in that it is a proxy for network security – the higher the hashrate, the more computational power is spent on validating transactions and maintaining the network.      So, the hashrate reaching all-time seven-day average highs is being taken as a bullish signal by some. But the numbers don’t bear that theory out.      As we can see, usually after a hashrate peak, both price and hashrate fall over a seven-day and 30-day timeframe. But not always. So, hashrate is worth keeping an eye on, because a growing hashrate indicates growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s outlook. But it should not be used as a trading signal without a lot of caution and additional information.    Anyone know what's going on yet?    You’re probably all aware of how previously underused and reconfigured words and phrases have been given a new life with the current crisis. “Lockdown,” “social distancing,” not to mention “unprecedented”… And some new words are emerging. Here’s one: coronacoaster. I kid you not.      The market has been alternating between fits of euphoria and depression. With the highs higher than the lows, the net effect is up.      The main new factor that impacted the market over the last week was the sharp rise and fall in the Chinese market. While not a large market by U.S. standards, this rally underlines a significant difference in market influences. In the case of the U.S., part of the rally has been encouraged by likes of Davy Day Trader, pushing the retail frenzy to new highs. Whilst, in China, the stock market moves were largely from the government telling retail investors to buy. And then, to not buy.      The bitcoin market, meanwhile, has been … well … uninteresting in terms of price and volumes. Maybe a strong breakout is building, maybe not, and either way, who knows in which direction. Meanwhile the developments in the sector are galloping forward as you will see below in CHAIN LINKS, so the lack of notable market trends does not mean that we get to put down our pencils for a bit and take a breather. Unfortunately.    CHAIN LINKS    Los Angeles-based fund manager Arca has launched its Arca U.S. Treasury Fund, an SEC-registered closed-end fund that invests in U.S. T-bills and notes, and whose digital shares – ArCoins – move on the ethereum blockchain. TAKEAWAY: This is the first time the SEC has allowed a fund represented by blockchain-based tokens to trade under the 40 Act. Technically the fund’s shares will be crypto asset investments, although their value will be based on one of the most stable securities available: short-term U.S. government debt. This is fascinating because it could change the perception that markets and regulators have of crypto assets in general, and it could start to wake general capital markets up to alternative trading mechanisms. Whether this fund takes off or not, it is a pioneering step towards what could be the capital markets of tomorrow.      Kraken Futures, previously known as Crypto Facilities, has been granted a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority. TAKEAWAY: This makes Crypto Facilities the first licensed crypto derivatives platform for the European market, and we could soon see the launch of EUR-denominated crypto products.      The London Stock Exchange Group has added 169 digital assets to its SEDOL Masterfile service, a global database that assigns unique identifiers to financial instruments. This helps LSEG customers keep track of traded assets from execution to settlement. TAKEAWAY: This is not an official seal of “approval,” but it’s worth asking why they would do this if it’s not to include digital assets in their offering at some point in the future.      The CFTC, which regulates the U.S. bitcoin and ether derivatives markets, plans to develop a digital asset innovation blueprint by 2024. TAKEAWAY: That may sound like a long time in the future, but in terms of new regulatory frameworks, it’s actually not, and it does strongly suggest the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is already working on it. So, we can expect more investigation, communication and events from the world’s principal derivatives regulator over the coming months, which should hint at the stance global derivatives regulators around the world could take.      The CENTRE Consortium, which issues the dollar-pegged USDC on top of the ethereum blockchain, blacklisted a USDC address in response to a law enforcement request, freezing $100,000 worth of the stablecoin. TAKEAWAY: That this is even possible – the freezing of a cryptocurrency account – highlights the centralized nature of most fiat-backed stablecoins circulating today, and should reassure regulators that they are not necessarily going to lead to greater money laundering and financial crime. CENTRE’s cooperation with law enforcement, while anathema to original crypto libertarians, could also position it as a complement to the eventual digital dollar, should that come about. There will always be demand for monetary transfer systems with no seizure risk; but institutional participants need to stick to the regulated space, in which the seizure option is likely to be a requirement.      My colleague David Pan outlines the potential impact on crypto market infrastructure of Hong Kong’s national security law. TAKEAWAY: For instance, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act passed by the U.S. Senate this week in retaliation stipulates that the U.S. government should restrict foreign banks and subsidiaries of U.S. banks in Hong Kong from accessing the U.S. dollar system if they conduct significant transactions with China. That could increase market friction as it becomes harder for Hong Kong-based companies to access U.S. dollars. Hong Kong is a significant crypto market hub, so it remains to be seen if this will affect trading volumes. It’s also worth keeping an eye on stablecoin flows, as they could be a short-term workaround.      Ten-day realized volatility is at a two-year low, according to data from skew.com. The last time it was this low, it preceded a sharp price drop. This time, investors point to increased call buying as a sign the breakout might be on the upside. TAKEAWAY: That feeling when an absence of activity is news.      Continuing on the theme that not much is happening in the crypto markets, CryptoCompare’s monthly Exchange Report highlights the relative lack of spot and derivative volumes.      Switzerland-based crypto lender Nexo is preparing to become a prime broker with help from oracle provider Chainlink, which will power audits to bring more transparency to Nexo’s operations. TAKEAWAY: Audited lending and borrowing would be good news for the industry, enhancing trust in the collateral and the yields. I am, however, beginning to sense the emergence of a buzzword (“prime broker”) that is starting to lose its original meaning.      Nic Carter and Matt Walsh of Castle Island Ventures wrote a compelling overview of the evolution of digital dollars, worth a read for anyone trying to keep up with what’s happening in stablecoins (fiat-backed as well as synthetic) and central bank digital currencies.

This episode is sponsored by Bitstamp and Crypto.com.      In this audio interview, CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen and Chaincode Labs researcher Clara Shikhelman talk about bitcoin and what attracted them to it.      As a co-founder of the Israeli Women in Mathematics Association, Shikhelman has been researching complex math problems for nearly a decade. But she said bitcoin offers especially interesting puzzles to solve because this technology may have the potential to change the world. She’s one of many young researchers who identify with the cypherpunk movement.      “There are a lot of people like me, their main thing is academic,” Shikhelman said. “They are not the classic cypherpunk people, but …[t]hey believe in privacy, in political change.”      Until recently, most people associated with the cypherpunk movement were technologists in the 1980s and 1990s who circulated mailing lists about encryption and other privacy tech topics. The term was created by feminist hackitvist Judith Milhon, although it is widely associated with software engineers such as bitcoin veteran Adam Back. Many of the original cypherpunks are still active in the cryptocurrency space today. However, they’ve also inspired a new generation of self-identified cypherpunks with different skills now also exploring the subculture’s proverb that “cypherpunks build things.”      See also: Bootstrapping Mobile Mesh Networks With Bitcoin Lightning      In Shikhelman’s case, she’s focused on mathematical research to make bitcoin’s Lightning Network reliable. Like her predecessors, she shares a love of cypherpunk literature, such as novels by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson. These fantasy worlds help her think outside the box and apply math to ideas with cypherpunk potential, meaning the potential to use privacy tech to promote social change. Such solutions-oriented research is a fundamental part of building technology, just as valuable as adding open source code to a Github repo.    Lightning-fast cypherpunks    “Let’s talk big. Let’s think huge. Let’s talk about thousands of years in the future, changing humanity,” Shikhelman said.      In order to build privacy into the bitcoin ecosystem, technologists first must understand the mathematical aspects of the system. Just as safety equipment works best when it fits the person (an oversized helmet can be more dangerous than none at all), software works best when designed with both the details and holistic value flow in mind.      See also: What Artists Love About Crypto      “Lightning will need more than just onion routing for good privacy guarantees going forward,” said cypherpunk journalist Janine Römer, who writes a newsletter about bitcoin privacy tech. “Lightning is one of many adaptations that will expand Bitcoin's ability to carry larger and larger portions of the global economy.”      Similar to Shikhelman, Römer is a researcher who views herself as part of the broader cypherpunk movement.      “A lowercase ‘c’ cypherpunk,” she joked, acknowledging she was never involved with the movement’s founding fathers.      This social movement is not preoccupied with overthrowing or altering governments, in stark contrast with Bitcoin Twitter’s anarchist undertones. Instead, Römer said, rather than seizing power the movement is focused on “working to make things un-take-over-able."" In short, unseizable assets, self-sovereign data and other types of independence in a digital world.      “I prefer the term ‘informational self-determination,’ which is used in the German constitution,” Römer said.      As for bitcoin, Shikhelman described Bitcoin Core as “pretty much stable and running,” meaning her focus has now turned to privacy-centric usability for the Lightning Network. With regards to bitcoin’s reliability so far, Römer agreed.      “I hope bitcoin will become/keep being something that survives under adversity, and gives the people who use it at least enough privacy that they can escape from whatever preys on them. Whether that's the state, banks, corporations, abusive family or partners,” Römer concluded.

42384068,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NFd,1594555200,Hyper-Stablecoinization: From Eurodollars to Crypto-Dollars,"Pascal Hügli is the Chief Research Officer at Schlossberg&Co, in Switzerland, and author of the book ""Ignore at Your Own Risk: The New Decentralized World of Bitcoin and Blockchain.""      Tribal fighting between Bitcoiners and Ethereans is unabated. Bitcoin is understood as “money crypto,” while Ethereum is labeled “tech crypto.” Bitcoin is sound money that will make all other monies obsolete. Ethereum, on the other hand, is seen as better tech that will update Wall Street's settlement layer. The conflict is incomprehensible to outsiders, and each community says the other has not understood the crypto world’s actual goal and ethos.      You could imagine this conflict going on for years, a sort of ""Game of Thrones"" for blockchain. But there’s another, more hopeful, way of imagining the future. Conceivably, the future will be one where Bitcoin and Ethereum gain greater relevance alongside each other (as Michael Casey argued in his recent column). Both “money crypto” and “tech crypto” will play their roles. It might just not be in the pure sense envisioned by either of the two maximalist groups.    Dollar shackles    We are currently under a crushing dollar yoke. Back in the 19th century, many parts of the world had free banking. Banks were granted unrestricted competitive issuance of currency and deposit money on a convertible basis. But gradually the paradigm of free banking faded away and state-orchestrated fiat currency took hold.      See also: In Race for 2030 Currency Supremacy, the Dollar Is Its Own Worst Enemy      After World War II, much of the world started trading in dollars, making it into a reserve currency. To this day, U.S. Treasurys provide a safe haven in times of financial turmoil, tightening the dollar’s grip on global finance.      Greater dependence on the dollar means greater dependence on the Federal Reserve. As a national bank, the Fed puts national interests first. These oftentimes contradict with other countries’ concerns, leaving them in a tight spot.      As the world has been dollarizing, a paradox has emerged: Although the U.S. central bank is often criticized for inflating its currency, global markets deem the available amount of dollar liquidity to be insufficient. This lack of liquidity has caused financial actors all around the world to start helping themselves.    Eurodollars needed    The world, especially emerging market economies, really needs dollars. The emergence of the eurodollar system in the 1960s was a direct consequence of the Fed not being able to supply the world’s relentless need for extra dollars.      Eurodollars are U.S. dollar accounting entries that are used to settle cash flows between numerous players outside the banking system supervised by the Fed. As such, eurodollars are not subject to U.S. banking regulations. As the economist Milton Friedman pointed out in 1969, eurodollars are created by the bookkeeper’s pen.      Corporations, banks and other international actors are dependent on dealer markets providing enough eurodollar funding to uphold market liquidity and service debt. These private dealers are acting primarily through the shadow banking system. Because the dollar has ascended to become the world’s number one currency with the deepest and most liquid capital market, people all around the globe have been going into dollar debt. There is nearly $60 trillion in dollar-denominated debt globally and immense demand to service dollar debt.    The crypto-dollar system is more transparent than the old euro dollar system based on shadow banking (so named for a reason).    Eurodollars are the world’s way to grapple with recurring short squeezes in the dollar, a global dollar shortage that manifests itself each time with ever greater severity.      See also: Michael Casey – Central Banks, Stablecoins and the Looming War of Currencies      But eurodollars are not actual dollars. They are offshore dollars or could be seen as dollar approximations. In times of crises this becomes evident as financial market actors strive to acquire actual dollars. With every crisis, the Fed also has to pump more dollars into the system, only to nourish the ground for a future crisis. As ongoing turbulence in the repo market and the broader shadow banking system show, the Fed’s actions seem only temporarily to soothe appetite for more and more dollars.      Higher demand for dollars will also imply further depreciation of local currencies against the greenback, especially in emerging markets. The most current example of this is Lebanon, where the local currency has lost at least 50% of its value against the dollar this year. Greater capital controls in these types of markets could well be in store, which would make it harder for debtors to obtain dollars or eurodollars for that matter.    Enter public blockchains    In times like these, public blockchains with a liability-free native asset can act as neutral settlement networks independent of the financial system. The stage is set for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be used as vehicles to alleviate the world’s global dollar shortage.      For example, U.S. dollar stablecoins – so-called crypto dollars running on Bitcoin and Ethereum – are a way to get dollar exposure or dollar proxies. As natively digital bearer instruments with transparent and efficient auditability capacities, crypto dollars are easy to accept and can be traded 24/7/365 with virtually no downtime. They also help circumvent emerging capital controls on traditional finance and eurodollar paths.      See also: Nic Carter – Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      The eurodollar approach was an attempt by private actors to create a dollar funding system outside the U.S., but still within the traditional financial system. Crypto dollars mainly reside outside of the traditional, U.S.-led financial system. Because of its inherent auditability, the crypto-dollar system is more transparent than the old euro dollar system based on shadow banking (so named for a reason).    Upgrade for the Eurodollar    We’re beginning to see the dollarization of public blockchains. Since March, the value of USD-pegged stablecoins has passed $11 billion. Tether could surpass the market cap of Ethereum or even Bitcoin due to growing demand for synthetic dollars and its approximations.      Hyper-stablecoinization will be the upgrade for eurodollar banking. It will once again be private individuals using the innovative tools at their hands to make sure they can get the dollar exposure they need. But this time the tools are public blockchains and cryptographic tokens.      See also: Hasu – USD Stablecoins Are Surging, but Zero Interest Rates Complicate Business Model      The shadow banking system is a way for private actors to pledge collateral to create synthetic dollar funds and approximations. But the crypto world in conjunction with the programmability of public blockchains will take this one step further. Bitcoin and ETH already serve as collateral to create dollar deposits and dollar credit instruments.    A new type of free banking on public blockchain networks is at the horizon. While crypto dollars will be its big driver, bitcoin and ether could play their part as well. As high-powered, non-state collateral these crypto assets could be used to back these future crypto dollars making them even more resilient. It is very likely that we will see more of the following in the future: Crypto-backed stablecoins like Dai, Bitcoin-backed financial services like Valiu or stable crypto dollars redeemable for bitcoin that, for example, Chinese blockchain wallet provider Bixinhttps://help.bixin.com/en/ann-2020-02-13-en/ is planning to launch.
