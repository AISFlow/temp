42397823,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHoX,1407088839,"Why Japan Fell in Love with Monacoin, the Cat Meme Cryptocurrency","Never mind the cute Shiba Inu of dogecoin, people in Japan are falling for a new Internet meme-based cryptocurrency – the locally invented and cat-logoed 'monacoin'.  While it has only about a third the market cap of dogecoin, the scrypt-based monacoin held a 12th place ranking for the past week on Coinmarketcap and was in the top 10 on Cryptocoinrank with a market cap of $6.13m – despite estimates that 90% of its user base is located in Japan.  Few other, if any, non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies have achieved this level of interest with such a geographic concentration of users.  At least five online and physical stores, plus an auction site, now accept monacoin for payments and the currency is traded on five exchanges: three in Japan, China's ybex and the BVI's AllCoin.com. A monacoin tipping systemhttp://monash.pw/bot/, developed by a 17-year-old high school student, is also active.  Monacoin's 90-day price graph has started to look like a mini-version of bitcoin's three-year chart: it has gone from a flatline value of around three yen (¥) through May and June, before rising in early July and shooting up to a high of ¥80 on 1st August. It has since fallen back to ¥44.6 with a market cap of $4.17m at press time (note: ¥1 equals roughly $0.01).  Positive news coverage  Why the sudden dramatic rise and drop? Some interest can be attributed to the WBS TV network in Tokyo, which ran a report on its program 'World Business Satellite'. Viewers said the report was generally positive in nature compared to Japanese mainstream television's coverage of bitcoin, which tends to focus heavily on Mt. Gox and the Silk Road.  The show mentioned a man that recently bought a plot of land in Nagano Prefecture with monacoin as mentioned in a tweet:    こちらの土地、最近「３万２００１モナ」で売買されました。「モナ」というのは日本初のネット上の「仮想通貨」の単位。ビットコイン騒動で一度は下火になった仮想通貨、いま「日本発」で次の動きが出始めています。経済事件簿でお伝えします。#wbs pic.twitter.com/HdQhjH56T6      — ＷＢＳ（ワールドビジネスサテライト） (@wbs_tvtokyo) July 7, 2014      Translation:  ""This piece of land was recently purchased for 32,001 MONA. 'Mona' is an internet-based 'virtual currency' unit started in Japan. Virtual currencies have been on the wane due to bitcoin's scandals, but now the next trend is starting to appear from Japan. Report from our Economic Case Files.""  The subsequent fall could be due to speculators seeing a bubble and dumping their holdings. At the price peak, those 32,001 MONA would have been worth $25,000.  Japan wants something Japanese  The success of the altcoin may also be the result of Japan's desire to produce its own native version of everything, with information in its own language. For years, Japanese shunned Facebook to use the locally-developed social network Mixi. The only downside was it wasn't open to anyone outside Japan.  Apple products and even smartphones in general took slightly longer to take off in Japan, as locals were happy with the Internet-connected handsets they already had.  This so-called 'Galapagos effect' in both technology and entertainment is almost inevitable when you're an island country with 125 million people and a proprietary language. Add to this the fact that bitcoin's documentation, developer materials, forums and most online information are written in English, and it's easy to understand why some in Japan might also want to develop their own cryptocurrency.  There is also plenty of information available in English, including a subreddit.  Keiichi Hida, a prominent digital currency enthusiast and lobbyist with 'Rising Bitcoin Japan' in Tokyo, told CoinDesk it is important to have something to which people could relate:  ""A few early adopters of cryptocurrencies recognized it at an early time. But almost all monacoin information is on Japanese websites and in Japanese. So monacoin was more accepted by other Japanese.""  Hida uses monacoin and, as well as his bitcoin advocacy activities, he and some friends formed the Monacoin Foundation. The foundation has so far promoted the use of the cryptocurrency in Japan by holding three information seminars in Tokyo and Osaka.  Unlike bitcoin, however, monacoin's lead developers are not members of the foundation.  Mystery 'Mr Watanabe'  Monacoin was launched in December 2013 on Japan's Internet mega-forum 2channel ('ni-channeru'). The capital of Japanese online culture, 2channel has over 600 active message boards covering nearly every topic of interest and is one of the more popular sites in the country.  Introducing the altcoin on the forums was the pseudonymous 'Mr Watanabe', who has never revealed his real identity. That may sound familiar. Unlike the equally publicity-shy Satoshi Nakamoto, however, monacoin users are almost certain that Mr. Watanabe is Japanese.  Monacoin is not intended to be a 'national altcoin' in the spirit of Iceland's Auroracoin and its many followers, and there is no 'airdrop' or handout planned so far.  In his original forum post introducing monacoin, Mr Watanabe suggested the coin was a game, with the mission of the game to find its hashes. Just as games like Final Fantasy XIV and DragonQuest had their own proprietary currencies, monacoin would be the same.  Monacoin is not supposed to be similar to securities, he continued, but more like points accrued to be spent only in the monacoin network.  ""I'm writing this clearly so there are no misunderstandings,"" he said.  Becoming its own meme  Monacoin, Hida said, is a good match for Japan's geek/gamer 'otaku' culture. Its name and logo are based on 'Mona', a cat-like ASCII art character used on 2channel. Monacoin tips are popular with manga fans and creators.  A Google image search for 'monacoin' uncovers a plethora of different monacoin memes, 'monacoin-chan' characters and mascots (as well as pictures of Monaco, which has probably missed a trick with the name should it ever decide to launch its own altcoin).  This summer will see the launch of MonaComi, a manga comic based on monacoin which has so far collected 18,000 MONA in donations.

42397807,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHZm,1407069929,Does Bitcoin Need Its Own Silicon Valley?,"When Steve Jobs was a boy, he looked up the name “William Hewlett” in his local phone book and was able to reach the founder of Hewlett-Packard at home. The elder technologist offered the future Apple Computer founder advice, some free components and a summer job.  Anecdotes like that  make it clear how geographical proximity can help one wave of innovation set up the next. Even now, when it's unlikely any young entrepreneur will be able to find Mark Zuckerberg in the Palo Alto phone book, hopefuls with ideas still flock to the stretch of towns flanking the San Francisco Bay. The accelerators are there, as are the venture capitalists' offices, the networking events and the pool of engineers.  Would bitcoin benefit from geographic concentration as much as the tech industry has? Silicon Valley veteran and investor Marc Andreessen raised the idea in a recent article titled “What It Will Take to Create the Next Great Silicon Valleys, Plural”.  “Imagine a Bitcoin Valley, for instance, where some country fully legalizes cryptocurrencies for all financial functions.”  Venture capitalist Tim Draper, who recently purchased 30,000 bitcoins that the US government had seized from the Silk Road, says he already sees Bitcoin Valley forming, within Silicon Valley.  “I believe that the concentration of bitcoin companies around the Boost.vc accelerator will give those companies a real leg up,” Draper said, referring to the San Mateo accelerator founded by his son, Adam, whose portfolio includes BitBox, BitWallhttp://www.bitwall.io/, Coincove and other bitcoin startups.  Bitcoin is not high tech  Concentrated talent and easy exchange of ideas would be good for any burgeoning industry. Yet bitcoin is so different from high tech that it's unclear that what's good for one would be good for the other. Unlike the chip and equipment manufacturers that sparked Silicon Valley, bitcoin companies don't need to set up factories or physical R&D labs to do their thing. And it feels ironic to try to pin down a physical headquarters for an industry based on a global, distributed technology whose very virtue is that users' geographical location doesn't matter.  “Bitcoin Valley, anywhere you want it to be,” Draper joked in an email to CoinDesk.  Most bitcoin leaders admit to having two minds when it comes to the concept of a Bitcoin Valley. Such a thing might be helpful, but is it really needed?  “Now that the internet already exists, something like that is less necessary because everybody can communicate with everybody else,” said bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver in a recent Skype call from a Tokyo restaurant.  Talent pool is vital  To Hemant Taneja of General Catalyst Partners, even in a distributed world, companies still need to position themselves where the talent pool runs deepest, and for bitcoin that could be one of several contender cities.  “New York would give Silicon Valley a run for its money,” he said, pointing to the depth of financial industry talent in the Big Apple.  He continued:  “You can look at talent one of two ways. If the issue of consumer-oriented parts of the bitcoin stack that need to be created is where the winning companies will reside, it will likely happen here in Silicon Valley. If you think the understanding and appreciation of regulations and compliance and financial instruments is the way the next generation of companies will be built, I'm inclined to say New York is where that talent resides.”  Taneja pointed to Boston, home of General Catalyst payments company Circle, as another strong contender, boosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is currently conducting an on-campus bitcoin experiment.  A distributed industry  Meyer ""Micky"" Malka  , founder of Ribbit Capital and funder of Coinbase and other bitcoin companies, sees a more distributed future for the bitcoin industry, with companies cropping up where the user cases are.  With his background in international finance companies, Malka sees a lot of pain points in the developing world; companies in far-flung places may take longer to develop and get funding, but it will happen, he said:  “We're seeing a lot of good ideas all over the world, but the capital is still very concentrated [in Silicon Valley].”  How to become Bitcoin Valley  It may be possible for any location to throw its hat in the ring to host Bitcoin Valley. Bitcoin insiders advise hopeful local or national governments to skip the traditional measures, such as offering companies financial incentives or building R&D centers, and focus on creating a welcoming regulatory climate for bitcoin companies.  Draper warned:  “Our federal government needs to lighten up on the banks using bitcoin, or we will lose all the business to other countries.”  Other countries could compete with the US as centers of bitcoin innovation with innovative regulatory approaches, some have suggested.  “Allowing more experimentation in financial services could help those in countries that don’t have stable currencies (let alone banks) to more easily save and move their money across borders,"" Andreessen wrote. ""Some of these places would leapfrog, innovation-wise, through something like bitcoin”  Ver said he is involved with an undisclosed Caribbean jurisdiction, helping it position itself as a potential bitcoin hub.  “Myslf incuded, thousands of bitcoiners are willing to move anywhere in the world” where conditions are favorable, he said.  However, Taneja pointed out that no matter how favorable the local market conditions are to bitcoin adoption, most companies will only locate a headquarters near the necessary talent. If there ever is a Bitcoin Valley, it will probably be in a location that has both benefits, he said:  “States with the right talent will have an advantage if they create an environment for bitcoin adoption in the market.”  Silicon Valley image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/03/does-bitcoin-need-its-own-silicon-valley,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32e6b433246902dd088e6bbd939668f39112d8f3-1000x606.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397814,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHhe,1407060347,New Index Ranks Argentina 'Most Likely' to Adopt Bitcoin,"Which markets have the greatest potential for bitcoin adoption?  With over $250m of venture capital invested in bitcoin startups to date, much is at stake in understanding which markets will prove most fertile for bitcoin. In addition, many governments and regulatory agencies are seeking to better understand the economic opportunities presented by bitcoin along with the perceived risks.  The new Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI) is the first attempt at providing a rigorous answer to the above question, assembling a new data set to rank the potential utility of bitcoin across 177 countries.  The BMPI can be helpful to entrepreneurs and investors planning international expansion, regulators or economic development agencies wondering whether bitcoin will gain traction in their country, or anyone who wants a better understanding of how bitcoin may progress geographically in the months and years to come.  How can bitcoin adoption be forecasted?  Sitting at the fast-moving intersection of technology, policy and economics, bitcoin is both a fascinating and complex research topic.  One of the first questions that arises in constructing a forecast of bitcoin's potential adoption is what kind of adoption should the index measure?[1]  For example, should the BMPI focus on where bitcoin has the most potential to be used as a store of value? Or should it measure bitcoin’s commercial potential as a medium of exchange? And which of these two is more likely to influence bitcoin’s geographic progression? The answers to such questions have a significant influence on the choice of index variables and weightings.  The BMPI is intended to forecast bitcoin’s total potential adoption and thus includes data which relate both to bitcoin’s function as a store of value and as a medium of exchange, as well as a technology platform.  The data set is structured in such a way that it can also be used to construct alternative versions of the index around different scenarios or more specific use cases. For example, one may believe that bitcoin does not have as much immediate potential in the international remittances market as compared to its use as an alternative investment vehicle or store of value. Or one may feel that Darkcoin is going to supplant bitcoin as the preferred cryptocurrency in the black market and that therefore the size of the informal economy in each country is not a significant factor in bitcoin adoption. Such scenarios can be incorporated into alternative calculations of the BMPI by removing the corresponding variables and or adjusting weights.  Which data is most closely linked to bitcoin adoption?  On the question of what variables to include in the index it is useful to remember the old joke about how economists go about choosing which data to work with:    A drunk on his way home from a bar realises that he has dropped his keys. He gets down on his hands and knees and starts groping around beneath a lamppost. A policeman asks what he’s doing.      “I lost my keys in the park,” says the drunk.      “Then why are you looking for them under the lamppost?” asks the puzzled cop.      “Because,” says the drunk, “that’s where the light is.”[2]    In other words, economists often are forced to use available data rather than the data which, if it did exist, has a stronger relationship to the subject of study.  With bitcoin it could, for example, be quite useful (and more precise) to examine which cities or regions may see the fastest bitcoin adoption. However, much of the relevant data is only available at country level and, as a result, the BMPI analysis is a country-level index.  A further challenge is that even when relevant data exists it only exists for a small subset of countries. For example, publicly available smartphone penetration data – which could be quite helpful in understanding bitcoin adoption – is unfortunately only available for 48 countrieshttp://think.withgoogle.com/mobileplanet/en/. If we were to exclude countries which do not have smartphone penetration data from the BMPI then the index would lose nearly 130 countries.  Another data point which could potentially be helpful for understanding bitcoin adoption is how quickly social norms spread across different countries. After all, using bitcoin requires at least some change in existing behaviour. However, this particular study only covered 25 countries.  In the interest of trying to ensure the BMPI was comprehensive in terms of countries covered, an effort was made to select index variables with available data for a large number of countries.  The more data the better? How should data be weighted?  When it comes to indexes more data does not always equate to ‘better’ results.  However, given the complexity of forecasting bitcoin adoption every effort has been made to include the variables which may have the greatest influence on bitcoin’s progress. Adding additional variables to an index can also help provide a more nuanced ranking of countries.  On the question of how different data should be weighted in the index, can it be reasonably claimed that some variables will be more important to bitcoin’s future than others? If yes, how much more important?  While weighting choices can be controversial, it is often useful in making indexes more realistic, and some variables in the BMPI are therefore weighted more strongly than others.  Some will certainly disagree with the BMPI’s weighting choices, and it is likely that the weightings will be adjusted over time as we learn more about bitcoin adoption. Meanwhile, unlike other bitcoin indexes which do not disclose their weightings it can at least be said that the BMPI weightings and methodology are openly documented.  BMPI data and sources  In constructing the BMPI a high priority was placed on finding both reliable and recent data. BMPI data also comes from a variety of different sources, including governments, multinational agencies, private companies and scholarly research. In total nine principal sources of data were used to construct the BMPI (Table 1).  Table 1: BMPI Data Sources and Time Periods  World Bank (2013, 2012)Bitnodes.io (July 2014)IMF (2013)Sourceforge.net (July 2014)CIA World Factbook (2013)Reinhart & Rogoff (2010)CoinDesk (July 2014)Elgin and Oztunali (2012)Google Trends (July 2014)  In some instances the data sets from Table 1 were supplemented or updated to reflect recent events. For example, Reinhart and Rogoff's financial crisis data were updated with this week's sovereign default by Argentina.  The BMPI variables  The BMPI is comprised of 39 variables deemed important to bitcoin’s potential for adoption. These 39 variables are grouped into seven equally-weighted categories to calculate BMPI’s rankings (Table 2).  Table 2: BMPI Data Categories  Technology Penetration  A full discussion of the relationship between the above categories and potential bitcoin adoption is impractical here due to space constraints but it is useful to highlight some examples.  Bitcoin is fundamentally a technology and the level of technology adoption in a country, as reflected in measures such as internet use and mobile phone penetration, will have an important influence on bitcoin adoption. In addition, the memory of recent financial crises, particularly hyperinflation or a currency crisis, will also have an influence on adoption. The greater the degree of technology penetration, frequency of financial crisis, etc for a particular country then the higher that country ranks on the BMPI.  Why is bitcoin regulation not included in the BMPI?  Just as the choice of variables included in the BMPI must be defended some variables which have been omitted from the BMPI also require justification. For example, one category which was excluded from the BMPI but which could have a significant influence on bitcoin adoption is bitcoin regulation.  The reason why bitcoin regulation was excluded from the BMPI for now is two-fold. First, bitcoin regulation is a recent development and still evolving. Second, and perhaps more importantly, bitcoin regulation may end up cutting both ways in terms of forecasting the likelihood of bitcoin adoption.  On the one hand, more aggressive bitcoin regulation in countries such as Ecuador and Bolivia may ultimately serve as a significant barrier to bitcoin’s prospects in those countries. However, aggressive bitcoin regulation could also provide a signal from regulators about bitcoin’s positive adoption prospects in that country, as perhaps is the case in China.  In sum, it is too early to tell how to score bitcoin regulation and this category has therefore not been included in the overall BMPI rankings.  The BMPI sub indexes  The categories in Table 2 also comprise the sub indexes of the overall BMPI, and these sub indexes allow for micro comparisons. For example, we can compare the rankings in a sub index like Bitcoin Penetration, where the United States is ranked number one by a significant margin over number two Netherlands, with rankings in other categories.  While the Inflation category is based on a single variable (consumer price inflation) most of the categories in Table 2 contain multiple variables. For example, the Bitcoin Penetration category contains the following four variables:  Global bitcoin nodes  Google ‘bitcoin’ search share  Bitcoin client software downloads  Bitcoin venture capital investment (dollar amount by country)  The Bitcoin Penetration sub index is laid out in detail in Table 3.  Table 3: Bitcoin Penetration Sub Index Variables  CategoryVariableSub VariableSourceBitcoin penetrationGlobal bitcoin nodesa) Total Bitcoin nodesBitnodes.iob) Global Bitcoin nodes per capitaBitnodes.io / World BankBitcoin client software downloadsa) Total client downloadsSourceforge.netb) Client downloads per capitaSourceforge.net / World BankGoogle 'bitcoin' searchesGoogle TrendsBitcoin VC investmentCoinDesk  As noted earlier, not all BMPI variables are equally weighted.  For example, the score for the 'Global bitcoin nodes' variable is broken down into two equally weighted sub variables – total bitcoin nodes per country and bitcoin nodes per capita. Sub variables were utilized in this case so that small countries with a high per capita number of nodes, such as Iceland, are not disadvantaged in the overall index ranking due to the small size of their population or economy.  A summary of the BMPI dataset can be found in Table 4.  Table 4: BMPI Dataset Summary  CountriesCategoriesVariables177739  As a point of reference, the widely cited Legatum Prosperity Index includes 89 different variables for 142 nations around the world.  The BMPI Top 10  The 10 countries with the highest potential for bitcoin adoption according to the Bitcoin Market Potential Index can be found in Table 5.  Table 5: BMPI Top 10 Countries  RankingCountry Name1Argentina2Venezuela3Zimbabwe4India5Nigeria6Brazil7United States8Nicaragua9Russian Federation10Iceland    Given the BMPI’s criteria it is not surprising to see Argentina ranked number one. The country suffers from persistently high inflation, has a large informal economy and a history of recent financial crises. In addition, Argentina has a relatively high degree of technology penetration and controls on the movement of capital. Argentina also just defaulted on its sovereign debt for the second time in 13 years. While external sovereign defaults have a relatively minor weighting in the BMPI this recent development is reflected in the BMPI rankings.    Like Argentina, number two ranked Venezuela also suffers from relatively high inflation and frequent financial crises, while number three ranked Zimbabwe has the largest informal economy (black market) of any country in the dataset at 63% of GDP.  A country which often features in discussion of bitcoin adoption but which is just outside of the top-10 is China, which is ranked number 13. China’s ranking is brought down by its relatively small black market; according to Elgin and Oztunali (2012) and other shadow economy researchers – ie Buehn and Schenider (2012), Schneider, Buehn and Montenegro (2010) – it is estimated that roughly 10% of the economic activity is conducted informally in China.  In contrast, near the bottom of the overall BMPI rankings at number 167 is Ireland, which recently hosted a high-profile bitcoin conference. While Ireland scores well in some categories, such as technology and bitcoin penetration, the country has wrestled with deflationary pressures in recent years and also has a relatively limited set of restrictions on the flow of capital. Dublin is a global tech hub, however, and the fact that the BMPI does not include a separate tech hub variable brings down Ireland’s ranking.  A full list of the BMPI rankings as well as a more detailed discussion of the index methodology, data and sources is available here.  An impossible challenge?  While indexes like the BMPI can provide a useful reference point to better understand factors which may influence bitcoin adoption it is important to acknowledge the limitations that are inherent in the construction of any such ranking. Countless variables not included in the index will influence adoption, data sets are often incomplete, and index methodology choices can have a significant influence on rankings.  More will be written about the Bitcoin Market Potential Index in the weeks to come on CoinDesk and in the State of Bitcoin reports, and the BMPI will also be updated periodically as new data becomes available.  Any surprises in the BMPI results? What data is missing from the BMPI? Share your thoughts in the comments below.  [1] Here the term 'adoption' means use and is captured in metrics such as number of bitcoin accepting businesses, number of wallets, and other use metrics. Unfortunately country level data does not exist for many of these adoption metrics.
