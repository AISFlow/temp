42388268,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCV5Z,1672703139,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Celebrates the New Year With Old Pricing, Holds Steady at $16.7K","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin inches up but remains in its recent, narrow range; other major cryptos see green.  Insights: Crypto exchange tokens are responding more to news developments than what regulators might be contemplating.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMIP) 824.68 +8.1 ▲ 1.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,704 +96.2 ▲ 0.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,216 +15.7 ▲ 1.3% S&P 500 daily close  3,839.50 −9.8 ▼ 0.3% Gold  $1,833 +13.0 ▲ 0.7% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.88% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Celebrates the New Year With Old Pricing  By James Rubin  New year. Old story.  As investors savored the waning hours of the extended New Year's holiday weekend, bitcoin plugged along in the same narrow range it occupied for the last 15 days of 2022.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at about $16,700, up 0.6% over the past 24 hours amid light trading typical for the holiday season. BTC has been hovering between $16,400 and $17,000 since mid-December when fears about inflation and sharp recession rekindled.  Whether crypto prices rebound in 2023, and if so, when, is uncertain, although analysts seem unified in the belief that market misery won't exceed the torment of 2022 when crypto exchange giant FTX's November failure capped a year of industry shipwrecks.  ""The crypto community won't be sad to see the back of 2022 and who can blame them?"" quipped Craig Erlam, senior analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in a recent email. ""Who knows what's to come in 2023 but at the very least, they'll be hoping to put the FTX scandal behind them and focus once more on innovation and adoption.""  Yet, Erlam also noted warily: ""That may be a lot to ask in the short term, especially if other market factors aren't favorable. No doubt it will be another intriguing year for the space.""  Ether followed BTC's Monday path to stick in its own two-week range between $1,150 and $1,230. The second largest crypto by market value was recently trading at about $1,215, a 1.3% gain from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptos spent the day largely in the green with XRP, the token of the XRP open-source public blockchain, XRP Ledger; and MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon Network, rising more than 4% and 3%, respectively.  SOL, the native cryptocurrency of embattled blockchain platform Solana, continued a surge that began last week when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted positively about the protocol. SOL was recently up 13%, although at just above $11, it has lost 93% of its value from a year ago when it was trading over $176 – a result of its entanglement with the imploded Terra ecosystem and FTX.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently jumped 1.5%.  Last Friday, equity indexes closed their own year of distress fittingly with the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all falling slightly. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted a whopping 33%, while the S&P, which has a robust technology component, plunged nearly 20% as markets flinched from the heavy body blows of macroeconomic uncertainty, socio-political unrest and rising prices.  Meanwhile, FTX ripples continued to widen with a co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini accusing Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert of “bad faith stall tactics” as their respective companies tangle over a business disagreement precipitated by FTX’s multi-billion-dollar implosion late last year.  Cameron Winklevoss blasted Silbert in an open letter posted to Twitter, alleging crypto broker Genesis Global Capital and its parent company, DCG, owe Gemini’s clients $900 million. The letter alleges Gemini has awaited word on a repayment agreement for six weeks to no avail. DCG is also CoinDesk’s parent company.  Silbert responded, tweeting that DCG delivered to Genesis' and Gemini’s advisers a proposal on Dec. 29, 2022, and has not had any response.  Looking ahead to the wider landscape, Oanda's Erlam wrote that much ""now hangs on the economic data and how companies plan to adapt to a potentially impending recession.""  ""The data towards the back end of 2022 wasn't as promising as hoped and the communication from the Fed and others has remained more hawkish than investors would like,"" he wrote.

Insights  Exchange Tokens Don't Care What the SEC Might Do  By Sam Reynolds  FTX’s FTT exchange token is a security.  That’s the uncontested comment the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made in its complaint against former Alameda Research executive Caroline Ellison in the last days of 2022.  Since then, many exchange tokens are up. CoinGecko data shows that during the last week, OKX’s OKB token has risen a staggering 30%; BNB has posted 1.5% gains; and KuCoin’s KCS is up 1.7%. Huobi’s HT is down 4%, and Crypto.com’s Cronos has dropped 4.2%, although these are both pretty moderate for digital asset markets.  For years, the market has treated exchange tokens like a security by any other name.  Sure, executives at exchanges would be quick to tell you that these tokens have many characteristics that are unlike a traditional investment contract – namely utility, such as discounts for large holders – but the price of exchange tokens tends to follow the news. Indonesia’s Tokocrypto exchange token rallied when it was leaked out that Binance was going to buy the exchange; Binance’s BNB token drops on bad news; FTX’s FTT fell precipitously in early November, going from $22.50 to $1.50 in a week, after CoinDesk broke the fateful news about Alameda’s balance sheet.  ""If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings,"" the SEC wrote in its December complaint. ""The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.""  Case law favors SEC  All these claims the SEC is making in its complaint are going uncontested. They aren’t being tested in court in the usual adversarial fashion because Ellison is agreeing with all of them by virtue of her desire to admit guilt and settle.  And thus, now the SEC has case law on its side to go after the other half-dozen prominent exchange tokens on the market. Exchanges might say that this isn’t an issue because in prior cases of the SEC calling tokens a security, the defendants have argued that U.S. laws shouldn’t apply to them as they are by all accounts offshore, not specifically marketing to those residing stateside, and run by non-Americans.  But FTX was also offshore, and had measures present to block U.S. residents from opening accounts on the platform (instead, directing them to FTX U.S.). Yet, millions of Americans lost money on FTX, so this argument isn’t going to work.  But could it be that the market is already pricing in a hostile regulator?  “SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been emphatic about his views that generally crypto products should be regulated as securities,” Ross Feingold, special counsel at Taipei-based Titan Attorneys at Law, told CoinDesk. “Numerous recent enforcement actions by the SEC show its willingness to bring charges against crypto exchanges, those offering new crypto, and cryptocurrency spokespersons.”  Feingold thinks that for the SEC, the case is easy to make, given the criteria the Howey Test has.  “One could simply swap out the name of the crypto product with the name of a company's shares or some other investment products that we usually think of as security; for the SEC it doesn't matter, as it is applying the traditional test,” Feingold said.  Foreign regulators actions?  One wild card might be if other regulators worldwide follow suit and target exchange tokens, too. Regulators in most of Asia, for instance, have historically approached crypto with a light touch. Binance and FTX aren’t blocked off as they are in the U.S. But this could change.  In Taiwan, for instance, retail investors lost an estimated $500 million with the collapse of FTX. Indonesia, where crypto traders outnumber stock traders, is already planning stricter regulation post-FTX with its Financial Service Authority given a mandate to come up with a better regulatory framework to protect investors.  “An interesting aspect of the SEC's willingness (or eagerness) to treat crypto as a security is that it gives regulators elsewhere, including here in Asia, cover to simply follow the SEC's lead, rather than make a determination on their own whether crypto is a security or issuing crypto specific public offering or trading regulations,” Feingold said.  The market might have already priced in a hostile SEC, but let’s see if it has accounted for other regulators simply following the commission's lead.

6925709,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514430,1672700438,"Valkyrie Investments Wants To Take Over Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Reveals Plans","The state of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest BTC trust in the world, has sparked concerns among investors in the space. With such a large discount to net asset value (NAV), there have been discussions on where the fund goes from here and if it is in trouble. Valkyrie Investments has now joined the conversation but is taking an entirely unexpected route. Valkyrie Wants The Grayscale Bitcoin TRUST In a statement that was released on Dec. 28, co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments Steven McClurg revealed the company’s interest in taking over the management of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The statement highlights the unique challenges that are being faced by the GBTC and present the Valkyrie team as the best to manage the fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Remains Steady As BTC Stalls At $16,000 It points to its experience in managing its own bitcoin fund, which it says has been operating with daily liquidity since it was launched a year ago. In addition, it also puts forward its experience with its multiple publicly traded BTC ETFs that were launched in 2021 as a good reason for why it would be a good fit. “We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done,” the statement said. However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.” The company also announced a brand new fund called the “Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, LP” which it says was created to help investors take advantage of the GBTC discount to NAV. “we are very interested in realizing the true value of the underlying bitcoin for our investors and will actively pursue this goal on their behalf,” McClurg said. GBTC sells trading at $8.11 | Source: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) on TradingView.com The Roadmap To Success Valkyrie’s statement also included its plan to actually improve the management of the Grayscale bitcoin trust if it were to take over. These were divided into three points. The first was that it plans to facilitate orderly redemptions for investors at NAV when they want it through a Regulation M filing. According to the statement, this would allow the investors to redeem shares without delays and at a fair price. Next was the plan to lower the fees associated with the fund. Valkyrie wants an over 50% reduction in the fee to fit in with best industry practices. As such, it plans to reduce the fee from 200 basis points to 75 basis points. Related Reading: Santiment: Bitcoin Will Trend Lower Because Whales Are Still Selling Last but not is the fact that Valkyrie wants to honor investor share redemptions in both BTC and cash. Its reasoning behind this was that it believes that it gives investors “greater flexibility and choice when it comes to redeeming their shares.” McClurg closes out the statement with a call for the statement to be considered. “We are committed to putting the interests of GBTC shareholders first, and we have the experience and expertise to do so effectively,” the co-founder said. The GBTC discount to NAV remains high despite some recovery recorded as 2022 drew to a close. It had reached a high of 48.57% on Dec. 16 but by the end of the day on Friday, Dec. 30, the GBTC discount had fallen to 45.17%.

We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Blofin In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. Ben Lilly: “ (…) for fundamentals… Nothing has changed. If anything, builders are building faster than ever before. All of us veterans know that right now are the most productive weeks you can have in crypto. It is a blessing to those that can weather such bearish times.” And now, for a bonus round, we spoke with Ben Lilly, Co-Founder at Jarvis Labs, the on-chain analytics and token design firm tracking the crypto market. Lilly offered his views on the industry’s current state, why the Bear Market must be used as a time for building, and why the nascent class has matured. This is what he told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: In December 2021 we were discussing whether or not the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow through on rate hikes in the face of bubbling inflation. A year later, what we’ve seen is a strategic push on saying they will take two steps, and instead take three in a hawkish/bearish manner. It has not only hurt markets, but ensured markets could not find any solid footing to build momentum on. This mentality led to a rapid hiking regime. The down wind effects were dollars as a currency were the asset to hold. And most everything else lost value to the dollar. A lot of people like to say Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other assets “lost value”. This is a misnomer. We price things in U.S. dollars, and relative to the dollar, these assets lost considerable value. What a lot of people are also slowly realizing is that most participants in crypto markets are and were speculators. This is rather unfortunate, in my opinion. And something I look to track better with data. The drop in speculators (and many market makers closing up shops) has left a significant hole in liquidity. We are well aware of this. It is very difficult for market makers to run smoothly on some second tier exchanges as the books are pretty dry. We understand this well as we began to explore market making since our team has run autonomous trading systems for half a decade now. Clients are asking us more now than ever to do market making, so our team has begun ramping up these operations for 2023. As for fundamentals… Nothing has changed. If anything, builders are building faster than ever before. All of us veterans know that right now are the most productive weeks you can have in crypto. It is a blessing to those that can weather such bearish times. I’m seeing some really impressive tech solutions coming to fruition right now. Our team is testing some of them currently and look to broaden our functionality onchain in the coming months – something we’ve been exploring for years now. To us, it’s a testament to the fundamentals of the industry only getting better. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: Operations that take place onchain are becoming more desirable than before. Our clients are pushing us in this direction, which tells us the don’t trust, verify mentality is becoming more prominent. I love hearing this and hope to push everything we do to be fully onchain in the years to come. I’ll put it this way, never would I have imagined our team would be looking into zero knowledge technology to run part of our operations. To put it simply, the vision is the same, just more crystallized – a process that will keep happening as years pass. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: The significant moment was GBTC sliding into negative NAV. As the tide was pulled out in 2022, we learned what was really happening in the waters of crypto, and we see many blowups having origins with the Grayscale Trust product. Three Arrows Capital, Genesis, DCG, BlockFi, Voyager, and others were all associated with the Trust and as the value of the Trust was more than the worth of all the shares outstanding (negative NAV), market dynamics caused spot demand to wane around April 2021. The timing with this and what the U.S. Federal Reserve did with rate hikes was like a double edge sword where both edges were pointed in the same direction. Higher rates and lower spot demand due to a toxic Grayscale product meant the bear market sword cut twice as much. As for 2023, I still think some of the worst is yet to come. I’m not necessarily referring to price here. I’m talking about operations not having enough cash to weather the winter. Revenues are down, new entrants to crypto are down. While I think this is good in a way because it rids the industry of poorly run businesses, it’ll cause some headline fears for the industry as companies close their doors. It won’t be the end of the industry from my vantage point. Those that have capital have plenty of runway. And even those that don’t have multi-year runways are staffed by very passionate builders. By the end of 2023 we will see the market coming back to life with lots of excitement. I don’t believe it’ll be a full blown bull market by any means… It’ll be more about projects rolling out the things that they’ve been busy building for the year. You give a bunch of crypto devs a year to build, the results are jaw dropping. Q: And, of course, we have to ask; many claim that the FTX collapse is setting the industry back to the 2018 bear market. Back to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) era, to the so-called “Wild Wild West” days of crypto, what do you think about this idea, and where do you think the industry stands now? More importantly, what is Jarvis’ role in this context, and where do you aim to be in 2023 and beyond? A: Crypto is maturing just like all of us do as we age. You ask anybody who has had ups and downs if they were set back to when they were a younger version of themselves… Most will say they are much wiser, and often the setbacks is how we truly realize our potential. Crypto is the same. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Tony Spilotro We discussed earlier about how onchain solutions are more in demand than ever… Well the industry had a bad go at centralized entities like FTX, which had one goal of making money, and not contributing to the space.

We have teams building software solutions, new metrics, dashboards, token designs, algorithms, and a few other things that we will unveil soon.

The crypto market suffered from high-profile bankruptcies, including the FTX meltdown, as well as a wider risk-off sentiment spurred by fast-rising interest rates and concerns about the future of the economy. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the general public's totem for the crypto market, dropped about 65% in 2022. Many pro-crypto arguments that fueled its rise in previous years underwent intense scrutiny, from Bitcoin's potential as an inflation hedge to the idea that a market can function effectively absent substantial regulatory oversight. Here are Seeking Alpha editors' picks for some of the best contributor work predicting the crypto meltdown during 2022. Recognizing Crypto Winter Was Coming Crypto entered 2022 with a lingering sense of enthusiasm. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reached a high near $69K during November, 2021. It came well off that peak by the end of 2021, yet still hovered above $47K as the year began. But some experts saw troubled times ahead. Seeking Alpha contributor Clem Chambers in January anticipated that crypto was nearing a crash -- one of the sharp pullbacks that has marked the crypto's history. ""If we see sub-$40K, a move to $20K territory will follow quickly,"" he predicted. (Even this would prove overly optimistic, as BTC-USD would fall below $15.5K at one point.) Along with technical signs of trouble, Chambers based his prediction on an insight that ""retail is bored of crypto"" as 2022 dawned. He also accurately predicted that Bitcoin ""is not an inflation hedge in the current market."" Another contributor, BiotechValley Insights, added to the bearish voices early in the year. The analyst said crypto investors would encounter a perfect storm of negative drivers that will crush the sector's inflated price throughout the year. Yet another prescient call came from SA contributor BOOX Research , who in January saw rough waters ahead for the crypto market. In making its argument, BOOX highlighted the fact that market participants' treatment of Bitcoin was similar to that shown to ""high-growth momentum technology stocks and more speculative areas of the market"" -- a coupling that would likely continue. This came as ""macro uncertainties including rising interest rates and questions regarding the strength of the economy have added to poor sentiment towards crypto,"" BOOX wrote. Surviving 2022 ... and Looking to 2023 Many aspects of this perfect storm predicted by BiotechValley Insights and others later materialized. TerraUSD ( UST-USD ), the third largest stablecoin by market cap, ranked among the casualties. The crypto lost its peg to the U.S. dollar in May, pushing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to as low as ~$30K . Its sister coin Luna ( LUNA-USD ) also lost market confidence. There was further damage ahead. In the second half of the year, the market was undermined by a string of high-profile crypto-related companies falling victim to liquidity issues, including many filing for bankruptcy . The most high profile of these was the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX ( FTT-USD ), once touted as a stabilizing force in the industry. The fallout caused a domino effect in the sector, which is yet to completely subside. Before the FTX implosion, Chambers said ""the chance of seeing $15K this year is high"" . Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dropped to a low below $15.5K in November after the FTX collapse, ~77% decline from its record high of ~$69K in November 2021. The bear market also forced crypto miners to sell assets and Bitcoin reserves , some even limiting operations or filing for bankruptcy . SA contributor Made Easy-Finance warned of the impending doom for miners if Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell to $10K. ""Bitcoin miners might risk insolvency ... we found that total all-in costs of a mining company are $25K to ~$40K per BTC,"" it said. But crypto bulls are still optimistic. BOOX Research said the FTX saga may mark a necessary reset for the crypto sector ahead of a rebound , while Knox Ridley remains bullish owing to increasing adoption of bitcoin . This short-term bear, long-term bull sentiment was common even among the group predicting a sharp drop in 2022. In his January piece outlining the near-term bear case for Bitcoin, Chambers still contended, ""Even if BTC tanks to $10,000, it’s still going to hit $100,000 come 2025/2026."" On the other hand, many believe the crypto recovery may never materialize. ""Fundamentally, I believe the market for Bitcoin and crypto should have never grown to what it is today. Already, there has been significant pain caused by its downturn. More likely than not, this pain will continue,"" Daniel Jones cautioned . Read why SA author Jeremy Blum believes investing in gold is more advantageous than cryptos .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3921173-look-back-crypto-winter-2022-bear-market-bitcoin-crash?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6920379.jpeg

After experiencing months of downside pressure, there seems to be no room for further losses. Related Reading: Billion-Dollar Hedge Fund Is Betting Against Bitcoin And Grayscale, Not Just USDT As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,700 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. On higher timeframes, BTC’s price records similar price action. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market capitalization follow this trajectory. Will History Repeat For Bitcoin? Pain Levels Max Out According to analyst Will Clement from Reflexivity Research, the price of Bitcoin is approaching critical levels on its Net Realized Profit and Loss Over Market Cap. This indicator measures the capital gain or loss for the cryptocurrency. As seen in the chart below, the metric is nearing levels of absolute capitulation when the crypto market and its participants are at their lowest. The industry approached a similar level in 2018 when BTC crashed from $20,000 and Ethereum from $1,400. In 2014 and 2015, the metric dropped into this territory following the collapse of the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox. Today, with the collapse of prominent crypto companies, such as FTX and Three Arrows Capital, the market is close to previous cycle bottoms. Clemente said the following about this metric and its implication for the price of Bitcoin: Capitulation, represented by net realized losses adjusted for market cap, is on-par with any prior macro Bitcoin bottom. Major pain is being felt in this market. January Is The Worst Month To Expect Profits? Despite the metrics and indicators pointing towards extreme market sentiment and capitulation levels, the timing might remain unfavorable for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency might see further sideways price action and additional losses until there is a change in macroeconomic conditions. Additional data from a pseudonym analyst indicates that January is historically a red month for the cryptocurrency. In the past two years, the returns for BTC in January were a historical exception. Since 2015, the cryptocurrency has been trading in the red during January, recording some of its worst losses. 2023 could see BTC return to that dynamic, but this period of losses might precede two months of gains.

Cameron Winklevoss blasted Silbert in an open letter posted to Twitter, alleging crypto broker Genesis Global Capital and its parent company, DCG, owe Gemini’s clients $900 million. The letter alleges Gemini has awaited word on a repayment agreement for six weeks to no avail. DCG is also CoinDesk’s parent company.  Silbert responded, tweeting that DCG delivered to Genesis' and Gemini’s advisers a proposal on Dec. 29, 2022, and has not had any response.  Winklevoss also accused the DCG CEO of using $1.675 billion in money Winklevoss claimed DCG ""owes"" Genesis and using it for purposes that helped other DCG ventures instead of repaying creditors.  “You took this money – the money of schoolteachers – to fuel greedy share buybacks, illiquid venture investments, and kamikaze Grayscale [net asset value] trades that ballooned the fee-generating [assets under management] of your Trust, all at the expense of creditors and all for your own personal gain.”  Silbert responded, tweeting that DCG “did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis."" He also said DCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding.  DCG does have a $1.1 billion promissory note related to liabilities from Genesis related to the Three Arrows Capital default. In November Silbert wrote in a note to shareholders that DCG had a roughly $575 million liability to Genesis Global that is due this May.  Gemini Trust Co., which is co-owned by Winklevoss and his twin brother Tyler, paused redemptions on an interest-earning product called Earn in mid-November, a week after rival crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy. The product offered investors opportunities to yield as much as 8% interest on their crypto by lending those digital tokens out to Genesis.  Gemini’s redemption pause came on the heels of Genesis' announcement that its derivatives business had roughly $175 million locked on now-insolvent FTX’s platform. Genesis halted withdrawals and suspended new loan originations when FTX filed for bankruptcy. Since then, creditors to Genesis have been working with restructuring lawyers to prevent insolvency.  Winklevoss’ letter comes as his company faces major financial headwinds, including a lawsuit against the firm’s Earn product alleging fraud and securities law violations, and a mob of angry Earn customers who have been unable to access their accounts.

Even after its Vasil hard fork, an event likened to the Ethereum Merge, the token still continued its downward spiral to its current price of $0.2491. One reason that pushed ADA’s price down is the current macroeconomic situation. During the first quarter of 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates until last month which is the seventh rate increase in 2022. This in turn had adverse effects on the market, pushing the price of both traditional finance instruments and digital assets down. But 2023 seems to have a new effect on the struggling ecosystem.

However, there seems to be a turn in the tide for the digital asset as it receives support from Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik Buterin Offers Support To Solana Taking to Twitter, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin expressed support for Solana for the first time. Solana which had been the fiercest competitor of Ethereum had been unable to keep up given its ties to FTX crypto exchange, its sister company Alameda Research, and its disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried, but Buterin is not pleased that the competitor is essentially crumbling.

Buterin himself explains that he couldn’t tell if this was true looking in from the outside but said that he hoped that “the community gets its fair chance to thrive. This tweet was made about four days ago and it had an incredibly positive impact on Solana. SOL Price Rallies On Buterin Comments The price of SOL saw an upward trend following the tweets from the Ethereum founder.

Since then, the ecosystem’s native token MATIC has not left its current support of $0.7550. This spot has left MATIC in a very delicate situation even as Polygon itself is setting itself apart from competitors. Related Reading: Avalanche Exits 2022 With 10% Decline – Will AVAX Recoup That Loss This Week? Polygon Going Strong The ecosystem has ended 2022 on a beautiful note, though. Although the year’s bear market clawed through MATIC’s gains, the ecosystem is thriving with partnerships. As of writing, the Ethereum L2 has over 20 partnerships with major brands like Nike, StarBucks, and Reddit. They mostly dealt with being the ideal NFT platform for their respective NFT collections or marketplace. Year to date, the NFT market of Polygon reached $305 million in trade value. This isn’t the only bullish development on the platform. Bhavish Finance, a newly built prediction market platform, has reached new highs. According to the most recent tweet of Bhavish regarding its key metrics, the market platform breached 1,100 weekly active users with over $1.287 million predictions made on the platform. According to Bhavish’s own website, the platform is handling over $90-$100 million in predictions and gains an average of $2.5 million to $3.5 million. Major Headwinds Expected The ecosystem certainly is bullish, but the token is far from it. As of press time, MATIC is up by only 0.1%, showing signs of possible weakness. MATIC has certainly suffered along with the entire crypto market following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Showing strong correlation to both Bitcoin and Ethereum, MATIC is set to have a bumpy 2023. If ever BTC and ETH continue to suffer in the midst of possible hikes in interest by the U.S. Federal Reserve, we might see MATIC experiencing more pain. However, this is offset by eye-catching developments on-chain. MATIC total market cap at $6.8 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Decentraland (MANA) Sheds 90% In 2022 Despite Solid NFT Volume Performance Most notable of these is the migration of y00ts and DeGods NFT collection to Polygon. This is a massive win for both Polygon and Ethereum against the touted “Ethereum killer” Solana. But with MATIC stuck on an oscillating path until now, the token’s holders can’t capitalize on the growth of the ecosystem just yet. For investors and traders, the current support being this strong can support any upward growth. However, any bullish momentum that can be gained can only be attained above the current resistance at $0.8157.

Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Hasn’t Been Able To Catch Any Momentum Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the taker buy/sell ratio hasn’t moved much above or below 1 since August 2022. The “Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the taker buy volume and the taker sell volume. When the value of this metric is greater than one, it means the buy or the “long” volume is higher in the market right now. Basically, this means that there are more buyers willing to purchase BTC at a higher price currently, and thus the buying pressure is stronger. On the other hand, values of the indicator under the threshold suggest the taker sell volume is more dominant at the moment. Such values imply a bearish sentiment is shared by the majority of the investors currently. Naturally, the ratio being exactly equal to one indicates the taker buy and taker sell volumes are exactly equal right now, and therefore the market is evenly split between bullish and bearish mentalities. Related Reading: Ethereum Finishes 2022 With ATH Correlation To Bitcoin, Despite The Merge Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 14-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio over the last few years: The 14-day SMA value of the metric seems to be close to 1 at the moment | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the relevant points of the trend for the 14-day SMA Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio. It looks like whenever the indicator has crossed the 1.03 level, BTC has observed some bullish momentum shortly after. On the contrary, whenever the ratio dipped below the 0.97 level, a bearish trend followed the crypto’s price. The last time this signal formed was back in April 2022, before the market observed the LUNA and 3AC collapses. The bullish signal was last seen in July 2022, as the crypto built up towards its first relief rally of the bear market. Since then, however, there have been no other breaches of either of these levels, as is apparent from the chart.

Litecoin Starts 2023 On A Positive Note 2022 was a terrible year for the entire cryptocurrency sector as the long bear market resulted in losses of more than 50% for most of the coins. Litecoin was no exception; the asset ended the year with a drawdown of about 53%. This year, however, may very well turn out to be different for LTC as the coin seems to have observed a strong start so far. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading around $75, up 7% in the last 24 hours. The below chart displays the recent trend in the crypto’s price. Looks like the value of the crypto has shot up during the past day | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView The reason why this year could be better for LTC investors is that the next halving is set to take place this year. A “halving” is a periodic event where the block rewards of miners are permanently cut in half, meaning that the supply production of the coin itself is halved. Related Reading: Most Public Crypto Firms Underperformed Bitcoin In 2022, Miners Hit Worst Since supply being constrained like this makes the asset scarcer, such an event can have a bullish effect on the price. Therefore, Litecoin holders have been hoping that a rally would build up soon, ahead of the halving scheduled for this August. As the graph shows, Litecoin has certainly already made a great start to the year, observing sharper upwards momentum than any other top coin. Though, currently, it’s unclear whether this would be the push that leads the coin to a proper halving rally, or if it’s another temporary rise before the real rally starts. Despite LTC’s poor performance during 2022, there were still some positive takeaways for the coin. For example, the network processed over 39 million transactions in the year, a new record.

6895300,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514393,1672660854,"Billion-Dollar Hedge Fund Is Betting Against Bitcoin And Grayscale, Not Just USDT","The pressure continues to mount on Grayscale with its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and parent company Digital Currency Group. And as Ram Ahluwalia, CEO and co-founder of crypto-native investment advisor Lumida, pointed out in a recent thread, two new characters, Valkyrie Investments and Fir Tree have entered the “Shakespearean drama.” The motivation of the second, in particular, is very dubious. Fir Tree is a hedge fund with about $3 billion in assets under management (AUM) and hundreds of holdings. The SEC 13F filings show that Fir Tree holds First Citizen’s Bank, KKR, Comcast, and hundreds of other securities. They are also large investors in oil and tobacco. Ahluwalia, therefore, raises the question of why Fir Tree, as a value investor, has an interest in GBTC and filed a lawsuit against Grayscale in early December, especially since the hedge fund does not own a lot of GBTC. Fir Tree Capital Management filed the lawsuit seeking information that could be used to force changes to the way the company operates its flagship Bitcoin Trust. Related Reading: Grayscale Says It May Return 20% Of Investor Capital, Bitcoin Refuses To Budge The lawsuit seeks Grayscale to lower its fees, initiate redemptions, and release documents related to its relationship with Digital Currency Group. In addition, Fir Tree also seeks to stop Grayscale’s efforts to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). A Big Short On Bitcoin, Crypto, And Tether? Ahluwalia hypothesizes that the arguments made in the lawsuit do not reflect their true motivation. Fir Tree claims the motivation lies with the “end investors” such as “teachers, firefighters, police officers, and other public officials” who own GBTC. “There’s a bigger story here…Be skeptical,” says Ahluwalia, explaining, “Fir Tree is making a bigger bet against the crypto ecosystem (USDT, Bitcoin, etc.) and pushing on all the softpoints it can find.” In this regard, the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) refers to Bloomberg’s revelation that Fir Tree took a large short position on Tether (USDT) in March 2022. Fir Tree is betting on a break of the USD/USDT peg, to some extent a “bank run” by March 2023. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Is Not At Risk Of Knocking $10,000 If Grayscale Increases Selling Pressure The position has been structured as an “asymmetric trade,” meaning that downside risk is low and potential reward is high, with the official rationale for the trade being that “much” of the commercial paper backing the token is tied to Chinese real estate developers, some of which are in trouble. Further, the analyst asserts that Fir Tree has identified three “softpoints” of the Bitcoin and crypto market that the hedge fund can rattle: Grayscale, the USDT bond, and Binance, whereas Fir Tree cannot take any action regarding the exchange, according to Ahluwalia. On GBTC, the analyst notes: Fortunately, I don’t see a credible path to Grayscale Trust unwinding. The Trust is a cashcow and can receive a private valuation from a 3rd party purely on cashflows. What Fir Tree is doing is pushing on the loose legs of the stool. With the lawsuit, Fir Tree could be trying to reduce the chances of DCG raising outside capital while its own bet still has about 3 months to run. It is also not clear from the 13F filings whether the hedge fund is also short Bitcoin or has OTM puts on BTC. Enemy Of My Enemy Is My Friend Dynamic Valkyrie, even if with “heroic” intentions, does not make the situation any easier as they propose to take over the role of managing GBTC and reduce fees from 2% to 75 basis points. In addition, Valkyrie would use Reg M. Both would hurt Grayscale’s valuation. “My opinion is that Fir Tree is attempting to hurt the probability of a VC raise and push DCG over the edge. Fir Tree and Valkyrie are strange bedfellows. Fir Tree is betting against Tether. Valkyrie is positioned as the hero for Bitcoin/GBTC holders. This an ‘enemy of my enemy is my friend’ dynamic”, Ahluwalia says. For Bitcoin investors, the unresolved situation around DCG and Grayscale thus remains one of the biggest potential risks for further crypto-intrinsic market turmoil. At press time, the BTC price was at $16,624.

6886094,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514379,1672649112,XRP Price Suddenly Plummets By 12% – Here’s What’s Going On,"The XRP price has experienced a harsh downward movement in the early morning hours of the Asian market (9 am in Tokyo). Within 45 minutes, the price dropped from $0.3394 to $0.2998, meaning that XRP experienced a drop of a whopping 12%. Remarkably, this move did not happen in line with the broader market sentiment, as BTC and ETH recorded small gains in the meantime. It’s also worth noting that the sudden price drop seemingly happened without any real news related to Ripple, such as a new development in the legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, or the XRP token. Thus, the price move seems mostly influenced by speculation. However, at press time, the price had already managed to bounce back to $0.3322, erasing much of the sudden price loss. XRP is now facing resistance at $0.3333, which has not been breached yet. There is one event that often comes into the focus of XRP investors on the first of the month, the unlocking of 1 billion XRP from Ripple’s escrow account which happened yesterday, Sunday. Under normal circumstances, this is unlikely to have caused the sudden sell-off. The action has been well-known in the community for years, although this time there was a bit of a surprise. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Tony Spilotro While previously, XRP was unlocked directly from Ripple escrow accounts, this time it happened on unknown accounts, according to Whale Alert. However, Bithomp identified the addresses as those of Ripple. 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 500,000,000 #XRP (170,074,826 USD) unlocked from escrow at unknown wallethttps://t.co/yymqzSjLYk — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 1, 2023 Ripple CTO Schwartz yesterday faced the question of why the XRP price is currently performing so poorly and answered: I don’t really have a good understanding of what affects the price of cryptocurrencies. But I will tell you what I think is true, though I can’t back it up with facts. It’s just my sense based on data, experience and maybe just feelings. More Downside In Store For The XRP Price? Today’s move could spell more downside for the price. The recent rejection at the key $0.37 resistance is likely to play a role in this. On the upside, it would be of significant importance for investors if XRP recaptures the level at $0.343 relatively soon. Otherwise, there could be a lot of liquidity on the downside, as today’s move also showed. Looking at the 1-day chart, a retest of the level at $0.2641 would be the most bearish scenario for now. The price level might present massive support, where liquidity could already kick in.

The price is now trading below $1,200 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,195 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair remains at a risk of a fresh decline if it stays below the $1,120 level or even $1,250. Ethereum Price Still In Range Ethereum price attempted an upside break above the $1,210 zone. ETH faced resistance below $1,220 and remained in a bearish zone, similar to bitcoin. A high was formed near $1,205 and there was a bearish reaction. The price traded as low as $1,192 and remained in a range. The price is now moving higher above $1,195. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,205 swing high to $1,192 low. Ether price is now trading below $1,200 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,195 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. An immediate resistance is near the $1,200 level and the 100 hourly SMA. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,205 swing high to $1,192 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,210 level. The first major resistance is near $1,220. A close above the $1,220 resistance could start a decent upward move. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $1,250 resistance. The next major resistance could be $1,270, above which the price might rise towards the $1,300 resistance zone. Fresh Decline in ETH? If ethereum fails to climb above the $1,210 resistance, it could start another drop. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,195 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $1,185 level. A downside break below $1,185 might send the price towards the $1,150 support. Any more losses might call for a test of the $1,120 zone.
