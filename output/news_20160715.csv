42426961,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Vh,1468622794,Ether Prices Spike Above $12 Amid Build Up to Hard Fork,"Ether, the native digital currency of ethereum, saw sharp gains this week while bitcoin experienced comparatively mild price fluctuations following last week's halving.  The price of ether pushed higher during the seven days through 14th July as the broader ethereum community came closer to implementing a hard fork that would offer a solution to funds compromised during the demise of the distributed autonomous organization, The DAO.  The digital currency's price continues to experience volatility ""as the fork debate settles down"", but it seems to be receiving tailwinds stemming from the 14th July commit of the nearly completed hard fork code, algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.  Eliosoff added:  ""A further rise is likely once the hard fork wins out, which now seems inevitable barring discovery of a serious flaw in that code.""  At press time, the price of ether was just over $11 on Poloniex. Trading earlier today saw the price rise as high as $12.40, trade data shows.  Approaching a hard fork  The ethereum community has spent several weeks determining how to respond to an incident where 3.6m ETH was moved into a child DAO.  While many have referred to this event as ""The DAO hack"" or theft, the ether was transferred in accordance with the rules of the contract, when someone executed the code of The DAO as written.  In the aftermath, developers had attempted to agree upon a viable soft fork, but these attempts have failed. As a result, the ethereum community has been working on a hard fork which, if executed, would move funds from The DAO to a new smart contract that would allow stakeholders to exchange DAO tokens for ethers.  During the last week, ether prices reached as high as $11.71, 15.5% higher than their opening price of $10.14 on 8th July, Poloniex figures reveal.  The digital currency retreated slightly before the week was over, closing at $11.50, up 13.4% for the seven-day period.

42426952,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Hh,1468613093,UK Parliament Hearing to Highlight Government Blockchain Applications,"A UK House of Lords committee will meet next week to hear testimony from academics and representatives of the blockchain industry.  Parliament announced today that the Economic Affairs Committee of the House of Lords (Parliament's upper house) will meet on 19th July to discuss blockchain and potential applications for the UK government. The committee will notably feature testimony from Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of monetary policy for the Bank of England who remarked this past March that a central bank-issued digital currency could have a major impact on banking.  In addition to Broadbent, witnesses set to speak include Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters; 11:FS co-founder and director of blockchain Simon Taylor; Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research associate director Dr Catherine Mulligan; Gresham College professor of commerce Michael Mainelli; and PwC transformation and assurance director Lord Spens.  According to Parliament’s announcement, the hearing will focus in part on public sector blockchain applications for the UK government, a topic that has seen interest from both within and outside of the government.  Specifically, the hearing will look into whether the technology could ""be used to collect taxes or pay benefits"", a question that comes after the UK Department of Work and Pensions began a blockchain welfare payments trial. The trial has since stoked concerns among privacy advocates, according to the Financial Times.  The hearing will also focus on regulation, central bank-issued digital currencies and the question of ""what happens if the technology goes wrong?"".  Testimony begins at 15:05 UTC, according to Parliament. A live broadcast of the hearing will be streamed here.

42426956,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Jh,1468605058,Why SAP is Quietly Playing Test-and-See With Blockchain,"The success of bitcoin has prompted technology companies from around the world to look into ways its underlying code can be adapted to new commercial use cases.  SAP, a major German software company founded in the 1970s by a group of IBM engineers, is no exception. For much of the past year, the Weinheim-based firm has been exploring a range of applications for the emerging technology in the areas of finance, payments, supply chain management and more.  But like other companies doing this kind of exploration, SAP isn’t certain that a future for blockchains is in the cards. Rather, interviews with representatives from the firm suggest that it’s simply responding to both a rising tide of client interest as well as broader enthusiasm from market incumbents and startups.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Gross struck an optimistic tone, explaining how SAP is approaching its early-stage testing from the perspective of client engagement and overall impact on how the global company operates.  At the same time, the company is seeking to plot its own course, according to Gross, who said that a driving factor behind SAP’s process is the ability for the company to ""do it ourselves"".  He told CoinDesk:  ""You can only understand these types of applications when you start doing things yourself.""  It’s an ongoing experiment that the company says has begun to bear fruit.  A previously reported partnership between distributed ledger tech startup Ripple and Alberta-based ATB Financial saw the completion of a cross-border payment trial for which Ripple worked with SAP to build a proof-of-concept.  Using that application, CA$1,000 was transferred from ATB to ReiseBank, headquartered in Frankfurt.  Use cases across sectors  Gross, who has worked for SAP since the early 2000s, cited supply chain management, trade finance and payments as major areas of interest for SAP, though he went on to point to energy distribution and even entertainment as areas in which the company sees promise.  ""I see things coming from pharmaceuticals, life science as well,” he told CoinDesk. ""What I have not seen a lot of is the pure manufacturing type of industries. Probably those are dealing with IoT, which will probably lead to blockchain down the road.""  Still, it's supply chain management that could prove particularly attractive for SAP. Research published last year by Gartner indicated that SAP had roughly a quarter of the world’s market share for supply chain management software.  Gross noted SAP is looking at applications beyond the world of finance, an area that has arguably received the most attention from market incumbents and startup entrepreneurs, though he said the company's financial services arm is exploring the technology closely.  Discussing the company’s early interest, he contends it was sparked, in part, during examination of machine learning and artificial intelligence, saying that blockchain has ""been on our radar for some time now"".  “So we thought, well, there’s something going on there,” he explained. “Let’s better understand it, let’s dive into it and look at it from the perspective of what is interesting or relevant beyond financial services.”  Following demand  But Gross isn't the only person at SAP looking at the issue.  John Bertrand, an industry value engineer with a specific focus on banking, said he’s seen a lot of activity on the development front as well as a high level of curiosity among the company’s global clientele.  He said SAP is working with startups like MarkIt as well as Ripple to develop prototypes, a process that dates back about 18 months.  Yet in interview, he repeatedly invoked the idea that despite the investment in an exploration of blockchain, SAP will ultimately move in whichever direction the most demand can be seen.  ""The big thing is, it's always great to have something that's wanted by the marketplace versus, 'Hey, here's this shiny toy,"" he said, going on to add:  ""We will respond very quickly to the marketplace, but the marketplace has to say, ‘This is what we’re looking for’.""  Bertrand, who joined SAP in 2014, said that international payments is an area in which blockchain makes sense – a topic he invoked in a recent blog post published on Finextra. While proponents say the technology could make the process more efficient, Bertrand said that the banks themselves are making money out of these very inefficiencies.  He explained:  “Banks do make a lot of money out of efficiency. Because they take the money and leave it in your bank account, and they’ll pay it anywhere from two to twelve days later. Two to 12 days, or 20 days, or 30 days. That’s free money for the bank. Right now interest rates are very low, so it’s making banks right now quite cash rich, this float. But it doesn’t help the economy because everything is slow. So blockchain helps that.  Both Bertrand and Gross said that one of SAP’s priorities is to cut through the hype, so to speak, weighing applications and seeing which areas make most sense for the company to continue exploring.  ""I certainly don’t need to tell you that the technology and scenarios are in early stages,"" said Gross. ""So, we are very busy figuring out what is hype and marketing and what is reality.""  As well, Bertrand and Gross indicated that, ultimately, SAP is going to move on products and services their clients want to buy.  Bertrand concluded:  ""If our customers say they definitely want it, they’ve got it.""

42426958,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Ph,1468600420,CME Exec: Bitcoin ETFs Signal Digital Asset Maturity,"CME Group's executive director and digitization lead has called the increasing number of planned bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) a sign that the market for blockchain-based digital assets is maturing.  At the Tech Talk 5.0 conference in London this week, CME's Sandra Ro spoke broadly about the progress being made by the derivatives marketplace provider in exploring the blockchain industry, reviewing the company's new bitcoin benchmark and speaking in-depth how the group looks at the future of blockchain more broadly.  In response to audience questions, Ro notably said she believes the two ETF filings currently pending in the US are a sign more filings for regulated products may be on the way. Further, she said existing products and filings prove that there is enough demand for additional regulated products in the digital assets space.  Ro told the audience:  ""In fact, some of the most exciting areas to explore are at the intersection of digital assets and tokenized fiat and tokenized commodities.""  Elsewhere, Ro voiced an argument as to why her firm believes the public blockchain space could be as valuable for financial institutions to understand as private alternatives, stating that CME maintains a dual focus on digital assets and blockchain and distributed ledger technology.  Even though Ro sees bitcoin as the most mature digital asset, she is quick to note that there are many others that may or may not succeed, even referencing how the social network-based digital currency Steemit has risen sharply in total market capitalization in recent days.  An audience poll at the event suggested that those in attendance are perhaps now more familiar with bitcoin, as well. When asked if attendees had ever held any bitcoin, 23% of the audience voted 'Yes', while 77% reported 'No'.  A total of 79 votes were cast.  PoC strategy  Overall, Ro discussed four primary mandates that CME has put in place for its digitization group.  Firstly, she said, the group is looking at projects as part of a long-term strategy, on a timescale of three to five years. Previous work by the group was more short-term focused, but going forward, the group is looking into ideas that take time to mature.  ""We want to make smart bets on where we need to be in the next three-to-five years,"" Ro said.  Ro spoke to a focus on both projects and proofs-of-concept, distinguishing between the two categories in terms of time and money invested.  CME undertakes a project, she said, when the idea is more concrete and the company is willing to spend up to a few million dollars getting the concept to fruition.  On the other hand, proofs-of-concept are worked on with little funding and a lesser time commitment, while experiencing a higher failure rate, she said.  Ro stressed that the company's motto with proofs-of-concept is to experiment and fail fast.  FinTech engagement  Later, Ro discussed how CME is working with both new and established players to chart its future course for FinTech.  For example, she said CME is looking into possible changes to how intellectual property should be handled by the group so it can better work with new players.  Ro believes that the traditional approach of patenting technologies developed by CME may not work well with the evolving FinTech community.  In terms of external engagement on blockchain specifically, Ro mentioned the group’s involvement with the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project, and other consortiums like Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Group (PTDL).

42426959,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Rh,1468586210,BNP's Ex-Blockchain Lead is Now Coding Smart Contracts for Clearinghouses,"Even if centralized clearinghouses are eventually built into or replaced by a blockchain, some services will inherently require the aid of a middleman, according to Collin Platt, the former lead blockchain developer at BNP Paribas who earlier this year launched his own blockchain startup to test this market thesis.  Based in London, DPactum is working to use blockchain tech to reduce risk for central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs) by replicating some of their services on a blockchain, thus freeing them up to fulfill tasks he says are safe from eventual disruption.  With reported investments from several large financials, Platt said his team of four is now working to build a prototype application using technology from the open-source Hyperledger project.  Platt told CoinDesk:  ""What we are doing is creating a new scaling process that will be governed by CCPs for derivatives. And this will allow clearinghouses using this tech and a distributed ledger system that we’ve set up to individualize the extent to which they are authorized.""  Along with co-founder and fellow BNP Paribas alum, David Acton, the bootstrapped team has already built a proof-of-concept for contract creation and trade registration that uses a smart contract for US treasuries and other cash-like short-term treasury instruments in Europe.  The smart contracts are intended to represent bilateral contracts between parties that are backed by different guarantors, likely a member of the CCP clearinghouse. The smart contracts themselves would be administrated by the CCP.  In Europe, CCPs such as the European Central Counterparty NV and Eurex Clearing serve counterparties by both taking funds from a buyer and assets from a seller and managing the risk in a wide range of ways. In the US, the DTCC fulfills a similar function.  But according to Platt, only some of those methods of mitigating risk are themselves also at risk.  Safe risks  Platt breaks down the value proposition of CCPs into four categories.  The first two — managing operational tasks to reduce settlement risk and tracking the credit risks counterparties may pose — are perfectly suited to being encoded into smart contracts and run on a distributed ledger, he said.  By encoding the operational tasks into a blockchain, Platt believes he’ll be able to give his clients the ability to determine who has access to what information.  ""They can see more information and thus can make greater assessment of the true risk,"" he said.  He contends the other two value propositions of CCPs will remain valuable long after the other services are ""wrapped into a heartless smart contract"".  He said services which are the ""more nuanced"", and therefore not likely to be disintermediated by blockchain smart contracts, include the handling of counterparties that default on a contract and the management of systemic risks.  Clearing up the future  Contrary to earlier reports that DPactum was participating in the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Group (PTDL), Platt said his company is not a member. ""PTDL is for regulated, incumbent services,"" he said.  In his previous job, Platt focused his efforts on the actual trade, not the post trade, and he expects that that will stay the same for the time being.  Elsewhere, he said an earlier plan his team made to deliver a pilot alpha of the derivatives blockchain product for exchange-traded futures and options was derailed earlier this month when the UK voted to exit the European Union.  He said such efforts could now be delayed until September of this year.  Platt said:  ""We’re building a prototype. We want to work with these firms to see how we can make this thing operational on a very small scale.""  DPactum Futures Demo Videohttps://vimeo.com/161942343  from DPactum on Vimeo.
