A governance vote for continuing farming on the same four asset pairs ‚Äì WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH and DAI/ETH ‚Äì was proposed by Audius strategy lead Cooper Turley and pseudonymous ‚Äúmonet supply‚Äù Monday. The proposal will have to pass a series of governance polls before farming restarts Dec. 4.

Farming rewards were first created in September for a limited two month run following a surprise airdrop of UNI tokens to the AMM‚Äôs developers, users and investors.      UNI is trading hands at $3.50, according to CoinGecko.      Uniswap‚Äôs total value under lock (TVL) first broke $1 billion in September after introducing UNI rewards.

In addition to bitcoin‚Äôs bullish run, global equities were also up Monday across the board, boosted by positive economic news ‚Äì and promising results for another COVID-19 vaccine ‚Äì in the face of a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic:    The Nikkei 225 closed in the green 2% as Japanese gross domestic product numbers grew by more than anticipated, boosting investor confidence.

In the United States the S&P gained 0.80% as fresh news on the vaccine front gave investors motivation to hit the buy button on a possible economic recovery.

Since November 2019, the amount of bitcoin ‚Äúlocked‚Äù in DeFi, for example, has skyrocketed from 1,422 to 174,673 BTC, a 12,183% increase.      ‚ÄúLending has gained popularity in 2020 with players like Nexo, BlockFi and others with strong growth throughout the year,‚Äù said Jean Baptiste Pavageau, partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha. ‚ÄúDeFi also allows the retail market to access those popular lending solutions thanks to the Ethereum network.‚Äù      ‚ÄúIt actually provides a strong use case for BTC beyond the digital gold narrative, as it's used as a pooling and yielding instrument,‚Äù said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of crypto exchange Alpha5. Shah also speculates that all this bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain may decrease the separation between blockchains. ‚ÄúIt may actually create a chain-agnostic paradigm.‚Äù    Uniswap, tether dominate Ethereum transactions    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday trading around $462 and climbing 4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

MIT researchers resoundingly reject blockchain-based voting. And Bitcoin Cash's latest fork looks set to fail.    Top shelf    Technical comparison? A Citibank executive published a report predicting that bitcoin could reach $318,000 by December 2021. Using technical analysis, and a comparison to gold markets in the 1970s, Citibank Managing Director Thomas Fitzpatrick said quantitative easing could lead to a breakout price movement for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. ClassicMacro, a pseudonymous Twitter account that surfaced the report, bucked the prediction by saying, ‚ÄúThere is no edge in guessing targets so far in time with TA. All we know is that price is likely to continue going up.‚Äù      Six criticisms Fidelity Director of Research Ria Bhutoria rebutted six common criticisms of bitcoin in a recent viral blog post. Published Thursday, the corporate blog examined supposed fallacies that bitcoin‚Äôs volatility means it cannot be a store of value, that bitcoin hoovers up energy and that bitcoin fails as a payments mechanism for all but criminals. She highlighted the crypto‚Äôs settlement assurance, supply inelasticity and decentralization. Bitcoin is growing because people recognize it offers ‚Äúperfect scarcity ‚Ä¶ transaction irreversibility, and seizure and censorship resistance.‚Äù      Expanding Galaxy Crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital acquired two firms¬†as it positions itself as the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù crypto platform for institutional buyers. Announced Friday, DrawBridge Lending, a ""white glove"" crypto service, and Blue Fire Capital, a futures market maker, are now under the Galaxy umbrella. Notably, DrawBridge brings over $150 million in third-party assets to the firm. The news came hours after Galaxy announced net income of $44.3 million for Q3 2020 ‚Äì well up from a loss of $68.2 million in the same quarter last year.      Downvoted A new report from MIT roundly rejects blockchain-based e-voting as a tool for any political elections. Following up on an earlier report detailing blockchain voting cybersecurity vulnerabilities, the latest study suggests that many cryptographic proposals ‚Äì like zero-knowledge proof and permissioned blockchains ‚Äì add complexity and are insufficient to meet the needs of a voting public. Putting aside these digital solutions ‚Äúhigher tolerances for failure,‚Äù blockchains cannot stop voter coercion, while also introducing the persistent issue of key management. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt yet seen a blockchain system that I would trust with a county-fair jellybean count, much less a presidential election,‚Äù one of the authors wrote.      Flash attack Value DeFi joined the ranks of exploited decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols this weekend, with a malicious trader (or traders) making off with approximately $6 million worth of crypto. In what appears to be a flash loan attack, the attacker borrowed 80,000 ether from the DeFi lending platform Aave and used it to arbitrage two stablecoins in Value‚Äôs MultiStables vault. (Flash loans allow users to borrow funds without collateralization because the lender expects the funds would be returned instantly.) The attacker has since returned $95,000 in DAI stablecoins. Separately, researchers with Israel-based startup B.Protocol found a novel way to trim debt positions on MakerDAO.

Bloomberg and Barclays‚Äô Global Negative-Yielding Debt Index is now worth $17.05 trillion, a lifetime high, a metric that measures the amount of bonds that will pay out less at maturity than their purchase price. Several analysts, including John Ng Pangilinan, a managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital, said this trend could incentivize investors and corporations to follow firms like MicroStrategy and Square by piling into bitcoin or other inflation-resistant assets. ‚ÄúOn our end, we are seeing an uptick in the number of investors looking at earning yield from lending out bitcoin,‚Äù Pangilinan said.    At stake    The fork that wasn't Bitcoin Cash‚Äôs latest divide looks like a dud. In the latest ‚Äúhard fork‚Äù of the network, two of the blockchain‚Äôs major clients, Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) and Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN), are hashing it out over control of the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap.      A dispute between the parties arose after BCHA developer Amaury S√©chet proposed an 8% ‚Äútax‚Äù on miner profits to fund his groups development of the network. This so-called Infrastructure Funding Plan (IFP faced strong opposition from the Bitcoin Cash community, including its most prominent advocate, Roger Ver, leading up to the hard fork.      Ver said the proposal would lead to greater centralization of the network, and said there were alternative ways to fund Bitcoin Cash‚Äôs development rather than a tax.      Now, one day after the contentious split, it appears that S√©chet‚Äôs proposal will fail. According to coin.dance data, the BCHN chain is currently 129 blocks ahead of the upstart chain, with no miners supporting BCHA. If BCH ABC does not attract enough hash power to produce a viable blockchain, the ABC blockchain would in theory ‚Äúdisappear,‚Äù CoinDesk‚Äôs Muyao Shen reported this weekend.      Until the situation is resolved, a number of major exchanges and crypto service providers have paused BCH functionality. ""We‚Äôll re-enable sends/receives once we‚Äôve determined the upgrade is stable,"" Coinbase, for one, said. Additionally, Decrypt reported that the majority of exchanges will support whatever blockchain has the most hash power behind it.      Bitcoin Cash is no stranger to disputes. The network came into existence in 2017, after a contentious dispute among Bitcoin developers over block size. At the time, Roger Ver led a group of stakeholders that believed Bitcoin was failing as a payment system, and proposed a marginal increase of the number of transactions that could be confirmed in a single block.      Following BCH‚Äôs hard fork from Bitcoin, a group led by Australian cryptographer Craig Wright wanted to further bump up the block size, resulting in Bitcoin SV (short for Satoshi‚Äôs Vision, as Wright has claimed he is Bitcoin‚Äôs pseudonymous founder).      Many have criticized Bitcoin Cash‚Äôs ‚Äúfork first‚Äù governance, which often introduces uncertainty into the market.

Speaking Monday at the V20 Virtual Asset Service Providers Summit, Carole House, cyber and emerging tech policy specialist at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), said criminals are conducting cross-border payments using smaller amounts of cryptocurrency ‚Äì hence FinCEN‚Äôs proposed lowering of the ‚ÄúTravel Rule‚Äù threshold.      According to the rule change proposal submitted last month, FinCEN and the Federal Reserve would modify the thresholds at which banks must collect and store fund transfer information, reducing it from $3,000 to $250 for any transfers ‚Äì in crypto or fiat ‚Äì¬†that go outside the U.S.      It‚Äôs part of a general broadening of terms, said House, adding that lowering reporting thresholds for international transactions will help law enforcement and other national security authorities.

Applying this rule to the pseudonymous architecture of crypto is a challenge being worked through by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in collaboration with local regulators and the digital asset industry.      According to FinCEN‚Äôs analysis of 2,000 suspicious transaction reports (SARs) filed between 2016 and 2019, the mean and median dollar value was $509 and $255, respectively. Almost all the transactions began or ended outside the U.S.      In response to the NPRM, Washington, D.C.-based digital asset think tank Coin Center questioned the changes to the threshold for Travel Rule obligations in terms of a proper cost-benefit analysis being absent. Such analysis should take into consideration not just the direct cost to regulated entities but the cost to individuals and society, it said.      There‚Äôs been considerable concern from small and mid-sized firms about the cost of compliance generally, and particularly when it comes to things like Travel Rule, which came up during the V20 Q&A.      Addressing the cost-of-compliance question, FATF Executive Secretary David Lewis told V20 delegates the cost of not complying was far greater.      ‚ÄúIf you want this industry to have a good reputation and to continue to operate out in the open, then it‚Äôs the central prerequisite ultimately,‚Äù Lewis said. ‚ÄúThe cost of non-compliance will only ever have short-term benefits, you might say, and would be very short-sighted for companies that want to continue to operate in this space and don‚Äôt want to give their industry a bad name.‚Äù      Lewis pointed out that in about 20 countries there are some 1,130 VASPs (the FATF shorthand for businesses dealing in cryptocurrencies) already registered in compliance with FATF recommendations.    Crypto outreach    Aside from the rule change consultation, FinCEN‚Äôs House urged industry players to get in touch, even mentioning that the regulator‚Äôs door is open to innovators from the recent wave of decentralized finance (DeFi).      ‚ÄúWe want to hear from the industry as we are examining all the different technologies and business models operating in this space, whether it‚Äôs decentralized exchanges or related applications,‚Äù said House, adding:    ‚ÄúPlease reach out to FinCEN and meet with us in innovation hours, let us know if there are specific pilot programs where you need accepted relief from certain regulatory obligations or just letting us know the efficacy of certain types of innovative technologies. That‚Äôs a huge priority for us.‚Äù    Read more: FinCEN Fines Bitcoin-Mixing CEO $60M in Landmark Crackdown on Helix, Coin Ninja      Given that much of DeFi involves interacting with a smart contract (rather than an identifiable entity, or at least at a remove from its creator), FATF was asked about its specific position on the $13.6 billion sector. To which, Sandra Garcia, co-chair of FATF‚Äôs virtual asset contact group, sounded a cautionary note.      ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre looking at when we sort of dissect a lot of these new innovations is that somewhere you do actually have some sort of central administrator or someone who holds the private keys that we think falls within the definitions of the FATF,‚Äù Garcia said.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/16/why-fincen-wants-details-on-all-cross-border-transactions-over-250,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/377c238536502b071b35c88fe3d16b9f36567f40-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405422,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMSCn,1605546741,Why Bitcoin Thrives (and Why It Won't Replace the Dollar),"Bitcoin is the leader of the pack in the crypto space. It has recovered from the disastrous crash of 2018 and is heading back towards the price it reached in December 2017. So what does the future hold for bitcoin? Could it eventually replace the dollar as the global reserve currency, as its loyal supporters claim? Will it eventually crash and die, as Nouriel Roubini has predicted? Or is it destined to remain a speculative asset, spicing up investment portfolios but never being adopted as a main medium of exchange?      More than a decade after its emergence from the ashes of the financial crisis, bitcoin is still a minority sport. Predictions that it will reach $1 million or more seem wildly over-optimistic. Nor is it showing any signs of becoming a main medium of exchange. Over the last 10 years, the U.S. dollar has entrenched itself ever more firmly as the world‚Äôs premier settlement currency. Bitcoin is no nearer universal acceptance than it was when it started.    Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book ‚ÄúThe Case for People‚Äôs Quantitative Easing,‚Äù explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates ‚Äúhelicopter money‚Äù to help economies out of recession.    But bitcoin has survived two major crashes and numerous smaller ones, and is now on the way up again. Unlike many smaller cryptocurrencies, its value has never fallen to zero ‚Äì indeed, over the 12 years of its existence, its value has risen considerably. Volatile though it is, it has demonstrated that it can hold value over the longer term. It has achieved a degree of maturity as a store of value, though not as a medium of exchange.      It‚Äôs tempting to predict Bitcoin‚Äôs future based on its performance so far. Speculative high-yield asset, yes. Long-term store of value, maybe. Medium of exchange, not so much. But as any investor knows, past performance is not a guide to future returns. So let‚Äôs examine whether despite its apparent resilience, bitcoin‚Äôs value could still fall to zero, and conversely, what it might take for bitcoin to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency.      To understand how either of these scenarios could happen, it‚Äôs instructive to look at how fiat currencies work. What gives fiat currencies value ‚Äì and how do they lose it?      There are two competing theories for what gives fiat currencies value: what we might call a ‚Äúmetallist‚Äù theory, that the value of a fiat currency is conferred by the gold to which it used to be pegged, and the ‚Äúchartalist‚Äù theory, which says that a fiat currency has value because people have to pay taxes in it. Of course, neither applies to bitcoin: it has never been pegged to gold, and no government accepts taxes in it. So are there other ways in which a currency can acquire and hold value over the long term?      See also: Frances Coppola - Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul      Underpinning both the metallist and the chartalist view of fiat currency value is a deeper fundamental: the belief that what backs the currency is itself trustworthy. In the case of metallists, it is the belief that gold will always be valuable. This belief has been tested over millennia and never failed, so it is probably reasonable. Less reasonable is the notion that a currency currently not pegged to gold is valuable because it used to be pegged. However, many metallists believe fiat currencies will eventually be re-pegged to gold (more on this shortly).      For chartalists, the underlying belief is the government is capable both of imposing tax liabilities and collecting them. Ability to tax doesn‚Äôt have to mean authoritarianism: Reasonable taxation by a government perceived as fair and benign is actually more likely to result in a stable currency than punitive and unfair taxes harshly enforced.      What gives currency value, therefore, is trust in whatever is backing it. So what is backing bitcoin? Responding to the criticism that ‚Äúbitcoin isn‚Äôt backed by anything,‚Äù the investment website Fidelity Digital Assets said, ‚ÄúBitcoin is backed by¬†code and¬†the¬†consensus¬†that exists among its key stakeholders.‚Äù    The sort of social and political collapse that would destroy the dollar would surely also destroy global civilization.    This is a statement of faith. It amounts to ‚Äúthe code is perfect, and the key stakeholders would never do anything to make it less than perfect.‚Äù Neither is necessarily true, but all is necessary for bitcoin to hold value is for a sufficient number of people to believe it.      The code isn‚Äôt perfect, of course. If it were, it would never have been hard forked. But Fidelity Digital Assets has an answer to that one too. Bitcoin may not be immutable, but its community is: ‚ÄúWhile Bitcoin‚Äôs open-source software may be forked, its community and network effects cannot.‚Äù      Many people have commented on Bitcoin‚Äôs cult-like nature, which appears to be a design feature ‚Äì the pseudonymous leader who disappeared after three years, the refusal of those who know who Satoshi is to reveal his/her identity, the reverence with which followers treat the sayings of Satoshi and his/her close associates. Network effects are particularly strong in cults, and the incentives of cult members are not necessarily financial. True believers remain invested in bitcoin and actively trading even when the price is falling catastrophically, because of their faith bitcoin will eventually become the heart of a new world order. While they exist, there will always be an incentive to mine bitcoin ‚Äì and while that remains the case, the price cannot fall to zero.      See also: Jill Carlson - Cryptocurrency Is Most Useful for Breaking Laws and Social Constructs      So the faith of bitcoiners is what gives bitcoin its value. If they were to lose that faith, the currency's value would fall to zero. But is their faith alone enough for bitcoin eventually to replace the U.S. dollar as global reserve currency?      There are at present no indications whatsoever that the world is likely to ditch the dollar anytime soon. If anything, the present pandemic has increased reliance on the dollar, forcing the Federal Reserve to provide more liquidity to financial markets. Even in crypto markets, there is a growing need for greenbacks ‚Äì after all, what are stablecoins but a means of tying cryptocurrencies ever more tightly to the dollar?      A global switch to bitcoin would cause the mother of all financial crises, destabilizing not only conventional markets but crypto markets, too. However, a significant number of people, including but not limited to bitcoiners, think this is not only possible but inevitable. They believe that quantitative easing (QE) will eventually trigger uncontrollable hyperinflation of all major fiat currencies. This belief has proved persistent despite the failure of QE to generate significant price inflation anywhere in the world.      In the early 2010s, people who believed in this hyper-inflationary Armageddon thought the inevitable result would be the return of the global gold standard. Some of them still believe this. But bitcoin‚Äôs true believers argue it is bitcoin, not gold, to which the world would turn when fiat currencies crashed and burned.      Why bitcoin? Because it has both the advantages of gold and the convenience of digital currency. It is not issued or controlled by a government, and ‚Äì unlike gold ‚Äì its supply increases predictably and will eventually be permanently fixed. It can be subdivided into tiny amounts, making it more usable than gold as a medium of exchange. And as its value increases, the prices of real goods and services bought with it will fall. A digital currency independent of government and naturally deflationary would be just what would be needed to restore trust in money after the dollar‚Äôs hyper-inflationary collapse.      But hyper-inflation is very much associated with social, political and economic collapse. So those who believe bitcoin is destined to replace the dollar as the premier international reserve and settlement currency, and investing in it for that reason, are essentially betting on the collapse of the U.S. and the unravelling of the current international order.  Sudden disastrous hegemonic collapses are the stuff of apocalyptic fiction, not reality. It took over half a century and two world wars for hegemony to transfer from Great Britain to the U.S., and even then the transfer was slow and not particularly disorderly. The sort of social and political collapse that would destroy the dollar would surely also destroy global civilization.      See also: Frances Coppola - Why Bitcoin-Like Scarcity Would Be a Disaster for the Dollar      Would people even have the devices, broadband and electricity needed to use and mine bitcoin after such a catastrophe? The apocalyptic fiction of the Cold War era, when nuclear war was a real threat, unanimously says ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Not only would the devices and the electricity fail to survive, but in their own struggle to survive people would quickly forget they ever existed. You can‚Äôt eat bitcoin.      It's possible the world might avert a deflationary collapse by agreeing to make bitcoin the underpinning of a global system of digital fiat currencies, much as gold underpinned the ‚ÄúBretton Woods‚Äù system of the post-World War II period. But the Bretton Woods system barely lasted 20 years before global economic imbalances and conflicts fatally destabilized it. Why would ‚ÄúBitcoin Woods‚Äù last any longer?      When faith rules the roost, people believe all sorts of incredible things. Bitcoin replacing the dollar as the global reserve currency is such an incredible thing. The chances of it happening seem very small. But as long as bitcoin‚Äôs supporters continue to believe that it is destined to rule the world, bitcoin will have value; others can benefit from that value even if they don‚Äôt share the belief. Thanks to the faith of bitcoin‚Äôs true believers, bitcoin will continue to be a good bet for investors.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/16/why-bitcoin-thrives-and-why-it-wont-replace-the-dollar,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42394458,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bviMtF,1605543349,Crypto Execs Need Liability Insurance,"When it comes to regulation and necessities like banking, crypto entrepreneurs haven‚Äôt always had the easiest time.      Recently, I‚Äôve discovered some of my crypto clients are having trouble obtaining an important business planning tool: directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance. In my opinion, as I‚Äôll explain, a combination of COVID-19 ‚Äúevent-driven‚Äù litigation, crypto regulatory uncertainty and a misunderstanding of crypto on the part of some in the insurance industry, is making it difficult for crypto entrepreneurs to secure an important service.    Matthew Burgoyne is a corporate and securities law partner at McLeod Law LLP in Calgary, Alberta.¬†He has advised clients in the cryptocurrency space since 2013 and is chair of McLeod Law‚Äôs cryptocurrency and blockchain group.    Many countries, including the U.S., impose a fiduciary duty on directors and/or executive officers that they owe either to the shareholders or to the corporation. Depending on the jurisdiction, the law may impose a ‚Äúduty of care,‚Äù a ‚Äúduty of loyalty‚Äù or a ‚Äúduty to promote the success of the company.‚Äù      How ever you define it, it means these individuals are held to the highest legal standard of care, where a breach of the fiduciary duty on the part of directors or officers may expose them to steep penalties, which often include jail sentences.      There are important policy reasons why directors and officers should be protected from liability. Arguably, directors should be free to run the business, operations and affairs of a corporation in a decisive manner without the fear that any action they take could lead to personal liability.¬†Limitation of liability promotes healthy risk taking by management, which, one hopes, leads to economic benefits for a corporation. This is supported by the reality that in the laws of many jurisdictions corporations are legal entities separate and apart from their stakeholders.      In an effort to protect directors and officers from liability, corporate bylaws often mandate that, provided directors and officers fulfill certain duties, the corporation will indemnify them against costs if they are sued.    Cryptocurrency companies are suffering from a perfect storm of sorts, which is making it difficult to obtain D & O Insurance.    In other words, the corporation will pay to defend and pay the damages awarded against directors and officers who are sued simply for doing their jobs.      A corporation may also enter into an indemnification agreement with a director or officer, providing a similar type of broad indemnification as can be contained in the corporate bylaws. A major difference between indemnification under the by-laws versus an in-house indemnification agreement is the latter can‚Äôt be unilaterally terminated without the consent of the other party. By-laws, on the other hand, may be changed by a corporation at any point in time, provided the appropriate director and/or shareholder approvals are obtained.      Why is D&O insurance necessary in light of the above protections? Insurance is critical because it can be used to mitigate risk as well as cost. When directors and officers are being sued, chances are the corporation is being sued as well, and the corporation may not have enough funds to defend itself as well as pay the legal costs of the directors and officers. Finally, the interests of the director or officer may not be completely aligned with that of the corporation, and in order to prevent a conflict of interest it may be necessary for the director or officer to obtain his or her own independent counsel.      Crypto company management may want to pay special attention to D&O Insurance, especially in light of the cybersecurity risks facing platforms such as crypto exchanges, and considering the immature state of crypto law.    In crypto    Based on conversations I‚Äôve had with insurance brokers and feedback I‚Äôve received from clients in different parts of the cryptocurrency industry, I believe cryptocurrency companies are suffering from a perfect storm of sorts, which is making it difficult to obtain D&O Insurance.      First, due to COVID-19, insurance companies are reluctant to provide D&O insurance in general due to a concern about COVID-19 ‚Äúevent-driven‚Äù litigation. Many companies, particularly in the travel, entertainment and restaurant industries, are barely staying afloat amid continued lockdowns and social distancing. Stakeholders are looking to hold corporations and their management liable for losses and damages resulting from employee terminations, reduced dividends and corporate insolvencies.      Secondly, there is the current murky state of the law governing cryptocurrency. Regulators continue to review regulations to address issues and provide greater certainty. Because of the uncertainty surrounding law in the context of securities, there is an increase in litigation and people looking to the courts to decide the matters.      See also: This Blue-Chip Crypto Insurance Consortium Lacks One Thing ‚Äì a Sizable Loss      In the last eight months, there has been a flurry of lawsuits targeting corporations active in the cryptocurrency space. As¬†Kevin M. LaCroix writes in The D&O Diary, April 3, 2020, was a pretty big day for securities class action lawsuits in the U.S. On April 3, 2020, 11 total cryptocurrency-related securities lawsuits were filed in a single day, which is likely unprecedented.¬†The lawsuits were all filed in the Southern District of New York, and they targeted four crypto exchanges and seven token issuers.      Significantly, LaCroix says, in addition to the defendant corporations, each of the complaints targets certain directors and officers of each of the defendant corporations.      Third, I‚Äôve been told that some members of the insurance industry do not understand cryptocurrency and tend to dismiss it as being a scam or too risky to insure. A colleague recently related a story where he spent almost an hour debating with an insurance broker about why Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme.      My hope is that as crypto enters the mainstream we will see critical industries, such as insurance, better understand and warm up to the technology. Ideally, as a crypto corporation commences operations, it will have an adequate D&O insurance policy in place.

In a notice on Monday, the company said it is removing a number of trading pairs, including BGBP/USDC (USD coin) on Tuesday at 12:00 UTC.  This was the final pair listed for the stablecoin and its removal means BGBP will no longer be offered.  Users are able to exchange any remaining BGBP into U.K. pounds via Binance's Convert service at a 1:1 ratio.  Talking to CoinDesk over Telegram, a Binance representative said BGBP had been the exchange's ""first experiment"" with a fiat-based stablecoin.  ""It worked but the issuance/redemption process was not the most friendly for users,"" they said.  Going forward the spokesperson said Binance will point users to its GBP fiat onramps where they will receive a ""better"" service.  When the token was listed on Binance Jersey (also now discontinued) last summer, Binance CFO Wei Zhou said there was ""overwhelming demand in the market and Binance community for more stablecoin diversification, including a GBP-pegged stablecoin.""  BGBP was obviously not the success the exchange had hoped. Binance also has a U.S. dollar-based stablecoin, BUSD, that the representative said has been the ""fastest-growing USD-backed stablecoin in the past year.""  Around $2.4 billion BUSD had been issued in total in September, the representative said, adding there are no plans to drop the coin.

On Monday, crypto industry blogger Colin Wu tweeted that miners in China have been struggling to pay for electricity after the authorities started cracking down on over-the-counter (OTC) brokers in the country.      The tweet notes that ""74% of the miners surveyed told Wu that the payment of electricity bills has been greatly affected."" China recently started blocking bank accounts and cards involved in purchases of cryptocurrency, and has investigated the two largest brokers, Zhao Dong and Xu Mingxing, Wu wrote in a blog post.      It's currently a ""challenge"" for Chinese miners to convert bitcoin or tether into yuan because ""many people have had their bank accounts frozen when exchanging crypto for [renminbi] on OTC platforms,"" said Thomas Heller, formerly global business director at the mining pool F2Pool and now chief operation officer of mining and media firm HASHR8.      As CoinDesk reported, in June, Chinese authorities ramped up efforts to block bank accounts that could be connected to illicit activities such as money laundering via cryptocurrency deals.      ""It has always happened, but this year more than others,"" Heller told CoinDesk. ""I would say it has become more common in the last couple months.""      However, he played down the scale of any exodus of miners from China, even though HASHR8 is currently helping some operators to move their operations ‚Äì most to Russia but some to Kazakhstan.      ""Most Chinese miners are mostly only familiar with the Chinese market, so it's hard for them to move abroad and start mining,"" Heller explained. ""It's [the China OTC clampdown] another factor that may make overseas mining more attractive, however this alone is not enough to push them overseas. Rather, they would try to find some workarounds.""      Also read: Chinese Agency Scraps Plan to Eliminate Bitcoin Mining Industry      In the meantime, some operators are unplugging their miners, Wu wrote in a blog post. ""There are also miners who said that their mining machines have been shut down for a month because they cannot sell the cryptocurrency to pay the electricity bill.""      Some OTC companies that specialize on serving mining firms ""have also terminated their business,"" Wu wrote.      Most of the largest mining pools are based in China.

A loophole in MakerDAO‚Äôs collateralized debt positions (CDPs) market, discovered by Israel-based startup B.Protocol, enables CDPs to be closed far more leniently than the system intends due to a small oversight in the auction market, according to a blog shared early with CoinDesk.      The lending protocol is meant to close positions automatically after collateral backing outstanding dai (DAI) falls below the 150% ratio. But a simple call function provides a workaround while decreasing the chance of being smacked by a liquidation penalty around that value.      If borrowers split CDPs into tiny positions around $100, B.Protocol analysis shows, the Keepers ‚Äì who bid on liquidated assets from undercollateralized positions ‚Äì won't liquidate positions because of the difficulties in calculating the profit margin, B.Protocol CEO Yaron Velner said in a phone interview.      A position ‚Äì big or small ‚Äì could theoretically be held under the collateral limit for some time and be closed without a liquidation penalty, he said. Exact values were not provided because of the odd nature of the problem; how long an extension lasts depends on Keepers who don‚Äôt seem interested in purchasing small underwater positions, Velner said.      ‚ÄúExtrapolating these results to a Vault of $1M suggests that it will cost around $5K in gas to split it into 7,800 Vaults. Or in other words, one could protect his Vault from future liquidations by sacrificing only 0.5% of his Vault size,‚Äù the blog states.      That‚Äôs compared to the typical 13% or more haircut liquidated CDP holders usually sustain when their debt-to-loan ratios fall below the minimum threshold.    Liquidation heuristics    The finding puts pressure on MakerDAO‚Äôs liquidation markets, which are already being overhauled by the community. Creating and destroying the platform‚Äôs native dai stablecoin is dependent on Maker self-executing liquidations when appropriate. Yet, as B.Protocol puts it, ‚ÄúIt is not clear such a threshold exists.‚Äù Rather, Keepers rely on vague ‚Äúheuristics.‚Äù      ‚ÄúThe core reason for the fact that small Vaults were not liquidated is likely because the liquidators did not find it profitable to initiate the liquidation process,‚Äù the blog states.      Read more: MakerDAO‚Äôs DAI Stablecoin Breaks $1B Market Cap      One decentralized finance (DeFi) arbitrage firm CoinDesk spoke with under the condition of anonymity concurred with B.Protocol‚Äôs assessment, adding that other DeFi lending schemes such as Aave or Compound are far simpler. ‚ÄúWith those protocols we don't have to price things and just need to consider whether there is enough liquidity,‚Äù the source said.      The ten-thousand-foot picture is far more flattering, however. Not only has MakerDAO's total value locked (TVL) shot north of $2 billion, but its ability to address architectural slights on the fly throughout 2020 does give some credence to DeFi's ever-growing dependency on governance tokens.      The finding is B.Protocol‚Äôs second in the last few weeks, the last being the use of a flash loan on Maker‚Äôs governance portal to close an election early. (B.Protocol offers lending market liquidation products).

Announced in a press release Monday, Clayton led the U.S. regulator for 3.5 years and through what the SEC called a ""period of historic productivity and unprecedented challenges.      ""Thanks to the hard work of the diverse and inclusive SEC team, we have improved investor protections, promoted capital formation for small and larger businesses, and enabled our markets to function more transparently and efficiently,‚Äù Clayton said in the announcement.      Under his leadership, the regulator has consistently rejected proposals for a¬†bitcoin exchange-traded fund¬†(ETF)¬†on grounds of concerns about fraud and market manipulation. However, recently Clayton softened his stance by expressing openness to the idea of a tokenized ETF.      Regarding his role in the digital assets space, he told a Senate committee in 2019 that the SEC has taken ""a measured, yet proactive regulatory approach that both fosters innovation and capital formation while protecting our investors and our markets.""      The SEC has taken numerous actions against crypto initial coin offering (ICO) projects under his watch, though he has said token issuances can be an effective way to raise funds as long as the rules are followed.      Clayton's decision to step down comes ahead of an impending change of presidential administration in the White House.

42405439,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMSSX,1605527514,Record Levels of Negative-Yielding Debt Strengthen Case for Bitcoin: Analysts,"Bitcoin's long-term bullish case may have gotten another boost as the global stockpile of negative-yielding bonds hits a new high.      The value of the Global Negative-Yielding Debt Index from Bloomberg and Barclays is now at a record level of $17.05 trillion, surpassing the previous lifetime high of $17.04 trillion reached in 2019. The figure has more than doubled in the past eight months.      A negative-yielding bond offers less money at maturity than the original buying price. The sharp rise in volume is the result of the massive liquidity-boosting bond purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.      The towering stockpile of bonds yielding negative returns is said to be an incentive for investors and corporations to pour money into inflation-resistant assets such as bitcoin. That's not only because these bonds yield losses on maturity, but also because the money received at maturity may be worth less in real terms than than when purchased, with the central banks' massive liquidity injections expected to boost inflation.      ""The more central banks print money and push bond yields lower to contend with ongoing stress in the global economy, the more compelling the economics around bitcoin become,"" Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk over Telegram.      Ever since its inception, bitcoin has been dubbed ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù because it is considered durable, fungible, divisible, recognizable and scarce, just like the precious metal. Several public listed companies and top investors have diversified their investments into bitcoin this year, validating its appeal as a reserve asset/inflation hedge.      The trend may continue. John Ng Pangilinan, a managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital, expects yield-hungry investors to pour money into bitcoin. ""On our end, we are seeing an uptick in the number of investors looking at earning yield from lending out bitcoin.""      Bitcoin holders can lend the top cryptocurrency on various exchanges and earn significantly higher interest rates than the yields offered by government bonds ‚Äì up to 6%, according to data aggregator DeFi Rate.      Looking ahead, the volume of bonds offering a loss at maturity looks set to increase, as the central banks have little scope to scale back or halt bond purchases amid the resurgence of the coronavirus crisis across major portions of the globe.      ""Expect more liquidity injections from central banks. Markets will be well supported with gold and bitcoin continuing to benefit,"" macro investor Dan Tapiero tweeted early on Monday.      Bitcoin is currently trading at $16,335, representing a 2.3% gain on the day.      The cryptocurrency has gained 51% so far this quarter and is up over 120% on a year-to-date basis.

42405407,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMQ11,1605521615,The SEC Is Still Working Out What 'Qualified Custodian' Means for Crypto,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is once again asking about qualified custodians and how crypto custody fits into this regulatory framework.      Last month, the Wyoming Division of Banking granted a no-action letter to Two Ocean, a wealth management firm hoping to offer custodial services for digital assets (which include virtual currencies) and call itself a qualified custodian.      In the letter, the division said it ‚Äúwould not pursue enforcement action against Two Ocean for holding itself out to the public as a ‚Äòqualified custodian‚Äô if Two Ocean operates in conformity with applicable laws and rules surrounding the safekeeping of customer assets, including both Wyoming and federal law.‚Äù      In response, the SEC published a statement asking for public input on ‚Äúqualified custodians,‚Äù noting that Wyoming‚Äôs letter touched on both state and federal law, and hinting the responses it gets may inform amendments to existing guidance to provide future clarity.      The statement‚Äôs very existence is a sign the SEC is still looking at cryptocurrency issues like custody, but confirms there is much work to be done in clarifying how digital assets fit into existing regulatory frameworks, industry experts said.      ‚ÄúI think essentially the SEC is coming out here and saying, ‚ÄòYes, it‚Äôs great that the Wyoming Division of Banking has issued this interpretation to you but we may have a different view and we are in the process of considering these issues,‚Äô‚Äù said Philip Angeloff, an attorney with Clifford Chance, a multinational law firm.      The regulator isn‚Äôt directly saying its view differs from the Wyoming Division of Banking. Rather, it sounds more like the agency has yet to finalize its position, Angeloff told CoinDesk. Ensuring that it‚Äôs clear which companies fall into the definition of a ‚Äúqualified custodian‚Äù remains under the SEC‚Äôs purview.      Still, the very fact the SEC is bothering to respond is a promising sign for the crypto industry, said Andrea Tinianow, an attorney who runs her own consulting firm.      ‚ÄúThis public statement reinforces the notion that digital assets are not going away, they are gaining in popularity,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSerious investors are paying attention to this asset class and they need to be protected, and that‚Äôs why the SEC is taking this up.‚Äù      The SEC move may benefit institutional investors and other parts of the investment community, she said.    Qualified custodians    The term ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù is a legal one, defined by the SEC as a bank, broker-dealer, futures commission merchant or other entity that maintains client funds and securities in specific ways. The federal regulator can designate an entity as a qualified custodian, while state-level regulators typically cannot.      That hasn‚Äôt stopped a number of crypto companies from trying to become qualified custodians, but by and large most have given up their bids and instead focus on becoming state-chartered trust companies, which still lets them offer custody services under regulatory oversight.      While the Wyoming Division of Banking determined that Two Ocean could call itself a qualified custodian, other trust companies or entities cannot do so without receiving similar letters of their own, the letter warned.      ‚ÄúThis is a fact-intensive analysis based on the assertions made in your letter of [July 27, 2020]. The guidance provided in this letter may no longer apply if these facts were to materially change,‚Äù the letter said.      Read more: SEC, FINRA Issue Explanation of Crypto Custodian Approval Delay      This distinction is important. As the Wyoming letter notes, the law surrounding custody, especially for digital assets, ‚Äúis not fully developed.‚Äù This means it may be difficult to ascertain which companies can provide custody for assets like virtual ones, or how these assets are treated under law.      In response, the SEC published a statement telling the general public to send it comments on how the ‚ÄúCustody Rule,‚Äù a part of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, should apply to issues like digital assets.      Chris Land, general counsel at the Wyoming Division of Banking, told CoinDesk this question has hovered over the industry for a few years, noting that most crypto custodians in the U.S. currently operate as trust companies.      One of the main issues for a trust company is whether custody qualifies as a fiduciary activity, another important regulated activity that falls under the Advisers Act.    Good sign    The SEC‚Äôs letter is encouraging, Land said. The SEC is highlighting that investment advisers must consider their fiduciary duties when acting as a qualified custodian, and in his view the federal agency is just laying out questions around this issue.      ‚ÄúThe SEC letter and our letter both agree we have shared power over this area, the custody area, but I don‚Äôt think that line has been drawn with the precision that the banking industry and the securities industry might like, and I think that‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôre both going to have to work together [on],‚Äù he said.      Tinianow agreed, saying trust companies and other entities are likely to provide ‚Äúthoughtful input‚Äù in response.      The move fits into a broader trend of recognizing that digital assets have value, something many states have already done by crafting laws around the space, she said.      ‚ÄúThe SEC staff would not invest its time, resources or expertise if this was going away,‚Äù she said.      Read more: Texture Capital Awarded FINRA License to Trade Security Tokens      What the letter does show is the SEC is maintaining its ground in terms of being able to declare whether or not an entity is a qualified custodian, Angeloff said.      ‚ÄúIn some cases, law firms and, as in this case, state regulatory agencies, could provide their interpretation of state and federal law, but the SEC has the final word on interpreting the Advisers Act,‚Äù he said.      In other words, while the Wyoming Division of Banking can tell entities they look like qualified custodians, those entities should still be talking to the SEC, he said.      ‚ÄúFrom my perspective, this is a sign that the SEC staff is still grappling with the notion that digital securities can be held on a distributed ledger and is still in the process of forming a definitive view as to how intermediaries that provide digital securities custody services can provide such services in compliance with the securities law and SEC rules,‚Äù he said.    Not bitcoin    The question of how digital assets are relevant to qualified custodians only applies to securities, meaning assets like bitcoin are not affected, Land said.      ‚ÄúI think providing further clarity around which virtual assets are securities is another issue,‚Äù he said.      Land noted the question does not apply to Wyoming‚Äôs Special Purpose Depository Institution license. So far only two entities have received this license ‚Äì Kraken and Avanti ‚Äì and both are operating as banks under the state law.      Read more: PayPal Removes Waitlist for New Crypto Service, Boosts Weekly Purchase Limit to $20K      ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs reflective of the SEC‚Äôs willingness to continue to look hard at digital assets and I‚Äôm fairly encouraged by the SEC putting that statement out. It was quite good, in my opinion. It was thoughtful and highlighted the issues well, in my opinion,‚Äù Land said.      The SEC‚Äôs statement asks whether state-chartered companies resemble qualified custodians, how their services compare, what advisers might look at when assessing custodians and if there are any qualified custodians that do not match the policy goals.¬†Members of the public interested in commenting to the SEC can email the agency, and the SEC will make all responses publicly available, it said.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/16/the-sec-is-still-working-out-what-qualified-custodian-means-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/656b169531f325d5fb731eca066a4efe41479dbf-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post on Thursday, Director of Research Ria Bhutoria said she was addressing persistent ""criticisms and misconceptions"" about the cryptocurrency. These include whether bitcoin is too volatile to be a store of value, has failed as a means of payment and is environmentally wasteful.      ""Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility is a trade-off [that] makes for perfect supply inelasticity and an intervention-free market,"" she said, but with greater adoption and introduction of derivatives and investment products, volatility may continue to drop.      According to the Bhutoria, the world's first cryptocurrency's ""core"" use case isn't in payments. However, it uses its limited capacity for settling transactions that aren‚Äôt well-served by traditional rails, and offers ""high settlement assurances.""      ""Limited throughput is the trade-off bitcoin makes for decentralization, which is a direct result of cheap and easy validation,"" she wrote.      The post responds to bitcoin's reputation for sucking up vast amounts of energy in the mining process, arguing a ""substantial portion"" of its power consumption comes from renewable sources. Further, the energy it does expend is a ""valid and important"" use.      ""Bitcoin transactions connected to illicit activity are very low,"" Bhutoria went on, addressing a common criticism of cryptocurrencies in general. Like cash, bitcoin is ""neutral and has properties that may be valuable to good actors and bad actors,"" she said.      As for the argument that bitcoin isn't backed by anything, such as real-world assets, it is in fact ""backed by code and the consensus that exists among its key stakeholders"" was Bhutoria's response.      See also: Fidelity Report Says Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Cap Is ‚ÄòDrop in the Bucket‚Äô of Potential      Bitcoin is growing because people recognize it offers ""perfect scarcity ... transaction irreversibility, and seizure and censorship resistance,"" she said.

The whole of bitcoin's existence has been characterized by major price swings, ""exactly the kind of thing that sustains a long-term trend,"" said Thomas Fitzpatrick, global head of the company's CitiFXTechnicals market insight product, in his report solely intended for the bank's institutional clients.      The report was first leaked to the cryptocurrency community by Twitter user ""ClassicMacro"" in a tweet on Saturday, noting Fitzpatrick is ""a big fan of moon targets.""      Fitzpatrick pointed to bitcoin's weekly chart and used technical analysis (TA) of prior highs and lows to determine a target of $318,000 by December 2021.      ""This kind of technical analysis is of little value,"" ClassicMacro commented in his tweet. ""There is no edge in guessing targets so far in time with TA. All we know is that price is likely to continue going up.""      The Citibank executive drew on bitcoin's 2010-11 ""exponential move"" as being ""very reminiscent"" of the 1970s gold market.

42405412,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMQ4x,1605502860,New MIT Paper Roundly Rejects Blockchain Voting as Solution to Election Woes,"As media outlets waited to announce a winner until the Saturday following the U.S. presidential election, calls for how blockchains would have made this process easier emerged, most prominently perhaps by Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, as well as Vitalik Buterin, who added that, though there are technical challenges, the call for a blockchain-based, mobile voting app ‚Äúis directionally 100% correct.‚Äù      A new report from MIT, however, strongly argues against the idea of blockchain-based e-voting, largely on the basis that it will increase cybersecurity vulnerabilities that already exist, it fails meet the unique needs of voting in political elections and it adds more issues than it fixes.      The report's authors are Ron Rivest, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) professor and one of the creators of RSA encryption; Michael Specter; Sunoo Park; and Director of MIT‚Äôs Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) Neha Narula. The paper was published on the research team's website this week and is being reviewed by a major cybersecurity journal for publication this winter..      ‚ÄúI haven't yet seen a blockchain system that I would trust with a county-fair jellybean count, much less a presidential election,"" said Rivest in a blog post accompanying the report.    Why online voting isn‚Äôt like digital banking    The report recognizes the desire for people to want the voting process to be faster and more efficient, but pushes back on the idea that just because we do things like shop or bank online, that means elections should be done in the same way.      One reason is that those systems have ‚Äúhigher tolerances for failure.‚Äù For example, if an issue were to occur, such as credit card fraud, you could block your card and a bank might even reimburse you. But when it comes to election, there is little remedy if a vote is altered or not delivered, particularly given that online voting systems might not always recognize when one of these actions occurred.      Read more: Overstock Touts Voatz ReBlockchain Voting App as Solution to US Election Fracas      Another is that anonymity, or at least detaching the way you voted from your identity, is an important part of any electoral process. While a bank or shop can offer you a receipt, proving you did something to detect or prevent fraud, with voting, it‚Äôs important no such receipt exists so votes can‚Äôt be coerced or sold.      ‚ÄúFor elections there is no insurance or recourse against a failure of democracy,‚Äù Rivest says. ‚ÄúThere is no means to ‚Äòmake voters whole again‚Äô after a compromised election.‚Äù      And the cybersecurity issues are numerous.    Issues with cybersecurity in online voting    One issue with online voting is that it opens itself up to attacks that are both scalable and undetectable.      In terms of scale, according to the report, a zero-day Android vulnerability only cost $60,000 to acquire in 2012. A zero-day vulnerability is a security flaw that is known about but for which a patch isn‚Äôt yet available.      The authors estimate that testing and weaponizing such a vulnerability would increase the associated costs by two orders of magnitude, meaning an election exploit could cost $6 million. While that may seem like a large sum, it‚Äôs little for a nation-state adversary, especially in comparison with the roughly $768 million that was spent on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This makes a scalable attack on an election system attractive, in terms of getting a bang for your buck.      Such an attack could also be undetectable, resulting in large numbers of votes being exploited. This is, in part, due to the number of vendors and devices that would have to be involved.      ‚ÄúVoting system flaws might be introduced by the voting software vendor, the hardware vendor, the manufacturer or any third party that maintains or supplies code for these organizations,‚Äù reads the report.      ‚ÄúA voter using a phone to vote depends not only on the phone vendor, but on the hardware companies providing drivers for the device, the baseband processor, the authors of third-party code in the voting software, the manufacturer of the physical device and the network or any other systems that the device relies upon to cast the vote.‚Äù    No concrete solutions to non-hypothetical problems    Even important tools like encryption don‚Äôt offer a concrete solution. While encryption does offer some protections, it doesn‚Äôt prevent system bugs. Plus, implementing it is difficult, not to mention there are numerous examples of flaws in a system allowing cryptographic protocols to become compromised.      These concerns aren‚Äôt just hypotheticals. The report notes that electronic-only voting devices at polling stations used in Georgia and Maryland, for example, have previously been shown to be vulnerable, and internet voting systems in cities like Washington, D.C., and countries including Estonia and Switzerland were found to be vulnerable to serious failures.      Read more: Downvoted: Security Researchers Slam Voatz Over Stance on White-Hat Hackers      For comparison, tried-and-true methods such as mail-in ballots make a large-scale attack on them incredibly difficult to conduct with any ease because of substantial friction points, like needing physical access to the ballots.      When asked whether there were lessons the U.S. could take from other countries when it comes to voting online, an MIT CSAIL spokesperson said, ‚ÄúNone that are positive. Online voting systems will suffer from major vulnerabilities for the foreseeable future, given the state of computer security and the high stakes in political elections.‚Äù    The arguments for blockchain-based voting ‚Äì and why they don‚Äôt hold up    The report lays out a number of arguments that have been held up by blockchain proponents. These include using coins as votes, using a permissioned blockchain and employing zero-knowledge proofs for secret ballots.    Voting with coins    Coins as votes is one model the report identifies as problematic. In it, a registered voter has a public/private key pair created by the voting authority, with each voter sending their public key to the voting registry.      ‚ÄúThen, the voter registry spends one coin to each public key. To vote, each user spends their coin to the candidate of their choice. After a period, everyone can look at the blockchain, total up each candidate's coins, and select the one with the most coins as the winner,‚Äù reads the report.      Read more: Trump‚Äôs Post-Election Purge Reaches US Cybersecurity Agency      The issue here is that it doesn‚Äôt provide a secret ballot ‚Äì all the votes are on a public blockchain. It also relies on users being able to get their votes on the blockchain in a certain amount of time, something that could be compromised through distributed denial-of-service attack, making the network unavailable to users.      An adversary could drive up transaction fees on a public blockchain, further hampering the ‚Äúvote.‚Äù Or the blockchain could be compromised if a majority of the miners or validators collude, creating multiple versions of the blockchain.      Finally, it relies on private key management, something that is user-dependent and, as cryptocurrencies have shown, something people are often bad at implementing.    Permissioned blockchains    Another proposal the report challenges is using a permissioned blockchain. A permissioned blockchain is one in which a central actor approves who can be a part of it. There is also usually a control layer that governs what actions participants have permission to perform.      Like voting with coins, use of this strategy would still suffer from key management vulnerabilities. Furthermore, permission parameters would also keep users from reading the blockchain to verify their votes were counted in order to preserve the secrecy of people‚Äôs votes.      A permissioned blockchain would also likely run on a smaller number of servers, with most of them running the same operating system, meaning it would be easier to compromise.    Zero-knowledge proofs    A final proposal that MIT examines is the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs are a cryptographic technique that allows two parties on the internet, such as an app and a user, to verify information with each other without sharing the underlying data related to this information. This would seemingly help ease the tension between secrecy and making a vote publicly verifiable.      But the report notes that, aside from the potential bugs in ZKPs and challenging cryptographic processes, it also doesn‚Äôt prevent physical monitoring by ‚Äúcoercers or vote buyers.‚Äù      Additionally, the report argues that ‚Äúzero-knowledge proofs are designed for a setting where the party with secret information wants to keep it secret (that's why they're using zero-knowledge proofs) - they generally do not prevent that party from revealing information voluntarily.‚Äù      Read more: ‚ÄòSnake Oil and Overpriced Junk‚Äô: Why Blockchain Doesn‚Äôt Fix Online Voting      A final and fundamental concern about any digital processes such as these, however, is that they rely on various vendors, hardware and software, all of which add additional complexities and likely vulnerabilities to the voting process.      ‚ÄúThe biggest issue is that blockchain-based approaches require that voters use software in which a single bug could undetectably change what they see - for example, showing them that their vote was cast for a certain candidate when it actually wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù said a MIT CSAIL spokesperson. ‚ÄúBlockchain is ripe for situations where election results could be changed in ways that are undetectable, or, even if detected, would be irreparable without running an entire new election.‚Äù      The report also plays up that elections have stakes beyond just losing money, as would be the case if these online voting tools were compromised in regards to cryptocurrencies.    Blockchain has lots of potential, just not for actual voting    The report notes it isn't addressing voting within a blockchain, such as EOS holders voting for validators in consensus networks, or Augur users using REP to vote on contract outcomes. These may fulfill some aspects of voting, but don‚Äôt map onto the system of political elections well, and leave many vulnerabilities that can't be accounted for.      The report also recognizes it‚Äôs focusing on voting, not areas such as voter registration management or auditing.      In conclusion, the report notes that blockchain and online voting don‚Äôt address fundamental security concerns; instead, they introduce more vulnerabilities than are present in current in-person and mail-in ballot systems.      ‚ÄúIf vote-casting is entirely software-based, a malicious system could fool the voter about how the vote was actually recorded,‚Äù said Rivest in an accompanying blog. ‚ÄúDemocracy ‚Äì and the consent of the governed ‚Äì cannot be made contingent on whether some software correctly recorded voters‚Äô choices.‚Äù",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/16/new-mit-paper-roundly-rejects-blockchain-voting-as-solution-to-election-woes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51fd02914be4ee324dc12a643d42232f94722091-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
