This increase is indicative of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where significant coins such as Dogecoin are also reaping the rewards of overall market optimism. Related Reading: XRP Price Patterns And 2024 Election Spark Talk Of A New Rally SHIB’s ascent, presently valued at $0.00002803, is gathering traction, drawing the interest of both retail and institutional investors. In the past 24 hours, SHIB’s trading volume reached $5.69 billion, clearly indicating market awareness. This behavior indicates that SHIB may be preparing for substantial price fluctuations, particularly if market sentiment continues to be optimistic. Favorable Sentiment For The Memecoin A huge portion of SHIB growth can be attributed to the positive sentiment that exists in the cryptocurrencies market. Recent election results in the United States have instilled growing confidence, which seems to be spreading within the crypto space. The broader crypto landscape’s renewed confidence has largely acted as a catalyst in pushing the price up for SHIB. Some analysts even foresee that the price might shoot up as much as 306% based on this positive outlook. This optimism has resulted in a significant increase in whale activity, with substantial investors executing transactions that may substantially enhance SHIB’s value in the forthcoming months. With the growing interest in meme coins, SHIB’s market position appears increasingly favorable. Whale Activity Indicates Confidence One major determinant of SHIB’s growth is whale activity. Previously quiet for eight months, an investor has now reappeared and sent significant amounts of SHIB to exchanges. One such deal is the $2.81 million worth of 100 billion SHIB transfer to Gemini. This trade among others shows that whales are positioned deliberately to take advantage of SHIB’s recent spike. Early $SHIB buyer “0xd6b,” with a $120M profit, is back to offload tokens after 8 months of inactivity. An hour ago, this whale deposited 100B $SHIB ($2.81M) to #Gemini, leaving 2.5T $SHIB ($73M) remaining. Total estimated profit from $SHIB: $120M (+415%). Follow @spotonchain… https://t.co/yGvZt3QyKC pic.twitter.com/SODtxnIZ77 — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) November 12, 2024 The whale holds a massive 2.5 trillion SHIB, worth around $73 million even after moving large volumes. This behavior usually shows trust in the potential of the asset, implying that large investors are orienting themselves for continuous expansion. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot Shiba Inu & Market Dynamics SHIB’s future will likely be influenced by persistent whale activity and prevailing market mood. The cryptocurrency market’s evolution indicates a robust development potential for SHIB. The growing interest from institutional investors, along with the fervor of regular traders, may create conditions for another substantial price surge. Nonetheless, with profit-taking already underway, it is evident that certain investors are attempting to realize their profits. The euphoria surrounding SHIB, driven by favorable sentiment and substantial transactions, remains elevated, with many wagering on the memecoin’s further success. The forthcoming months will be pivotal in ascertaining whether SHIB can sustain its rising trajectory or will encounter a setback.

Major corporations and institutions are adopting Bitcoin, integrating it into treasury strategies, and offering Bitcoin ETPs, signaling its acceptance as a strategic asset. Small-cap companies like Semler Scientific and MetaPlanet have seen significant stock price appreciation after adopting Bitcoin strategies, highlighting BTC's potential for value creation. The upcoming launch of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs will enhance BTC's market maturity, liquidity, and attractiveness, despite its inherent volatility risks. Few metaphors are as enduring in finance as ""Tulip Mania."" In the 1630s, the Dutch fell in love with tulips, turning them from a rare luxury into an object of mass speculation. At its peak, a single tulip bulb could be worth as much as a house, only for the market to crash spectacularly, leaving many in ruin. It was one of the earliest recorded speculative bubbles, and it's become a cautionary tale ever since. So it’s no surprise that whenever an asset's price surges, someone inevitably compares it to those infamous tulips. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), now trading above $87,000 per coin and surging above previous all-time-highs, has faced this exact comparison for its entire existence. Skeptics have dismissed it as ""digital tulips"" or compared it to the Beanie Baby craze of the 1990s. But the narrative is quickly shifting now that Bitcoin has a dozen spot ETFs with enormous inflows , now that Bitcoin is being adopted by various corporations as a strategic reserve asset, and now that robust US-based options markets will develop over Bitcoin via the spot ETFs. What was once seen as tulips is now being seen as a legitimate asset class, driven by adoption from individuals to small companies to major institutions. Yet, little about the Bitcoin network has materially changed. Bitcoin still works with 10 minute blocktimes, 1 MB of space per block, 2.1 quadrillion total satoshis (100 million satoshis makes 1 BTC), a difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks, a halving every 210,000 blocks, and proof-of-work consensus. It is the world that is waking up to Bitcoin, and not Bitcoin that is changing to be more agreeable to the world. One thing about asset bubbles is that they tend to not resurge after crashing. Bitcoin, therefore, must be a very unique form of tulip, because it simply refuses to die. Here’s the log chart, so you can see how many times it has crashed over 70% but has broken out to new highs. BTC All Time (bitinfocharts.com) Very recently, we just saw a very convincing breakout through the ATH setback in 2021. This was right before BTC crashed over 70%. Here’s the 3-year chart. BTC 3YR (bitinfocharts.com) So basically, the “tulips” have done it again. This is the fourth time the digital tulip has surged up in classic tulip mania fashion, right before erasing 70% of its market cap, and then proceeding to surpass the previous high in another tulip mania. Each time, the highs and lows were higher than the highs and lows of the previous time. And each time, bears and skeptics called for the final death of the digital tulips at the bottom, usually right before another manic rally commenced. This is the fourth time BTC has surpassed the previous tulip-mania high, making this current rally the beginning of the fifth tulip mania. Five tulip manias occurring in rather orderly 4-year cycles These are some very special tulips indeed. You will note that the original tulips of the Dutch did not make a comeback after the very first mania. Bitcoin is on its fifth mania and now publicly traded corporations are buying these tulips too. Now, I’ve been heavily buying these tulips and have recommended them to everyone who would talk to me. Here’s my article published over a year ago - Bitcoin: Why I'm Buying 14-Year-Old Tulips With Both Hands . Today BTC is past 15 years old, and two weeks ago on 31 October was the 16th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper publication. The tulips have more than 3X’d since I wrote the article, and I’m still buying with both hands. I still see plenty of upside, and here I’ll go through why. From Flowers to Corporate Treasury Asset At this point, I hope it is clear that BTC behaves less like tulips and more like an asset that is experiencing a very volatile multi-year price discovery process. It started from 0 in 2009 and is now an asset that is bigger than many (smaller) fiat currencies and bigger than silver. The landscape has changed. Major corporations are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, not as a gamble, but as a way to store their economic energy and recapitalize the business. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has made headlines with their Bitcoin purchases. This is a mediocre software business which has prioritized increasing BTC per share over anything else. The result is quite literally outperformance over every stock in the S&P 500 . MSTR Outperforming Everything In SPX (Saylor) The MSTR playbook is open for anyone to study. It is very easy to focus a business on acquiring BTC. The most difficult part is understanding the reason for buying BTC and developing the conviction. Once this conviction is developed, the action of focusing on acquiring BTC is almost certainly going to cause significant value creation for shareholders, as we’ll see below. Even traditional financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock have entered the market, offering Bitcoin ETPs. The message is clear: Bitcoin is no longer just for a fringe group of retail enthusiasts; it’s becoming a legitimate and strategic asset for corporate treasuries and institutional investors seeking diversification. SMLR And MetaPlanet: Case Studies In Bitcoin Adoption For Small-Cap Companies While the headlines often focus on large corporations, I think it’s in the small-cap space where Bitcoin’s adoption story is becoming even more compelling. Look at Semler Scientific (SMLR): a lesser-known small-cap medical services company with no debt and strong cash flows. SMLR is a good business. But the stock price didn’t reflect any appreciation for its objective achievements. The company was sitting on $60 million in cash and cash equivalents in Q1 2024. The price had fallen from the 50s to the low 20s in the first five months of 2024. In May 2024, SMLR made the bold move to start buying BTC , allocating nearly all its cash to BTC. The resulting price action speaks for itself. SMLR (Google) I’ve been bullish on this stock since the announcement of the Bitcoin acquisition strategy, as I cover in my article Semler Scientific's Bitcoin: The Next MicroStrategy? . I wasn’t even aware of SMLR's existence before that Bitcoin announcement, but it took only a glance at its strong capital structure and cash flow situation to realize that this stock could easily outperform if it started prioritizing BTC purchases. The strategy is not without doubters, even given the empirical facts of outperformance. Here was a comment from my SMLR article . Instead of buying-out other profitable niche businesses and growing the company, [SMLR] speculates on BTC. Even buying real estate, or pieces of art would be a smarter way to grow the intrinsic value of the company. Sell. The stock has rallied about 100% since this comment. At the time I responded with: Most buyouts are demonstrably overpaying. Real estate is a terrible investment - just look at how much ROE REITs generate. They are complete laggards. Art has no fungibility and is illiquid. BTC is the best place to store long term capital. Find me something else with 50% CAGR which no one entity can control. Now add on the fact that it is infinitely divisible, a bearer asset, and moves at light speed. Of course I can say ""I'll wait"" but let's be honest, you'll never find anything like this so I'll be waiting forever. That which constitutes good capital in the 21st century is shifting towards digital things. This trend is effectively unstoppable because the Internet has created unparalleled global connectivity and real-time updates of the world. As I stated in another response to the argument that art was as liquid as private debt (so SMLR could be better off buying art): If your measure of liquidity is against private debt then perhaps you can also send me your reasoning via carrier pigeon or the pony express. I'm sorry to bring you back to the real world, but the standard for liquidity in the digital age is increasingly approaching 24/7/365, worldwide accessibility. The writing is on the wall. Companies that get on the BTC train early are benefiting. This is simply the fact we can observe in the price action of these stocks. SMLR isn’t the only one. MetaPlanet is a tiny company in Japan that did the same thing. The price action, here in terms of the Japanese Yen, also speaks for itself. MetaPlanet (Google) A BTC strategy is not just a gimmick; it reflects a strategic play to enhance the balance sheet by injecting pristine capital into a business. If this weren’t the case, the market wouldn’t assign immediate premiums to stocks when they announce BTC strategies. It is very potent on a larger company like MSTR. But it is arguably even better to go from having no BTC to having some BTC. A small cap gets a huge amount of attention from the announcement alone, and the ability to increase BTC per share of course warrants a premium. The broader trend here is simple: small caps and private businesses have an opportunity to differentiate themselves by integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. As larger institutions embrace BTC, smaller players can follow suit, potentially boosting their stock valuations and creating a new wave of investor interest. I have been arguing that corporate adoption is the real catalyst during this fifth tulip mania. If more companies start buying BTC, it will send the price parabolically higher as the limited supply is squeezed. Rather than focusing on how President Trump might be crypto friendly, people need to see the big picture. Options on Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Another Gigantic Catalyst The impending launch of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs is another major benefit to BTC, bringing it one step closer to established financial assets. The reality is every single mature asset class has a robust and liquid options market. There are no exceptions. SPX, SPY, XSP, QQQ, IWM are the most liquid option chains in the world; they all have daily expiries. Then a step-down are TLT, GLD, SLV. These have expiries on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. A step-down from here would be the Magnificent 7 stocks with huge options volume, huge open interest, weekly expiries, and long-dated contracts. Options on Bitcoin ETFs means deeper liquidity and a more mature market structure, making BTC a more attractive asset for institutional investors because they will have the ability to hedge their positions. Options on BTC is a very deep topic, which I cover in the article IBIT Options Approval: Massive Watershed Moment For Bitcoin . The main thing I can see happening is that the reflexive flywheel of Option Greeks plus BTC’s absolute scarcity can create chaotic scenarios where rallies can extend by far more than what is normally considered possible. We’ve had various derivatives-driven tulip manias in smaller equities. The GME short and gamma squeeze in January 2021 was the most recent one. Like actual tulips, GME has failed to reclaim those highs. BTC will likely be very different. There is no ability to create more BTC to sell into rallies. This means price going higher is the only lever to satiate demand for BTC - and technically this doesn’t even satiate demand, it only prices out people who cannot pay the price. Risks In BTC Here’s the biggest risk I see for the corporate adoption thesis. BTC is still highly volatile, and its price can swing dramatically in a matter of days. This volatility could pose a unique challenge for corporate treasuries that choose to hold BTC. During steep market declines, companies might be tempted to panic-sell their reserves to shore up their balance sheets, potentially triggering a cascading wave of selling. This domino effect could amplify price declines and lead to broader market disruptions. However, I seriously doubt that crashes will kill BTC. It’s simply the Lindy Effect . At this point, it’s survived so many crashes that it’s becoming increasingly rational to assume that it just won’t die. Conclusion Bitcoin’s journey from ""tulips"" to a legitimate financial asset has been interesting. The growing adoption by corporations and the upcoming introduction of financial products like options on spot ETFs all point to a coming-of-age for the asset class. While the critics may continue to see BTC as tulips, the data tells a different story. As more companies integrate BTC into their financial strategies and institutions deepen their involvement, it becomes increasingly clear that BTC needs to at least be reclassified as “tulips with startling longevity.” In the end, whether you see Bitcoin as a bubble or the future of money, one thing is certain: these tulips have done it again—and they are almost definitely going even higher.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737096-bitcoins-rally-the-tulips-have-done-it-again?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36259558.jpeg

Bitcoin's peak may deter investors, making Ethereum a more attractive alternative, especially given its strong recent performance relative to Bitcoin. Ethereum's potential for DeFi growth and its programmable blockchain platform offer compelling reasons for investment amidst the current crypto market dynamics. Investment Thesis I recommend buying Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Trump's victory and his speech in favor of cryptocurrencies do not seem to be just noise. After Trump's victory, there was a record flow of purchases of crypto ETFs. However, as predicted , B itcoin ( BTC-USD ) has reached new all-time highs, and this may bring skepticism to investors. In this case, Ethereum may present a good risk-return ratio, and its momentum already seems to be showing positive signs. The Result Of The Elections Donald Trump was the big winner of the American election . The Republican Party also won a majority in the Senate and is very close to winning a majority in the House. This dominance helps Trump put his plans into practice. Trump (bitcoin2024) Trump's Speech It is worth remembering that Trump himself launched a cryptoasset venture, and his speeches were to make the United States of America the capital of cryptocurrencies . After the elections, data shows that the ""possible"" flow into cryptocurrencies is becoming a reality. BTC ETF inflows (Syz) As we can see above, Trump's victory led to a strong buying flow in Bitcoin ETFs. It is interesting to note that the day after the election result, the capital inflow in one day was similar to that of an entire week, an absurd flow. What was the effect of this? Bitcoin is at its all-time high , and logically this brings aversion to investors looking for a good risk-return ratio. In any case, there are other interesting options for exposure to the crypto market. Ethereum, The Alternative? Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is a blockchain that allows cryptocurrency to be transferred between individuals without the need for an intermediary. But it is also a programmable platform on which developers can create decentralized applications. But since cryptocurrencies are primarily flow-driven, it struck me that Ethereum achieved its best performance relative to Bitcoin since May, with renewed hopes for DeFi growth. ETH/BTC (Syz) This relationship made me quite curious, and I went looking for more information about the relative performance of Etherum versus Bitcoin. This relationship made me believe that there is an opportunity here. Let's see. ETH/BTC Ratio (Visual Capitalist) We can see from the chart above that the Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio is quite favorable to Bitcoin, indicating that if it returns to the average, Ethereum's upside would be over 100%, which corroborates my buy recommendation. But what would be the trigger for this? Triggers for Ethereum to Fire It is interesting to note that altcoin seasons, when other cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin, occur after strong Bitcoin rallies (as we are seeing). This occurs because Bitcoin price corrections tend to make investors look for other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Ethereum has links with the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which could suffer from regulatory scrutiny post-election. Trump's election appears to be beneficial in this regard, and future appointments to regulatory positions could be a trigger. Potential Threats To The Bullish Thesis The main risk to the thesis concerns the aggregate open interest of Ethereum futures, which reached a new all-time high and could act as a warning sign. Let's take a look at the chart below. ETH (coinglass) This surge in demand for leveraged Ethereum positions typically precedes sharp price corrections. On August 2, for example, the price dropped by more than 30% when this pattern occurred. Another risk is that by investing directly in Ethereum, the investor does not have an extra layer of security that the asset manager like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton can offer. The Bottom Line Trump's election victory and his speech brought an absurd flow of purchases for cryptocurrency ETFs. In this sense, Bitcoin reached an all-time high, raising skepticism about new purchases. Ethereum, on the other hand, is far from its all-time high. The ETH/BTC ratio is also leaning much more towards Bitcoin, however, a stronger momentum has been making Ethereum outperform Bitcoin recently. This is consistent with the idea that altseasons occur after strong Bitcoin highs. Based on this analysis, I recommend buying Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies in general should benefit from a new Trump administration, and for skeptical investors, the margin of safety seems greater in Ethereum.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737086-ethereum-alternative-for-investors-who-find-bitcoin-expensive?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36257956.jpeg

Despite a Q2 net loss, Canaan has improved operations, reducing operating expenses by 10.4% QoQ and increasing revenue to $71.9 million. Canaan's decreasing debt load and undervaluation compared to peers position it well to capitalize on Bitcoin's bullish momentum and hardware demand. Risks include Bitcoin's volatility and potential supply chain disruptions from U.S. policies, but Canaan's strong order backlog and market alignment offer upside potential. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining hardware manufacturers see increased backlogs around and after the Bitcoin halving event. If they are strategic and deliver upgraded products timely, this boosts their overall financials. Canaan Inc. ( CAN ) began the rollout and bulk delivery of the A14 series miner in Q2. The A14 series miners come in both air-cooled and liquid-cooled models. The A1466 delivers 150 TH/s at 21.5 J/T, and the A1466I achieves 170 TH/s at an improved efficiency of 19.5 J/T. Canaan has also recently begun shipping a more efficient A15 series miner. Data by YCharts I initiated coverage on Canaan in June with a “hold” rating. The stock was (and still is irrespective of the recent upward movement) one of the very few Bitcoin stocks that have fully leveraged the Bitcoin momentum since the start of this year. Though CAN showed potential for growth at the time, inventory management posed challenges for the company. Mining hardware manufacturers often face inventory challenges as hardware becomes inefficient for Bitcoin mining at different stages of the Bitcoin market cycle and the demand for hardware type and performance constantly changes. Canaan’s Q2: New Hardware Launch and Improved Operations Canaan showed improvements in its operations in Q2. And the introduction of the more efficient A14 series miners was a major highlight in Q2. Canaan was able to beat management Q2 revenue guidance of $70 million by $1.9 million, recording $71.9 in revenue. This has prompted a slight increase in Q3 guidance to $73, which was also initially $70 million. Canaan reported a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of ~$30.6 million, a slight improvement from $31.9 million in the previous quarter, reflecting cost-cutting efforts and adjustments for impairments and fair value changes. Q2’s net loss remained worrisome at $41.9 million. Total OpEx (Canaan Inc.) Total operating expenses saw a decline of 10.4% QoQ. Q2 total OpEx was $27.5 million as against Q1 total OpEx of $30.7 million, showing Canaan’s cost-cutting measures, especially in SG&A spending, with a notable reduction in stock-based compensations. This contributed to the reduction in operating loss, which decreased to $12.4 million from $17.7 million in Q1 - a 30% improvement. Despite improvements in operations, the bottom line was influenced by unrealized losses due to a fair value change of $10 million on Bitcoin holdings due to the asset’s price decline at the time. ASIC price index (hashrateindex.com) Q2 could have been a much better fiscal quarter for Canaan. Revenue in Q2 could have been higher if the market-wide prices of mining rigs had improved. The chart above represents the price per terahash trend of Bitcoin miners. We can see that the current price per terahash is a far cry from where it was during the last bull market in 2021. Average computing power sold in Q2 (Canaan Inc.) Canaan’s average selling price (“ASP”) in Q2, which is the average revenue per terahash of mining power sold in the quarter, rose by 33% QoQ. And the company recorded a total of $6.2 million in total computing power sales for the quarter. The higher total computing sales showed an increase in demand. And the more important metric, which is the ASP, showed an increase in the price of hardware. We could be set to enter the stage of the market cycle where the increase in ASP will be sustainable for the coming months. The increase in ASP indicates that customers are willing to pay more per unit of mining power, which is linked to higher Bitcoin prices and positive sentiment in the Bitcoin market. The $6.2 million in total computing power sales further supports this notion of rising demand. Normalized weekly price, Bitcoin vs mining machines (Coin Metrics, Bitcoin Magazine) Mining hardware prices are dynamic and typically move in tandem with Bitcoin’s price momentum. This means that in Bitcoin bull markets, the price of mining hardware increases, while in bear markets it decreases. From the chart above, notice how the price peaks of mining hardware coincide with Bitcoin price peaks. The current price of hardware favors Bitcoin miners, but is unfavorable for hardware manufacturers. Just a little digression here: this is why at the current stage of the crypto market cycle one of the important qualitative factors to look out for if you own the stock of one of the Bitcoin mining companies is how the Bitcoin miner is taking advantage of the current low price of mining hardware and expanding its hashrate capacity with newer, more efficient hardware. Though Bitcoin mining hardware prices have generally remained low since the halving, I believe that the recent uptick in ASP will be sustainable in the coming months as Bitcoin moves into full bull trajectory, as the asset has recently broken and now trades way past the $70,000 psychological level and is bound to stay above that level since the post-election rally kicked in, fueled by Donald Trump's victory and his pro-crypto stance. Data by YCharts CAN is beginning to take off here with a 55% price surge this past week. Though it seems every Bitcoin-related stock has seen some surge in the past week because of Bitcoin's own surge, I believe there will be a ceiling for Bitcoin stocks with weak fundamentals, as they may struggle to capitalize only on Bitcoin's momentum for long. Among Bitcoin stocks, Canaan remains undervalued compared to its peer group (of Bitcoin mining companies and mining hardware manufacturers). I believe Canaan has the potential for a higher run, as Bitcoin maintains bullishness, because of the timing of Canaan’s latest hardware release. EV/Sales peer comparison (Seeking Alpha) Also, Canaan’s debt reduction efforts in recent quarters means that it has become less leveraged and now trades at 2.45x EV/Sales. Despite the recent price surge, CAN still trades at lower valuation multiples compared to its peer group. Ebang ( EBON ), a direct peer of CAN, currently trades at 14.78x Price/Sales while facing declining sales ; CAN, on the other hand, has a strong backlog building up for A15 miners and will see boost in sales in the coming quarters, and rightly positioned for the Bitcoin rally, but trades at a 2.05x P/S. Price/Sales peer comparison (Seeking Alpha) Moving forward, CAN’s upside potential hinges on the success of the new A15 series miners as well as Bitcoin's momentum. Orders for the A15 series miners are already strong. Hive Blockchain ordered 6500 A1566 miners from Canaan just last week, in addition to orders from CleanSpark earlier this month. The timing of the launch of the A15 miners (already shipping this quarter, Q4 2024) is well aligned with the current market demand for more efficient miners, and this potentially gives Canaan some market competitive advantage. Below is a table of a head-to-head comparison of Canaan’s latest A15 series miners with BITMAIN'S newly unveiled ANTMINER S21+ series miners. A head-to-head comparison shows that Canaan’s latest miner offering is within the efficiency and performance expectation of industry demand, following the fourth Bitcoin halving. Canaan Avalon Miner A15Pro Canaan Avalon Miner A15XP Bitmain Antminer S21+ (Air-cooled) Bitmain Antminer S21+ (Hydro-cooled) Hashrate (TH/s) 215 200-212 216 319 Power Efficiency (J/T) 16.8 17.8 16.5 15 Delivery Timeline Already shipping Already shipping Shipping in Q1/Q2 2025 Shipping in Q1/Q2 2025 Culled by author from the press releases of the related companies. Risks Bitcoin's volatility remains a risk factor for Bitcoin stocks. In the wake of the U.S. elections and Donald Trump's victory, sentiment have been positive in both the stock and crypto markets - the S&P 500 and Dow have been in positive territory, while Bitcoin has surged over 30% since election night. Bitcoin’s higher surge is indicative of a higher volatility risk. Data by YCharts Another potential risk for companies like Canaan is also linked to the recent elections, where new policies and tariffs from the Trump administration, which historically have been critical of China, adds some uncertainty to the supply chain for China-based manufacturers like Canaan. Bottom Line Canaan is well strategically positioned with the release and timing of its latest A15 series miners, which align with the rising demand for more efficient mining hardware. With a decreasing debt load over the past few quarters, Canaan is now less leveraged and better positioned to capitalize on Bitcoin market opportunities. With a strong order backlog for the A15 miners and a product line that aligns with the current market demand for more efficient mining hardware, Canaan stands to benefit from Bitcoin's upward momentum.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737082-canaan-new-hardware-rollout-and-bitcoin-rally-combine-as-catalyst?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36257506.jpeg

36256306,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652897,1731533434,"Dogecoin Price To $20? Higher Montly Close Suggests 8,000% Run Is Possible","The Dogecoin price is starting to reverse some of its gains it made last week. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is down by 9% in 24 hours, but it is in a good place to reverse these losses very soon. Particularly, Dogecoin is still on track to close the month at a very long bullish candle. Notably, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted this phenomenon for the Dogecoin price on social media platform X. As pointed out by the analyst, Dogecoin is on track to close November above the previous highest monthly close level. Dogecoin Price To Make Higher Monthly Close Breaking above its previous highest monthly close might seem like a routine move during bullish rallies for some cryptocurrencies, but for Dogecoin, it signals something far more significant. Historically, each time the Dogecoin price exhibits this phenomenon, it has always marked the beginning of a stronger rally. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 82% Despite Recovery, Can SHIB Price Still Make It To $0.00008 ATH? Interestingly, this occurrence has been rare in Dogecoin’s 11-year history, making it even more impactful when it does happen. What’s more interesting is that whenever it occurs, it has always gained more than 1,000% in just a few months. The last time the Dogecoin price closed above its highest monthly close was in 2021, which ultimately led to a surge of more than 8,000% in about four months. This surge was what led to the current Dogecoin all-time high of around $0.732. Prior to the 2021 rally, a similar breakout took place in 2017. This earlier instance triggered an impressive 1,000% rise over the course of eight months. What Does This Mean The DOGE? Given these historical patterns, we could as well look forward to a repeat of a powerful rally in the coming months. According to price data, the current highest Dogecoin price monthly close is $0.35 in August 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is well on track to make a new highest monthly close this November. If history were to repeat itself, we could see Dogecoin surging between 1,000% and 8,000% in the coming months. Such a trend would not only be significant for Dogecoin investors but could also have broader implications for other cryptocurrencies in the meme coin market. As pointed out by Trader Tardigrade, a repeat of the first 1,000% case would see Dogecoin reaching $3.6 by July 2025. On the other hand, a repeat of the extraordinary 8,000% case would see Dogecoin reaching $26.9 by March 2025. Even a price movement between these two scenarios would result in a substantial return. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.372. Although it has retraced about 9% in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin is still up by 140% since the beginning of November.

42435344,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7Os,1731532876,Polymarket CEO's Home Is Raided by FBI,"Federal law enforcement officials raided the home of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan on Wednesday.  The prediction market was a breakout success in the U.S. presidential election, a platform where billions of dollars worth of bets were placed on the outcome. Polymarket traders viewed Donald Trump as the likely winner, as indeed he was.  The raid was confirmed by a Polymarket spokesperson. The New York Post and Axios reported the news earlier. According to the Post, the feds took Coplan's phone and other electronic devices. By all accounts, Coplan has not been arrested or charged with any wrongdoing.  Read more: Polymarket's Probe Highlights Challenges of Blocking U.S. Users (and Their VPNs)  Bloomberg later reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Polymarket for allegedly letting U.S. users access the site.  ""This is obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Polymarket is a fully transparent prediction market that helps everyday people better understand the events that matter most to them, including elections.""  Polymarket is supposed to block U.S. persons from accessing its services, after coming to a settlement with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2022.  A CFTC spokesperson told CoinDesk on Oct. 30 that, ""Polymarket is required to adhere to the terms of the settlement they reached with the CFTC. Full stop. That means they cannot accept any business from people living in the United States or US persons as we write in the order. It’s pretty clear. It is incumbent on the company to comply with the law.""  Despite this ban, Americans can trade on the platform though virtual private networks, or VPNs, which can be used to circumvent that prohibition. CoinDesk confirmed at least two Americans were able to place trades ahead of the 2024 election from locations in the U.S.  Last month, responding to a question from CoinDesk about price discrepancies between Polymarket and U.S.-regulated prediction market platforms, attorney Aaron Brogan said: ""Legally, these markets should have limited user overlap, but anecdotally I’ve heard enough stories about individuals in the US using VPNs to access Polymarket that I doubt this is a practical barrier to efficient pricing between the markets.""  Coplan seemed to be in good spirits late Wednesday afternoon, making a wry reference to the morning's events in a post on X.  Marc Hochstein contributed reporting.

The crypto asset manager gained 29.11% in the last six trading sessions. The stock has gained more than 108% so far this year, compared to an over 25% rise in the broader S&P 500 Index. GBTC is up 36% over the past one month. The stock closed 2.90% higher, at $71.23 on Tuesday. Cryptocurrencies have been on fire since Donald Trump won the White House, amid investor expectations that the 47th President's administration will embrace the sector. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has rocketed since Trump's election win, and is now closing in on the long-speculated $100K mark. On Wednesday, bitcoin topped $93K, but has since retraced a bit to $92.5K. Trump embraced crypto as part of his election campaign - a marked departure from President Joe Biden's current government, which has cracked down on the sector. Seeking Alpha analysts are cautious regarding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), and have rated it as HOLD. While Seeking Alpha’s Quant rating has an optimistic view, rating the stock a STRONG BUY , with a score of 4.80 out of 5. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) has received an A+ in terms of momentum and liquidity, and F on expenses, dividends, and risk. Despite the positive sentiment, Seeking Alpha analyst Noah Cox of Noah's Arc Capital Management argues that high management fees and significant tracking errors undermine GBTC's value proposition, making it less efficient for Bitcoin exposure. “Competing Bitcoin ETFs, like those from BlackRock, offer similar exposure at a fraction of GBTC's cost, making them more attractive to investors,” the analyst added.

On-chain data analysis suggests a new wave of demand for Bitcoin. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF holdings surpassing its Gold ETF. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices have continued their impressive run today, breaching the 90000 mark for the first time. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is now up around 30% since election day and a 121% YTD as the new generations ‘digital gold’ continues its ascent. The greed around crypto markets is evident at present, can you blame the hodlers? There does seem to be somewhat of a generational shift when it comes to investment flows, and this has been reflected in recent data. BlackRocks Bitcoin ETF has now surpassed the holdings of its Gold ETF, and this switch could in part explain the struggles of the precious metal as the new digital Gold grows in popularity. It would be unwise to dismiss this, as we have seen in 2024 that the world’s largest cryptocurrency appears to be less volatile than in the past. The reason for this has been touted as institutional adoption, which could be part of it. Source: FinancialJuice ETF Flows Soar Bitcoin ETFs have seen remarkable inflows over the past week. The last two days, however, saw close to $2 billion dollars of inflows, led largely by the IBIT ETF ( IBIT ). The continuation of ETF flows will be a comfort for fund managers and institutions in particular, with market participants expecting less volatile swings as mainstream adoption continues to increase. Can the inflows continue? Source: CoinMarketCap On-Chain Data Analysis – New Demand Wave Incoming? Looking at on-chain data analysis from Glassnode, In March, there was a big surge in profit-taking, reaching over $3.1 billion. Over the past seven months, as the market settled, both profits and losses balanced out. This indicates that supply and demand have reset. Now, we’re noticing an increase in profit-taking again, hinting that new demand is coming into the market. We can see changes in the market by looking at the difference between profits and losses. Right now, the market is mostly about profits, with profits being about 47 times bigger than losses. This shows that there are very few people holding Bitcoin at a loss as the market climbs to a new all-time high. Could we see a surge in profit taking that could scupper the rally? Source: Glassnode President Trump Plans The US President-elect Donald Trump is already making moves ahead of assuming office on the 20 January 2025. Markets have been buoyed by Trump’s victory, with crypto in particular benefiting. Markets are eyeing looser regulations under Trump, while Elon Musk has suggested the US Government use Bitcoin to help tackle outrageously high US debt levels. In the coming weeks, any further developments and comments by incoming members of Trump’s team may have a knock on effect for crypto. Interesting times ahead indeed. Technical Analysis BTC/USD Bitcoin is trading around 5% higher on the day, having breached the $90k barrier. It is becoming extremely difficult to do any technicals as there is a lack of historical price action. On the upside, I will pay attention to the round numbers like $95k before the 100k becomes a real possibility. The downside at least leave something to look at. BTC/USD is trading in overbought territory, with the RSI currently in the mid 80s. Now of course, we know that just because the RSI is in overbought territory it does not mean that a sell is imminent but worth paying attention to. Support on the downside may be found at 90000 before 88884 and 86334 come into focus. Lower down we have the 85000 handle and and the 81500 handle to focus on.

Related Reading: XRP Price Patterns And 2024 Election Spark Talk Of A New Rally With long-term predictions considerably more hopeful, they are now projecting a possible upside that may drive ADA’s price as high as $2.77 in the next months. However, technical indicators hint to ADA perhaps being underpriced right now, trading 16.99% below target forecasts for the next 30 days, data from CoinCheck up shows. Based on current analysis, ADA could soar to 139% within three months. While the one-year prognosis forecasts an amazing 168% increase, the six-month view is even more hopeful, predicting a 159% rise. Expectations For A Major Rally Analysts are hopeful that ADA will hit $7.77, with some predictions calling for a 1,700% increase. Even though it’s just a “prediction”, this massive price goal shows how far ADA has come and how big the market could be. These predictions are interesting, but they also show how unstable the crypto market is as a whole.

MSTR's C Corp structure results in double taxation, which is a less favorable tax structure than ETFs such as IBIT. While MSTR has some debt, each dollar of MSTR market cap is currently only backed up by $0.30 of bitcoin, potentially resulting in less bitcoin leverage than investors expect. MSTR Short Thesis MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is a C corporation that owns 280,000 bitcoins or $100/share, net of debt, and has a software business that is worth ~$7/share, for a total NAV of $107/share. Shares are trading today at $355/share and may have significant downside, regardless of the direction of Bitcoin. There are a few misconceptions that investors do not understand about MSTR that have led to extreme overvaluation, which I will share in this write-up. First, MSTR is a C Corporation, which is subject to double taxation on the sale of any Bitcoin gains. MSTR is subject to double taxation because shareholders who buy MSTR pay short-term or long-term gains on their trading gains in the shares. In addition, the company pays taxes on any gains in bitcoin realized at the corporate level. The company has been a long-term holder of bitcoin, and I expect that to continue; however, eventual tax considerations are important upon making an initial investment. Especially in a scenario where bitcoin really works well, like let's say to $1m, the company would pay capital gains if/when that is ever realized. Contrasting that to an ETF or investment vehicle that does not pay tax at the entity level is a meaningful disadvantage for MSTR versus an ETF like IBIT. There is no way to distribute the bitcoins or monetize the bitcoins without incurring significant tax liability. Because of this structural tax disadvantage, I think that MSTR eventually may trade in-line or even at a discount to NAV, given the superior legal and tax structure of ETFs. Second, MSTR uses what management calls ""intelligent leverage"". However, at this valuation, one dollar of MSTR market cap is only backed by $0.30 of bitcoin, and thus it is not a ""leveraged"" investment to bitcoin. Giving management credit, shares have significantly outperformed bitcoin because its premium to NAV increased from 1x to 3x over the last two years. However, on a go forward basis with only 30% exposure to bitcoin, MSTR might not keep up with bitcoin's performance in the future. I think that IBIT is a better option for investors seeking bitcoin exposure through a listed stock because of its long-term superior structure being an ETF which is not subject to double taxation and IBIT having 100% underlying exposure to bitcoin versus MSTR's 30% exposure. Further, MSTR pays a 2% fee for ATM equity issuance, which is a significant cost versus IBIT paying nothing for newly created ETF shares. While a small part of the story, I estimate the software business is worth $7/share. I estimate the software business is worth 3x TTM sales of $480m divided by 210m shares for a total $7/share. Sales are declining, and the business does not generate free cash flow. The business operates in the highly competitive field of business intelligence. I think this valuation is probably on the high side of what it would sell for in a private market transaction. Case study in February 2021. On February 9th, 2021, MSTR closed at $127/share, compared to its NAV $40/share, approximately 3.2x NAV (today's price/NAV is also 3.2x price/NAV). Bitcoin closed that day at $47,336. Bitcoin continued on to reach a closing high of $63,410 on 4/15/21, up +34% while MSTR closed at $74/share, -42% over that two-month period. Underperforming bitcoin by 76% in just two months from the same 3.2x price/NAV starting point that we are at today. And more importantly, declining significantly while the bitcoin price continued to rise. Given the significant premium and disadvantaged tax structure of being a C Corp, investors in MSTR should be aware that MSTR could decline even if bitcoin prices rise. In summary, I estimate that MSTR may be worth around 1x NAV or $107/share, given the disadvantageous tax structure of being a C Corp, which results in double taxation. Given each dollar of MSTR only has $0.30 of bitcoin behind it, I think there is a risk that MSTR underperforms bitcoin. Investors seeking bitcoin exposure may be better off buying a low-cost bitcoin ETF such as IBIT. Catalysts: MSTR's use of the ATM program increases the float and could eventually put pressure on the NAV premium. As investors better understand the tax consequences of MSTR being a C Corporation, some investors might switch their bitcoin exposure from MSTR to IBIT could reduce the premium to NAV that MSTR currently trades at. Risks: Bitcoin's price could increase significantly. MSTR's premium to NAV could increase.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737047-microstrategy-ccorp-means-double-taxation-107-nav-price-target?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36252369.jpeg

(In case you're interested in that history, we wrote here about how we turned $15,000 into $70,000 running an Ethereum validator.) We started covering Bitcoin technology in the newsletter along with Solana and Cosmos and Sui and everything else. Over time, the format evolved, and got a bit longer — as I increasingly geeked out over blockchain tech and found myself incrementally incompetent at leaving cool stuff out. I say that with utmost earnestness, because as the main author of The Protocol, I also got more and more snarky and cynical and jaded about the various news developments, especially regarding the money end of the business, while simultaneously getting more and more wowed by all of the developers and entrepreneurs in this space coming out with hundreds of fascinating projects and updates every week, as duly highlighted in the Protocol Village column.

Niche Bitcoin developer conference in Boston spurs discussions of what-if.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Espresso, STXN, Avara/Family, Tether, NEAR Foundation.  $143.5M of blockchain project fundraisings.  Network News  Justin Drake introduces his proposed Beam Chain upgrade roadmap (Ethereum Devcon/YouTube)  BEAMING IN FROM BANGKOK: At Ethereum's Devcon conference in Bangkok on Tuesday, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake revealed his proposal for a major redesign of Ethereum's consensus layer called ""Beam Chain."" Beam Chain is ""a proposed redesign of the consensus layer that incorporates all of the latest and greatest ideas from the Ethereum roadmap,"" Drake said in a speech at Bangkok's Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre. Drake's Beam Chain vision organizes a series of ""big ticket"" upgrades to Ethereum's consensus layer into a single package. The changes include adjustments to Ethereum's block production apparatus, as well as how it handles staking and zero-knowledge cryptography. Drake's presentation was highly anticipated—coming after months of speculation online and in crypto forums that the influential Ethereum researcher, who was instrumental to the 2022 Merge upgrade, was working on something major. Drake delivered his remarks to a packed convention hall, with onlookers spilling out into the hallway outside of the event's main stage. SEPARATELY, CoinDesk reported last week that the dollar value of the Ethereum Foundation's treasury shrank 39% over 2.5 years to $970 million.  DOGE WHISTLE! A frenzied narrative that boosted dogecoin (DOGE) prices over 500% turned to reality — as President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that it had picked Vivek Ramaswamy and technology entrepreneur Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that seeks to make government spending and administration more efficient. Musk, a big supporter of Trump's campaign, had been tweeting about the Department of Government Efficiency since early August. (This DOGE is not to be confused with D.O.G.E., a months-old and completely separate memecoin that went viral last week.) Even the New York Times's coverage of Trump's announcement flicked at the sly reference to DOGE. Musk, who owns the social media platform X, tweeted out what appears to be a cartoon promoting the new Department of Government Efficiency, featuring the face of a smiling dog.  Figure from just-published paper by prominent Bitcoin researchers mapping out a way of adding covenants to the blockchain without needing a soft fork. (Heilman, Kolobov, Levy, Poelstra)  A group of top Bitcoin developers collaborating across multiple teams claimed a breakthrough on the oldest and largest blockchain, outlining a way of adding a type of programming known as ""covenants"" that could unlock crucial functionality such as new wallet and vault features and more efficient layer-2 protocols. Importantly, the technique would not require changes to Bitcoin's main underlying code, a notoriously fraught process where consensus is typically seen as the threshold required to greenlight major upgrades known as a ""soft fork."" The announcement was detailed on Thursday in a research paper titled, ""ColliderScript: Covenants in Bitcoin via 160-bit hash collisions."" The team was led by Ethan Heilman, who separately is one of the authors of a proposed technique known as OP_CAT that could increase Bitcoin's programmability. However, that effort would require changes to the Bitcoin software, as would a separate proposal for covenants known as OP_CTV, proposed by the developer Jeremy Rubin. Other authors of the new research paper include Victor Kobolov and Avihu Levy of the StarkWare project and Andrew Poelstra, a longtime Bitcoin developer who currently serves as head of research at Blockstream.  Linea, the rollup blockchain built by Ethereum development firm Consensys, is on the brink of releasing its ""LINEA"" token, the company told CoinDesk's Sam Kessler. Consensys was founded by Joe Lubin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, and is today best-known as the company behind MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum wallet. The Linea network was released last year and represents Consensys' attempt to compete with a growing fray of layer-2 networks — blockchains that help scale Ethereum by offering users an extra lane for transacting more quickly and cheaply.  Roman Sterlingov, 36, a Russian-Swedish national who was convicted of four U.S. federal charges related to running the no-longer-operational bitcoin mixing service Bitcoin Fog, was sentenced to 12 years and six months, the Justice Department said in a press release.

In addition, Sterlingov was ordered to forfeit his interest in the Bitcoin Fog wallet, totaling approximately 1,345 BTC and currently valued at more than $103 million,"" the government said.  'Just Don't Break' Bitcoin: Devs Debate Upgrading Tech Behind Top Crypto  FUN FACT: Will Foxley, shown here opening OP_NEXT as the conference emcee, was a co-author of the Valid Points newsletter, the predecessor of The Protocol. (Danny Nelson/CoinDesk)  BOSTON –– Most of the world focuses on bitcoin (BTC)’s zipping price. Not so for the 100-odd bitcoiners who gathered at Fidelity Investments’ headquarters over the weekend.  They were preoccupied with helping the original cryptocurrency conquer the world – and meantime avoid getting wrecked.  “This is about getting bitcoin to the next billion people,” said Will Foxley, emcee of OP_NEXT, what he claimed was the first bitcoin scaling conference in five years.  OP_NEXT is the newest anomaly on crypto’s overstuffed conference circuit. It's got none of the retail-friendly bravado of Bitcoin Nashville. It lacks the corporate booths that dot ETH Denver. Few of its speakers shilled their crypto-business ventures, as nearly everyone did at Solana’s rebooted Breakpoint.  Instead, dozens of hoodie-wearing coder boys (and a handful of women) debated improvements that might make bitcoin more useful, usable, and even resilient against faraway problems that could one day upend the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency.

Ethereum is getting a new dimension: time. Smart Transactions (STXN), a new project from Vlad Zamfir, who pioneered Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain system, released on Wednesday a platform that will enable applications to execute transactions based on future events. The new platform, called the “Ethereum time machine,” extends the blockchain's programming capabilities by allowing smart contracts to execute transactions based on uncertain or not-guaranteed future events. “For example, a user could stipulate that a trade execute at a specified day and time conditional on a set of prerequisites,” the STXN team wrote in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “These prerequisites could be absolute, such as the dollar value of a particular asset, or relative – for instance, whether one asset is worth more than another. The potential permutations are almost unlimited, greatly increasing the dynamism of the largest blockchain for developers.”  Avara, the parent company behind Aave Labs and Lens, has launched Family Wallet, describing it as ""a secure, user-friendly crypto wallet for everyone,"" according to the team: ""It offers features like in-app messaging, NFT support, DeFi integration and advanced security."" The release comes roughly a year after Aave Companies bought Los Feliz Engineering, the development team behind Family, and rebranded as Avara.

Designed to support both human users and embrace new digital beings like AI agents, robots and autonomous systems.""  NEAR Foundation has launched Alpha for User-Owned AI with NEAR AI Assistant and Research Hub, according to the team: ""The AI Assistant provides users with a personalized, user-owned AI, capable of Web2 and Web3 interactions, from blockchain transactions to e-commerce. The hub fosters community-driven AI, enabling monetizable research. Additionally, NEAR Intents — a new blockchain transaction type — allow actions and data to flow seamlessly between AI agents and services.

42435348,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7Ra,1731525269,How a $115M Crypto Fund With Big Ambitions Plans to Invest In Latin America,"Hyla Fund Management is launching a new $30 million fund focused on the Latin American crypto sector.  The ""funds of funds"" specializes in giving investors access to other hedge funds.  The Latin American crypto market is still very small, Hyla CEO Paola Origel told CoinDesk, but it’s filled with opportunity.  There’s a big business opportunity for crypto funds focused on Latin America.  That’s according to Paola Origel, the CEO and co-founder of Hyla Fund Management — a firm that invests in other hedge funds on behalf of its clients — with $115 million assets under management.  “Many big funds like Sequoia and a16z have been trying to capture that market, but it's very fractionalized and challenging to break in because of the difference in culture,” Origel told CoinDesk in an interview. “You really need boots on the ground, people who understand the market and communicate opportunities to founders.”  “In Latin America, and specifically in Mexico, there are very few venture capital funds,"" she continued. ""They’re almost non-existent … I scouted the entire region for the best managers with the most impressive track record to put together this fund.” She eventually picked three, all based in Mexico City.  Originally from Mexico herself, Origel has 17 years of experience in the financial sector and was recently included in the top 50 women leaders in investment management by Women We Admire — a membership-only organization for professional women.  The crypto ecosystem in Latin America in 2024 presents similar opportunities — and challenges — as the crypto industry did on a global scale in 2017. “Back in the day, there were no service providers or vendors that understood blockchain or crypto at all,” said Origel. ""I believe we were the first institutional fund to open a bank account with Wells Fargo, because they didn't understand what it was.”  One of the biggest roadblocks in converting Latin American investors to concept of crypto, is education about the sector. Cryptocurrencies, which don't have a physical existence like gold or cash, can be a difficult concept for investors to grasp. “Latin American investors are still very traditional,” she added. “They tell me they only invest in things that they can stand on, or things they can touch. We’re trying to change that mentality… we need to prove to them that these technologies actually work.”  The Goldman Sachs of Crypto  A crypto fund of funds acts like a bridge between traditional investors and the crypto ecosystem, Origel said. The crypto space is new and rapidly evolving, and some investors simply don’t have the time, resources or specialized knowledge to dive into the industry and figure out which crypto hedge funds they want exposure to. That’s where Hyla steps in.  “The value of a fund of funds is access,” Origel said. “We’re jurisdiction agnostic, so we know most of the fund managers around the world, and each manager has their own strategy. For example, some funds are fully dedicated to the development of layer 2s on Bitcoin.”  Not only is Hyla is in regular contact with fund managers, but the firm also has lines of communication with all the founders that these funds have invested in — which gives Hyla a unique perspective on the crypto ecosystem as a whole, and makes it easy to help the right people meet.  “It’s not a new concept. Funds of funds have been tried and tested in traditional finance for many years,” Origel added. “But in crypto, that approach holds even more value because of how fragmented and complex the space can be.”  Down the line, the ambition is for Hyla to become the ""Goldman Sachs for digital assets,"" according to Origel. The firm currently offers a variety of strategies, including its liquid venture fund and its bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} market-neutral yield strategies. And the Latin America fund, slated to launch in January 2025, will add $30 million moreto Hyla’s assets under management.  Investing in Latin America  So why Latin America?  According to Origel, crypto can have a transformative impact on the region's economies and help them rise up “to the next level, to stop being frontier markets.”  She sees Remittances as one of the obvious areas of growth, since most Latin Americans must contend with exorbitant fees and difficult banking sectors when they try to send funds internationally — like from the U.S. to Honduras, for example. Mobile companies also have plenty of room to improve their products, Origel said, for peer-to-peer transactions, especially since a large percentage of the region’s population is still unbanked.  The global shift in supply chains is presenting further opportunities for Latin America, she said, as is the rise in entrepreneurial talent in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina, and the fact that venture capital investment in the region remains “disproportionately low.”  At the same time, Origel says that it’s still very early days, and that has an impact on investment decisions. “The market is still so small that you can’t be very picky,” she said. “You can’t say ‘Oh, we're only going to focus on infrastructure,’ because there’s not enough deal flow for that. You need to be open to any sector.”  And not all Latin American countries have the same profile, obviously.  Origel singled out Brazil for its technological development in the crypto sphere, as well as Mexico because of her experience in that country’s markets. Argentina and El Salvador are also on her radar. In the end, though, the jurisdiction doesn’t matter as much as the quality of a project and the caliber of a team.  “We want to find the next unicorns that will have not only a regional impact, but a global one,” Origel said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/13/how-a-115m-crypto-fund-with-big-ambitions-plans-to-invest-in-latin-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5079478bbb386b427f3a341536a0eb0e586e3f2-3600x2401.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After days marked by euphoria and rapid gains, the price is now entering a consolidation phase, providing a much-needed pause for the market. Key data from CryptoQuant indicates moderate selling pressure is emerging, which may signal a brief pullback or stabilization below the $90,000 mark. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $2.4 If Price Aligns With Macro Pattern – Details This week will be pivotal in determining Bitcoin’s next steps as traders and investors watch if BTC will hold near the $90,000 supply level or retreat to test support around $80,000. With strong market fundamentals and continued interest from bullish investors, the potential for another rally remains high. However, a short consolidation period could offer healthier groundwork for BTC’s long-term ascent. All eyes will be on whether Bitcoin can sustain its current levels or if this cooling-off phase will allow buyers to re-enter lower demand zones, setting the stage for the next major price move. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Still Far From Peak Levels Bitcoin has reached a local top after setting a fresh all-time high, signaling a potential pause in its recent surge. Analysts and investors are watching closely, as BTC has a history of making aggressive moves once it starts trending upward. Despite this bullish momentum, many are exercising caution, anticipating that Bitcoin might need time to consolidate before pushing higher. According to key data from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, the market is now experiencing moderate selling pressure. Adler’s analysis points to a possible consolidation phase, as short-term holders take profits. He specifically examines the short-term holder realized profit and loss data, which reveals that the current selling pressure is relatively mild compared to historical peak selling periods. In Adler’s view, this moderate pressure suggests that BTC’s recent rally might not end. He highlights clusters of intense selling seen in previous peaks, marked as Clusters #1, #2, and #3 on his chart, showing levels of selling pressure significantly higher than what we see today. This data implies that while some profit-taking is underway, it’s nowhere near the intense levels seen at past tops. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone – Last Time BTC Soared 80% As Bitcoin approaches consolidation, this subdued selling pressure could set the foundation for a more stable rally. Investors are eyeing this moment to gauge whether BTC will gather strength for the next leg up or continue cooling off, forming a solid base around current levels before another potential breakout. BTC Testing New Supply Levels (Again) Bitcoin has officially entered a much-anticipated price discovery phase, recently marking a new all-time high of $90,243. Currently trading around $87,500, BTC has experienced days of intense buying pressure and record-setting highs. However, the market may see a period of consolidation below the $90,000 threshold as traders assess new demand levels, potentially around $80,000. The coming days will be critical in determining BTC’s short-term path. If Bitcoin holds above the $85,000 mark, this would signal resilience and likely encourage a push toward higher supply zones as bullish momentum builds. However, if BTC loses this level, a retracement to lower demand of nearly $82,000 could come into play, allowing for a more stable foundation before the next rally attempt. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Volume Hits $60 Billion As ETH Aims For Yearly Highs Analysts view this consolidation phase as necessary after BTC’s rapid ascent, as it allows the market to establish support. Holding within the current range would signal strength, suggesting that BTC is well-positioned for further gains.

42435361,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7Zi,1731522600,Blockchain Analyzer 'Bubblemaps' Adds AI to Help Identify Insider-Controlled Tokens,"A revamped version of Bubblemaps, a blockchain analytics and visualization app, aims to help cryptocurrency's plebs identify the whales, using AI and other new features.  Bubblemaps launched in 2021 to provide a simplified way for blockchain users to understand the supply distributions of various digital assets. The platform’s latest update seeks to boost transparency in the crypto market by exposing token ownership patterns that may indicate centralization or manipulation.  “On-chain data deserves more attention,” said Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman in an interview with CoinDesk. “It is the lifeblood of the system. However, it is widely overlooked by the majority of crypto users because traditional tools are complex and overwhelming.”  Bubblemaps occasionally publishes its research online. In one widely circulated study, the platform revealed how venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) holds disproportionate control over the supply of UNI—the governance token for Uniswap, a popular decentralized exchange—positioning it to significantly influence the project’s development.  When influencers Andrew Tate and Iggy Azalea launched speculative tokens, Bubblemaps published reports revealing how the tokens were more centrally controlled than claimed. In many cases, the platform demonstrated how creators of popular meme coins spread their ownership across multiple wallets to evade allegations of insider control.  What's new  Bubblemaps displays the top holders of crypto tokens as nodes in a graph—“bubbles” whose size corresponded to ownership stakes. The platform analyzes transaction histories to find links between wallets, forming “clusters” that approximate individual entities.  The new version of Bubblemaps adda a ""time machine"" that allows users to view snapshots of how tokens were distributed at various points in time. The upgraded app also employs AI to power its “magic nodes” feature, which discovers links between blockchain addresses that would've gone undetected in older versions of Bubblemaps.  The AI “cleans up the data,” said Vaiman, enabling the platform to “reveal clusters that were hidden” in Bubblemaps V1.  Another significant update in Bubblemaps V2 is the addition of cross-chain support, enabling users to analyze the supply of assets across multiple blockchains. The stablecoins USDC and USDT, for example, exist on multiple chains, and there are ""wrapped"" versions of bitcoin on the Ethereum and Base networks. Previously, Bubblemaps displayed ownership of a given asset on one chain at a time; the new version allows users to view ownership across several chains simultaneously.  “Version 2 is essentially the vision we’ve had for a long time,” said Vaiman. “I don’t think we’re going to expand on this much further.”  Now that Bubblemaps has achieved its vision, the CEO says his team is turning its focus to expanding to new blockchains. The Bubblemaps V2 tool will launch with support for blockchains based on Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM). Support for Solana is coming soon, with other chains to follow.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/13/blockchain-analyzer-bubblemaps-adds-ai-to-help-identify-insider-controlled-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df12360660287ec945004c62f041a53cb99cd644-1920x1281.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The same economic factors driving gold's rise could continue to benefit bitcoin. What’s curious is that bitcoin has not rallied alongside gold, whose price has soared to record highs over the past few months amid central-bank buying. By Erik Norland At a Glance Despite historical trends of significant price increases following halvings, bitcoin's price has remained relatively flat even amid its ongoing rally The same economic factors driving gold's rise could continue to benefit bitcoin It's been seven months since bitcoin’s latest halving , which reduced the pace of its annual supply from 330,000 units to 165,000. In the past, bitcoin prices have often gone on post-halving rallies ranging from several hundred percent to even thousands of percent. Yet, thus far, bitcoin prices have been largely flat, trading in a relatively narrow range, at least by historical standards, despite a spike to record highs in a post-election rally. This isn’t to say that the cryptocurrency hasn’t been volatile. Day-to-day price moves have grown somewhat larger over the past few months despite the lack of overall price direction. Source: Blockchain.com, CME Economic Research Calculations Gold’s Rally What’s curious is that bitcoin has not rallied alongside gold, whose price has soared to record highs over the past few months amid central-bank buying and concerns among investors about the size of budget deficits in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. These large budget deficits have coincided with worldwide central-bank easing, which in the minds of many investors has made holding fiat currencies less attractive compared to hard assets. Source: Bloomberg Professional (GC1) Some of these same forces which are calling into question the value of government-issued fiat currencies and are boosting gold might eventually work out to bitcoin’s benefit. Bitcoin, after all, experienced a meteoric rise in price during the period of low and often near-zero rates in the U.S. from 2009 to 2021. This may have been partly due to bitcoin being new, for the first six years of its existence it was virtually the only crypto asset on the market, giving it a large first-mover advantage. Moreover, while central banks have been cutting rates, they remain far above zero. Core inflation remains 1-1.5% higher than pre-pandemic levels across most of the Western world, which may limit the extent to which central banks will be able to ease policy. While bitcoin rallied in Q1, prices haven’t moved much since March, even amid growing demand for ETFs, which may be increasing the volume of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. In the past, a rising number of daily transactions has sometimes served as a precursor to rising prices. Source: Blockchain.com Lower Revenue That said, miners’ revenue per transaction (referred to as cost per transaction at blockchain.info/data ) has been exceptionally low in recent months. Historically, periods of relatively low payments to miners for matching trades on the bitcoin blockchain have often been followed by bull markets, although sometimes these periods of rising prices took a while to materialize. Miners’ revenue per transaction spiked ahead of major bitcoin bear markets in 2011, 2014, 2018 and 2022. When it returned to low levels, it sometimes took bitcoin prices a while to begin a new bull market. Source: Blockchain.com Given the growing presence of bitcoin ETFs, the reduced pace of new supply creation, the rising number of transactions and the relatively low level of miners’ revenue per transaction, conditions may be ripening for a new bull market in bitcoin. That said, the cryptocurrency has yet to break its previous record highs decisively to the upside.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the world's most well-known cryptocurrency, has rocketed since Trump's election win, and is now closing in on the long-speculated $100K mark. On Wednesday, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) topped $93K, but has since retraced a bit to $92.5K. But is bitcoin overbought at these levels? Looking at RSI, or relative strength index, it suggests that the crypto is far from its most overbought levels. As of Wednesday, the RSI on bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) stands at 84.86, which is well above the 70 level that traditionally marks an instrument to be overbought. Still, higher RSI levels for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) have happened many times before. Back in March 2021, the RSI pushed up to 93.06, while in December 2017, it touched 96.56. Other notable periods were August 2017, when the RSI hit 95.62, and November 2013, when it tagged 95.66. For bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to hit the target of 100K, the crypto asset would need to rise another 7.8% from its current level. Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) initial surge happened on election night on November 5. As Trump built his lead in electoral votes against Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris, the crypto smashed past the $75K mark for the first time. It has sustained an upward trajectory since. Trump embraced crypto as part of his election campaign - a marked departure from President Joe Biden's current government which has cracked down on the sector. Trump has vowed to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world."" This year, he became the first-ever major U.S. party nominee to accept donations in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other crypto assets. Since November 5 - Election Day - bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has advanced a whopping 36.6% . During this move, its technical relative strength index indicator has also popped up into overbought territory, which may have caused alarm bells to ring for some. For investors focusing their attention on bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), they can also monitor a group of bitcoin backed exchange-traded funds that aim to mirror the price action of the cryptocurrency for further exposure. Bitcoin-Backed ETFs: ( IBIT ), ( ARKB ), ( GBTC ), ( BRRR ), ( BTCO ), ( HODL ), ( BTCW ), ( FBTC ), ( BITB ), and ( EZBC ).

42435347,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7Qg,1731519483,Film Development Needs an On-Chain Business Model,"The film industry is at a moment of transition. The rise of streamers and the increased popularity of YouTube-type media have changed the game. Streamers flooded the market with capital based on unsustainable projections of growth. Now, as financial reality hits, they are scaling back and fewer films are being produced within the studios system than in decades past.  Independent producers have an opportunity to make films more efficiently, providing audiences with stories that challenge them to think at a time where it seems films are scared to push the envelope. We need a new model for financing and production, which introduces a new and special asset class for blockchain.  Pressman Films, the production company that brought you Wall Street, American Psycho, Conan the Barbarian, The Crow and one hundred more motion pictures over the last 50 years, is now trying to fix what’s broken in film financing by leveraging the advantages of blockchain to bring more transparency and community to independent films.  Our solution: crowd financing on-chain. Both accredited and unaccredited investors alike are able to buy a securitized token powered by Avalanche. That allows them to share financial revenues of a slate of multiple films through the platform Republic.com/pressman. If you’ve ever wanted to attend a premiere, walk the red carpet, or simply learn about how movies are made - this is your chance.  We have one week left to go in the raise and have, as of November 12 raised $1.69 million. Investors will learn about a film from its initial, most important stage and gain insight into the whole sales cycle from development to distribution. We’re breaking new ground by inviting a community of investors on chain to participate in this raise and believe this methodology can transform film financing and be adopted across the industry.  During the last bull market, there were a number of projects pushing towards a democratization of media that offered similar concepts but simply couldn’t fulfill their promise, in part because of restrictions from a securities standpoint. Through our partnerships with Republic and Avalanche, we have cleared these restrictions, opening up investment opportunities that would normally be available just to the 1%.  Transparency  “Hollywood accounting” has long plagued the industry. Where is money going? Accountability is one of the primary problems we need to solve in both film and crypto.  Our offering is built on smart contracts, which live on an immutable ledger and treat all investors equally. This immediately solves transparency issues in accounting and paying investors. The thought of accounting to thousands of micro-investments would be a nightmare for any independent producer. But, with blockchain tech, the process is straightforward and dividends are paid out immediately.  We did a lot of research and legal analysis with our own counsel and the team at Republic to ensure this raise complies with SEC and FINRA regulations. We see this as the beginning of a new movement in film financing on-chain. The Pressman Film Development Fundraise consists of two simultaneous raises:  republic.com/pressman - a Reg CF offering wherein unaccredited investors are able to invest with the low barrier to entry of just $200.  republic.com/pressman-reg-d – A RegD offering wherein accredited investors are able to invest entirely on chain making investments through USDC with a minimum investment of $1,000.  I have long believed that film would be a special asset class for blockchain. This is because films both create community and are created by a community. You’ve heard of “cult classics.” Those cults are made up of people who form a personal relationship with a film and form a community with others who love that story’s world. Here we are able to galvanize a community as the film is being produced, not only after it is released, helping the process in several ways.  If we can raise funds from large groups of investors while a film is in the greenlight process, we better determine that there is a market for that film before even greenlighting. It enables us to market more efficiently: we now have an army of thousands of built in super fans, our “cult.” This helps inform the demographic profile of our film audience, not to mention the legions of people ready to help us grassroots market.  Pressman Film, founded by my father Edward R. Pressman, has long stood for innovation on the financial side of the film industry and in terms of product the number of culturally meaningful films that stand the test of time produced by the company is simply awe inspiring. Characters like Patrick Bateman and Gordon Gekko have helped define Wall Street culture for almost 40 years. We were one of the first companies to adapt comic books to film with The Crow, Judge Dredd, and Conan the Barbarian (launching the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger), video games to movies with the Jean Claude Van Damme Street Fighter. We’ve helped launch the careers of filmmakers such as Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma, Terrence Malick, Kathryn Bigelow and Jason Reitman.  Independent film has been the proving ground for so many of the great storytellers of the last 50+ years. Hollywood needs to form new pipelines to continue building the connection between emerging filmmakers and new audiences; from the conversations I’ve had throughout this endeavor it is clear that there is great excitement around this emerging structure.  This is the beginning of something radically new in the entertainment and blockchain spaces. We believe the future of media is one where creators and consumers are closer together, enabling audiences to have more say in the movies they want to see made. Let’s build the future of cinema together.

Nevertheless, the former banker struggles to see crypto's real-life use cases, especially given how the industry has been pushing for mainstream adoption — without success in his opinion.  Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has long been a loud critic of bitcoin {{BTC}} and the rest of cryptocurrencies, calling them ""worthless,"" ""fraudulent"" and ""nonsense.""  But now, he says his view could be swayed.  ""I will have an open mind,"" Kashkari told CoinDesk during a brief conversation in New York City on Tuesday.  Despite that pledge, the Ohio-born-and-raised banker continued to question the point of cryptocurrencies during the conversation. The industry has been around a long time without reaching widespread adoption, showing a lack of utility, he said.  ""Other than as a speculative asset, what does it actually do in the real economy?"" Kashkari said. ""It's been a dozen years."" (The Bitcoin white paper that sparked the crypto revolution came out 16 years ago.)  Crypto has struggled to gain a foothold in the U.S. (besides serving as an asset in investment portfolios). The federal government's stiff resistance has made it hard to connect crypto to the conventional financial system, which is partly overseen by the Fed.  That might be poised to change. Last week, Donald Trump won the presidential election, promising to support the crypto industry in the U.S. and fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who is widely viewed by crypto insiders as an impediment.  Some in Trump's circle, including crypto-fan Elon Musk, reportedly want him to dramatically weaken Kashkari's employer, the Fed.

Here’s What The Fibonacci Levels Say,"So far, the $1 target has been a psychological level that market participants expect the Dogecoin price to reach in this bull run. Based on Dogecoin’s Fibonacci levels, crypto analyst Dj Anas has predicted that the foremost meme coin could even reach this target by year-end. Fibonacci Levels Show That The Dogecoin Price Can Reach $1 By Year-End In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Dj Anas cited Dogecoin’s Fibonacci levels as why he believed the price could reach $1 by year-end. Based on the Fibonacci levels, The analyst remarked that Dogecoin is witnessing a solid push on the support-resistance line between $0.25 and $0.27, which could act as a solid foundation for the upward movement to the $1 target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins Crypto analyst Swallow Premium responded to the post and warned that the Dogecoin price would have to break many resistance levels first if it is to reach this target by year-end. Meanwhile, like Dj Anas, crypto analyst Master Kenobi, who correctly predicted the start of the Dogecoin bull run, has also suggested that the Dogecoin price can reach $1 by year-end. This came as he revealed that Dogecoin was less than 30 days away from completing a 91-day sequence which could lead to the price rally to $1. Master Kenobi further explained that Dogecoin’s current all-time high (ATH) is already slightly above the psychological threshold of a $100 billion market cap, which could propel the Dogecoin price to this target. The accompanying chart he shared shows that DOGE could reach $1 by December 2. Master Kenobi said that the $1 target for the Dogecoin price isn’t just an important psychological threshold but also a major benchmark that validates DOGE’s potential. He added that reaching $1 would mark a new stage in the meme coin’s maturity and solidify its position as an asset with lasting impact. The Next Four Months Could Be Huge For DOGE In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade suggested that the next four months could be huge for the Dogecoin price. This came as he revealed that Dogecoin had just surpassed its previous highest monthly close level. The last time this happened, the Dogecoin price recorded a gain of 8,000% in just four months. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 82% Despite Recovery, Can SHIB Price Still Make It To $0.00008 ATH? Meanwhile, during the 2017 bull run, when this happened, the DOGE price rallied by 1,000% in eight months. As such, Dogecoin could again witness a parabolic rally, just like in 2017 and 2021. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could rise to $3.6 if it mirrors the 1,000% gain from 2017 and rally to $26 if it mirrors the 8,000% gain from 2021. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.36, down over 12% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

TeraWulf's fundamentals show growth, with a 117% sales increase forecast this year and a shift to profitability expected in the next year. The company’s efficient capital allocation and secured financing for next year mitigate risks, supporting its aggressive growth and expansion plans. Despite a high EV/Revenue multiple and rapid share price rise, I maintain a Buy rating. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner TeraWulf ( WULF ) reported earnings on Tuesday, and the stock is thus far not reacting one way or the other on the news. The last time I covered the stock was back in August, and I called it a buy. Seeking Alpha That has turned out pretty well as shares are up about 140% since then, and the post-earnings move down proved to be the exact bottom. The share price ramped in a parabolic manner into this earnings report, owed to a similarly shaped move in Bitcoin. But is all that good news priced in? Let’s take a look at the earnings report and an updated view of the valuation to see what we should do next. Uptrend firmly intact The beautiful thing about technical analysis is that it takes the emotion out of investing choices. Something is either in an uptrend, a downtrend, or is trendless. In the case of TeraWulf, it’s firmly in an uptrend, and unless that changes, we have to respect the price action. StockCharts The trend line was tested in early October and proved to be the start of another huge move up. The stock is extremely extended right now as Bitcoin’s move to new highs has generated euphoria in the miners. However, this chart is quite bullish and there’s simply no other way to view it. The PPO and the RSI are both overbought, but the best rallies are generally born of overbought conditions, as buyers overwhelm sellers. The 20-day EMA was tested in early November and was immediately bought by the bulls; that’s our clue as to where support should be on the next pullback. The 20-day EMA is rapidly ascending, but is still quite ways down at under $7. I would welcome a pullback to that level as I believe it would be a strong buying chance. TeraWulf is overbought to be certain, but this chart remains extremely bullish in my view. It doesn’t mean we won’t have pullbacks, but it is my belief those pullbacks will be bought. A fresh look at the fundamentals TeraWulf is a smaller miner and is very much in its growth/ramping phase, so metrics on profitability are less important. Think of this in a similar way that you would, of a software company that hasn’t yet achieved profitability; that comes with enough scale, and TeraWulf isn’t there yet. However, there are some valuable metrics we can examine to understand the fundamental picture, so let’s have a look. For the third quarter, TeraWulf mined 555 Bitcoin, which was down 43% year-over-year. That sounds bad, but keep in mind the halving took place in April of this year, making it doubly difficult to mine Bitcoin, all else equal. The company continues to ramp its capacity, which is helping to offset some of that. Indeed, its total self-mining hashrate capacity was 10.0 EH/s as of September 30 th , exactly double what it was a year ago. The total value of self-mined Bitcoin in Q3 was $33.9 million, up from $27.6 million a year ago. The power cost per Bitcoin was $30,448, which is sharply higher from just $9,322 in last year’s Q3. That was attributable to an approximate doubling in network difficult as well as the aforementioned halving. Of course, these factors impacted all miners, so this isn’t some deficiency TeraWulf has; it’s just the cost of doing business. Seeking Alpha These factors have led analysts to downgrade earnings expectations for this year in recent weeks, with all four recent revisions being lower. That’s never a good thing and I won’t try to explain it away; we want revisions moving higher. However, given the early stages of TeraWulf’s growth plans, I think it’s more instructive to focus on the left side of the table above. We have sales growth of 117% forecast for this year, and about 80% in the next two years, respectively. We can also see that the company is expected to swing from a loss to meaningful profits in that time. That’s where I think the value is in TeraWulf, and why the stock has been bid up so aggressively in recent months. Obviously, as the price of Bitcoin goes higher, these estimates become much easier to meet and beat. The fundamentals of TeraWulf with Bitcoin at $90k are much better than the exact same fundamentals with Bitcoin at $70k. If you’re bullish on Bitcoin, you probably should be bullish on TeraWulf. The reason is because the cost of mining Bitcoin is the same regardless of the price of the coin, so higher Bitcoin prices produce massive operating leverage. This works in reverse, of course, so keep that in mind as you're looking at miners from a risk perspective. Investor Presentation Speaking of growth plans, the company is looking to continue scaling and sees capacity at the end of Q1 at ~13EH/s. That’s about 30% higher from today, and the important thing is that management is focused on profitable mining. The cost of mining is largely out of the control of miners (network difficulty, mainly). But one thing it can control is the efficiency of its miners, and the company is actively taking steps to improve efficiency, which should help drive the power cost per Bitcoin lower over time, all else equal. Investor Presentation Increased hashrate should result from the S21 Pro miners set to be received early next year, which should also boost the overall efficiency of the portfolio. The S21 Pro is the most efficient miner TeraWulf employs, and having 14.4k more of these will boost both the capacity and efficiency of the company’s fleet sizably. One thing we must always keep in mind with miners is that financing is generally a concern. Bitcoin mining is a hard business, and it costs a lot of money to run. TeraWulf’s capital allocation has been quite good in my view, as I mentioned back in August as well. Investor Presentation Next year’s capital needs are already taken care of, and it's hard to overstate how beneficial that is. TeraWulf should have about $300 million in cash on the balance sheet in Q4 of this year, and along with financing and free cash flow generated, should have something like $750 million available in total. Capex is slated to be less than $400 million, leaving estimated unallocated cash of $387 million. Some (or all) of this unallocated cash is likely to be used on the recent share repurchase authorization from the Board. I love buybacks, but hope that the management team is opportunistic with its purchases, buying on dips rather than chasing highs. Point being, there is no financing risk to TeraWulf's growth plans, and if anything, it can move some of its planned growth forward. Speaking of chasing highs, let’s wrap up with a look at the valuation. Too far, too fast? That’s the question here as TeraWulf has seen a meteoric rise in its share price in recent months. With the company unprofitable, one way to value it is EV/Revenue, which is below. TIKR There’s no way to read this chart other than to say the stock is expensive. We’re at more than 13X revenue today, which is extremely high based on TeraWulf’s prior trading history. Now, the counterargument to this is that companies that are growing quickly, and boosting profitability, should receive higher multiples. I subscribe to that belief, but I also recognize that the stock may be in need of a breather here to reset some of this valuation concern. Seen another way, we can value TeraWulf against Bitcoin itself, which we have below. StockCharts Bitcoin – since the September low – has risen about 64%. That’s nice, but it’s only half the rise in TeraWulf shares. That implies that TeraWulf has seen its valuation relative to Bitcoin double in the past two months, which is unsustainable. We know Bitcoin miners are generally leveraged plays on Bitcoin pricing, and this helps illustrate how that works. It works on the downside too, so if I have a concern about TeraWulf, it’s the current valuation. I see the fundamental picture as strong, and getting stronger. I see the price chart as very bullish and portending even higher highs in the future. I do think the valuation needs a breather before the next big rally phase can begin, but that’s really my only concern. Seeking Alpha Indeed, the Quant Rating shows similar concerns. Growth is excellent, as is momentum. I also think the ‘F’ rating in profitability will work itself out in the coming quarters as capacity ramps, so I’m really just concerned about the valuation going forward. That’s not enough to put me off the stock, however, so I’m sticking with my Buy rating after Q3 results.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736924-terawulfs-big-rally-isnt-done-yet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36245304.jpeg

42435345,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7Pm,1731516415,Your Idea of a Memecoin Community Is Wrong,"Memecoins have taken the crypto world by storm, but not for the reasons you think. According to CoinGecko, memecoins accounted for 14.3% of all transaction volume in Q2 of 2024, making them the biggest narrative in crypto. However, despite their meteoric rise, the way we understand memecoin communities needs a serious rethink.  Memecoins are more than a joke  As Murad Mahmudov noted at Token2049, memecoins have captured a unique market position because they are fully unlocked; no VCs, no lock-up periods, and often, no tangible revenue. These factors, Mahmudov argues, turn the tokenized meme into the real product — in essence, the value of memecoins lies within community, mission, and meaning.  But here's where we challenge the narrative. We believe that memecoins started as fun, collective expressions or insider jokes, but their staying power isn't rooted in the ""community"" as most people define it. Instead, memecoins have evolved into something more fluid and fleeting — a new type of liquidity vehicle.  The Maturation of Memecoins  Having a front-row seat to the evolution of the crypto space has made one thing clear to us: memecoins are no longer just speculative playthings. Yes, speculators thrive on them, and platforms like Ape.pro — which facilitates Solana memecoin trading — have brought significant UX innovation to this speculative frenzy.  What’s more, memecoins aren’t simply driven by community-building in the way traditional asset classes are. Instead, they operate within a cocktail of entertainment, pop culture, and financial speculation. This heady mix has created a distinct market segment that draws substantial trading volume. But something besides community keeps memecoins afloat — their liquidity.  Your idea of community is wrong  We’re not totally dismissing the narrative that memecoins succeed because they create communities – in part, that's true. People gravitate toward memecoins to express themselves or align with certain viewpoints, as Michael Selig from Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP recently pointed out. Memecoins have been tied to political movements, like the U.S. presidential election or Argentina’s libertarian president Javier Milei.  But here's the catch: the community isn’t stable, nor is it the central value proposition.  Memecoins, in reality, create a form of liquid community — one that exists as long as the meme and liquidity flow. Think of it as ""tradeable social utility."" The moment attention shifts, so does the community. This is not a static group of loyal holders, but a fluid network of traders who are drawn in by the social and financial momentum of the moment.  Cross-chain key to retain attention  Memecoins represent an attention economy in the sense that their real value lies in their ability to generate liquidity in an ecosystem. What this means is that cultural and financial trends change as users shift their attention. In short, memecoins will endure because they harness the enduring power of cultural communication that evolves with the tech.  A recent incident highlights just how transient and attention-driven memecoin markets can be. Crypto enthusiasts manipulated an experimental AI bot into promoting a memecoin, leading to a staggering 16,000% price increase in one week. This event perfectly illustrates the volatile nature of memecoins and how quickly liquidity and attention can drive up value without any underlying stability.  To capture and sustain this attention, cross-chain liquidity is key. FLOKI, for example, started on Ethereum and then added Binance Smart Chain to reach new users. As memecoin projects expand beyond their original chains, they increase accessibility across ecosystems, making it easier for users to follow the next big trend regardless of blockchain.  For traders, this flexibility means that they are no longer bound to a single blockchain’s limitations. Instead, memecoins and their communities will become fluid across multiple chains, with users choosing the environment that offers the best transaction speeds, lower fees, or broader appeal.  Liquid communities  From an infrastructure standpoint, what we’ve seen is that memecoin communities are as fluid as the technology that allows them to be. The faster and more frictionless the tech becomes, the more easily memecoin holders can move their assets — and their attention — across different ecosystems.  This is why we believe memecoins will endure. Memecoins provide ""tradeable social utility""— a way to signal belonging, express a viewpoint, or capitalize on the next big meme. In the end, memecoins are more than the communities they create. Their true value lies in the liquid nature of these tokens — fluid, fleeting, and always on the move, and it’s this liquidity that will keep memecoins relevant. That too, is evolving with the tech.

42435356,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7Xu,1731516223,Bitcoin Surges to New Record Over $93K as Strong U.S. Demand Crushes Resistance Level,"Bitcoin blasted through the $90,000 resistance level early in the U.S. trading day and then quickly pushed even higher to top $93,000.  The surge was fueled by heavy demand, with the Coinbase Premium Index at its highest level since April.  Blackrock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was the fourth-most traded product across all ETFs, with $1.2 billion volume in the first hour of the session.  After bouncing off the $90,000 level multiple occasions earlier this week, bitcoin {BTC}} moved through that resistance during U.S. morning hours Wednesday. Once through, further gains ensured, with the price quickly rising past $93,000.  The breakthrough over the key price level happened right as U.S. traditional markets opened at 9:30 am E.T., indicating that strong demand from U.S. investors propelled prices higher.  Bitcoin's Coinbase Premium Index, a key gauge of U.S. demand, has jumped to 0.2, its highest reading since April, CryptoQuant data showed, underscoring the heavy buying pressure coming from U.S. players.  The metric measures the price difference for the leading crypto asset on Coinbase, widely used by U.S.-based investors and institutions, compared to prices on off-shore Binance, the most popular global exchange by trading volume.  While it was not immediately clear what type of market participants are buying, U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) started the day with strong trading volumes. Shares of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, IBIT, the largest spot ETF with $40 billion of assets, traded around $1.2 billion in the first hour of the session, making it the fourth most-traded product across all ETFs, per Barchart data.  Bitcoin at press time had pulled back a bit and was changing hands at $92,200, up almost 7% over the past 24 hours and leading over the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's 3.5% rise. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} and solana {{SOL}} gained 1.6% and 2.7%, respectively, during the same period.  Spot buying drives the rally  Spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) — defined as the net difference between buying and selling trade volumes — continues to show strong flows with the majority of the net volume coming from buyers. Each time there's been a spike in spot CVD, it has corresponded to a rise in the asset's price, which suggests this rally is more sustainable as the buying is not futures-market based, said CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, James Van Straten",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/13/bitcoin-surges-to-new-record-over-93k-as-strong-us-demand-crushes-resistance-level,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f683ff4dfc85096422d150f01679cfafcf0eedd-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That panel will be responsible for handling crypto legislation in the coming months.  If Democrats can manage to wrest back Senate control in two years, she could become the committee's next chairwoman.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has long been held up as the crypto industry's chief opponent in Congress, and she's now ascending to the role as the top Democrat in the Senate Banking Committee, where she'll be heard from on the digital assets legislation that likely needs a sign-off from that panel.  The Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee has been under the chairmanship of Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat that the cryptocurrency industry spent tens of millions of dollars on defeating in this month's elections. In his tenure, Brown allowed no significant legislative debate on digital assets legislation, though even as he ran the committee, Massachusetts Democrat Warren often managed to be the more prominent naysayer on crypto matters. Now that the Republicans won the Senate majority and will take the gavel, Warren confirmed she'll step up as the ranking Democrat there.  ""This new role means a better chance to advance solutions like building more housing to lower prices and protecting consumers from private equity greed and special interest scams,"" she said in a Wednesday statement.  While the Republicans will control the committee's agenda and hearing schedule, she'll have a prominent platform to criticize the group's work on crypto, which she has often argued is riddled with criminality and has introduced legislation to try to apply tight U.S. constraints on the sector.  Warren just won a third term in office, opposed by a prominent crypto lawyer, John Deaton, who only managed to secure 40% of the vote.  Control of the Senate could possibly change hands again in two years. In midterm elections, the sitting president's party usually experiences setbacks in its Senate strength, and the 2026 contest will see far more Republicans' seats up for grabs than Democrats' seats. If Democrats do reclaim the majority, Warren would likely become the chair of the committee, where she would set the direction and tone for crypto legislation past that point.

42435350,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7UI,1731515815,The Real Winner of the 2024 Elections: The Crypto Industry,"For the crypto industry, the elections in 2024 were a game changer. With 287 “pro-crypto” members of Congress and a president-elect who has proclaimed that the U.S. will be the “crypto capital of the planet,” the industry is poised to be on an accelerated path toward mainstream adoption. As market participants digest the potential impact, one thing is certain: a pivot from “regulation by enforcement” to a regulatory regime where clear, transparent and predictable rules are prioritized will be a major unlock for the space. The inevitable regulatory de-risking that will follow will open the door to a new class of markets, products and applications. Here are some verticals that could thrive in this new environment:  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi is one of the most exciting crypto-powered innovations where applications deploy “smart contracts” to replace intermediaries, offering universal access to trading, borrowing, lending and myriad other financial services. To date, regulators have remained steadfast in their insistence that intermediaries must be required, undermining the fundamental innovation of DeFi. A favorable regulatory climate will change this. A clear regulatory framework could also pave the way for token holders to compliantly share in protocol revenue — something long sought by industry participants.  Artificial intelligence: With artificial intelligence (AI) exponentially accelerating and AI “agents” arriving years earlier than expected, the openness, transparency, scale and even “proof of personhood” achieved by integrating crypto and AI could pave the way for responsible innovation across both technologies.  Fixed income markets. Interest rates are the backbone of traditional financial markets. Nascent fixed income markets are poised to grow as financial institutions, now facing less regulatory resistance, enter global crypto markets. Benchmark yields like the composite ether staking rate (CESR), and perpetual swap funding rates, will bring the utility of the $500 trillion interest rate swap market to the crypto space, appealing to hedgers and speculators alike.  Utility tokens. During the SEC’s regulation by enforcement regime, tokens that demonstrated utility were often targets for enforcement. As a result, memecoins — tokens with no utility — flourished. A favorable regulatory climate could refocus the market on utility — something that could fuel additional mainstream adoption.  Decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). DePIN uses the incentivization of tokens to drive mass community participation, allowing for the creation of large, decentralized physical networks. Across telecommunications, mapping, computing and geolocation industries, these networks are providing more scalable and cost efficient solutions than their centralized peers.  Trump 2.0 and the bipartisan, pro-crypto Congress will usher in a brave new world for the crypto industry. A regulatory environment that encourages innovation, rather than stifles it, will finally give institutions the confidence to enter the market. And entrepreneurs, no longer shackled by the threat of regulatory sanction or personal liability, will be free to focus on building. The future could not be brighter.

42435360,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7Yo,1731515809,Beating Bitcoin,"Many digital asset investors benchmark themselves to bitcoin, at least psychologically. Whether or not bitcoin is the right benchmark, it has certainly been a tough one to beat over the last few years — so tough that some market participants seem ready to throw in the towel on alts. But has bitcoin always been this tough to beat?  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  We reviewed data going back to 2019 for the top 150 tokens by market cap (excluding memecoins and with a minimum volume requirement on major CEXs) to see what it took to beat bitcoin over the years. We picked the top 150 tokens as a starting point to illustrate the universe of tokens that a manager of a liquid token strategy, with some liquidity considerations and reasonable AUM, may realistically evaluate. Note that until late 2020, there were fewer than 150 tokens that met these requirements (on account of the liquidity filter).  With this universe in mind, we examined how many tokens in the top 150, on any given day, outperformed bitcoin over the next year. At certain points in 2019 and 2020, it seems like beating bitcoin was easy, with many tokens beating it by a wide margin (north of 1000% over bitcoin’s own generally stellar return, on average). What’s more, it used to not require too much exploration out of the scale of market cap to find the tokens beating bitcoin, with an average market cap rank of the outperformers of ~30 pre-2020.  Post-2021, the picture is different. Only 10-20% of the top 150 have beaten bitcoin in any 365 day period over the last few years, with average outperformance vs bitcoin also moderating to around +100%. The average market cap rank of tokens beating bitcoin over the last few years has also drifted higher — oscillating around the 60-80 rank mark.  What does this tell us? For one, it is clear that capturing the winners takes considerable skill — perhaps more so now than it did 5 years ago. The cryptocurrency market has evolved since the heady days of easy monetary policy, with tangible results now expected to accompany the vision of growing crypto projects. Still, the figures suggest that selecting just a handful of high conviction names could leave an investor with low odds of beating bitcoin.  It is also clear that smaller projects continue to hold significant potential, and that even though the crypto market has matured, performance for the top names, even in a liquidity and size constrained universe, is still significant (>100% over bitcoin).  These points suggest that returns in crypto markets today largely follow a power law type distribution, with a handful of outperformers capable of driving an overall positive result for a portfolio. To this end, diversification still seems underappreciated by investors in the liquid token space. Still largely a collection of start-up stage companies, investors could benefit from adopting VC-style approaches to diversification, while reaping the benefits of the liquid secondary market. Alts have a bright future, but it won’t mean investing will be easy.  Disclosure: The information herein is for general information purposes only and is not investment advice.

Similar bullish flows are being observed on Deribit.  There seems to be no stopping the bitcoin {{BTC}} freight train. The largest cryptocurrency blasted through the $90,000 resistance level, hitting a new record above $93,000 while traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) loaded up on bets that stand to profit on prices rising into six figures.  According to CF Benchmarks, traders are flocking to the $100,000 call option on the CME, a location favored by institutional investors, following the lead of their Deribit-based counterparts. A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.  ""Per CF Benchmarks' data, the 30-day constant maturity 25 delta skew has now breached the 5 vol threshold, a near YTD high, which implies that there is much greater demand for upside exposure,"" Thomas Erdösi, head of product at CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk in an email.  The 25 delta skew measures the relative richness of call options relative to puts, providing a glimpse of the market sentiment. A positive reading, in this case, the 5 vol (volatility) threshold, indicates that calls are pricier than puts, which give the right to sell at a set price, and traders are preparing for BTC to rise even futher.  Strikes above $100,000 are also witnessing a surge in demand, as evident from the elevated implied volatility for these options, CF Benchmarks data shows. CME's derivatives track CF Benchmarks Bitcoin Reference Rate – New York (BRRNY) variant.  The bullish positioning is consistent with the offshore giant Deribit, where traders have been piling into the $100,000 call option since at least late September.  Bitcoin's rally seems to be ignoring the continued rise in the dollar index. BTC prices have surged over 36% since pro-crypto Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election held on Nov. 5.

42435362,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kp7bW,1731514263,Hard Way to Make An Easy Living: Profiting in A New Altcoin World,"How is altcoin trading like online poker? Let me explain. I have played over 2,000,000 hands of online poker. Starting in university and going on to play professionally for five years, I got to experience the industry evolve firsthand. The first major poker boom occurred in the mid-2000s. This drew in millions of online players worldwide and created some highly profitable games.  ""Black Friday"" occurred in April 2011, when the U.S. government shut down all major poker sites and froze all assets overnight - including player funds. Without a constant influx of US-based beginners, the largest poker market, the active player pool instantly became more competitive. At the same time, the remaining worldwide player pool started honing their skills…  Players began improving their strategies by utilizing tracking software to analyze their opponents and their own play. As time went on, so-called “poker solvers” – advanced software tools enabling humans to learn game theory optimal strategies – became ubiquitous. Sites began offering less “rakeback” – a rebate for fees players pay to partake in the games. As poker became more analytical with more advanced software tools, on came the bots to further grind down the expected value (EV) of hopping on the virtual felt.  As I look at the altcoin trading landscape now, some muscle memory is kicking in, as I sense the whole game getting tougher in a not-so-dissimilar fashion.  How Altcoin Trading In Changing  As the saying goes, “there’s a million ways to make a million dollars.” In altcoin trading, there are dozens or maybe hundreds of ways to approach the markets to make juicy returns. You can be a scalper, swing trader, yield farmer, airdrop hunter, new-launch sniper; the list goes on. Each of these approaches is getting tougher, though, for two overarching reasons:  Modest capital inflows  Stablecoin market cap can be used as a measure of money flowing into the crypto markets. It is not a perfect measure, but it is useful. Stablecoin market cap currently sits at $178 billion, still a bit shy of all-time high levels of $188 billion. In over two years, stablecoin supply has essentially just recovered to these levels after a major downtrend (although it has made a new all-time high when excluding non-algorithmic stablecoins).  Terra Luna’s UST, the notorious algorithmic stablecoin, accounted for $18.7 billion back in 2022, and it was central to the fervent bullish mania that made altcoin gains so easy. This time around, fiat-backed stablecoins are increasingly used for real-world utility, as evidenced by Stripe’s $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge. This is something I celebrate as I believe stablecoins are one of crypto’s greatest products. However, it also means that this stablecoin growth has a materially weaker impact in terms of translating to a risk-on environment for altcoins.  The recent trend of capital inflows to the altcoin market from both institutional and retail sources is undoubtedly bullish, even if it is coming at a modest rate. But in those two years it took for capital to flow in and stablecoin market cap to recover, what has happened in the altcoin market?...  The proliferation of altcoins  The altcoin space is seeing hundreds of thousands or sometimes millions of new token launches each month. It took two years for stablecoin supply to recover, and in the meantime, altcoin supply has been booming. A majority of crypto innovation comes out of the Ethereum ecosystem, but it has also produced over 100,000 new tokens each month, with over one million new tokens launched during the recent summer months.  Pump.fun, a memecoin launchpad that enables users to launch their own memecoin with just a few clicks, has launched over 3 million new memecoins since the beginning of the year.  This proliferation of altcoins combined with relatively modest capital inflows for altcoin speculation ultimately means one thing: modest amounts of capital chasing a massively booming number of assets. Many altcoins still have negative year-to-date returns despite Bitcoin being in a bull trend since late 2022 and setting a general risk-on environment for crypto. This has made the entire game of altcoin trading, in all its various forms, considerably more difficult. However, it is not all doom and gloom…  The Trump-Crypto Era  Bitcoin dominance (BTC’s percentage of total crypto market cap) rose from 40% in late-2022 to around 60% just before Trump won the U.S. election last week. The last time Bitcoin dominance rallied hard from major market lows (the March 2020 wipeout), it quickly gave up ground to altcoins as excitement flooded the market and a new wave of capital entered alternative digital assets. We have not had that yet, but since Trump’s win was confirmed, Bitcoin dominance fell to 58% from its 60% peak, all while Bitcoin kept powering on to reach over $80,000. ETH and the wider altcoin market have responded particularly well to the Republican sweep as a new era of favorable regulation is expected. Not a rising tide just yet, but a red wave of optimism.  If someone asked me for advice on how to become a professional online poker player starting out today, I would say not to bother and pursue something else - there simply is not enough juice in it anymore. While I would not necessarily advise someone to become a professional crypto trader, there are undoubtedly far more profitable opportunities in crypto markets even though things are generally getting tougher.  Altcoin trading is getting harder, but we are entering a new optimistic era for crypto. We have not yet had the fabled “alt season” but there have been frequent windows marked by highly profitable momentum trades throughout the cycle so far - from GambleFi to AI memecoins. It’s possible that Republicans do not deliver on their promises to support the crypto industry, but at the very least, the narrative alone is fuel enough for the next two months until Trump’s inauguration: a window where altcoin traders can let their anticipatory animal spirits run wild.  Although Q4 has shaped up tremendously well, we still have to adjust to a new regime: accept that there will be fewer 100x baggers, be more agile and aggressive in rotations through hot market narratives, and be more aggressive with profit taking and loss cutting. Yes, it is getting harder, but there is plenty of juice left and it beats the hell out of logging on to play another 100,000 hands of poker… believe me.

36242066,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-surpasses-91k-ath,1731511858,Bitcoin Surpasses $91K ATH,"Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) surge to an all-time high of $91,301.55 is a landmark moment, highlighting its evolving role in global finance. This remarkable price point isn’t just a result of hype but reflects several critical factors propelling Bitcoin forward. A significant driver has been institutional investment ; traditional finance giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have entered the crypto space, bringing credibility and substantial liquidity. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a legitimate, viable asset class, with major investors seeing it as a hedge and diversifier within traditional portfolios. Economic uncertainty worldwide has further increased Bitcoin’s appeal. With inflation fears and currency instability in some regions, Bitcoin has emerged as a preferred asset for those seeking a hedge against traditional economic risks. Its reputation as “digital gold” has become stronger as people look to preserve value in an asset with a limited supply, capped at 21 million coins. This scarcity, combined with periodic “halving” events that decrease the rate of new Bitcoins entering circulation, creates a unique supply constraint that adds to its allure and drives demand. The record high has implications beyond Bitcoin itself, signaling the continued evolution of crypto as part of mainstream finance. As it achieves higher valuations and deeper integration into the global economy, Bitcoin is increasingly regarded as a foundational digital asset. Its rise could also impact traditional fiat currencies in inflation-prone economies, where citizens may adopt Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. This shift could potentially disrupt traditional currency models and even influence central banks to explore digital currencies of their own. As Bitcoin’s price climbs, regulatory interest intensifies. Governments are watching Bitcoin more closely, recognizing the need to establish clear guidelines around taxation, anti-money laundering, and financial stability. While regulation may present some friction for growth, it could also create a safer environment that attracts more cautious investors, enhancing Bitcoin’s standing in conventional finance. The rising institutional interest and regulatory scrutiny demonstrate Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital experiment to a prominent asset with real-world implications. Despite the optimism, Bitcoin faces significant challenges. Its volatility remains a concern, as price swings can be abrupt, driven by regulatory news, market sentiment, or macroeconomic factors. Although Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased compared to its early days, it remains high relative to traditional assets, presenting risks for both institutional and retail investors. Additionally, environmental concerns around Bitcoin mining persist. Mining’s energy demands have sparked debates about its ecological footprint, with some investors and regulators pressing for more sustainable practices. Although shifts towards renewable energy are underway, environmental impact remains a factor that could influence investor sentiment and regulatory policies in the future. Bitcoin’s journey to this ATH is both a testament to its resilience and an indicator of its growing acceptance in the world’s financial fabric. Its future depends on its ability to integrate further into global finance, adapt to regulatory requirements, and address environmental concerns. With continued adoption and institutional support, Bitcoin’s story is far from over; this ATH marks not just a price milestone but a significant step in its role as a transformative financial force.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-surpasses-91k-ath,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36242066.jpeg
36241919,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652868,1731511811,"Bonk Downward Drift To $0.00002635, Can Bulls Ignite A Trend Reversal?","Bonk has taken a downturn, sliding toward the crucial $0.00002635 price mark as bearish forces take charge. This level could be the bulls’ last stand to regain momentum and prevent a deeper correction. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, all eyes are on whether buyers can mount a comeback at this pivotal support. A successful defense could spark a bullish reversal, bringing fresh optimism to Bonk’s price trajectory. But if the bears hold strong, the path forward may grow more challenging. This analysis aims to examine the meme coin’s recent price movement as it approaches the $0.00002635 support level, assessing whether this key point could spark a potential trend rebound. By analyzing technical indicators, market sentiment, and historical price patterns, this article seeks to provide insights into whether upbeat pressure can reassert itself at this level or if further bearish pressure could drive the price lower. Analyzing Bonk’s Price Trends And Recent Downward Shift Recently, despite staying above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), Bonk has shifted into a bearish phase on the 4-hour chart. After facing resistance at $0.00004002, the price has pulled back toward $0.00002962. This retreat indicates increasing negative pressure, with sellers gaining control. If the price fails to hold at $0.00002962, more declines could follow, possibly testing lower support levels. Also, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen from 80% to 63%, signaling a decline in bullish momentum. As the RSI approaches neutral territory, buying pressure has eased, and market confidence in the uptrend is diminishing. Specifically, this change suggests that BONK may be entering a correction phase, with the potential for further downward movement should the trend persist. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally On the daily chart, after facing resistance at $0.00004002, BONK is exhibiting a growing pessimistic sentiment. A negative candlestick pattern and a decline toward $0.00002962 highlight increasing selling pressure as the meme coin struggles to maintain higher levels. This implies that market momentum is shifting, and BONK may face additional downside pressure if it fails to stabilize. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI has dropped from 82% to 67%, signaling a possible shift in momentum suggesting fading buying pressure and a transition from an overbought condition to a more neutral or bearish phase. As the RSI moves further from overbought levels, it indicates weakening upward strength, with sellers possibly gaining control, which could lead to a price correction or consolidation. Navigating The Downturn: Can Bulls Push Back Bonk From Here? As the market faces a downturn and the price drops toward $0.00002962, the critical question is whether bulls can regain control and reverse the trend or if bearish pressure will continue pushing the price lower. If BONK reaches this support level and the Bulls can successfully defend it, a rebound could follow, potentially driving a resurgence toward $0.00004002 and beyond.

In a Wednesday X post, the California-headquartered crypto exchange notified the crypto community that it has readded support for XRP, Cardano, and Solana and is adding its maiden support for the meme coin Pepecoin.https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/1856699618815513040 Notably, the support includes for US customers who have been unable to access the assets through the platform. The latest addition takes the total number of cryptocurrencies accessible to Robinhood’s US clients to 19, already allowing the trading of notable assets like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu.XRP and Cardano Finally Available for US CustomersIt bears mentioning that XRP, Cardano, and Solana were once available to trade on the Robinhood platform. However, regulatory uncertainties and the risk of sanctions from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forced the exchange to delist them.Robinhood delisted XRP in 2020 in the wake of its legal battle with the SEC. The Wall Street regulator sued Ripple Labs for offering XRP to US investors, branding the XRPL native token as an unregistered security.Furthermore, Robinhood announced in June 2023 that it would delist Cardano, Solana, and a handful of other tokens following regulatory unclarity. The SEC named the assets unregistered securities in its lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, forcing Robinhood to delist them in a precautionary move.Meanwhile, the XRP relisting for US customers came almost two months after Robinhood quietly readded the seventh largest cryptocurrency by market cap for trading to its European customers.

The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report reveals a spike in inflation, adding volatility to Bitcoin’s price trajectory. This critical data release has had market participants on edge, as it was expected to disrupt the cryptocurrency’s recent two-day stability.For instance, in a post earlier today, Michaël van de Poppe, Chief Investment Officer at MNConsultancy, noted that Bitcoin hovered around $87,000, while altcoins were under intensified selling pressure amid anticipation of the inflation report.Van de Poppe identified $80,000 as an ideal entry point should a bearish turn occur, with a major price target of $100,000 in the event of continued bullish momentum. Notably, the anticipated bearish scenario did not materialize. Instead, Bitcoin has rebounded higher, reaching a peak of $91,100 at press time.https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1856615484113780897 Long-Term Holders Maintain Confidence Amid Bitcoin's price movements and potential targets, long-term holders have shown resilience. Data from Glassnode shared by Ali Martinez indicates that despite recent gains, these investors are not exhibiting signs of extreme greed. Martinez’s Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (LTH-NUPL) chart reveals that sentiment among long-term holders remains in the ""green greed"" zone. Historically, market peaks occur when sentiment shifts to ""blue extreme greed,"" suggesting room for further upside still exists. Bitcoin Could Reach $100 MillionMeanwhile, Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, has made bold predictions about Bitcoin’s future. He foresees the asset reaching seven figures, driven by macroeconomic pressures, including the U.S.’s soaring public debt, now at $35.95 trillion. Mow speculated that the U.S. could adopt drastic measures, such as rebasing its dollar to Bitcoin’s smallest unit, the Satoshi. This would significantly boost Bitcoin's valuation, with Mow projecting an eventual price of $100 million per coin.Notably, Mow remains optimistic about Bitcoin hitting $100,000 by year-end, attributing the delay to the FTX collapse and Grayscale-related market impacts. He pointed to growing demand for Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds as a key factor likely to drive prices higher in the coming weeks.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/bitcoin-officially-breaks-91000-peak-amid-cpi-data-release/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-officially-breaks-91000-peak-amid-cpi-data-release,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bitcoin has been on a spectacular run , with its price soaring to new all-time highs. It is currently trading around $89,600, marking a 111% gain year-to-date and a 35% increase since the U.S. elections in early November. However, according to Matt Hougan, Bitwise's Chief Investment Officer, this is just the beginning of Bitcoin's much larger journey.Until Bitcoin $500K, “It’s Still Early”In a recent memo to investors, Hougan argued that despite the current bullish trend, Bitcoin is still in its early days. He believes that the true milestone for the cryptocurrency won't be reached until its price hits $500,000 per coin—a figure that he says marks the transition from an emerging asset to a ""mature"" store of value, similar to gold.Bitcoin’s Role as a Store of Value: Still EarlyHougan points out that Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system is still evolving. While Bitcoin has seen major institutional adoption, with some pensions and endowments making small investments, it is far from the level of acceptance and stability seen with traditional assets like gold. For Bitcoin to be considered ""mature,"" it must be widely held by central banks and institutions.The $500,000 price target is based on a simple comparison to gold’s market size. Gold boasts a $17 trillion market, while Bitcoin’s capitalization is around $1.177 trillion. If Bitcoin captures 50% of gold’s store-of-value market, it will reach a price of about $500,000 per coin, Hougan explains.What Would It Take to Reach $500K?For Bitcoin to reach the $500K mark, Hougan outlines several key factors. First, he noted that Bitcoin’s adoption must broaden, with large institutional investors and even central banks beginning to allocate more capital. As it stands, governments hold about 20% of the world’s gold reserves, with less than 2% for Bitcoin. Closing this gap would be a significant step toward Bitcoin achieving its full potential.The potential for government adoption is already beginning to take shape. One high-profile example is U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis’ push for a national Bitcoin reserve, which would see the U.S. government invest billions in Bitcoin.https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1854208373740458432The Path Beyond $500KWhile Hougan’s target of $500K per coin is based on Bitcoin’s potential to capture a significant portion of gold’s market share, he is also optimistic about Bitcoin's future beyond that threshold. He suggests that the total market for store-of-value assets will likely grow, driven by government debt expansion and currency debasement, creating additional opportunities for Bitcoin to gain value. Hougan even entertains the possibility of a $1 million Bitcoin , noting that the market for store-of-value assets is dynamic and could expand massively in the coming decades. For now, however, he believes $500K is a reasonable starting point, with BTC still in its formative stages.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/bitwise-executive-until-bitcoin-hits-500k-its-still-early/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitwise-executive-until-bitcoin-hits-500k-its-still-early,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Dogecoin has corrected 13% from its weekly high attained on November 12. Before then, the largest meme coin by market cap surged to a 3-year price high of $0.4355, sponsored by favorable macroeconomics.Notably, seasoned analyst Ali Martinez foresaw the downtrend, warning investors of an impending correction. He cited the TD Sequential on multiple timeframes that printed a buy signal on DOGE’s price chart.Now that the correction has materialized, Martinez has urged Dogecoin proponents to remain resilient in the face of the price drop. He argued that corrections were healthy, as historical trends show Dogecoin is up for another bullish outbreak when the downswings end.Analyst Cites Historical Data Backing ClaimsIn a Wednesday tweet , Martinez showed his audience Dogecoin’s historical correction patterns and how they have preceded further price upswings. He then stated that the 13% dip was no reason to panic. Martinez noted that Dogecoin followed a similar correction pattern in its 9,470% and 30,700% upsurges in 2017 and 2021, respectively. He further stated that the meme coin faced two major corrections but still recorded substantial uptrends in those years.In 2017, DOGE corrected 40% and 84% on the path of its 9,470% price explosion, which saw it peak at $0.01355 in January 2018. The token also repeated the pattern, correcting 56.51% and 53.25% in 2021.However, Dogecoin ultimately grew a staggering 30,700%, hitting its current all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021. With the analogy, Martinez called for patience and conviction, insisting they are the requirements to “become a true Dogecoin millionaire.”Price Outlook for Dogecoin After CorrectionNotably, Martinez had earlier given price expectations for Dogecoin after its correctional phase. Per an analysis , the seasoned market analyst speculated an over 500% surge to $2.4 and an ambitious 4,440% uptick to $18.The analyst based his assertion on Dogecoin surging to the upper channel of its ascending channel. The 500% growth is if the meme king hits midway through the channel, and the 4,440% would represent a theoretical uptick to its upper boundaries.Interestingly, Marinez has given higher Dogecoin assertions. In another analysis , he speculated that the meme coin would surge over 7,000% to $23, citing Elon Musk’s growing influence.In the meantime, Dogecoin trades at $0.4059, up 17% in the past 24 hours as it embarks on a recovery push.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/expert-says-13-dogecoin-dip-no-reason-to-panic-as-it-can-result-in-9470-to-30700-price-explosion/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-13-dogecoin-dip-no-reason-to-panic-as-it-can-result-in-9470-to-30700-price-explosion,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

""We wanted to develop an ecosystem that was thoughtfully designed to be digital and take advantage of the advantages of tokenization,"" Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said in a statement. ""With these new chains we'll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do.""

The BUIDL token is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds and its price is anchored to $1. Institutions and protocol treasuries use the product to park their on-chain cash to earn a yield or as collateral for trading, while other decentralized finance protocols such as Ondo Finance build their products on top of it.

Coinbase, which has previously offered the trading of Solana, Cardano and XRP, also added Pepe on Wednesday.  The move comes one week after crypto-friendly Donald Trump's win in the presidential election and the promises of a more welcoming regulatory environment.  Stock and crypto trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) has added sizably to the number of cryptocurrencies available to trade for U.S. customers just one week after elections appeared to usher in a far friendlier regulatory environment for the industry.  With the introduction of Solana {{SOL}}, Pepe {{PEPE}}, Cardano {{ADA}} and XRP {{XRP}}, Robinhood will now offer trading in 19 cryptocurrencies for its American clientele, the company said in a blog post Wednesday morning.  Coinbase (COIN) — which already offered all of the HOOD additions — joined Robinhood in adding PEPE to its platform.  All of the named cryptos moved modestly higher alongside the announcements, as did bitcoin, which printed a new record high above $91,000.  “We’ve consistently heard from our customers that they want access to more digital assets, and we’re excited to continue expanding our crypto offering,” Johann Kerbrat, vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, said.  The news comes as President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take office in January, is expected to push very little against crypto-related innovation. Among his pre-election promises was the firing of crypto-gadfly U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler.  Last year, Robinhood ended support for several tokens, including SOL and ADA, after some of them were named as securities in a lawsuit by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase.  Industry leaders are hoping for more clarity from the SEC on which tokens will be considered a security and which won’t. The current SEC under chair Gary Gensler has not given firms any guidance on the topic. It has, however, sued crypto exchanges for allegedly violating federal securities laws by offering unregistered securities.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL | XRP | PEPE,ADA | SOL | TRADING | XRP | PEPE,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/13/robinhood-adds-sol-pepe-ada-xrp-following-trump-victory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cc1475e07029c7b3763a5b241299a10a334e91b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cardano Foundation made history today by publishing its first Financial Insight report, marking a major step in its commitment to integrity and transparency. This follows the company’s Activity Report published earlier this year. https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF/status/1856663641317081530Cardano Foundation’s 2023 Investment According to the report , the independent foundation invested a total of $19.22 million last year in three core areas: education, operational resilience, and adoption. The report provided an overview of the Cardano Foundation’s 2023 investment in these sectors. Adoption Investment Of the $19.22 million invested in 2023, Cardano Foundation committed $12.92 million to drive 'Adoption.' This area focused on getting institutions and businesses to use Cardano by creating conditions for utility.Following this investment, the foundation simplified smart contract development on Cardano by launching the open-source programming language Alken. Other notable achievements include optimizing SPO rewards and collaborating with the United Nations and Switzerland on the ‘Global Climate Challenge.’Educational Funding It committed $4.18 million to ‘Education,’ supporting research and educating various stakeholders about blockchain. With this investment, the foundation hosted the Cardano Summit 2023 in Dubai and launched various educational tools, including the Cardano Academy. Investment in Operational Resilience Lastly, it invested about $2.12 million to the ‘Operational Resilience’ sector. This investment strengthened the infrastructure behind Cardano for institutional-grade use. This resulted in uninterrupted network operation for 2,000 days (more than five years), testing of a decentralized governance mechanism with the University of Zurich and an SPO, and improved interoperability through the support of Valentine's hard fork.Additional Investment In addition to the $19.22 million the organization invested in the above areas, it allocated an additional $4.55 million to central operational costs. This investment helped the foundation expand its capacity to support key initiatives within the Cardano ecosystem. Despite these investments, the Cardano Foundation ended last year with $478.24 million worth of assets. 82.5% of the assets, representing $394.54 million, were in ADA, 10.1% ($48.3 million) in Bitcoin, and 7.4% ($35.38 million) in USD liquidity. In the meantime, the foundation disclosed plans to release the 2024 Activity Report by the first quarter of next year.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | FORKS,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/cardano-foundation-releases-first-financial-report-outlining-its-investment-in-3-major-areas/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-foundation-releases-first-financial-report-outlining-its-investment-in-3-major-areas,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36239941,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101367,1731508722,Market Veteran Predicts Timelines for Bitcoin Cycle Top and Start of the Altcoin Season,"Market veteran Miles Deutscher recently identified where Bitcoin is in its current cycle and when altcoin season could potentially begin. He disclosed this amid Bitcoin’s recent spike above $89,000 and a subsequent retracement. Based on historical data and his analysis, Deutscher predicts a possible top for Bitcoin by mid-to-late 2025, followed by a likely surge in altcoin value. Bitcoin Bull Run in Familiar Territories According to Deutscher, Bitcoin’s price trajectory mirrors that of previous bull cycles from 2012, 2016, and 2020. He suggests that BTC is in the third, and historically, most rapid growth phase of the cycle, a phase that typically starts around 200 days after the halving event. Following data patterns from previous cycles, Deutscher sees two possible timeframes for Bitcoin to reach its peak.Using cycle length as a benchmark, he predicts a potential high point around Q2 2025. On the other hand, timelines based on Bitcoin’s halving and the breaking of its all-time high (ATH) indicate Q3 2025 as a possible top. However, Deutscher advises that while historical data provides a framework, the exact peak will become clearer only as the event approaches. By Q1 2025, he expects more definitive signs on whether Bitcoin’s momentum is slowing or still on an upward trend.Timeline for the Altcoin SeasonWhile Bitcoin has been in an upward trend, altcoins have yet to see a full-scale rally like the one witnessed in 2021. Deutscher explains that this cycle has been primarily focused on Bitcoin’s “price discovery” phase. During this phase, Bitcoin tends to absorb the bulk of market liquidity , making it challenging for altcoins to gain momentum. Deutscher noted that a key indicator for when altcoins might outperform is the level of Bitcoin dominance in the market. At present, BTC dominance continues to rise, which he considers healthy as it supports Bitcoin’s growth. Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 59.7%.However, a shift in the trend — featuring a drop in BTC dominance — would signal a more favorable environment for altcoins. He suggests that as Bitcoin’s rally matures, the capital that initially flowed into BTC will start rotating into altcoins, setting up for a possible altcoin season .Historically, the transition from Bitcoin dominance to an altcoin rally occurred in the post-halving year. In the last cycle, Bitcoin outperformed most altcoins until the end of 2020, with altcoins taking center stage in 2021. If this pattern holds, Deutscher sees early 2025 as a realistic starting point for a major altcoin rally.Potential for Growth in Altcoin InvestmentsDeutscher highlighted that the current speculation index, which measures market enthusiasm, sits at only 21%. In the previous cycle, this index peaked at over 90%, indicating there’s still substantial room for growth in the altcoin market. According to Deutscher, the market environment for crypto is highly favorable, supported by positive macroeconomic conditions that could drive further gains in both Bitcoin and altcoins.For now, Deutscher advises patience, suggesting investors focus on solid crypto projects they believe in. He recommends observing market trends and waiting for BTC dominance to correct, which he sees as a natural precursor to a robust altcoin season.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/market-veteran-predicts-timelines-for-bitcoin-cycle-top-and-start-of-the-altcoin-season/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-veteran-predicts-timelines-for-bitcoin-cycle-top-and-start-of-the-altcoin-season,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36239581,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652968,1731508249,Justin Drake Unveils ‘The Beam Chain’: A Vision For Ethereum Final Design,"In a significant development for the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, researchers propose redesigning the network’s consensus layer, aiming to enhance scalability, decentralization, and security. During a presentation at DevCon in Bangkok on Tuesday, Justin Drake, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, introduced the concept of “Beam Chain,” a new consensus layer intended to replace the existing Beacon Chain. The Beam Chain Proposal Drake explained that the Beacon Chain, which has been operational for five years, has become somewhat outdated. “In those five years, so much has happened,” he remarked, highlighting the rapid advancements in blockchain technology and research. The redesign will reportedly focus exclusively on the consensus layer, leaving the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the binary large object (blob) data layer untouched. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 82% Despite Recovery, Can SHIB Price Still Make It To $0.00008 ATH? In addition, the Beam Chain aims to revamp several critical aspects of Ethereum’s staking mechanism, block production system, and cryptographic architecture. One of the central proposals is to reduce the validator bond from 32 ETH to just 1 ETH, a move intended to foster greater decentralization within the network. Drake noted that the current issuance model for Proof of Stake (PoS) is perceived as flawed, presenting an opportunity for improvement that could benefit Ethereum’s long-term health. To enhance censorship resistance, the proposal includes mechanisms for attestor-proposer separation, which would further secure the block production process. Additionally, the Beam Chain is designed to improve throughput by accelerating block time slots, ultimately leading to faster transaction confirmations. Plans To Transform Ethereum Future A hallmark of the Beam Chain initiative is its incorporation of zero-knowledge (ZK) consensus, which leverages Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARK) proofs. These cryptographic tools will serve dual purposes: enabling consensus clients to compile high-level languages into bytecode and creating a “hash-based post-quantum infinitely-aggregatable scheme” that can condense thousands of hashes into a single proof. Recent advancements suggest that users can prove over 2 million hashes per second, indicating that the “SNARKification” of the consensus layer is feasible even on consumer-grade hardware. Drake outlined that if the community supports the proposal, the next steps would involve specification in 2025, development in 2026, and testing in 2027. The researcher described this strategy as “ossification accelerationism,” aiming to achieve stability and maturity for Ethereum sooner rather than later. “We want Ethereum to go into ‘maintenance mode’ as soon as possible,” he stated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins The proposal has generated considerable interest within the Ethereum community, with Drake emphasizing the importance of community participation in shaping the future of the consensus layer. He referred to the Beam Chain as his “most ambitious initiative to date,” highlighting the need for collaboration to realize this vision. In an exclusive interview with NewsBTC, Professor Christian Cachin from the University of Bern commended the Beam Chain proposal for its potential to solidify Ethereum’s consensus roadmap. Cachin noted that while the planned upgrades involve sophisticated and non-backwards-compatible technologies, they are crucial for advancing Ethereum’s scalability and overall capabilities: As far as I see so far, the proposal makes the existing Ethereum consensus roadmap concrete, it takes the next steps toward more powerful and more scalable consensus of Ethereum. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,227, up 22% for the week.

This may not be eye candy to investors who are currently on the sidelines waiting for the coin to hit $90k, particularly the release of CPI data set today, November 13. This news is perceived by analysts to have a considerable influence on market sentiment and the expected direction of the alpha crypto asset. Related Reading: XRP Price Patterns And 2024 Election Spark Talk Of A New Rally The Barometer For Inflation Reflecting changes in the prices consumers pay for goods and services, the CPI report is a main indication of inflation. Expectations about the CPI can cause more volatility in the bitcoin markets as inflation rates affect the Federal Reserve’s choices on monetary policy. Recent trends imply that should inflation remain lowered, the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates—historically this has had a positive effect on Bitcoin prices. Reduced borrowing rates sometimes inspire investment in risky assets such as cryptocurrencies, hence increasing demand for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin is up to $90,000 and I think we’re about to get started with the markets. The sweet spot is having a 10% correction towards the CME gap before we continue. I’m slightly bearish going into CPI tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/dfpUc2df1k — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 12, 2024 Growing Investor Trust Famous crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe, the founder of MNConsultancy, said that the current state of affairs in the crypto market corresponds well to the positive assessment of Bitcoin. In case CPI statistics would indicate more cases of inflation drops, he says that this would lead to growing investor trust and higher capital inflows into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Will Bitcoin Retrace? He also cautions, though, that unanticipated inflation rises could surprise markets and cause pricing adjustments all around. He anticipates a 10% Bitcoin retracement prior to the release of CPI data, targeting a range of $75,660 to $81,193. Market Reactions And Predictions As traders get ready for the CPI figures, the general market mood remains mixed. Some experts think that positive CPI numbers could lead to a rise in Bitcoin prices, but others say that people shouldn’t get too excited. Meanwhile, many investors are still optimistic about the long-run prospects of Bitcoin. The incoming administration of newly-elected US President Donald Trump adds another layer of complexity to market dynamics. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot According to Van de Poppe, short-term regulatory actions will benefit Bitcoin, but their long-run consequences might be something more complex if control for inflation is not handled well. Meanwhile, as Bitcoin continues in its path for a major price discovery, the focus will be on the CPI data and the impact they have on digital assets. Such an unpredictable environment should be approached with caution by investors while they remain focused on economic events that could swing their investments.

The crypto custodian recently received regulatory approvals from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in Abu Dhabi.  The approval means the company's clients can now use money market fund tokens as collateral in derivatives trades.  Cryptocurrency firm Copper said it is now able to offer clients secure custody and trading of tokenized money market funds such as Blackrock's BUIDL, the company said in a press release Wednesday.  Copper clients can also use tokenized money market funds as collateral in derivatives trades, after the crypto custodian received regulatory approvals from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in Abu Dhabi, the London-based company said.  The company has signed new partnerships with key participants involved in tokenization, including Securitize, Franklin Templeton, Ondo and Hashnote. Securitize is the transfer agent and tokenization platform for Blackrock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, issued on the Ethereum blockchain and represented by the blockchain-based BUIDL token.  Tokenized Treasuries are digital representations of U.S. government bonds and are at the forefront of the representation of real-world assets on blockchains, allowing them to be traded as tokens on networks such as Ethereum, Stellar, Solana and Mantle. Digital asset firms and TradFi heavyweights have been racing to put financial instruments such as government bonds, private credit and money market funds on blockchain rails, to achieve operational efficiencies and faster settlements.  ""If the Fed does end up keeping rates higher for longer, these tokenized money market funds could enhance returns for derivative market participants, who would be earning income from the collateral they post to counterparties,"" Amar Kuchinad, Copper's global CEO, said in emailed comments.  The tokenized Treasury market has almost tripled in size this year, growing from $780 million in January to around $2.3 billion, according to data from rwa.xyz.  Kuchinad, a former Securities and Exchange (SEC) adviser, replaced Dmitry Tokarev as global CEO last month.

In addition to the seed funding, the company secured a $250 million ""token purchase commitment"" that, it said, will let it draw on liquid digital assets on exchanges to further support project development.  Zero Gravity Labs (0GL) said it raised $40 million in seed funding from a number of heavyweight crypto investors to develop a decentralized AI operating system, dAIOS, following a $35 million pre-seed round in March.  dAIOS is designed to offer a decentralized environment for massive datasets to power AI computation.  The seed round included contributions from Hack VC, Delphi Digital, OKX Ventures, Polygon and its founder Sandeep Nailwal, and Animoca Brands and its founder Yat Siu, among others, according to an emailed announcement.  0GL said it also secured a $250 million ""token purchase commitment"" that will allow it to draw on liquid digital assets held on exchanges to further support project development.  The proliferation of AI tools in the last couple of years has prompted many blockchain projects to explore how decentralization can be applied to artificial intelligence to prevent huge datasets being concentrated under the auspices of just a few powerful entities.  Whether or not there is a use case for such projects remains to be seen, but it is evident that the great and the good of crypto VC are willing to spend tens of millions of dollars finding out.

The price of bitcoin rose above $89,000 following the numbers.  The chances of another Fed rate cut in mid-December jumped to 69% just after the data.  U.S. inflation data for October exactly matched economist estimates, sending bitcoin back towards the $90,000 level.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in October versus forecasts for 0.2% and a 0.2% rise in September, according to a government report on Wednesday morning.. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI was higher by 2.6%, also matching forecasts even as it rose from 2.4% in September.  Core CPI – which excludes more volatile food and energy costs – rose 0.3% in October versus estimates for 0.3% and 0.3% in August. Year-over-year core CPI was 3.3% versus an expected 3.3% and 3.3% in September.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} gained following the numbers to $89,500. It remains higher by nearly 30% over the past week.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points since beginning an easing cycle in September. Easier monetary policy across nearly all Western central banks combined with the crypto-friendly Donald Trump election victory last week has provided the fuel for bitcon's run to new all-time highs.  According to CME FedWatch — which factors in short-term interest rate movements into odds on what the Fed may do at its next policy meeting — the chances for an additional 25 basis point rate cut in mid-December were just under 60% prior to this morning's data and rose to 69% just after the print.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/13/us-cpi-meets-estimates-rising-02-in-october-bitcoin-moves-above-89k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce30c5f668be3eaaf3a49a27f10943739c69a19b-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Severino, XRP's price is forming a classic Elliott Wave structure, with the digital asset poised to enter its Fifth Wave. Notably, the fifth wave is often characterized by sharp upward movements in Elliott Wave theory.Analysis of XRP’s Elliott Wave StructureIn the chart shared by Severino, the first and third waves led to significant gains for XRP during the 2014 and 2017 market cycles, respectively. The 2017 wave was particularly powerful, with XRP surging by over 70,000% during that period. Meanwhile, a bearish phase followed these two waves, specifically Wave 2 in 2016 and Wave 4 in the current ongoing phase of 2024.Interestingly, Severino’s chart shows that XRP is on the verge of breaking out of its fourth wave, signaling the start of an explosive fifth wave with a projected price target of $20. Currently, XRP is trading at around $0.55, so reaching $20 as projected would result in a massive gain of 3,536% for current XRP holders.Other Technical Indicators Supporting an Impending XRP SurgeIn addition to the Elliott Wave structure, Severino's analysis also incorporates other bullish technical indicators. Specifically, the chart shows XRP consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, which often signals an impending breakout.The triangle, marked with an A-B-C-D-E pattern, reflects a tightening price range that typically precedes a significant price movement once the pattern resolves.Adding to the bullish case, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching a key downtrend resistance, according to Severino.He suggested that if XRP breaks above this long-standing RSI resistance , it would signal a surge in buying momentum, further supporting the potential for a rally. Sentiment Around XRP in the Crypto MarketWhile XRP has traded sideways in recent months, the convergence of these technical signals suggests that a major move could be on the horizon. Pro-XRP market analysts have stressed that virtually every metric is pointing to an impending explosive surge for XRP. However, XRP has continued to show disappointing price performance , even as Bitcoin has broken multiple all-time highs this week. This has led some to continue doubting the bullish narrative surrounding XRP. In response to Severino’s post, an X user named Wide Field remarked that, for years, the market has been engaging in wishful thinking about XRP, but the price has failed to reflect any substantial change.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/fifth-wave-could-propel-xrp-by-3536-to-20-says-chartered-market-technician/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fifth-wave-could-propel-xrp-by-3536-to-20-says-chartered-market-technician,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
42435391,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAkc,1731502860,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Consolidates After Encountering Resistance at $90K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,598.80 -1.86%  Bitcoin (BTC): $87,804.73 -0.04%  Ether (ETH): $3,166.56 -3.78%  S&P 500: 5,983.99 -0.29%  Gold: $2,611.13 +0.00%  Nikkei 225: 38,721.66 -1.66%  Top Stories  Bitcoin has applied the brakes to its record-shattering rally after encountering resistance at the $90,000 level. Having briefly hit $90,100 on Coinbase during the U.S. afternoon Tuesday, BTC succumbed to selling pressure, falling as low as $86,200 during the European morning. It subsequently recovered some ground to settle around $87,500, about 2.65% lower than its Tuesday highs. Altcoins saw greater losses, with ETH and SOL falling by 3.6% and 2.8, respectively, in the last 24 hours. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, dropped 1.4%.  The release of October U.S. consumer price data at 8:30 a.m. ET, could signal a period of sentiment change in the crypto market. The report is expected to show that the cost of living rose 2.6% year-on-year last month following a 2.4% increase in September. Inflation data releases brought downside volatility to bitcoin in the first quarter, with BTC performing negatively as inflation remained almost double the target. For example, it fell as much as 7.5% on Jan. 12, when the U.S. reported a December figure that was the highest since June 1982.  President-elect Donald Trump confirmed plans to create a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a clear nod to the dog-themed memecoin, with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy at the helm. The duo will work from outside the government to offer advice and guidance to drive large-scale structural reform and create an “entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.” A CoinDesk analysis flagged in mid-October that the DOGE trade was gaining interest among investors for its memetic nature, and that there could be more chatter of “DOGE” in mainstream media and retail trading circles that fuels attention and interest in the token. The DOGE price has gained almost 250% in the past 30 days, reaching 2021 levels on Tuesday with traders now eyeing the $1 mark as a long-term target.

36235127,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652925,1731501113,Dogecoin Outperforms Bitcoin: Bloomberg Expert Explains Why,"Over the past few weeks, Dogecoin (DOGE) has exhibited a massive surge, significantly outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and other major altcoins. The memecoin has soared by 170% in the last two weeks, an astounding 250% over the past five weeks, and 95% in just the last five days. This meteoric rise has positioned Dogecoin as one of the top-performing digital assets in the current market landscape. Why Is Dogecoin Outperforming Bitcoin? Michael P. Regan, the global team leader for cryptocurrencies at Bloomberg and a former senior markets editor, shed light on this phenomenon during an interview with Bloomberg Crypto. Addressing skepticism from traditional investors regarding Dogecoin’s fundamentals, Regan acknowledged the coin’s unexpected resilience. “Dogecoin, I think, has surprised everybody with its staying power,” Regan stated. “When you talk about the fundamental values, that gets kind of, you know, sort of a philosophical discussion when it comes to crypto. But one thing about Dogecoin that’s really interesting is it is actually very cheap to transact with, much cheaper than Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price May Explode By 10,200% Based On Classic Chart Pattern: Expert Regan highlighted practical use cases that contribute to Dogecoin’s value proposition. “We’ve had stories—you do actually find people using it for remittances, you know, people sending money back home to Venezuela to their parents. It’s a lot cheaper to do that with Dogecoin than most other cryptocurrencies,” he explained. Additionally, he mentioned the growing acceptance of Dogecoin in everyday transactions: “There’s even people developing payments apps. You know, there’s a pizza place, Williamsburg Pizza in New York, that accepts Dogecoin.” Despite its origin as a joke, Regan believes there’s more to Dogecoin than meets the eye. “It started as a joke. You know, it still makes me laugh to think about it, but there is something there that’s a little bit sort of more serious than most people realize, I think,” he concluded. The Elon Musk Effect When asked about the influence of Elon Musk on Dogecoin’s recent rally, Regan didn’t mince words. “This rally we’ve seen, I think, is almost, you know, completely tied to Elon Musk,” he asserted. Musk, a well-known advocate for Dogecoin, has a history of impacting its price through his public statements and social media activity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $2.4 If Price Aligns With Macro Pattern – Details “Elon Musk has been a huge champion of Dogecoin lately. I think, you know, just for the memes—the guy likes funny memes on the Internet. Dogecoin is sort of the, you know, meme coin of choice on X and Twitter before that,” Regan remarked. He emphasized the speculative nature of the memecoin and Musk’s significant role within it. “It’s hard to know exactly, you know, if that’s as far as Musk’s appreciation for it goes. But regardless, you know, crypto is all about speculation. He likes it,” Regan said. Highlighting the impact of Musk’s involvement, Regan concluded, “It’s up almost 200% since the election,” referring to the hype which the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) created. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.38698.

36234974,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652843,1731501014,"XRP Surges To $0.74, Reaching Its Highest Price Since Mid-March: Here’s Why","Over the past nine days, XRP has experienced a significant rally, climbing from $0.4957 on November 4 to a peak of $0.7407 today on Binance—a surge of over 50% at one point. Approximately 30% of this ascent occurred within the last 48 hours. However, following this rapid rise, XRP saw a sharp correction, retreating by -12% to $0.65 as of press time. These are the key reasons for the rally: #1 XRP Funding Rates and Social Dominance Spike One of the primary drivers behind the XRP price surge appears to be heightened social media activity and shifts in funding rates. On-chain analytics firm Santiment noted via X that the XRP community “has erupted with excitement and discussions related to crypto’s #7 market cap,” with over 4% of all coin discussions currently related to XRP following its 45% breakout over an eight-day span. The firm emphasized that surpassing $0.74, XRP’s year-high back in March, will largely depend on “FOMO staying at bay, and funding rates on large exchanges like Binance not getting too weighed down by longs.” Related Reading: XRP Price Patterns And 2024 Election Spark Talk Of A New Rally Santiment’s analysis highlighted that the ratio of Binance XRP long versus short positions has reached its highest point since March 31, indicating strong bullish sentiment among traders. They also observed that previous spikes in social dominance, such as those at the beginning of August, served as perfect top signals, suggesting that the current surge in social discussions could precede a market correction. Conversely, Santiment also pointed out that the previous social spike marked a bottom signal. #2 Gensler Resignation This Week? Speculation about potential regulatory changes is also influencing XRP’s market dynamics under the Trump administration. Pro-crypto lawyer James “MetaLawMan” Murphy shared an intriguing timeline via X, drawing parallels between US presidential elections and the resignations of SEC chairs. Related Reading: Could XRP Explode After US Elections? Data Hints At Massive 60,000% Rally He noted that after the 2016 and 2020 elections, SEC chairs Mary Jo White and Jay Clayton announced their resignations shortly after the results. Murphy suggested that with the 2024 election, there could be expectations for current SEC Chair Gary Gensler to resign, posting, “Hey Gary Gensler, we’re waiting.” Time to say Goodbye Gary! Nov. 8, 2016: Trump elected Nov. 14, 2016: Mary Jo White (SEC Chair) announces her resignation Nov. 3, 2020: Biden elected Nov. 16, 2020: Jay Clayton announces resignation Nov. 5, 2024: Trump elected Nov. __, 2024: Hey @GaryGensler, we’re waiting — MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) November 12, 2024 This speculation is particularly significant for the XRP community because of the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. President-elect Donald Trump has explicitly stated his intention to remove Gensler from his position on his first day in office, citing the need for a more crypto-friendly SEC chairman—a statement he made at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has shown strong support for this potential change, urging Trump to appoint replacements more favorable to the crypto industry, such as Chris Giancarlo, Brian Brooks, or Dan Gallagher. Garlinghouse highlighted the need for regulatory clarity, especially concerning digital assets like Ethereum and XRP. The speculation among some Ripple supporters is that Gensler’s removal could lead to a more favorable outcome for Ripple, potentially through the SEC dropping its appeal in the case. The market seems to be reacting to this speculation, with investors possibly trying to front-run the news in anticipation of a settlement or regulatory shift. At press time, XRP traded at $0.65.

Ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are showing positive cumulative flows for the first time since their introduction in July after five consecutive days of net inflows.  The nine spot ether ETFs listed in the U.S. recorded just under $136 million of inflows on Tuesday, taking the total since Nov. 6 to around $650 million, according to data tracked by SoSoValue.  The funds' cumulative inflows are now in the black to the tune of $94.62 million.

Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which already had over $8 billion in assets at the time of listing, began experiencing outflows that were not offset by flows into the other funds.

36238619,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101340,1731499128,Bitcoin Eyes $104K as MVRV Signals Room for Growth,"As Bitcoin forms an evening star pattern, is a pullback to $84,000 imminent, or will the bull run continue toward $100,000? As bullish exhaustion leads to a minor pullback in Bitcoin , the streak of new all-time highs takes a pause. Currently, the BTC price is trading below the $88,000 mark with a market cap of $1.75 trillion. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin has increased by more than 40%. Will the latest minor pullback delay the Bitcoin price target of $100,000? Let’s find out.Bitcoin Price AnalysisBitcoin is currently trading at $87,496, with an intraday pullback of 0.61% from the opening price of $88,038. Yesterday, the price formed a doji candle, with a downfall of 0.83%. This warned of an evening star pattern, as it had formed a massive bullish engulfing candle with a 10.38% surge on Monday. Further, Bitcoin's bearish reversal occurred from the 1.618 Fibonacci level, which was priced at $88,574. In the recent cycle, the BTC price formed its all-time high at $90,243 on the Bitstamp exchange. As the evening star pattern warns of a pullback, the lower price rejection in the intraday candle teases a bullish extension. Furthermore, the growing bullish influence teases a positive crossover between the 100-day and 200-day simple moving average lines. This means the average lines are ready for a positive alignment following the golden crossover. Hence, the dynamic lines trigger a buy signal for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the MACD and signal lines continue to prosper, with a surge of positive histograms signaling healthy bullish momentum. MVRV Shows Room for Growth Amid Growing NetworkAmid the increasing demand for crypto, the active Bitcoin addresses have surpassed the 1 million mark. Furthermore, the number of transactions and transaction fees over the Bitcoin network has significantly increased, per Intotheblock . Bitcoin Network Growth Over the past week, large transactions have surged to 33.33K, with a total transaction volume of 1.36 million BTC. This marks a seven-day high in both transaction count and volume. With the network growing stronger, the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio indicates that there is still room for further growth.Historically, the MVRV ratio has been useful in identifying market tops. In 2013, it peaked at 4.91; in 2017, it hit 4.24; and in 2021, it reached 3.68. These peaks in the MVRV ratio often signal market tops. Bitcoin MVRVCurrently, the MVRV ratio stands at 2.47 as the BTC price continues to create new all-time high levels. Based on the tweet from IntoTheBlock , historical values between 2.6 and 5 have aligned with market tops. Furthermore, with the previous peak at 3.68 MVRV, the lower peak is expected to form near 3. Hence, the present MVRV ratio at 2.47 shows significant room for growth in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price TargetsBased on the Fibonacci retracement tool, Bitcoin's upside targets are $97,781 and $104,337 at the 2 and 2.272 Fibonacci levels. However, for Bitcoin to reach these levels, it will need to break through the 1.618 Fibonacci resistance level at $88,574.Conversely, the crucial support levels for Bitcoin are at $84,000 and $80,000.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/bitcoin-eyes-104k-as-mvrv-signals-room-for-growth/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-eyes-104k-as-mvrv-signals-room-for-growth,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

However, this strategy positions Ethereum for long-term dominance. Ethereum has encountered a significant resistance level at $3,386, prompting a temporary correction. This pivotal region, marked by substantial supply, has led to a 6.59% price decline in the past 24 hours, bringing ETH to $3,161. Despite this short-term setback, Ethereum has seen a 21.22% increase over the past week. Meanwhile, Ethereum's performance in recent years has lagged behind competitors like Bitcoin and Solana. According to a Hack VC report, Ethereum's 121% year-to-date growth pales in comparison to Bitcoin’s 290% and Solana’s 1,452%. The report attributes this underperformance to Ethereum's decision to embrace modular architecture, which may have dampened its short-term price momentum.https://twitter.com/alpackaP/status/1856425712967647262Modular Approach Sparks Debate Hack VC highlights that Ethereum’s move toward a modular architecture, incorporating Layer 2 solutions and shared security protocols, has introduced trade-offs. Among these are lower fees and reduced token burns, which have affected ETH’s price dynamics.As a result, market gains have shifted toward tokens within Ethereum's modular ecosystem, particularly those associated with Layer 2 networks, leaving ETH holders at a disadvantage in the short term.However, despite these challenges, Ethereum’s modular ecosystem retains a strong market presence, with a combined market capitalization that rivals Solana's.Long-Term Prospects of Ethereum’s Modular StrategyDespite the short-term price challenges, the long-term benefits of Ethereum’s modular strategy are evident. Hack VC data indicates Ethereum has maintained a 75% market share over nine years, bolstered by Layer 2 solutions. This modular strategy positions Ethereum for future technological advancements, helping to secure its dominance in the blockchain space for years to come.Deflationary Dynamics Meanwhile, Ethereum’s supply dynamics have shifted positively, according to Onchain Foundation’s latest analysis. The network has re-entered deflationary territory, with more ETH being burned than issued. As market momentum grows, this trend is expected to accelerate, creating a self-sustaining cycle of higher demand and reduced supply.The report emphasizes that rising gas fees are contributing to the increased burn rate of ETH , further tightening supply.

42435384,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAio,1731495844,Volatility Expected in Bitcoin Later Today as US Headline Inflation Data Is Expected to Tick Higher: Van Straten,"Consensus for headline inflation year-over-year is expected to increase by 0.2% to 2.6% — the first year-on-year increase since March 2024.  Bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility spiked to as high as 90% past week, and could see further volatility when U.S. inflation data is announced.  The U.S. inflation report set to be released on Wednesday has the potential to stir up bitcoin {{BTC}} price volatility, ending the 48-hour period of calm.  Its been a whirlwind week for cryptocurrencies, with Donald Trump winning the U.S presidential election on Nov. 6. As a result, the total cryptocurrency market jumped from $2.2 trillion to $3 trillion back down to approximately $2.8 trillion, according to TradingView.  While bitcoin {{BTC}}, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, touched $90,000 on Nov. 12 just before U.S. equity markets closed.  U.S. inflation data is not squashed  Per FXStreet, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) due at 8:30 ET, is expected to show that the cost of living increased 2.6% year-on-year in October, having risen 2.4% in the preceding month. This would be the first year-on-year increase since March.  The issue of embedded inflation is not from headline but from core inflation, year-over-year. Early this year, we saw core come down from 3.9% to 3.2%. However, it turned higher in September to 3.3%, presenting a challenge to the Fed.  The concern of inflation not being slayed can be shown in the U.S. yields, which have only soared since the Federal Reserve started the rate-cutting cycle with a 50bps rate cut, followed by a further 25bps rate cut. Since the first rate cut on Sep. 16, the U.S. 10Y has jumped from 3.6% to 4.4%. With the U.S. 3-month treasury yield trading at 4.6%, which follows the effective federal funds rate, it's suggesting that no more than 25bps of rate cuts will occur over the next three months, as the current target rate is 450 - 475.  So, with a spike in implied volatility and an expected increase in headline inflation YoY, could bitcoin see a dramatic price swing later today?  Implied volatility has risen  Implied volatility for options contracts expiring one week from today has spiked from 40% to as high as 90% due to bitcoin's climb to $90,000, an increase of more than $20,000 since Nov. 6. Glassnode defines implied volatility as the market's expectation of volatility. Viewing At-The-Money (ATM) IV over time gives a normalized view of volatility expectations, which will often rise and fall with realized volatility and market sentiment.  How has bitcoin fared on previous U.S. CPI releases?  Inflation data releases brought downside volatility to bitcoin in the first quarter. It performed negatively as inflation remained almost double the inflation target. For example, bitcoin fell as much as 7.5% on Jan. 12 when the U.S. reported a hotter inflation figure for December.  However, as the year progressed and headline inflation YoY continued to slow, this became more of a bullish event for bitcoin, eventually registering a 6.7% price increase on Jul. 15 as an example.  As inflation slowed, the market became more efficient and produced three consecutive 0-1% price movements. Now, inflation is expected to rebound again.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/13/volatility-expected-in-bitcoin-later-today-as-us-headline-inflation-data-is-expected-to-tick-higher,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b387f2788b3b8f0d6dc6b69312a7955d9e31c01d-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dogecoin Sharks & Whales Have Seen Their Count Grow Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the sharks and whales have shown a reversal in their count recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us, among other things, how many addresses belong to a particular Dogecoin wallet group. Addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of tokens they carry in their current balance. For instance, the 1 to 10 coins group includes all wallets holding between 1 and 10 DOGE. The Supply Distribution for this specific cohort would tell us about the total number of network addresses that satisfy this condition. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up In the context of the current discussion, two address ranges are of interest: 0 to 100,000 coins and 100,000+ coins. The former comprises the small investor groups of the sector, like retail, while the latter includes the large entities like sharks and whales. Generally, the influence of any address on the network increases the more they carry, so the sharks and whales, with their large holdings, can be considered key cohorts of the memecoin. Naturally, the whales are the more important of the two, as they have more massive bags. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the recent trend in the Dogecoin Supply Distribution over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin Supply Distribution has been going up for the 0 to 100,000 coins group for a while now, suggesting more investors of this size have been popping up on the blockchain. More particularly, 74,885 new addresses have appeared inside this range over the last four weeks. During this same window, the 100,000+ tokens cohort has seen a downtrend in the indicator, which suggests some big-money investors have been clearing out their holdings. That said, while 350 Dogecoin sharks and whales have left the network over the past month, things appear to be turning around for the better on smaller timeframes. Related Reading: Dogecoin To As High As $23? This Pattern Could Hint So Around 108 wallets of this size have cropped up on the network in the last couple of days, which would explain where the fuel for the memecoin’s impressive rally has come from. At present, both retail and large holders are witnessing a rise on the network, but it only remains to be seen whether this momentum lasts. Naturally, the uptrend in the Supply Distribution of the sharks and whales is of more significance, given their placement in the market. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.383, up over 21% over the last 24 hours.

Mow asserts that Bitcoin will go parabolic soon, speculating a surge to a multi-million valuation per coin. The JAN3 CEO, famously known as the Asian Michael Saylor, based his lofty Bitcoin call on the macroeconomic landscape and growing US debt.In an interview , Mow noted that US debts have increased to insane levels, placing the economy at risk of implosion. Data shows that the total outstanding public debt of the United States stands at $35.95 trillion.The market expert noted that these debts are not sustainable. As a result, he believes there would either be a “debt jubilee” or the US would have to reprice its dollar valuation to a harder asset. Mow asserted that he sees the US dollar rebasing to one Satoshi.Bitcoin to Surge to $100M on Rebasement BasisThe JAN3 CEO insisted that the United States would have to take a drastic approach to its growing debt. He stated this would happen as it could not pay the debt because it has outgrown its gross domestic product (GDP).As a result, Mow sees the US government rebasing $1 to worth 1 Satoshi (SAT). Currently, 1 SAT trades at $0.000876. Repricing the dollar to the value of 1 SAT would spur Bitcoin to a value of $100 million.Notably, Mow argued that the rebasement would eventually happen, noting it was a matter of when the US would make the move. He added that “it is inevitable that we do rebase to Bitcoin,” noting that $1 to 1 Satoshi was a “fair rebase plan.”Mow’s Near-Term AssertionMeanwhile, the JAN3 CEO stated that Bitcoin is on a path to $1 million per coin. He insisted that Bitcoin is severely undervalued at the current price and expects a massive parabolic expansion.However, Mow noted that the premier asset would trade at $100,000 before the end of the year. He stated that Bitcoin would have attained the price mark but is still lagging from the FTX implosion and Grayscale sales hangover.Notably, the famous Bitcoin advocate cited reasons for his six-figure assertion, which include the growing demand from the spot exchange-traded funds.

More than $4.5 billion was lost to cryptocurrency investment scams last year.  A Chinese citizen linked to Cambodian ""pig butchering"" operations pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in a scheme to launder millions of dollars in proceeds of cryptocurrency investment scams, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Nov. 12.  Daren Li, a 41-year-old native of Shaanxi province in China who also holds citizenship from St. Kitts and Nevis, laundered over $73 million from scam victims using a web of shell companies and international bank accounts, the DOJ said. He will be sentenced on March 3 and faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.  Li was arrested on April 12 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The DOJ described him as a resident of China, Cambodia and the United Arab Emirates. Co-conspirator Yicheng Zhang, a 38-year-old Chinese national who lives in California, was arrested in Los Angeles on May 16.  “Although Li committed this offense from outside the United States, he was not beyond the reach of the Justice Department,"" Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, said in a statement. ""Today’s plea reflects our ongoing commitment to working with our domestic and international partners to hold accountable anyone responsible for cryptocurrency investment fraud against U.S. victims — wherever the perpetrators are located.”  Losses from crypto investment scams hit $4.5 billion in 2023, according to the FBI. As the figure is based on reported incidents, the real total is likely to be much higher.  Among the different types of scams, pig butchering has garnered significant attention. It targets victims by having perpetrators strike up friendships online before enticing them to invest in a cryptocurrency platform, sometimes even pretending to have secret knowledge of the inner workings of the platform to make an investment a sure bet. Victims are initially able to withdraw money from the platform, which encourages them to invest more significant amounts before withdrawals are frozen.  Pig butchering scams are conducted at scale by companies with links to organized crime, particularly in Southeast Asia. Myanmar and Cambodia alone are suspected of having over 220,000 individuals involved, some of whom have been trafficked to the region on false pretenses of legitimate jobs, according to the United Nations.  Li played a role in laundering the money from victims, according to court documents. He instructed co-conspirators to open U.S. bank accounts established on behalf of shell companies and would monitor the receipt and execution of interstate and international wire transfers of victim funds.  Li and his co-conspirators would then receive victims’ funds in financial accounts they controlled and monitor the conversion to virtual currency, specifically Tether's USDT stablecoin and its subsequent distribution to cryptocurrency wallets they also controlled.  Some of these proceeds were to bank accounts at Deltec Bank in the Bahamas. In June, authorities seized over $58 million in funds from the bank during an investigation into international money laundering, wire and bank fraud. A representative for Deltec Bank told CoinDesk at the time that the investigation related to crimes committed by individuals and denied any wrongdoing",NEGATIVE,USDT,ASIA | FIAT | USDT,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/13/money-launderer-who-moved-scam-victims-funds-faces-up-to-two-decades-in-us-prison,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65939466cf81d95b9eac594e0324f0b0b9b6c957-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36238611,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101330,1731491755,Two Reasons Why Bitcoin Might See Sustained Rally: Expert,"Attorney Jeremy Hogan discusses the recent developments surrounding Bitcoin, highlighting two major factors that could pave the way for a sustained rally. The price of Bitcoin has surged tremendously following the conclusion of the United States election, which saw the emergence of a pro-crypto president and over 200 lawmakers. With investors enthusiastic about cryptos’ prospects under the forthcoming administration, Bitcoin rallied to $89,956 a week after the election. 2 Factors That Could Drive Government and Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Reacting, Attorney Jeremy Hogan, a partner at Hogan & Hogan law firm and pro-XRP lawyer, provided an overview of Bitcoin’s recent performance, suggesting that the premier crypto asset could see big gains in the coming months. https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1856333024322871570He highlighted two factors that could drive government and institutional investments in Bitcoin, leading to a massive surge in BTC’s price. Government Adoption Attorney Hogan referenced the recent election result, which led to Trump’s victory and the Republican Party, with more pro-crypto lawmakers, winning the Senate and the House. The pro-XRP lawyer suggested that with additional support from the Democratic Party, there is a high likelihood that the United States ‘Bitcoin Purchase Program’ legislation might pass next year. For context, the legislation proposes that the U.S. government purchase not more than 200,000 BTC yearly over five years, bringing the total acquisition to 1 million BTC. This represents about 5.05% of Bitcoin’s 19.78 million circulating supply. The legislation recommends that the U.S. Secretary of State holds the acquired Bitcoin for at least 20 years to ensure long-term stability. Interestingly, Hogan emphasized that if the bill passes, it will potentially influence other countries to accumulate Bitcoin, thus driving the asset’s price significantly. Institutional Adoption Notably, Hogan claimed that MicroStrategy, which had a hint about the bill, embarked on a Bitcoin accumulation spree immediately after the election. Recall that MicroStrategy announced a purchase of 27,200 BTC worth $2.03 billion on November 11. According to MicroStrategy, the average cost of each BTC was $74,463. Currently, MicroStrategy holds 279,400 BTC, costing $11.9 billion. At the current price of $87,363, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin portfolio is worth about $24.41 billion, representing a 105% ROI. Given MicroStrategy’s enormous profit, Hogan speculated that companies with excess cash reserves, like Microsoft, might face intense pressure from shareholders to invest in Bitcoin as well. Finally, Hogan envisages a future where Bitcoin could see a sustained rally driven by a combination of institutional and government-backed BTC investments.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/two-reasons-why-bitcoin-might-see-sustained-rally-expert/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=two-reasons-why-bitcoin-might-see-sustained-rally-expert,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36238609,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101333,1731491344,Analysts Confirm XRP Bollinger Bands Expanding After 19 Months of Contraction: A Massive Rally Incoming?,"Amid the ongoing market uptrend, XRP monthly Bollinger Bands have finally begun to expand after an extended period of contraction. The latest development marks the end of a 19-month consolidation phase, the longest in XRP’s history. According to market analysts, historical data suggests that when XRP exits a contraction phase, it often undergoes substantial price surges .For the uninitiated, Bollinger Bands has an upper, middle (moving average), and lower band. During periods of low volatility, these bands contract, indicating a “squeeze,” while high volatility causes them to expand. Such contractions typically lead to rapid price swings.XRP Historical Bollinger Bands ExpansionsThe Great Mattsby, a market analyst, spotlighted this. For instance, XRP’s price has responded explosively after such Bollinger Band squeezes. An example occurred between August 2016 and February 2017, when XRP’s Bollinger Bands contracted for six months . XRP 1M Chart | The Great Mattsby Following this contraction, XRP’s price soared from $0.00626 to $3.31 within a year, achieving a staggering gain of over 52,000%. This rally became one of XRP’s most remarkable historical price movements.A similar, though less extreme, pattern emerged in late 2019 and 2020. The Bollinger Bands contracted from December 2019 to October 2020—a 10-month period. In the months following this squeeze, XRP’s price surged from $0.2419 to a high of $1.96 in April 2021, marking a 686% increase over seven months. However, unlike the 2017 rally, this price movement was somewhat restrained due to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit filed against Ripple in December 2020, which led to XRP’s delisting from several major exchanges and large-scale selloffs.XRP’s Bollinger Bands Now ExpandingIn the most recent scenario, XRP’s Bollinger Bands had been tightening since October 2023, creating a prolonged squeeze that, according to past patterns, could lead to a large price movement.Currently, XRP is set for another potential breakout, as it benefits from the momentum of a broader market rally spurred by Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. presidential election. XRP has already seen a 28.37% increase in November alone, bringing its price to the $0.65 region.Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino noted XRP’s current position above the upper Bollinger Band, pointing out that the Bollinger Band Width (BBW) is now beginning to widen from the narrowest squeeze in XRP’s history. He described this movement as a potential setup for a “shock and awe” price rally. XRP Bollinger Bands | Tony Severino Currently, XRP changes hands at $0.6517, down 1.7% over the past 24 hours but up 22% in the last week. Its most immediate concern is reclaiming and holding above the $0.70 region before the next leg up.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/analysts-confirm-xrp-bollinger-bands-expanding-after-19-months-of-contraction-a-massive-rally-incoming/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analysts-confirm-xrp-bollinger-bands-expanding-after-19-months-of-contraction-a-massive-rally-incoming,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
36228411,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652886,1731491311,"Cryptocurrency Surge Transforms Investment Strategies Of Millions In 2024, Do Not Miss The Boat With Cutoshi (CUTO)","An increasing number of altcoins are regaining their bullish momentum due to the US election results and Bitcoin hitting $89,000. Savvy traders are now making huge hauls from these gains. With top financial institution, BlackRock, surpassing $1B in inflows a single day for the first time in its spot Bitcoin ETF, more attention has been directed to the approval of ETFs for some other top coins like Solana and Ripple. Given the new administration’s bullish stance on crypto, these ETFs are likely to become a reality very soon. This, combined with the long-awaited continuation of the bull run, has ignited a lot of optimism, as more investors flood the crypto market looking for new investment opportunities. In the midst of all this, Cutoshi (CUTO), a new hybrid MemeFi platform, has been silently creating a lot of in its presale, attracting predictions of over 100x growth when it launches. With built-in DeFi market features in this meme coin’s ecosystem, investors are closely watching Cutoshi as it progresses through its presale. Cutoshi Presents Lucrative And Rewarding DeFi Features That Have Attracted Bullish Sentiment Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Cutoshi (CUTO) has successfully distinguished itself from typical meme coins by incorporating practical features that can be used to make DeFi easy and accessible. The Cutoshi hybrid ecosystem offers robust use cases, including the Cutoshi DEX, which facilitates the swapping and exchange of digital assets across multiple chains. Additionally, Cutoshi’s community members and token holders can engage in Cutoshi farming, where they complete quests to earn token rewards. But that’s not all. Cutoshi will also offer a learning academy that has integrated to spread and teach the knowledge of DeFi to the masses – an idea that will empower many new people to start using decentralized technology. And something that makes Cutoshi stand out from other altcoins. This unique MemeFi cryptocurrency draws inspiration from the Chinese Lucky Cat, which is known for prosperity, wealth, and luck. Cutoshi invites users into this mindset for their digital assets while also promoting principles of freedom, anonymity, and monetary empowerment for all. And it all seems to be working since the newbie meme coin has been able to attract significant interest so far. Starting its initial coin offering with a presale price of $0.015, Cutoshi’s native token, $CUTO, is now up by over 72%. The token now sells at a new price of $0.0259, having just reached the third presale stage, and is continuing to attract investors from several financial sectors. With a presale revenue surpassing $775k, Cutoshi is poised to raise over $1M before the end of October, especially as interest keeps surging for the token. Meanwhile, the token’s buyback and burn mechanism is another attractive feature, as investors know that this will facilitate its long-term growth. The reason for this is that the buyback and burn mechanism will deflate CUTO supply while pushing up its price and demand, as a result of scarcity. With a capped supply of only 440 million tokens and an upcoming centralized exchange (CEX) listing post-presale, Cutoshi has laid the groundwork for significant future price appreciation, driven by increased demand for the token. Can Cutoshi Make Top 10 Meme Coins By Market Cap In 2025? Cutoshi has already shown itself as a hybrid cryptocurrency, catering to both the meme coin and DeFi markets, which sets it apart from 90% of meme coins. This unique attribute is not only a game-changer among meme coins, it’s a trend that is on its way to becoming a wider phenomenon in crypto, as traders realize that real utility is king. With Cutoshi pioneering innovation among meme coins, its chances of ranking among the top 10 meme coins in 2025 are high.

Analysts caution that FOMO and funding rates on major exchanges could influence further gains. XRP has posted a massive rise this week, gaining over 23% following an explosive performance on Tuesday. The token’s recent performance contrasts sharply with last week, when broader market momentum, spurred by Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory, lifted most cryptos except XRP. However, XRP has rebounded, climbing 7.13% in the past 24 hours, drawing increased investor interest. A ccording to the analytics platform Santiment, XRP has witnessed a surge in social discussions. Over 4% of all crypto-related conversations now center around XRP, fueled by its 45% price breakout over an eight-day period. XRP Uptrend Continuation Hinges Avoiding Excessive FOMOThis surge in social engagement often coincides with significant price movements, as highlighted by historical patterns. Santiment also noted that previous spikes in XRP’s social dominance have acted as reliable indicators of market shifts. A recent spike served as a signal for a market bottom, suggesting a recovery phase, while an earlier peak aligned with a market top, resulting in a correction.Accordingly, Santiment cautioned that XRP’s ability to surpass its March high of $0.74 would depend on maintaining balanced funding rates on major exchanges like Binance. The platform emphasized that sustained price growth hinges on avoiding excessive long positions driven by fear of missing out (FOMO). Technical Indicators With Bullish OutlookMeanwhile, technical analysts are also projecting a bullish outlook for XRP. Dark Defender, a prominent market observer, highlighted that the token has broken through key resistance levels and is showing strong signals across key technical metrics.The analyst pointed out a Golden Cross on XRP’s weekly RSI, which remains above the 50% threshold. This pattern is traditionally seen as a positive signal for continued upward momentum.Dark Defender suggested that if XRP clears its immediate resistance at $0.6649, it could set the stage for a rally toward the $1 mark.XRP Performance Amid Election Cycle TrendsIn addition, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto shared an optimistic outlook for XRP, pointing to historical trends.

42435373,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAba,1731490270,Bitcoin Price Rally Hits a Wall at $90K Resistance While FX Traders Back the Dollar Bull Run,"BTC takes a bull breather at the key $90,000 barrier that CoinDesk identified last week.  Crypto traders anticipate an eventual breakout toward $110,000.  Continued dollar strength, anticipated by FX traders, might lead to financial tightening and slow BTC's ascent.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is taking a bull breather at the $90,000 resistance level CoinDesk identified last week as foreign-exchange traders focus on the rally in the dollar index (DXY), raising the risk of financial tightening that often weighs on risk assets.  Since early Tuesday, bitcoin's supposedly euphoric rise has hit a snag at the $90,000 barrier, with prices briefly dipping to $85,000, CoinDesk data show.  It's completely normal for such a pause to occur after a staggering $20,000 price surge in just a week, shattering previous lifetime peaks. Such pauses typically recharge bulls' engines for the next leg higher and traders in the options market are positioning for a breakout to $110,000-$120,000, according to data shared by QCP Capital.  Betting on a dollar rally  Still, it could be more than coincidence that the rally has paused alongside reports of traders betting on a continued rise in the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency's value against major fiat currencies.  ""Traded levels of volatility are rising notably as it seems the market is actively positioning (investors) or hedging (corporate treasurers) in expectation of a stronger dollar,"" ING said Tuesday. ""All we would say here is not to fight this emerging trend.""  Both BTC and USD, part of the so-called ""Trump trades,"" have surged since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election held a week ago. The DXY has risen by 2.7% to 106.78, hitting a six-month high, according to TradingView.  Persistent dollar strength, however, could restore the historical negative correlation between the two and at least slow down BTC's ascent, if not halt it altogether.  That's because the U.S. dollar is a global reserve currency with an outsized role in global trade, international debt and non-bank borrowing. An appreciating dollar commonly has investors with dollar-denominated debt and servicing costs trim exposure to riskier assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies.  Hardening bond yields  Yields on U.S. Treasury notes are also hardening, providing additional support for the dollar. The yield on the two-year note rose to 4.36% Tuesday, the highest since July 31. The 10-year note bounced close to the multimonth high of 4.46% seen a week ago.  The market action likely reflects concerns that President-elect Donald Trump's policies, especially mass deportations, could breed inflation, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next year.  ""Strong immigration was one of the big things that made central banks (not just the Fed) much more relaxed about underlying price dynamics,"" Dario Perkins, managing director of global macro at TS Lombard, said in a Nov. 11 note to clients. ""It helped to solve post-COVID labor shortages (not just in the U.S.). Sending millions of people back to their country of origin would reverse those trends and – depending on how many people were deported – recreate the situation we were in two years ago.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/13/bitcoin-price-rally-hits-a-wall-at-90k-resistance-while-fx-traders-back-the-dollar-bull-run,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/130f29ee3f8de9b6c6ffa066a914414940ef7f2e-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36227767,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652749,1731490233,Ethereum Spot ETFs Attract Record $295 Million Daily Inflows – Is ETH Set For New Highs?,"Ethereum (ETH) appears to be finally waking from its slumber, surging nearly 37% in the past week following Bitcoin’s (BTC) all-time-high (ATH) rally. Spot Ethereum ETFs Record Daily Inflows Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of approximately $404 billion, is now gaining ground on BTC, with the platform’s ETH token jumping more than 35% over the past week. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up While the broader digital assets market has been buoyed by Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election, additional factors may also be driving the recent industry boom, especially for ETH. A key data point is the substantial inflow of funds into spot ETH ETFs. On November 11, US-based spot ETH ETFs attracted a record $295 million in daily inflows, the highest amount to date. In comparison, the previous peak for daily inflows into spot ETH ETFs was $106 million, recorded on the first day these ETFs launched in July 2024. According to data from SoSoValue, the record inflows were led by Fidelity’s FETH ETF, which drew in $115.48 million. BlackRock’s ETHA followed with $101.11 million, Grayscale’s ETH with $63.32 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW with $15.57 million. At the time of writing, the total value of net assets held across various spot ETH ETFs stands at $9.72 billion, representing just over 2.41% of Ethereum’s total market cap. Meanwhile, cumulative net outflows from all spot ETH ETFs amount to $41.30 million. ETH Price Action And Resurgence In DeFi Renewed interest from institutional investors in Ethereum ETFs amid record daily inflows appears to be contributing positively to ETH’s price action. Related Reading: Survey Finds Almost 70% Of Ethereum Institutional Investors Engaged In ETH Staking Throughout much of 2024, ETH lagged in price performance among major cryptocurrencies such as BTC and Solana (SOL). However, Q4 2024 holds potential for a dramatic turnaround in ETH’s momentum. Analysis shared by Leon Waidmann, Head of Research at Onchain Foundation indicates that ETH staking levels are at an ATH, while the token’s reserves on crypto exchanges is heading toward record lows. This combination of record-high staking levels and reduced supply on exchanges suggests a potential supply squeeze, which could trigger a parabolic rally for ETH. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio seems to be recovering after prolonged losses, with the trading pair rising from 0.034 to 0.040 before dipping to 0.037 at the time of writing. The next major resistance for this pair lies around 0.040, and a successful breakout from this level could lead to more gains for ETH over BTC. At press time, ETH sits about 32% below its ATH value of $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Further, Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) activity seems to be picking steam. Data from DefiLlama shows that the total value locked (TVL) across Ethereum-based DeFi protocols currently sits at $62.36 billion, up from about $24 billion in November 2023. Over half of this TVL is tied to the ETH staking platform Lido, which holds close to $33 billion. Lido is followed by the DeFi lending protocol Aave with $15.21 billion and EigenLayer with $14.57 billion. That said, concerns remain regarding ETH’s “ultrasound money” narrative due to the token’s high issuance rate. At press time, ETH trades at $3,291, up 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

Will the NEAR token rebound to $7.71, or is a drop to $4.50 ahead? Following the broader market correction, the price of NEAR’s native token has experienced a bearish reversal from a critical resistance level. The pullback has extended nearly 10% over the past two days, bringing the token back to the psychological $5 support level.Will this bearish extension lead to a drop to the $4.50 support, or will a post-retest rebound send NEAR’s price toward $7.71? Let’s dive into the details.Near Protocol Price AnalysisTaking a bullish reversal from the crucial support of $3.522, the bull run in Near Protocol’s native token extended from $3.50 to $5.75. The bullish recovery accounted for a 64.22% rise and seven consecutive bullish candles. NEAR Price Chart However, the recovery rally failed to sustain dominance above the $5.50 mark, resulting in a bearish reversal. The bearish reversal started due to the massive supply at the 38.20% Fibonacci level at $5.56. It accounts for a price fall of nearly 10% in two days and forms an evening star pattern. Additionally, the recent pullback suggests that the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) will likely continue the sideways trend. The pullback has led to a declining gap between the MACD and signal lines, resulting in a drop in intensity in bullish histograms. Transactions and Fees Improve over Near ProtocolOn-chain metrics for Near Protocol have been showing positive signs, particularly in the ongoing bull market. During the April 2024 rally, transaction fees spiked above $60,000. NEAR PROTOCOL DAILY TRANSACTION CHART Now, the trend is rebounding. A break above the $30,000 transaction fee could accelerate the recent recovery. Furthermore, the daily transaction count continues to form higher lows. NEAR PROTOCOL TRANSACTION FEE CHART On Tuesday, the total number of transactions reached 7.5 million, with 982,375 new addresses added to the network.Given these growing metrics and improving market conditions, NEAR’s price could surge in the near future.Will the Uptrend Reach $7.71?In the daily chart, the NEAR token price has surpassed the long-coming multi-month resistance trendline. Essentially, the ongoing pullback comes as a potential retest. If the price holds above dynamic support (as indicated by the average line), the uptrend could continue, breaking above the $5.56 level (38.2% Fibonacci retracement). In this scenario, the bull run could target the 78.6% Fibonacci level, which stands at $7.71.",NEUTRAL,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | NEAR,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/13/near-protocol-targets-7-71-amid-growing-network-activity-5-support-in-focus/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=near-protocol-targets-7-71-amid-growing-network-activity-5-support-in-focus,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

XRP has finally awakened from its slumber to join the bull market frenzy, breaking multi-month highs after previously underperforming and frustrating holders. On Tuesday, XRP surged by an impressive 23%, rising from $0.5991 to as high as $0.7354—a price level last seen eight months ago in April. This remarkable turnaround coincided with Bitcoin’s attempt to break into the $90K price range on Tuesday.While XRP capitalized on Bitcoin’s uptrend following months of anticipation, excitement has swept the XRP community. Now, market commentators are growing more confident that the elusive $1 price is within reach.Last Chance to Buy XRP Under $1As a result, analysts are issuing bold warnings to the crypto community that now may be the last chance to buy XRP cheaply under $1. Commentators like Edo Farina have asserted that the long-awaited $1 price level could be recaptured as early as Friday—just two days away.https://twitter.com/edward_farina/status/1856463248909905935Notably, since XRP broke into the $0.70 range, it has retraced to $0.6542 at the time of writing. From this point, reaching $1 would require XRP to rally by 53% in the coming days.Meanwhile, analysts believe the $1 level will serve as a springboard for a sharp price pump.XRP Price After $1 BreakoutCrypto educator Ralston Maximus suggests that the longer-term trendline for XRP points to the $1.09 to $1.10 range. He emphasized that once XRP surpasses the $0.75 resistance level, the next major challenge will be breaking through the $1.10 zone.Maximus also pointed out that, regardless of short-term fluctuations, XRP has successfully broken out of its prolonged downtrend. Accordingly, he identified the $6.5 to $7 range as a potential target for the “smaller” move.Looking further ahead, Maximus speculated that XRP could reach the $30-$35 range in the “bigger picture.” Crypto commentator Armando Pantoja shared a similar outlook in a separate analysis. He highlighted the symmetrical triangle pattern, MACD indicators, and increasing volume as key factors supporting a potential breakout for XRP.Pantoja noted that a similar alignment of indicators played out previously, which led to XRP pumping from just a few cents to over $3. Accordingly, he suggested that after XRP surpasses the $1 mark, its price target could range between $8 and $30.

Between late 2021 and March 2023, the scheme allegedly took more than $232 million from victims.  Police in South Korea arrested 215 people in an investigation into a suspected 325.6 billion won ($232 million) cryptocurrency investment scam, Yonhap reported.  The Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency's Anti-Corruption and Economic Crime Investigation Unit said the arrests included staff from a fake investment consulting firm and an unidentified YouTuber with 620,000 subscribers. Gyeonggi is a South Korean province that surrounds the capital, Seoul.  Between December 2021 and March last year, the scheme allegedly defrauded more than 15,000 people by promising high returns from investments in virtual assets. Targeting mostly middle-aged and older people, it promised 20x returns and encouraged people to sell their apartments and take out loans to fund their investments.  The investment itself included 28 different tokens, six of which were created by the group. The remaining 22 had low trading volumes and were determined to have little value.  Twelve of those arrested remain in detention, including the YouTuber, who also headed the consulting firm. He initially fled South Korea to Australia via Hong Kong and Singapore.

42435389,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAmQ,1731487500,Ethereum Developer Consensys Plots Token Issuance in Sign of Trump Thaw,"Consensys, a leading Ethereum development firm, is ready to release a token for Linea, its layer-2 blockchain network.  The plan comes after Donald Trump's reelection has lifted a regulatory ""cloud"" over blockchain companies in the U.S.  LINEA will be issued as rewards to active contributors and users of the rollup network, sometime in Q1.  Linea, the rollup blockchain built by Ethereum development firm Consensys, is on the brink of releasing its ""LINEA"" token, the company told CoinDesk.  Consensys was founded by Joe Lubin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, and is today best-known as the company behind MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum wallet. The Linea network was released last year and represents Consensys' attempt to compete with a growing fray of layer-2 networks — blockchains that help scale Ethereum by offering users an extra lane for transacting more quickly and cheaply.  According to Texas-based Consensys, the LINEA token will be issued as rewards to active contributors to, and users of, the Linea network. The exact distribution criteria and timeline have yet to be disclosed, but Consensys said it expects to release LINEA sometime in the first quarter of next year.  Ethereum's layer-2 ecosystem has flourished over the past two years, with networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Base gradually outpacing the main Ethereum chain in terms of overall transaction volume.  Linea sought to differentiate itself from many early rollup networks by centering itself around zero-knowledge technology—a kind of cryptography that Ethereum developers expect to eventually become the dominant method for scaling the network. But its lack of a token has long been viewed as a disadvantage, as most other layer-2 platforms dangled the prospect of tokens in part as a way to attract users.  Regulatory 'cloud' lifted  The LINEA announcement comes just after Donald Trump's re-election to the U.S. presidency. Consensys was one of the most closely watched U.S.-based blockchain companies during the Biden administration's crackdown on the industry.  MetaMask is nearly ubiquitous among Ethereum users, and some feared that position would make Consensys a target of anti-crypto regulators looking for potential points of network centralization.  The incoming administration is widely expected to take a more favorable view of the crypto industry. Several teams at Ethereum's Devcon conference in Bangkok, where Consensys unveiled its plans for LINEA, told CoinDesk they were optimistic a second Trump administration would foster a friendlier environment for issuing tokens.  Lubin said the election did not play a role in Consensys' decision to finally announce LINEA, but he acknowledged that ""we've been operating under a cloud of uncertainty for a long time.""  ""To the extent that we were concerned that the SEC would come after us, years ago we stopped doing tokenizations,"" said Lubin.  An association and a DAO  The token marks a major step toward decentralizing the Linea ecosystem. It comes months after Consensys made a similar move to decentralize core components of its widely-used Infura data platform.  Along with the LINEA token, Consensys has announced the formation of the Linea Association, a non-profit tasked with distributing the token and stewarding development of the Linea protocol.  Furthermore, ""there'll be a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] and probably sub-DAOs to organize the work,"" Lubin told CoinDesk. ""It'll be lots and lots of tokens, a high percentage of tokens, dedicated to the community."" Lubin would not specify how many tokens will be distributed to Linea's community or to other network stakeholders.  The DAO will eventually be able to award token grants to Linea contributors. ""As people land new innovations for Linea, land products and users and TVL [total value locked] on Linea, there will be programs to award those,"" said Lubin.  Avoiding 'sybil' attacks  While tokens have proven a reliable recruitment tool, they haven't always proven durable in the long run. Months after their public debuts, most of the tokens linked to Linea's layer-2 competitors have fallen sharply below their initial price levels.  Lubin said he is convinced that LINEA will fare more favorably than similar Layer-2 tokens. In part, this comes down to Linea's user-attestation system, which was designed to suss out individual humans to prevent any single person from spoofing the network across multiple different accounts, thereby accruing tokens to each of them via so-called ""sybil"" attacks.  ""When we introduced Linea, very early on we introduced proof of humanity, and we put it as a main element of our point system,"" said Nicolas Liochon, the head of Linea at Consensys. ""Points"" refers to the internal scores that Linea uses to track who should receive LINEA tokens.  Other tokens have ""allocated tokens to many Sybils who had no interest in being productive members of the ecosystem and dumped tokens,"" said Lubin. ""We believe we've taken effective and prudent steps to drastically minimize the number of Sybils that will receive LINEA.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/13/ethereum-developer-consensys-plots-token-issuance-in-sign-of-trump-thaw,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f3fb73348fe1ac7e0117c7ef400c3875221209c-8114x4565.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As this milestone was crossed, a notable trend emerged with short-term holders transferring their holdings to major exchanges, particularly Binance. According to CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson, this behavior suggests that investors with shorter time horizons may be positioning themselves to take profits, leading to potential selling pressure in the market. What To Watch Out For Wedson highlighted that the concentration of Bitcoin deposits to a single exchange like Binance is worth close monitoring, as it could impact liquidity and price stability on the platform, potentially reverberating through the broader market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Now Overheating? Key Metrics Reveal Crucial Insights For Investors The CryptoQuant analyst emphasized three areas for market participants to watch closely. First, tracking the flow of BTC to exchanges, especially Binance, can provide insights into the potential scale of selling intent among short-term holders. As more coins flow to a major exchange, the potential for market impact rises, making it crucial to gauge the extent of any impending sell-off. Second, the impact on price volatility is expected to be significant as concentrated selling or profit-taking on Binance could create sharp movements, providing both challenges and opportunities for traders. The final area of focus, according to Wedson, is anticipating potential price movements based on these inflows and understanding how they may influence the broader market’s behavior. Bitcoin Market Correction Imminent? Meanwhile, further insights were provided by another CryptoQuant analyst known as “caueconomy.” This analyst pointed out that Bitcoin’s breakout of its previous all-time high has initiated a price discovery process. With this milestone, the market has seen heightened open interest levels, with more than $16 billion added to futures positions over the past week. This surge indicates a rise in leveraged positions, which can lead to heightened risk of corrections in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buying Pressure Rises, But Here’s Why A Pullback Could Be Coming However, the analyst emphasized that the market’s underlying fundamentals appear much more strong this time around, suggesting that any potential short-term corrections could be viewed as natural adjustments. Rather than signalling a broader downturn, these corrections may offer buying opportunities for investors looking to enter or accumulate during periods of market pullback. Bitcoin trades for $86,441, which has increased by 2.3% in the past day. Notably, this current trading price marks a 3.6% decline from BTC’s latest achieved all-time high of $89,864 earlier today. According to renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X, key support levels for Bitcoin to watch are between $83,250 – $85,800 and $72,880 – $75,520.

Announced shortly after Trump’s reelection, D.O.G.E. is expected to be a transformative project, with a mission to streamline federal operations, dubbed by Trump as “potentially the Manhattan Project of our time .” Trump shared this plan on Truth Social, highlighting that D.O.G.E. will spearhead the “Save America Movement” to tackle the $6.5 trillion in government expenditures. He expressed that Musk and Ramaswamy would work toward creating “a smaller government with more efficiency and less bureaucracy” by July 4, 2026, aligning with the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Musk, known for his criticisms of bureaucratic inefficiency, eagerly supported the announcement, adding that the initiative would be a shock to “those involved in Government waste.” Reposting Trump’s message on X (formerly Twitter), Musk emphasized his opposition to bureaucracy with comments like, “Threat to democracy? Nope, a threat to BUREAUCRACY!” The acronym D.O.G.E. resonated with fans of Dogecoin, the popular meme-based cryptocurrency often linked to Musk. Dogecoin’s ( DOGE ) value saw a 10% increase following Musk’s appointment, as speculation grew that he might integrate cryptocurrency into government projects or his business ventures. This speculation gained traction, especially after Musk hinted at reintroducing Dogecoin as a payment option for Tesla merchandise. Ramaswamy, a former presidential contender, also voiced strong support for the project. He announced on X that he would withdraw from the Ohio Senate race to fully commit to D.O.G.E., allowing Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to appoint a successor to the Senate seat soon to be vacated by Vice President-elect J.D. Vance. Despite the positive response, some analysts and officials voiced concerns. Economist Peter Schiff, a known Bitcoin skeptic, warned about potential limitations on D.O.G.E.’s mandate, reminding Musk and Ramaswamy that closing federal departments would still require Congressional approval. Schiff referenced previous efforts, such as Ronald Reagan’s unsuccessful attempts to eliminate the Department of Education, as examples of how challenging it can be to implement structural changes. While Musk’s involvement in D.O.G.E. has ignited interest in Dogecoin, some analysts remain cautious. They point out that while Musk’s engagement often boosts short-term enthusiasm for the currency, long-term stability depends on actual economic applications. For now, however, Trump’s announcement has put D.O.G.E.—both the agency and the cryptocurrency—in the spotlight.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/elon-musk-to-lead-trump-s-new-government-efficiency-dept-d-o-g-e-,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36223125.jpeg

WLTC will maintain a 1:1 peg to Litecoin, ensuring seamless transactions for users between the two protocols. Coinut’s CEO, Xinxi Wang, emphasized that the trusted Litecoin ecosystem will now be connected to Ethereum’s broader range of services, opening new doors for Litecoin users. Despite the potential of this collaboration, Litecoin’s price dipped after the announcement, sparking questions about the popularity and demand for wrapped tokens, as token wrapping saw a decline in 2024. Although token wrapping had surged in early 2023 with wrapped ETH, its use has since diminished. However, Litecoin, as one of the longest-standing altcoins, may help bring attention back to wrapped tokens with this new offering. The purpose of WLTC is to bridge the Ethereum and Litecoin networks, allowing Litecoin users access to Ethereum’s DeFi and dApp capabilities. WLTC holders can participate in Ethereum’s decentralized exchanges, increasing liquidity and the range of potential applications. Through WLTC, Litecoin users can engage with specialized features of Ethereum , including smart contracts and ERC20-based services, such as staking, yield farming, and borrowing. This is a significant enhancement, as Litecoin’s blockchain does not support these types of applications natively. To secure this initiative, Coinut has partnered with Coinbase for cold storage solutions and Fireblocks for hot wallet infrastructure, ensuring that WLTC tokens have robust security. While WLTC presents promising opportunities, the real test will be user adoption, as demand for wrapped tokens has recently waned. The long-term success of WLTC could reflect whether token wrapping remains relevant in the market or if interest continues to decline.",POSITIVE,ETH | LTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | LTC,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/litecoin-launches-wrapped-token-on-ethereum-for-new-features,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36222695.jpeg

Thị trường phấn khích đến mức giá BTC phi như tên lửa – tăng vọt 23% so với lúc rơi tự do trước bầu cử. Tiền đổ vào ETF như nước vỡ bờ với 2,28 tỷ USD chỉ trong ba ngày – một kỷ lục không tưởng! Riêng ông lớn BlackRock đã hút về 1,1 tỷ USD qua ETF IBIT, xóa sạch làn sóng rút vốn trước đó. Đây quả là một cú lột xác đáng kinh ngạc – lực mua mạnh đến mức “ nuốt chửng ” mọi áp lực bán, kể cả ở mức đỉnh cao nhất lịch sử. Chỉ số giao dịch tổng hợp cho thấy các đại gia đang mua vào rầm rộ sau bầu cử. Thị trường hợp đồng tương lai cũng nóng hơn với khối lượng kỷ lục 45,43 tỷ USD, nhưng vẫn giữ được sự cân bằng ở mức cao mới này. Thú vị là đợt chốt lời lần này “ khá hiền ” so với cơn sốt tháng 3 (khi lợi nhuận đạt 3,1 tỷ USD). Có vẻ như thị trường đã trưởng thành hơn và biết điều chỉnh kỳ vọng cho hợp lý. Dù đà tăng đang hứa hẹn, vùng 82.000-85.000 USD có thể sẽ là ải khó nhằn. Nhiều khả năng Bitcoin sẽ cần nghỉ ngơi một chút hoặc giảm về mức 77.000 USD để thu hẹp khoảng cách CME trước khi tiếp tục chinh phục đỉnh cao. Nhưng với nền tảng vững chắc từ các nhà đầu tư theo tổ chức, Bitcoin đang có bệ phóng cực kỳ tốt để “khai phá vùng đất mới”! Kinh tế Mỹ đang làm mưa làm gió với niềm tin tiêu dùng cao ngất, tăng trưởng ổn định như đinh đóng cột và lạm phát đang hạ nhiệt dần. Sau chiến thắng của Trump, thị trường đang phấn khởi tột độ với kỳ vọng về các chính sách phi thường như cắt giảm thuế và các quy định. Tuy nhiên, cũng cần đề phòng rủi ro lạm phát, đặc biệt là nếu thuế quan và các quy định nhập cư chặt chẽ hơn được ban hành, có khả năng làm tăng giá cả và chi phí tiền lương. Cục Dự trữ Liên bang vừa nhẹ tay giảm lãi suất 0.25%, trong bối cảnh năng suất tươi tốt và thị trường lao động vững vàng – cho thấy niềm tin vào tăng trưởng bền vững. Tuy nhiên, Fed đang thận trọng từng li từng tí về việc giảm lãi suất thêm và muốn chờ tín hiệu tài chính rõ ràng hơn trước khi có động thái mới. Tâm lý người tiêu dùng cũng đạt mức cao nhất kể từ tháng 4, được thúc đẩy bởi giá xăng giảm và lo ngại về lạm phát ngắn hạn giảm bớt. Sự lạc quan này hỗ trợ chi tiêu của người tiêu dùng, cho thấy hiệu suất kinh tế mạnh mẽ trong những tháng tới. Tuy vậy, rủi ro lạm phát và chính sách không chắc chắn vẫn là những ẩn số, khiến đây trở thành giai đoạn lạc quan về mặt kinh tế nhưng vẫn nên thận trọng. Đối với crypto, chiến thắng của Trump là “ phép màu ” đích thực, khiến Bitcoin tăng vọt và các cổ phiếu crypto lên như diều gặp gió giữa hy vọng về quy định lỏng lẻo hơn và khả năng có quỹ dự trữ Bitcoin quốc gia! Tuần này, Tether đã mở rộng quy mô khi tài trợ thành công thương vụ dầu thô 45 triệu USD ở Trung Đông – chính thức đặt chân vào thị trường hàng hóa! Thông qua bộ phận Tài trợ thương mại mới, Tether đang định vị USDt như một công cụ chuyển đổi cho hoạt động thương mại toàn cầu nhanh hơn, tiết kiệm chi phí hơn, với tham vọng mở rộng sang nhiều lĩnh vực khác ngoài năng lượng. Về mặt quy định, SEC lại trì hoãn quyết định ETF Ethereum sang sân khác, viện cớ lo ngại về bảo vệ nhà đầu tư và ổn định thị trường. Dù ETF Ethereum đã gây sốt từ tháng 7, có vẻ như các cảnh sát tài chính vẫn muốn theo dõi thị trường kỹ càng hơn. Và đó là tóm tắt từ Bitfinex Alpha 130. Chúc các trader một tuần giao dịch bùng nổ!

The price differential is still noticeably lower than the previous bull market peaks.  When it comes to trading alternative cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin {{DOGE}}, South Korea, known as the ""Land of the Morning Calm,"" is often in stark contrast to its tranquil image.  Today is just that day as Koreans seem to be jumping into the DOGE market, driving prices higher and creating a noticeable premium on local exchanges Upbit and Bithumb relative to global giant Binance.  At press time, Upbit and Bithumb's DOGE/KRW pairs, adjusted for the USD/KRW exchange trade, traded 1.5% higher than Binance's DOGE/USDT, drawing the largest premium in three months, according to data source TradingView.  Premiums reflect renewed Korean appetite for DOGE, which has surged 78% since pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election a week ago.  Trading volume data suggests the same. According to 10x Research, DOGE has topped the charts as the cryptocurrency with the highest trading volume on Upbit and Bithumb since Trump's victory. The latest 24-hour trading volume for DOGE pairs tallies a remarkable $8 billion, equivalent to 57% of the total market capitalization of all stocks in Korea, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research said in a note to clients Wednesday.  DOGE has gained 227% in 30 days amid long-time crypto fan and billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's plans to start the ""Department of Government Efficiency, a new wing in the Trump administration, abbreviated as D.O.G.E in a homage to the meme cryptocurrency.  On Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the D.O.G.E department.  A spike in Korean demand is typically associated with speculative fervor, often seen at market peaks. However, current premiums on local exchanges are noticeably lower than the highs recorded in March and are significantly less than the double-digit price differentials observed in early 2021.  So, there is excitement, but without the speculative frenzy observed at the bull market peaks and other things being equal, prices may continue to rise.  Options traders bet on the $1 breakout  Options activity on PowerTrade, a crypto exchange focused on derivatives tied to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), points to expectations of DOGE's price topping the $1 mark by the end of January.  ""A client has bought 10K DOGE call options at the $1 strike expiring on Jan. 25 for $0.058 per contract,"" PowerTrade told CoinDesk Tuesday, explaining a similar outsized bet in the December expiry options.

36220908,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-s-return-sparks-bitcoin-boom,1731479654,Trump's Return Sparks Bitcoin Boom,"The recent U.S. presidential election, which saw Donald Trump return to office , has sparked a fresh wave of optimism for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the wider cryptocurrency market. Throughout Bitcoin’s history, each U.S. election has typically been followed by an upward trend in its value, and the 2024 election has continued this pattern. The election outcome has reinforced Bitcoin’s position as a resilient digital asset, with its price experiencing a notable increase soon after the results were announced. Trump's return to the Oval Office has had a powerful influence on the crypto market, largely due to his administration’s supportive stance toward Bitcoin. Trump has hinted at his vision to make the U.S. a ""Bitcoin superpower,"" indicating a willingness to back Bitcoin growth and position the U.S. as a global leader in the cryptocurrency sector. This supportive outlook from one of the world's largest economies is strengthening Bitcoin’s appeal and helping drive a new era of investment and interest in the digital asset. The renewed confidence in Bitcoin is also reflected in the significant inflow of capital into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has boosted its market capitalization and underscored its growing role in the financial system. This investment trend demonstrates the increased level of institutional interest, supported by Trump’s administration, in a market that was once viewed with skepticism. Beyond the U.S., other nations are taking note, with countries like Bhutan increasing their involvement in Bitcoin investments, showing that Bitcoin's growth isn’t limited to domestic U.S. policies. This global interest mirrors Bitcoin’s transformation into a versatile asset that appeals to a variety of investors and holds potential for long-term economic growth. With Trump's administration in place, there is a growing sense of anticipation for policies that could further integrate Bitcoin into the mainstream financial system. Potential regulatory frameworks and infrastructure developments may emerge, paving the way for more government participation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In summary, Trump’s return has invigorated the crypto market, positioning Bitcoin as a strong asset for investors worldwide. This election result has catalyzed a renewed sense of confidence in Bitcoin, with both retail and institutional investors viewing it as a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. As Trump’s administration embraces Bitcoin, it seems poised to begin a new chapter as a prominent global financial asset.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-s-return-sparks-bitcoin-boom,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36220908.jpeg

42435375,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAdO,1731479527,Dogecoin Trade Goes From Meme to Reality as Donald Trump Confirms D.O.G.E,"President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).  Musk mentioned creating a leaderboard for the most inefficient government spending, blending transparency with public engagement.  The announcement and the use of ""DOGE"" have significantly boosted dogecoin’s memetic fundamentals, with traders setting a long-term target of $1.  A frenzied narrative that boosted dogecoin (DOGE) prices over 500% turned to reality on Tuesday — showcasing how memetic bets could be a strong trading thesis.  President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that it had picked Vivek Ramaswamy and technology entrepreneur Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that seeks to make government spending and administration more efficient.  The duo will work from outside the government to offer advice and guidance to drive large-scale structural reform and create an “entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.”  ""Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies -- essential to the 'save America' movement,” Trump said in the announcement posted on his Truth Social account.  Musk and Ramaswamy will work until July 4, 2026, on the project, Trump said.  In an X post, Musk said that all Department of Government Efficiency actions will be posted online for maximum transparency.  “Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know,” Musk said. “We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining.”  A CoinDesk analysis flagged in mid-October about DOGE trade gaining interest among investors for its memetic nature, and that there could be more chatter of “DOGE” in mainstream media and retail trading circles that fuels attention and interest in the token.  DOGE prices are up nearly 250% in the past 30 days, reaching 2021 levels on Tuesday with traders now eyeing the $1 mark as a long-term price target.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/13/dogecoin-trade-goes-from-meme-to-reality-as-donald-trump-confirms-doge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80e28bdbde93eb04a189445179235a8638d6493d-4000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36220707,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652775,1731479453,Market ‘Pricing In A Higher Fair Value’ For Bitcoin As Price Discovery Continues,"Bitcoin (BTC) has performed remarkably over the past week, surging 30% since the November 5 US election. The flagship crypto surpassed its March all-time high (ATH), recording a new high nearly every day for the last seven days. Bitfinex analysts noted that the market remains “relatively stable” despite increased speculative activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Closing In On $80,000 For Record-Breaking Run After Trump Win Bitcoin ‘Fair Value’ Priced In At Higher Levels Following Donald Trump’s victory last Tuesday, the crypto market has seen a massive rally, surging to a market capitalization of $3.05 trillion. Bitcoin has led the post-election bullish run with a 30% price increase, nearing the $90,000 mark earlier today. According to Bitfinex Alpha report, the rally “highlights the positive reaction to the election outcome, with investors positioning themselves for potential economic stimulus and regulatory shifts.” During the March highs, BTC’s realized profit volume reached its peak of $3.1 billion. Since then, realized profit volumes have gradually decreased, “reaching an equilibrium.” As the report noted, there’s been a reset in supply and demand forces, which indicates, alongside the recent price surge, that “the market is now pricing in a higher ‘fair value’ for Bitcoin.” At the same time, the cryptocurrency continues its price discovery. Moreover, profit-taking above $70,000 has been significantly smaller than the past instances when Bitcoin traded above this range, despite a structural increase in profit-taking. Bitfinex analysts consider this to signal the “entry of a new wave of demand into the market,” backed up by Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) buying post-elections. Additionally, it suggests that fresh investor interest “could drive further upward momentum in the near term.” BTC Enters ‘A New Phase’ The report highlighted record-breaking BTC ETFs’ inflows, around $2.28 billion in three days. This performance represented a significant increase from the pre-election de-risking, which saw the crypto-based investment products record their second-largest single-day outflows. According to CoinShares data, Bitcoin ETFs closed the US election week with $1.8 billion in inflows and started this week with $1.1 billion in positive net flow. This performance displays a resurgence in demand for the flagship crypto as the market adjusts to BTC’s new price levels. Bitfinex analysts explained that from March to August, there was significant supply and insufficient sustained buying pressure to absorb it. The recent demand surge suggests a notable shift as buying interest is “absorbing selling pressure at all-time highs and stabilizing market dynamics: Now we appear to be entering into a new phase where the volume of profit-taking when BTC hits an all-time high is notably lower, given the amount of fresh demand entering the market post-election. This demand is helping to absorb the minor selling pressure still present, suggesting a healthier market environment and potential for further upward movement. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Records 3-Year High As Price Hits $220, Is $260 Next? Meanwhile, Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin futures and perpetual contracts reached ATH, hitting $45.43 billion. The report explains that this signals an increase in speculative activity but details that the market remains “relatively stable” since OI and BTC prices “are in equilibrium at elevated levels.” Ultimately, Bitfinex anticipates some consolidation soon, with a potential pullback to $77,000. A correction toward this level would close BTC’s CME gap and strengthen Bitcoin’s position to climb even higher levels. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $86,225, a 5% increase in the daily timeframe.

42435369,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kpAXy,1731474060,Ethereum Pioneer's New 'Time Machine' Makes Transactions Conditional on Future Events,"Ethereum, a paramount blockchain due to its programmability and sprawling ecosystem of layer-2 networks, is getting a new dimension: time.  Smart Transactions (STXN), a new project from Vlad Zamfir, who pioneered Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain system, released on Wednesday a platform that will enable applications to execute transactions based on future events.  The new platform, called the “Ethereum time machine,” extends the blockchain's programming capabilities by allowing smart contracts to execute transactions based on uncertain or not-guaranteed future events.  “For example, a user could stipulate that a trade execute at a specified day and time conditional on a set of prerequisites,” the STXN team wrote in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “These prerequisites could be absolute, such as the dollar value of a particular asset, or relative – for instance, whether one asset is worth more than another. The potential permutations are almost unlimited, greatly increasing the dynamism of the largest blockchain for developers.”  The release comes after STXN announced in July that it would collaborate with Consensys, a major Ethereum development firm, on research that complements Smart Transactions — a feature enabled by Consensys’ Metamask wallets.  “STXN is like a time machine because it allows us to guarantee the future when it comes to smart contracts,” STXN co-founder Anuj Das Gupta said in the press release. “It allows us to travel backward in time as well, in the sense that Ethereum smart contracts are no longer limited by what was known at the time they were written. We believe this is an important solution to the tension between flexibility and immutability when it comes to blockchains.”  Read more: Popular Crypto Wallet MetaMask Rolls Out 'Smart Transactions' to Combat Ethereum Front-Running",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | WALLET | RESEARCH,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/13/ethereum-pioneers-new-time-machine-makes-transactions-conditional-on-future-events,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f86dd62cf01dc2b6fafe8852ddfc801e378f9d4-1480x833.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36217086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652741,1731474055,Dogecoin Could Target $2.4 If Price Aligns With Macro Pattern – Details,"Dogecoin has skyrocketed over 200% in less than three weeks, riding the wave of Bitcoin’s recent record-breaking rally. As BTC surged to new all-time highs, the momentum carried over to altcoins, with Dogecoin leading the pack in aggressive gains. This historic price surge has captured the attention of traders and analysts alike, sparking excitement for DOGE’s future potential in this bullish market phase. Renowned crypto analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Dogecoin’s upward trajectory, setting bold targets that have left the community buzzing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals Bulls Are Growing But Still Behind March 2024 Peak – Details According to Martinez, if DOGE continues to align with its current macro trend channel, it could reach an impressive $2.4 price target soon. Furthermore, Martinez notes that, under certain conditions, Dogecoin could aim as high as $18 should broader market dynamics and macro support levels remain favorable. With DOGE’s explosive growth and heightened investor interest, these next few weeks will be critical. If market conditions persist and BTC’s bullish trend holds, Dogecoin may continue its path upward, pushing into levels previously considered out of reach. Dogecoin Leading The Memecoin Dogecoin has taken the lead in the meme coin market, surging massively over the past few weeks and drawing attention from investors and analysts alike. With renewed momentum, DOGE has started an uptrend, forming a solid bullish structure that suggests further upside. Many analysts now see Dogecoin as a high-potential asset in the current market cycle, especially as broader sentiment remains positive across major cryptocurrencies. Ali Martinez, a well-regarded crypto analyst and investor, recently shared a technical analysis on X highlighting Dogecoin’s impressive setup within a macro channel. According to Martinez, if DOGE tests the middle or upper boundary of this long-term channel, it could potentially reach ambitious price targets of $2.40 or even $18. Martinez’s optimistic analysis aligns with the broader market view that DOGE, a well-established coin with a strong community and historical price resilience, is primed for significant growth. His analysis underscores the potential for this rally to continue in a major way, especially if BTC maintains its bullish trajectory, supporting altcoin momentum. For investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities, DOGE stands out as a viable option with a potentially huge upside. Related Reading: Cardano Skyrockets Over 40% – Funding Rate Suggests Further Upside As market participants closely watch for a potential test of these channel boundaries, Dogecoin’s current rally could signal the beginning of a transformative bull run, rewarding those strategically positioned themselves. While volatility is likely, the opportunity for massive gains could attract both retail and institutional interest, setting Dogecoin up as a leading player in this bull market. DOGE Hits Multi-Year Highs Dogecoin has reached a price level not seen since May 2021, breaking several local highs established over the past three and a half years. The recent rally took DOGE to a peak of $0.43, marking a substantial recovery and signaling bullish strength in the meme coin market. After two intense weeks of buying pressure, the price has slightly cooled and is now trading around $0.382, suggesting some consolidation may be underway. A deeper retracement to the $0.34 level would provide a healthy setup, allowing the previous supply zone to flip into a new demand zone, supporting sustained upward movement. Such a pullback would likely appeal to investors looking for re-entry opportunities at a support level before the next bullish leg.

However, with strong price action in play, a continued move toward the next major resistance at $0.45 remains a realistic scenario.

The price tested the $0.740 zone and is currently correcting gains. XRP price started a decent increase above the $0.620 resistance. The price is now trading above $0.6250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.6180 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $0.6200 support zone. XRP Price Eyes More Upsides XRP price remained supported above the $0.5850 level. It formed a base and started a fresh increase above $0.6000. It outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past two sessions, with a move above the $0.650 resistance. The price even climbed above the $0.70 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $0.740 before there was a pullback. It dipped below $0.7200 and tested $0.700. The price traded toward the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6063 swing low to the $0.7400 high. The price is now trading above $0.6250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.6180 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6063 swing low to the $0.7400 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.700 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.7080 level. The next key resistance could be $0.7250. A clear move above the $0.7250 resistance might send the price toward the $0.740 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.7550 resistance or even $0.7650 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.780. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.7080 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.6750 level. The next major support is near the $0.6250 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.6250 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.6050 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.600 zone.

The price is trading above $3,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The pair could continue to rise if it remains stable above the $3,150 zone. Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $3,000 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH was able to climb above the $3,120 and $3,120 resistance levels to move further into a positive zone. It even surged above the $3,350 level and traded to a new monthly high. A high was formed at $3,443 before there was a minor pullback. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,070 swing low to the $3,443 high.

The first major resistance is near the $3,400 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,450. A clear move above the $3,450 resistance might send the price toward the $3,580 resistance. An upside break above the $3,580 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,320 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,250 level and the trend line.

36213328,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652784,1731468620,Ethereum’s Positive Funding Rates Push Price Near $4K—Are There Any Downsides?,"Ethereum has recently climbed to a major high above $3,400, reigniting enthusiasm among market participants and signaling a potential upward trend that may lead to a push above $4,000 toward a new all-time high. This optimism has been met with major speculation of ETH’s price from the crypto community and analysts, who are observing key indicators within the market to assess the asset’s trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Volume Hits $60 Billion As ETH Aims For Yearly Highs Ethereum Rise and Market Sentiment According to a report shared by a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘ShayanBTC,’ Ethereum’s recent price performance, up by 35% in the past week, has been accompanied by positive sentiment in the futures market, providing a detailed look into potential short-term fluctuations. Shayan pointed out that the funding rates for Ethereum futures have remained positive, demonstrating strong demand and bullish sentiment among investors. Notably, positive funding rates typically indicate buyers are willing to pay a premium to hold long positions, which signifies market confidence. The analyst highlighted that this surge in positive sentiment was especially evident when Ethereum surpassed the $3,000 mark, reflecting a similar pattern observed during the March 2024 rally that culminated in a yearly peak. This pattern now raises questions about whether the current momentum can be sustained or if the market is vulnerable to sudden reversals, just as it did following a major rally earlier this year. What Is Expected While positive funding rates are a favorable sign of market interest, they can also indicate heightened risk when they become too elevated. Shayan particularly noted: Although positive funding rates generally signify healthy demand in a bullish market, elevated funding rates can be a red flag. The analyst cautioned that high funding rates may point to an “overheated” market, which could increase the likelihood of a long liquidation cascade if the price faces significant resistance or experiences even a modest correction. Elevated rates suggest that traders may be over-leveraged, creating conditions where a sharp pullback could trigger a wave of sell-offs as leveraged positions are liquidated. The CryptoQuant analyst further revealed that with Ethereum experiencing high funding rates in the current market climate, investors may need to “exercise caution and adopt strategies to mitigate potential risks.” Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up The analyst emphasized that with heightened funding rates comes an increased chance of market volatility. Rapid price movements could lead to liquidations, particularly if profit-taking or minor corrections unsettle the market. Meanwhile, Ethereum has breached the $3,400 price mark to trade as high as $3,424 earlier today. However, at the time of writing, the asset appears to have seen a slight correction with a current trading price of $3,289, albeit still up by 2.2% in the past day.

The 2020 election caused another upward spike which resulted in the altcoin increasing by 170% within the span of one month. There was also a liquidity crunch in December for the cryptocurrency market however this was occasioned by the contrary ruling from the SEC against Ripple Labs. In light of the ongoing litigation, the election rally evokes interest because it proposes that such increases could be achieved in 2024. Given the current bullish sentiment in the market, Mikkybull believes that another rally is almost imminent. Positive Technical Indicators At present, XRP is trading at approximately $0.6393 and is encountering a resistance level at $0.6533. The prospective path to the next target at $0.7463 is seen by analysts if it can overcome this barrier. Volume is increasing, and recent gains may provide the necessary impetus. RippleLord, a market expert, predicts that the price of XRP may even resume its 2017 highs if this rally continues. In 2017, XRP experienced a significant increase from $0.06 to nearly $3.84. RippleLord believes that XRP could at least reach a consolidation level of $3, with a longer-term peak potentially reaching $28 if market conditions coincide, despite the fact that repeating such a massive run may be ambitious.

Analysts also noted that as BTC’s price moves upward so does its daily trading volume increases with a current value of $133 billion. Bitcoin: The Domino Effect Analysts said that the positive sentiment on Bitcoin is also having a domino effect on the entire cryptocurrency sector. Its price surge is also pulling the price of other digital currencies worldwide.

BITO ETF tracks bitcoin via CME futures, but its structure leads to high dividends and lagging performance compared to spot bitcoin ETFs like IBIT. BITO's high monthly dividend impacts price performance, making it better suited for short-term options rather than long-term LEAPs. Despite its flaws, BITO is the only bitcoin ETF offering options, making it useful for conservative investors until other ETFs implement options. Thesis If an investor opened their trading screens today in the cryptocurrency sector, they might have had a bit of a shock: Bitcoin funds are up roughly +10% on the day, with other crypto names outperforming. While today's price action might remind some investors of 2021, the current bull run can go on longer than expected, with momentum a powerful factor to consider. While we are having a hard time valuing Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on traditional fundamental factors (i.e. cash flow, earnings, etc.), it has undoubtedly become an asset class that exhibits the same characteristics as other high beta investments. With momentum behind bitcoin, we are going to show investors why the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is an imperfect instrument to use when looking for capturing long-term spot moves in the cryptocurrency, and why the exchange-traded fund is better suited for option positions. BITO - a fund based on bitcoin futures BITO is an ETF which seeks to track the price of bitcoin: BITO seeks results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to the performance of bitcoin. BITO invests in bitcoin futures and does not invest in bitcoin. There is no guarantee the fund will closely track bitcoin returns. However, the fund takes a traditional capital markets approach and does not use crypto wallets, investing via CME listed bitcoin futures: Holdings (Fund website) As per the above table from the fund website, the name is currently holding the front month bitcoin futures. A large amount of the fund net cash is parked in T-Bills. Investing via futures has an expense aspect to it as well as the futures 'roll' effect. As we will notice in the next section, BITO lags outright bitcoin funds when looked at on a year to date basis due to these factors. Year to date performance highlights the problems with BITO Although bitcoin is up over 76% for the year, BITO is lagging: Bitcoin funds Total Returns (Seeking Alpha) We are using the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) as a comparison and a graph start date of January 15, 2024, to account for the IBIT start date. Also, kindly note, we are using a total return graph above to account for BITO's high dividend. If we were using just a price graph, it would look like this: Price move (Seeking Alpha) BITO tends to distribute all its gains via a high dividend yield, whereas IBIT tracks the bitcoin price and thus provides for capital gains. High dividend distribution Due to the ETF structure that uses futures rather than spot Bitcoin, BITO distributes a very high monthly dividend: Dividends (Seeking Alpha) Most of the fund gains actually come via the dividend distribution rather than capital gains. This is very important for investors who look at tax implications and choosing an asset class which appreciates in value versus one that offers a high distribution. Furthermore, when structuring options, it is important to understand the price implications for a high distribution. An option is the right to purchase BITO at a later date at a certain price. When a fund has a high distribution, in effect, it undercuts the price performance. Although bitcoin is up significantly for the year, BITO is roughly flat. When structuring options and their price, an investor needs to factor in the high distribution. In effect, from a price perspective, BITO is a series of 1-month options. If an investor buys a long-dated option here, they run the risk of small returns even if bitcoin moves higher, due to the distributive nature of the fund. As we can see from the above table, the ETF pays out every month, at the beginning of the month. From October 1, 2024, to November 1, 2024, the BITO price was the result of the intra-period move in the cryptocurrency. Post the distribution, the price went down. Thus, the structure favors shorter dated options. Are there options on other bitcoin ETFs? Not yet. What sets BITO apart though is the access it offers to options . As per the Seeking Alpha platform page, we can see that an investor can easily trade options on BITO, thus gaining access to using options on the underlying asset class. Options are favored by many when it comes to bitcoin due to the large moves observed historically for this asset class. Conservative investors can also limit the damage to their accounts when drawdowns occur via options (as a reminder, a bought call has the paid premium as the maximum downside). Ideally, an investor should have access to options on IBIT or the other spot bitcoin ETFs. While the SEC has now approved the move, options have yet to be implemented: Oct 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has granted ""accelerated approval"" to the New York Stock Exchange to list and trade options tied to three spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a regulatory filing. Therefore, as of today, investors are still reliant on BITO and its structure in order to utilize options. Despite the above-mentioned structuring issues, BITO is still the only ETF that allows for the efficient use of options in order to take positions on bitcoin via a traditional brokerage account. Conclusion Bitcoin is now an established asset class with a very volatile return profile. The BITO ETF seeks to track bitcoin's performance via CME listed futures, but represents an imperfect way to track the asset class. Due to tax implications and its structure, BITO pays out a very high monthly dividend yield, thus disbursing gains via its dividends rather than capital appreciation. Furthermore, due to the fund's high expense ratio of 0.95% and the 'roll' effect present for futures, BITO lags spot bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT (over 9% lag in 2024). The one feature that BITO has, but other bitcoin ETFs currently don't, is the ability to use options. Investors are able to use BITO call options to profit from bitcoin's appreciation, while waiting for the market implementation for other bitcoin ETFs after the SEC's approval. We are of the opinion that a retail investor looking to get outright bitcoin exposure for an extended period is better served by ETFs such as IBIT, whereas more conservative market players looking for bitcoin plays via options are correct in looking at BITO.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736616-bito-useful-for-bitcoin-options-better-alternatives-exist-for-spot?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36205247.jpeg
