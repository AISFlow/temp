42397575,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYjN,1397997027,"The CoinDesk Mining Roundup: Multipools, Doge on Amazon EC2 and 11GH/s USB Sticks","As the mining industry evolves, there are always new products and services hitting the market for enterprising cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. The competition between hardware manufacturers continues, with CoinTerra shipping its 5,000th unit and KnCMiner offering new incentives.  Before ASICs came along, issues of power and cooling were not as much of a priority. Now, even the new Radeon, the most powerful graphics card to date, is not the least bit exciting to those interested in mining.  But with data centres full of mining racks and malicious actors dropping cryptocurrency mining libraries into mobile malware, new and unexpected technological developments still crop up to make things interesting.  With that captivating information out of the way, here is what has been going on in mining since the last roundup.  KnCMiner updates  Stockholm, Sweden-based KnCMiner has recently announced a number of updates. The company's Titan scrypt miner is getting closer to launch, with the 28nm chip getting 300MH/s out of 800W of power. The Titan costs $9,995 and is expected to begin shipping Q2.  The company has also made public plans to sell a Titan Mini model with at least 150MH/s of performance for $5,495. The company has not yet specified the power consumption of the Titan Mini.  KnCMiner is also selling upgrade units for its November model of the Neptune bitcoin miner, which appears to be an additional ASIC card for $350. Also, the company plans to sell a third generation model of the Neptune in a month at 3TH/s for $5,995.  HashPlex opens first HashCenter  Seattle-base HashPlex, founded by veterans of Google, Microsoft and Facebook, has announced that it has opened its own data centre called the HashCenter. Calling on people to join them ""in the continuing fight to keep the hashing power of the bitcoin network distributed,"" HashPlex has a number of different options available.  Customers can utilize HashPlex's own mining gear, cloud-style, or mining gear can be sent to the company's data centre in the Seattle area – either mining units a customer already has or ones currently on order with mining manufacturers.  HashPlex's hosted pricing is based on kilowatts per month, and it has a listing at the bottom of its website of what typical mining equipment costs to be hosted in the HashCenter.  GHash.io multipool  BitFury ASIC mining pool Ghash.io has announced that is now offers Multi Pool Pro, a scrypt multipool functionality for members of the pool. That means Ghash.io's software is now configured to mine the best possible scrypt coin for users, whether that be litecoin, feathercoin, auroracoin or any other scrypt-based coin.  Multipools are controversial, and have the ability to weaken a coin by shifting computing power on a whim, and, recently, litecoin creator Charlie Lee proposed merged mining with dogecoin to create a stronger defence for the two coins against the threat of a 51% attack.  Multipools might be good for miners, but bad for the future of scrypt coins as ASIC miners arrive, having the potential to make them unstable. One solution would be to make sure that retargeting is happening, often, as in the case of dogecoin where it is now set to retarget at every block generation.  Hex-Fury USB miner  Think that USB miners are worthless? What if you put six BitFury chips on one USB dongle? The Hex-Fury USB miner can actually pump out 11GH/s per stick at approx. 0.86W – which means that if you are able to cobble together enough of them they may be a good low-power mining solution when paired with a Raspberry Pi host.  It may not be as efficient as using something more data centre-friendly, such as a blade miner. But the small form factor Hex-Fury, at $282 per unit, may allow for some unique configurations that could involve more unconventional mining setups.  If space is an issue, USB miners may still provide a way to custom build an ASIC rig. The Hex-Fury stick does have a heat sink on one side, but cooling will still be an issue to contend with.  Amazon bitcoin miners  Hackers don't seem to care that regular computing power is practically worthless for bitcoin mining. If they can find a way into a system, they might as well try anyway. The case of one developer getting a $5,300 bill from Amazon because of a compromised account trying to mine BTC proves that to the unscrupulous, it doesn't seem to matter.  Although the developer in this instance got a refund because his story was made public, Amazon has ""been seeing more and more of this"", the company said.  It's important, however, to remember that it still costs more to mine dogecoin on Amazon EC2http://grantammons.me/bitcoin/using-amazon-ec2-to-mine-dogecoin/ and that the value of coins produced will be worth current prices – so these types of activities may not be worth it.  Transaction fees vs electricity cost  Electricity is becoming the single most important variable when considering the costs associated with a bitcoin mining operation. When BTC prices are high, miners obviously make a better profit.  But a lower price of late has meant that power consumption is cutting into costs. Understanding these speculative aspects of the bitcoin price is important, because the prospects of long-term viability for mining may rest on whether BTC can become a currency that is popular for transactions.  Mining's future may end up being all about transaction fees versus electricity costs. If miners aren't able to reap transaction fees that disrupt the $1 trillion-plus in annual revenue that the global financial industry brings in, then it's all just a game of power usage versus speculative price.

42397564,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYaW,1397993107,Small Businesses Enjoy Success After Accepting Bitcoin,"As bitcoin continues to grow in popularity, small businesses around the world have begun accepting the digital currency as a method of payment.  Many of these businesses have seen only a very small portion of their customers pay with bitcoin, but that doesn’t necessarily make the venture into cryptocurrencies a failure.  Dr J Anthony Allen, CEO of the Minneapolis-based music production school Slam Academy, said bitcoin payments at his business have been “very successful,” yet Slam Academy has seen just one customer pay with the digital currency since Allen began accepting it in November of 2013.  With only one total sale it may be hard to see why Allen considers his foray into bitcoin a success, but the answer doesn’t actually lie in the money. Allen said:  “So only one sale, but the more important thing is the press we’ve received from [accepting bitcoin]. I hate to say that we started accepting it just to get press, but it’s turned out to be a great side effect of accepting bitcoin.”  Allen first began accepting the digital currency when he made a post on reddit in hopes of finding new ways to promote his business. A user suggested he accept bitcoin and another joked that he should accept McDonalds gift cards as well.  “It really got me thinking,” Allen said. “I thought, ‘They are both right, actually. I would totally accept McDonalds gift cards if I could pay my rent with them. I would accept just about anything if I can pay my rent with it. Who am I to turn a customer away no matter what they want to pay with?’ So I looked into bitcoin, and when I realized it wouldn’t be very hard at all to actually pay my rent with it, we implemented it into the site.”  New clientele  Other business owners have had experiences similar to Allen’s. Robert Hohne, owner of New Orleans general store Homestead, mentioned that accepting bitcoin has brought in customers who otherwise might not have shopped at his store.  “We’ve been fortunate to have met some great customers who only found us because we accept bitcoin, and have also sparked the interest of customers who come in and ask us what this bitcoin phenomenon is all about,” Hohne said.  Other than simply being a tool to bring in publicity, bitcoin provides other advantages for both businesses and their customers.  Nick Pappas, owner of the Flamestone American Grill in Oldsmar, Florida, began following bitcoin when it was valued at about $30. As he watched the value rise over time, he began to see how it could be incorporated into his restaurant. Pappas said:  “After doing some more research, I realized bitcoin was another option I could give my customers to be able to purchase gift cards from our website using it.”  “From a business standpoint, it cuts out the middle man and eliminates any transaction or credit card fees. Also, by accepting bitcoin we are the ones accepting the volatility and the risk, not my customers. That was important to me.”  Like Allen, both Pappas and Hohne have only had a handful of customers pay with bitcoin, but each mentioned that they think bitcoin payments will become more popular and widespread in the future as the general public becomes more educated about cryptocurrencies and their benefits.  “I think once people understand bitcoin better they will embrace it more,” Pappas said. “Let’s face it, this is something that has never been done before and it is difficult to comprehend how it works. Once people do start understanding, I think the popularity of it will boom.”  Mobile payment image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | RESEARCH,Austin Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/20/small-businesses-enjoy-success-after-accepting-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a67e2fb2970ab17476779f736279a7f69dc314e-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397574,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYiO,1397989457,"CeX, Drugs, and a Fond Farewell","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 20th April 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most thought-provoking and most controversial events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of scepticism and wonder.  John Law takes his leave, but not before compressing the entire week’s news.  After practically a year perched somewhat unsteadily at CoinDesk’s in-house bar – they like to keep it exclusive, but the absinthe cocktails are to die for – it’s time for John Law to move on. This is the last of these weekly columns.  So, let’s get the week’s news out of the way. What did we learn over the past seven days?  It’s good news if you want to turn your old mobile phone into a pile of top-quality skunk weed, a trick that until now was known only to the pick-pockets of the Holloway Road. Now you can do it yourself, and legally too: send your redundant device to the tech resellers at CeX, they’ll put it online, and when someone buys it they’ll pass you the proceeds in bitcoin. Then, take a plane to Colorado and give your bitcoin to ZaZZZ’s automatic dispenser of the chronic. Job done, entirely by computer. Truly, the future is here.  Alternatively, if you have a lot of old mobile phones and no particular fondness for exotic cheroots, then you can repeat the CeX trick until you have around $11 million and then buy a luxury yacht with it. To be honest, that’s the sort of daft trick only Silicon Valley billionaires or over-coked rock stars go for: nobody can say the luxury yacht business doesn’t know its customers.  What else? American finance officials warm to bitcoin while China continues to disapprove; there are new exchanges in the works; Mt. Gox is filing for liquidation; Nick Szabo has been unveiled as Satoshi Nakamoto – again, unless he isn’t – because he uses phrases like “trusted third parties” when writing about cryptography.  Amazon doesn’t want your bitcoin and Wikipedia’s still not sure; ATMs and ASIC miners are cool (figuratively, in the case of ASIC miners); online fraud is not; and while you still can’t buy sex with bitcoin one canny app developer cashed in when the price was over $1000 and wrote an iOS dating app – which is close enough, if you fancy Apple users. John Law has always found Android fans more open, more flexible and cheaper dates, and they come in an exotic variety of sizes, which keeps a chap interested. Although - of course - the risks of catching something nasty are somewhat higher. The price of freedom.  That’s pretty much it for the week, and the most surprising thing? There are no surprises. If you’ve been following along at home, you’ll have noticed that shock and awe is no longer the name of the game. There may be – will be – more stories about clever criminals doing bad things, but Silk Road’s demise has lanced the boil of OMG ANARCHY! that was still pustulating away in 2011. China has loved and lost, but bitcoin’s still here and more than twice the price it was a year ago. The starry-eyed are still gathering in San Francisco to urge each other on to ever greater feats of optimism.  Business, in short, is as usual. There is a usual now.  So: what next?  With your permission, distant reader, John Law would like to share what he’s going to be watching most closely for real surprises as bitcoin leaves its terrible twos and settles down as a more placid child of the 21st century.  1. Bitcoin will stop being virtual  You can’t miss the Internet of Things, where all our gizmos talk to each other – and to big data-driven companies and governments – to automate our physical environment. It won’t be long before our gadgets are making buying decisions on our behalf, and how will they swap value between themselves? Has to be bitcoin-like technologies.  And now there are ways for bitcoin to attach itself to anything digital through coloured coins, and anything physical can have a digital side built into it. Physical things will be able to carry their own guarantees of authenticity and ownership. No trusted third party required. Everything, in short, will stop being nickable and start to be tradeable with no paperwork. That’ll be a shock to the system.  2. Bitcoin will change the law more than the law will change bitcoin  If you’ve got a few minutes, go and look up the idea of polycentric law. Not exactly a new idea – and one that describes how law has worked many times in history. It simply says that you don’t need a monopoly of law. You can have many overlapping systems at once, and people can agree to use different law systems for different tasks.  They have to be largely compatible; they don’t have to be the same. So it’s possible, and John Law thinks likely, that people who use bitcoin will agree to behave to a different set of norms than they do with cash. The chances are high that this will be an international affair.  Rather more fancifully, it may yet foreshadow a greater move away from state-defined legislation towards a more devolved social contract; the Internet and ever-growing travel habits are mixing parts of society, mostly the young, across borders far more than ever before. In twenty years, they’ll be making decisions for us.  Things will change, and bitcoin will lead the way. The law will follow, not least because it’ll learn that bitcoin’s astonishing transparency will reveal ever-increasingly interesting things about what we’re all up to.  3. Bitcoin will die. Long live bitcoin!  We need a World Wide Web for the bitcoin idea, something that will do for it what the first Web servers and browsers did for the Internet. Before the Web, you could do almost the same stuff you can now – you could search, you could download, you could publish, you could email – but you had to be a right geek and none of the tools worked well together. They worked well enough to show what the Internet’s underlying technology could do, but you had to really want to use them.  Then came the Web and ker-pow! Convenience amplifies. Bitcoin may well evolve into something that feels natural and universal, but it doesn’t now and there may be a much better way of doing the same thing much, much better. Watch the altcoins.  John Law, being quite the geek himself, will also be following the development of the underlying technology: things need to be fixed in mining, in block chain management, in security and in distribution of resources. They will be fixed, but the details will be delicious.  He’ll also carry on learning how money works, which is a fascination he feels far more keenly now than when he started writing about that darn cryptocurrency thing. He warmly recommends you do, too, even if it’s just to be able to wow impressionable young things at parties when they ask “So, what is this bitcoin stuff anyway?”. And you thought fiat was a small Italian car.  Adieu, readers. Thanks for all the kind messages - and the nasty ones, which were most amusing. A year in bitcoin is like seven in any other Internet technology, and given that a year in Internet technology is like seven in the real world, that makes a year writing about bitcoin roughly equivalent to 49 on the calendar. That’s practically a career’s worth. Hard work. No wonder John Law feels quite so thirsty.  Oh, OK then. One for the road.  Cheers!
