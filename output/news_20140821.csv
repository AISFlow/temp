42397897,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbESHt,1408659627,FireEye Founder: Bitcoin Could Secure Our Global Payments Infrastructure,"The promise of digital currency technology and its potential applications has drawn a number of investors to the ecosystem, each with unique backgrounds and expertise.  For example, bitcoin mining company PeerNova announced in July that it had received funding from Ashar Aziz, a cybersecurity entrepreneur and founder of noted malware protection solutions provider FireEye. Aziz explained in a new interview with CoinDesk that the strengths of bitcoin are most obvious when you look at the infrastructure of today’s mainstream payment systems.  This infrastructure, which he labeled primitive, reflects the evolution of 20th century styles of payment. For this reason, Aziz argued, a new approach has to be taken, and that bitcoin may be the key to unlocking this future.  Aziz told CoinDesk:  “As we’ve seen over the past several years, more and more of our traditional transactions have moved to the Internet and are leveraging Internet speed for what used to be typical offline transactions. The value exchange is somewhat limited and primitive in their mechanisms, and bitcoin’s underlying technology provides a good, cryptographically secure platform for exchange.”  Beyond payments, the actual procedural aspects of bitcoin could be applied to other types of digital infrastructure, Aziz said.  To Aziz, bitcoin payments are the first application of what may become a litany of additional use cases that fortify the Web’s security for the long term.  Legacy systems out of date  Aziz believes that the various elements of today’s payments infrastructure don’t work fluidly enough to handle the needs of a global economy. He called credit card systems archaic and unfit for the digital age, saying that the technological holes make it easy for cybercriminals to acquire sensitive data and subsequently commit fraud.  When asked how digitized payment systems will evolve in the years ahead, Aziz called the situation amorphous, owing to the many companies involved and the complexities in the infrastructure itself.  From a security perspective, however, he said that change will have to take place as the stark realities of securing payment networks becomes more apparent, explaining:  “It’s a large and complex problem, and many enterprises struggle to even understand where their valuable digital assets are, much less effectively secure them. So, if we can shrink the attack surface down to a small set of objects, which can then be very easily secure, that makes the attacker’s job much harder.”  Migration slow but steady  Notably, Aziz said that the companies in the payments space are in a period of research and fact-finding. He described conversations between PeerNova and representatives from the payments ecosystem about today’s legacy systems as positive and engaging, adding:  “The PeerNova team has talked to many people who have looked at other applications that represent value exchange, and are all interested in learning how they can take these traditional mechanisms and create a more secure infrastructure.”  Beyond businesses, Aziz sees consumers – many of whom don’t know too much about bitcoin, much less understand its transaction process – warming to the technology as it gets easier to use. Given the security problems dogging legacy payment systems, he said that those making payments will come to see the benefits that a digital currency-based system would offer.  Yet, at the same time, legacy payments systems aren’t going away anytime soon. Given the vast level of investment into modern payment infrastructure, bitcoin won’t have a direct impact overnight. What is more likely, Aziz argued, is that the nature of digital currency will spark a conversation abou how people transact with one another on the Internet.  He concluded:  “I think there are going to be alternative mechanisms coming around, and other things building – you’re already seeing that, systems being built around alternative currency models. I don’t see [legacy systems and bitcoin] competing – I think there’s room for multiple systems to exist.”  Image via Skydeck/ UC Berkeley, Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/21/fireeye-founder-bitcoin-could-secure-our-global-payments-infrastructure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/413254b98c40335fa184cba62187f6a34ee46691-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397893,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbESDx,1408650313,Ben Lawsky: New York Can't Risk Getting Bitcoin Regulation Wrong,"The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced today it would extend the comment period for its proposed bitcoin regulations by 45 days, citing significant public interest in the rules as a key reason behind the decision.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, NYDFS superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky opened up about the decision, emphasizing that he felt the extension both necessary and reasonable given his agency's need to ensure that the proposed laws, when enacted, have the desired consequences.  Lawsky told CoinDesk that the aim of the agency is to put forward the best regulation possible, adding that while the agency wants to move quickly to put in place policies, it doesn't want to do so at the risk of getting crucial elements wrong.  Lawsky explained:  ""We're not the kind of agency that thinks we have a monopoly on the truth and that we're always right. We feel strongly about a lot of the provisions in the proposed regulations, but we get that there might be things we can improve.""  For instance, he clarified that the law is intended to relate only to financial intermediaries and financial service providers, not software providers as widely interpreted.  He confirmed the NYDFS aims to put out a revised proposal by the end of October, and that following any material changes in the law, an additional 30-day comment period would allow the industry more time to influence the final rules.  ""I think the sooner we get the regulatory framework out there, I think ultimately the better, but we don't need to move so fast that we risk getting something wrong,"" he added.  International influence  Though the NYDFS said that letters from US companies and citizens had an influence on the decision in the formal release, Lawsky acknowledged to CoinDesk that the broader global effects of the proposal were also a motivating factor.  Noting this global influence, Lawsky said:  ""I think that gives us an additional responsibility to do our very best to get it right, and the best way to get something right is to try and get as many viewpoints as you can when you put a complicated regulatory framework, consider them carefully and make the best decisions possible.""  The response is notable given a recent comment filed by China's three largest bitcoin exchanges BTC China, Huobi and OKCoin, which alleged the language of the laws would require them to perform enhanced due diligence on non-US customers.  Expected reaction  Lawsky also commented on the reaction from the digital currency community, which, while initially positive about the regulation, has been more vocal in recent weeks about its more restrictive aspects. For example, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire went so far as to suggest his company would refrain from serving New York customers should the laws pass in current form, a viewpoint echoed by other prominent business leaders.  Noting that he wasn't surprised by the reaction, Lawsky remarked:  ""I think the most surprising thing has been that certain provisions in the regulation that I think when we drafted it initially that we thought would be pretty clear in terms of the breadth, were read by some much more broadly than we intended.""  Still, he praised the responses the NYDFS has so far received, noting that he has been impressed by the number of companies and individuals that take the industry seriously and care about its underlying technology.  Unintended consequences  Specifically, Lawsky suggested that he was surprised that the digital currency industry's software providers had implied that the law was meant to govern their actions.  Responding to this popular critique of the law, Lawsky told CoinDesk:  ""We saw fairly quickly that certain provisions were being read by software developers as potentially applying to them, and that could stifle [their] development.""  For example, he noted that the NYDFS does not intended to seek approval for every piece of code created by these companies, though he acknowledges that the original wording may have suggested such an interpretation.  He added that this initial unintended reading could prove beneficial, however, ultimately enhancing the agency's ability to better communicate its desired policies.  ""I think accompanying the revisions, we'll do some kind of guidance so people have more clarity as to the breadth of the regs, so software developers aren't going to have to be sitting around wondering if it applies to them – it doesn't, it applies to financial intermediaries,"" Lawsky said.  Further extensions unlikely  Throughout the interview, Lawsky stressed that the NYDFS still wants to move quickly to implement its laws for the bitcoin sector, and that he believes an additional 45 days will allow his agency to address the community's concerns.  ""We've already gotten extensive and very good comments, and the first 45 days haven't even run fully,"" Lawsky said. ""So, I think an additional 45 days should get us to where we're comfortable and that we've given people enough time to think about the regulation and the provisions they care about and give us comment.""  Still, Lawsky added that he doesn't want to close the door to a further extension completely, saying:  ""I don't right now, but never say never.""  Bitcoin's future bright in New York  Despite the community's sometimes negative outlook on the regulation, Lawsky was also optimistic that his agency can establish nuanced and thoughtful rules that don't stifle innovation.  He indicated that his team is already working through comments with an eye for updating the document, noting that some changes now obviously need to be made. Other revisions, he added, are likely to take time and high-level meetings to assess.  Finally, he welcomed additional comments on the proposal and encouraged the community to continue to inform the NYDFS on how it can create a framework that is in both the interest of the state and the community.  Lawsky concluded:  ""If we get that right, I think the outlook for virtual currencies in one form or another is quite bright in New York, but we'll have to take it one day at a time.""

42397879,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES47,1408643187,New York Extends Comment Period for BitLicense Proposal,"New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky has extended the comment period for the BitLicense proposal by an additional 45 days.  The agency cited the large volume of input from various sources, including prominent members of the bitcoin community, as the primary reason to double the comment period. The NYDFS announced the move on its official website, moving the final deadline to 21st October.  The notice cited requests from the bitcoin community, which included grassroots supporters and the Bitcoin Foundation, as a driver of the deadline change. The agency also noted the potentially significant impact of the BitLicense proposal on the broader bitcoin market as another reason for the extension, saying:  “There has been a significant amount of public interest in and commentary on DFS' proposed regulatory framework for virtual currency firms. A number of groups and individuals have also requested additional time to study the proposal given that it is the first of its kind and could potentially serve as a model for other jurisdictions.”  Comments from across the industry  Beyond the formal requests to extend the comment deadline, numerous business and community leaders have weighed in on the issue.  By and large, many in the bitcoin industry see the BitLicense proposal as an inhibitor rather than an promotor of the digital currency’s success. Other observers, however, see the BitLicense as a step forward for bitcoin’s legal and financial legitimacy on the global stage.  The strongest language yet has come from Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who noted in a blog post that his company would refuse to do business with New York customers should it be required to comply with the proposed regulations. At the time, he noted Circle is “not alone” as it considers the downsides of the BitLicense.  Criticism of the BitLicense has come from beyond US shores as well. This week, the CEOs of China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges – OKCoin, Huobi and BTC China – submitted an open letter to the NYDFS, saying that the proposal risks hurting bitcoin abroad as well as in the United States.  Comments from the Digital Chamber of Commerce and a team from George Mason University, have also been submitted during the ongoing review period.  More to follow.

42397886,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES92,1408637933,Wedbush: Wall Street Sees Opportunity in Bitcoin's Volatility,"A new report from Wedbush Securities suggests the price of bitcoin will continue to be volatile – but adds that this is necessary for the market’s growth and maturity.    Entitled Embracing Volatility: Trading as Bitcoin's First Killer App, the latest report from the financial services firm concludes that fluctuations in bitcoin’s price, far from harming the currency, will benefit its underlying infrastructure.  Gil Luria  , the author of the report, said:  ""Volatility in the price of bitcoin should not impede retailer acceptance of bitcoin, in our opinion, as merchants and payment processors are entirely shielded, and we expect consumers will be shielded in the future.""  Luria noted that US bitcoin companies such as Coinbase and Circle are currently working on such solutions. When they are introduced, he said, it will become common for consumers to use wallets with small amounts of bitcoin for online transactions.  However, he added that the challenge for the wider bitcoin ecosystem will be to provide a volatile market for investors alongside a stable user experience for consumers.  The power of market perception  The report also assesses the effect of investor perception on the bitcoin market, further reiterating the firm's belief that 1 BTC could one day be worth $1m.  While this bullish sentiment remains prevalent in the market, the Wedbush report notes that when this long-term outlook is disrupted, the markets movements can be fierce.  Should market perception of bitcoin's long-term growth change even 0.01%, the report says, the market could see a $100 change in current valuation, or about a 10% rise or fall in prices.  However, according to Luria, this volatility will attract new participants:  ""We believe traders value volatility as they continue to gravitate to bitcoin trading as an active 24/7 market uncorrelated with other asset class returns. The connection between volatility and trading volumes is well established in equities and is beginning to emerge in bitcoin trading.""  Advanced financial trading to continue  Luria also suggested that this belief has been established through talks with Wall Street traders, who they say see an opportunity given that the market's sometimes severe reactions to news.  Further, he added that the recent rise of advanced financial trading products in the bitcoin ecosystem is likely to continue to cater to these new participants, stating:  ""We expect this activity to continue to draw more sophisticated tools borrowed from the equities trading world – such as derivatives, margin trading and computer trading – all of which have contributed volatility in the equities markets.""  The finding is notable as margin trading was most recently at the center of controversy surrounding bitcoin's latest price decline, with many in the community labeling it a contributor to two flash crashes on major exchanges.  The exchanges that offer such services have dismissed the claims.  For more on the findings, view the full report here.

42397878,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES38,1408624923,QwikBit Launches Isle of Man’s First Bitcoin ATM,"QwikBit will launch the Isle of Man’s first bitcoin ATM today at a pub in the island’s capital, Douglas.  As Thirsty Pigeon customers can already buy food and beverages in exchange for bitcoin, the venue was “an obvious choice” to home the Lamassu machine, QuikBit said.  Robert McAleer, the pub's owner, added that although he only began accepting the digital currency two weeks ago, bitcoin business is already booming: “more and more customers have come to the bar, looking to spend their bitcoins on a decent pint,” he said.  To celebrate the ATM launch, McAleer is offering a 10% discount on all food and drink purchases made with the digital currency.    Software update  The launch of the ATM was previously delayed as QwikBit worked on a software update to address security concerns from local law enforcement.  However, the company's new update, dubbed Qwik-Screen, is now fully functional. Having registered in advance, users must provide standard AML documentation such as an ID card and a proof of address before they can use QwikBit's ATM.  Once a user's information is verified, their account is activated and can be linked to their smartphone using an random authentication tool Google authenticator.  The user is then issued with a four-digit PIN. This, coupled with the Google authenticator code, will verify the user’s identity on the QwikBit ATM network.  QwikBit's chief operating officer Stan Ho said this is the first time a third party has coded a software update for a Lamassu machine. He added that the two businesses collaborated in the run up to launch to ensure the update was implemented successfully.  Isle of Man rolls out the red carpet  The Isle of Man Financial Supervision Commission (FSC), the jurisdiction’s chief financial regulator, has already issued comprehensive clarification of its position on digital currencies.  The island has already attracted a number of bitcoin businesses and will host the first annual Crypto Valley Summit in September. QwikBit believes its software update will go a long way toward complying with the jurisdiction's forthcoming regulatory framework.  Having liaised with local regulators and Jason Kelly, vice chairman of the Manx Digital Currency Association, Ho explained:  “It’s a sensible solution [as] later this year [...] businesses operating in the cryptocurrency sector may be required to comply with anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorist legislation.”  Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey said the Isle of Man is poised to become a “financial centre of digital currencies” and praised QwikBit's efforts to prepare for the ATM's launch.  First Manhattan, then Brighton  QwikBit’s bitcoin ATM joins an ever expanding network of digital currency teller machines across the world.  Today alone, two other Lamassu machines have been launched in Manhattan, New York, and Brighton, England. South Africa also got its first bitcoin ATM this week.  Last week, CAVIRTEX announced plans to expand its operations and bring an additional 10 ATMs to Canada's malls and tourist spots.

42397885,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES83,1408612097,Bullion Dealer Amagi Metals to Stop Accepting Fiat Currency,"Precious metals and coin dealer Amagi Metals announced today it would stop accepting US dollars as a payment method at the end of 2016, saying it had ""lost confidence"" in the future value of the world's most popular fiat currency.  While several prominent retailers and dealers have joined the bitcoin ecosystem in 2014, and some businesses have always been exclusively bitcoin, Amagi is one of the first to halt fiat acceptance.  The company said in a statement:    ""Since the dollar was decoupled from gold in 1971, it has lost 97% of its value compared to the yellow metal and 83% of its domestic purchasing power, and the trend shows no signs of stopping.      Both investors and foreign governments have begun to lose confidence in the dollar’s future… and so has Amagi Metals. Thus, Amagi has planned that, by the end of 2016, the company will no longer accept US dollars or other 'fiat' currencies. Instead, Amagi plans to be trading exclusively in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.""    After 2016, Amagi will serve customers holding fiat only through an exchange on its website. Those customers will need to convert their money into digital currency before purchasing.  Amagi CEO Stephen Macaskill offered a grim future vision for paper currencies, suggesting his decision was not as radical as it sounded:  ""With the adoption of cryptocurrencies increasing every day, their viability is virtually assured. History shows that paper currency, backed by nothing of value, will ultimately fail. It’s only a matter of time until no one will be accepting the dollar. By trading exclusively in cryptocurrencies, we’ll still be in business when that time comes.”  Nearly two years of bitcoin  Denver, Colorado-based Amagi Metals has been a pioneer in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency space, accepting bitcoin in November 2012 when the currency had made little impact on mainstream attention.  Bitcoin now accounts for over 40% of all customer payments, the company said, and was responsible for a total $10.4m in sales up to March this year.  It began accepting litecoin and dogecoin payments that same month, but dropped dogecoin in July.  Along the way, Amagi has had to battle for its principles, having bank accounts unilaterally shuttered by Bank of the West, BBVA Compass and Colorado's First Bank for accepting bitcoin. It keeps a minimum two banking partners to ensure service is never lost completely.  Bitcoin and money ideals  Exchanging newer digital currencies into more 'traditional money' like gold and silver added to the digital currencies' stability and air of legitimacy for new investors, Amagi added.  Though the two do not always walk hand in hand, there is a lot of overlap between the cryptocurrency and precious metal-holding communities thanks to a shared interest in sound money, certain Austrian economic principles and a mistrust of central bank-controlled fiat currencies.  This has produced several businesses that trade digital currencies for precious metals and vice versa, including Agora Commodities, BullionStar, and Bullion Bitcoin. Others trade precious metals via the Ripple Network, like Gold Bullion International and Ripple Singapore, while GoldMoney Group's Netagio cold-stores bitcoins alongside bullion in its vault.

42397884,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES74,1408591077,China's 'Big Three' Bitcoin Exchanges: BitLicense Would Harm Overseas Markets,"China's 'Big Three' bitcoin exchanges, OKCoin, BTC China and Huobi, have joined forces to submit feedback to Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), regarding his agency's recent BitLicense proposal.  In a newly published open letter, the three companies criticized the broad reach of the regulations, stating they should only apply to businesses with meaningful connections to New York.  Signed by company CEOs Bobby Lee of BTC China, Lin 'Leon' Li of Huobi and Mingxing 'Star' Xu of OKCoin, the letter said:  ""While we are companies organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, we believe that it is not only appropriate, but also necessary for us to express our thoughts on certain aspects of the BitLicense proposal because the block chain protocol is decentralized, because regulations in New York have long been given great deference and are modeled after by regulators around the world, and because the BitLicense proposal as drafted appears to cover us.""  The three exchanges had previously expressed their opinions on the matter in interviews with CoinDesk, demonstrating just how much of a global reach the US state law could have.  At the time, however, only OKCoin indicated that it would seek to submit a formal response to the NYDFS.  Regulations overreach  Under the proposals, any business that serves customers in New York would be subject to the BitLicense provisions, no matter how tenuous the association.  This would include giving the NYDFS access to all books and records from the company and its affiliates, even if the affiliate's business had nothing to do with New York or cryptocurrencies. Currently, this is not a requirement for regular money services businesses.  The proposals would also require any licensed business to perform 'enhanced due diligence' (EDD) on non-US customers, meaning non-US businesses would be required to perform EDD on customers in their own jurisdictions, but not on those in the US.  This is both time-consuming and ineffective, the Chinese companies said.  Forcing business abroad  The proposed rules are a pertinent issue at a time when the China-based exchanges are increasingly seeking to capture the broader, global US dollar market, which has several regulatory walls of its own.  A BTC China spokesperson told CoinDesk the company ""would need to possess a very strong business case"" to justify the company applying for a BitLicense under the current proposals. They also acknowledged that businesses in China ""face similar challenges"".  They said:  ""It is extremely difficult to comply with the regulation as written, and may force us to avoid doing business with 'New York persons' or avoid the US entirely. The greatest concern is that other regulators in the US and around the world will follow New York state, which would be very damaging to the industry.""  BitLicenses  , if enacted unmodified, would dampen interest in doing business in the US and reduce willingness to work with US companies, they added.  A statement from Huobi said it would be ""extremely difficult to comply"", and expressed concern that regulators in other countries may follow New York's lead.  ""The reason why we feel the need to [make the statement] is because Huobi is an international platform, and bitcoin regulation in the US will definitely affect our plan of expanding in America directly. Moreover, we believe there will be direct influence to Chinese regulation because the Chinese government watches closely BitLicense in NY [...] Huobi definitely wants to expand our legitimate business in the US but also needs a flexible bitcoin environment.""  Huobi would ""geofence"" New York and not apply for a BitLicense if the proposal was enacted, the statement concluded.  OKCoin's manager of foreign operations, Zane Tackett, said:  ""We feel that it was important to release a unified statement because the regulations implemented in New York will likely be used as a model for other states and countries alike. Especially since we've started the rollout of our international exchange these regulations – if implemented – will have broad effects on how we operate. It is important to try and help the NYDFS draft the best possible BitLicense for both users of bitcoin, and the state itself.""
