42401126,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLluo,1519078801,Actor Steven Seagal Endorses Questionable 'Bitcoiin' ICO,"UPDATE (22nd February 11:00 a.m. EST): Following the publication of this article, Bitcoiin2Gen issued a press release refuting allegations that it is a multi-level marketing (MLM) company or pyramid scam.  The team said:    ""Of course, we are not an MLM company or any Pyramid Scheme or Scamming people, all of these allegations are false and just an attempt to discourage people from becoming a part of the Bitcoiin2Gen, Crypto-Currencies, and Crypto-economies.      The fact is that we are only providing potential investors the chance to earn through promoting us via a 4 level commission structure that will just EXIST during our ICO period only and it is not mandatory. The vision behind to adopt this structure is to lower our marketing expense and to take advantage of word of mouth advertising.""        Action film star Steven Seagal has become the brand ambassador for a controversial cryptocurrency ahead of its initial coin offering (ICO).  A statement posted to Seagal's Twitter account confirmed the news, the announcement for which was posted to the official website of ""Bitcoiin."" Seagal's endorsement – one of a number of celebrity endorsements in the cryptocurrency space in the past year – comes over a month before the ""second generation Bitcoiin"" is set to be sold.  An accompanying press release notably highlights Seagal's film and martial-arts career, stating: ""Hollywood actor Steven Seagal has become a believer of Bitcoiin2Gen, the Hollywood action star will be representing the leading cryptocurrency organization, Bitcoiin2Gen, as brand ambassador.""  The cryptocurrency in question is said to be based on ethereum's blockchain, and also boasts a mining component through a partnership with a company called Dragon Mining. The website also advertises ""considerable profit from holding Bitcoiin (B2G)"" via a staking/depository process.  The project notably boasts affiliate rewards for those who drive investor interest ahead of the sale, calling to mind investment schemes such as OneCoin and BitConnect – both of which have been accused of constituting pyramid schemes – that also featured affiliate programs.  As a press release from Feb. 8 explains:  ""To promote Bitcoiin B2G, a depositor who chooses to participate in one of our accredited Mining Programs, will earn commissions off their recruits’ earnings. Bitcoiin B2G is offering a 4-level commission structure, available to whoever joins the program and/or purchases Bitcoiin B2G during the ICO period.""  Additional information about Bitcoiin's official backers isn't available on the website. Data from ICANN reveals that the site was initially created in 2015, is registered out of Panama, and that the ownership of it changed hands around Jan. 8.  Celebrity endorsement aside, Bitcoiin has attracted some criticism for sharing elements of pyramid schemes, or investment structures by which early investors make money largely by bringing in new buyers.  The name itself – which simply adds an additional ""i"" to ""bitcoin"" – has raised concerns that it will lead to confusion among unsophisticated cryptocurrency buyers. Indeed, frequent multi-level marketing critic BehindMLM.com wrote earlier this month that ""Bitcoiin hope[s] to peddle their B2G altcoin using bitcoin's established brand awareness.""  Seagal's endorsement is also a notable one given that the pace of celebrity endorsements around cryptocurrency – including those from boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr. and actor Jamie Foxx, among others – has largely dried up. In the case of Mayweather, a planned cryptocurrency promotion venture was quietly scuttled, and much of the activity seen in the fall months died away following a public warning from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  ""Celebrities and others are using social media networks to encourage the public to purchase stocks and other investments,"" the agency said in November. ""These endorsements may be unlawful if they do not disclose the nature, source, and amount of any compensation paid, directly or indirectly, by the company in exchange for the endorsement.""

42401111,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLli1,1519074020,Who's Said What About the Coinbase-Visa Dispute,"Users of cryptocurrency startup Coinbase have seen repeated charges appear on their bank statements tied to their Visa credit and debit card use in recent days, prompting several rounds of statements from the companies involved after the situation went viral last week.  These charges reportedly emptied bank accounts and resulted in some customers getting hit overdraft fees, while others were unable to pay for critical expenses, as CoinDesk previously reported. At the time, Coinbase claimed the issues came from their payments processing network, not from any actions instigated by the exchange. Indeed, both firms seemed to initially deny responsibility as news of the issues took shape.  A joint statement from Coinbase, Visa and Worldpay released at the end of the week disclaimed responsibility for the charges from the startup, noting that Visa and Worldpay were working to reverse the duplicate transactions.  In the statement, the companies announced that all reversals would be completed within the next few days, going on to tell customers to contact their banks if they continue to see issues.  What happened?  A Visa spokesperson told CoinDesk that the multiple-charge issue appears to have stemmed from an incorrect Merchant Category Code (MCC). Payment operators like Visa use MCC codes to help process payments from merchants.  The codes tell operators what sort of transaction is being conducted, which then helps the company analyze the risk associated with the transaction.  However, payment operators do not actually influence these codes, the spokesperson said, explaining that “Visa reaffirms MCC codes. It doesn’t set them and we can’t change them.”  The representative said expanded:  “Neither Visa nor Coinbase is responsible for changing/setting MCC codes. Visa processes transactions via our processing network, Visa.net.”  Those remarks also noted that this issue was unique to Coinbase.  ""Visa has not made any systems changes that would result in the duplicate transactions cardholders are reporting. We are also not aware of any other merchants who are experiencing this issue. We are reaching out to this merchant’s acquiring financial institution to offer assistance and to ensure cardholders are protected from unauthorized transactions,"" the company said.  Normally, a merchant's acquiring bank or institution would be responsible for setting the MCC codes. Coinbase's acquirer is Worldpay, though none of the companies have confirmed that Worldpay had any responsibility in last week’s charging issues.  What comes next  In the joint statement, Visa and Worldpay claimed that most, if not all, charges should have been refunded to customers by this point.  However, it is possible that some refunds will take multiple days to process. According to posts on social media site Reddit, some customers are still reporting issues with their refunds as of Monday morning.  Additionally, Worldpay – beyond the joint statement issued with Coinbase and Visa – has yet to independently comment on the situation. CoinDesk contacted the firm for comment but did not receive a response by press time.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

42401108,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLlf4,1519069219,Israel Confirms It Will Tax Bitcoin as Property,"Israel's government confirmed Monday that it would treat bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a kind of property for tax purposes.  The notice confirms past indications that the Tax Authority will regard cryptocurrencies as ""a property, not a currency"", making it therefore taxable as such. The Authority's position was first detailed in a draft circular issued in January of this year.  The circular explains that profits from cryptocurrencies will be subject to capital gains tax at rates between twenty percent and twenty-five percent, while individuals mining or trading cryptocurrencies in connection with businesses must pay a seventeen percent value-added tax (VAT) in addition to capital gains tax.  That latter aspect – excluding broad swaths of investors from potential VAT charges – is in line with a trend seen in recent years since the issue gained prominence. The Israeli government started exploring the taxation of cryptocurrencies as early as 2013.  And while today's announcement was largely expected (given the previous draft release from the Tax Authority), officials there are still working on initiatives that could continue to impact the industry at-large.  The Authority's Monday announcement follows another draft circular published in late January, which outlined potential ways in which the government could tax ICOs. Possible steps include setting a minimum token sale revenue threshold at which a tax would be triggered.

In a Feb. 15 statement, the Lietuvos Bankas said it had made contact with blockchain banking firm Bankera regarding its token sale, which was advertised on two websites and had already raised over 80 million euros. The ICO's official website now claims it has raised more than 100 million euros in a sale that is scheduled to end next week.  Yet, based on information received, the central bank considers that the token sale constitutes an offering of securities under state law.  Lietuvos Bankas said:  ""In addition, [the ICO] distributes its authorized [cryptocurrency] and has already attracted more than 80 million [euros]. Taking into account the features set out in the heading and based on the information provided by Bankera's business plan, it is concluded that this ICO falls within the scope of the Law on Securities, i.e. is considered a public offer, and therefore must be executed in accordance with the established requirements.""  The institution suggested that it could take further action as a result of the probe, and concluded with a warning for those advertising token sales.  ""The Bank of Lithuania also draws attention of other media to the requirements of legal acts regarding the dissemination and promotion of instruments possessing the features of securities, and recalls that the Law on Advertising prohibits the advertising of activities that violate the requirements of legal acts,"" the central bank said.  The move comes months after Lithuania released guidance for the blockchain use case, being one of a number of institutions to do so last fall. That wave of statements followed a determination by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July, at which time the regulator said that its securities rules would apply to some tokens sales.

If confirmed, the raise is by far the largest seen for any ICO to date. According to CoinDesk's ICO Tracker, the previous record was the token sale by Tezos, which raised $232 million last year. Filecoin and Bancor raised more than $200 million and $150 million in the same year, respectively.  The amount raised was revealed in an SEC notice of securities exemption, which also indicates that the firm aims to use the funds for ""the development of the TON Blockchain, the development and maintenance of Telegram Messenger and the other purposes described in the offering materials.""  Launched in 2013 by Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, Telegram announced in January that it intended to raise $1.2 billion via a sale of its own token known as ""grams."" Having struggled with high operating costs, as previously reported by CoinDesk, a successful ICO would likely secure the struggling firm's future.  Part of the ICO is also aimed to open new avenues for the firm, financing development of a network for low-cost real-time payments and, later, a platform for decentralized identity, storage and more  It's so far unclear if the $850 million represents the token pre-sale, but that would appear likely. It further indicates that Telegram has had no problem appealing to VC firms and hedge funds in its capital-raising efforts.

Additionally, there are concerns about the governance of the tokens, as detailed in the ICO white paper, and the voting power of the TON Foundation set up to manage the reserve tokens kept by Telegram.

42380355,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NClT,1519047912,Record Retest? ETC Looks Poised on Double-Digit Climb,"ETC, the native currency of the ethereum classic blockchain, looks set to retest record highs, having now formed a base above $30.  As of writing, ETC is changing hands at $37.90, as per data source OnChainFX. Yet, the crypto asset has appreciated 16 percent in the last 24 hours, and is up 95 percent from its Feb. 6 low. Further, ETC was restricted to a narrow range of $30-$35 in the last few days and the sharp rise seen Monday marks an upside break of the consolidation.  As for the cause, one theory is that traders are exiting bitcoin for the alternative crypto asset.  OKEx, which offers ETC/BTC pair, is the leading exchange by trading volume, meaning it's possible investors are taking this strategy – the sharp rise in ETC/BTC (up 10.52 percent) is mainly responsible for the uptick in ETC's US dollar exchange rate.  That said, ETC is still down at least 20 percent from the record high of $47.77 hit on Dec. 21.  However, technical charts indicate the gap between the current market price and record highs could continue to narrow in the days ahead.  ETC Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Previous day's long-tailed doji and a bullish follow-through Monday signal a continuation of the rally from the Feb. 6 low of $14.00.  The upward sloping 5-day moving average (MA), 10-day MA and the bullish crossover between 10-day MA and 50-day MA favors further upside in ETC.  The relative strength index (RSI) is trending higher in support of the bulls.

42380348,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCcf,1519045231,Coinbase. Ripple. Uphold? Greg Kidd Defends His Boldest Bet Yet,"""I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floatin' around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both.""  The well-known quote from the Academy Award-winning movie ""Forrest Gump"" seems to sum up tech investor Greg Kidd's life, and he even says as much himself.  Calling an investment opportunity his ""Forrest Gump moment"" – just being in the right place at the right time – Kidd has bumped into, and subsequently invested in, some huge successes in his day.  For instance, after founding a bicycle courier service aimed at helping financial institutions more efficiently deliver paper checks, the company was hacked by Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Square, both of which Kidd then put money in.  And while working on an early Y-Combinator project that would have allowed people to spend any kind of value on a credit card, Kidd stumbled into Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, in which he also invested.  Then, most recently, while looking for an investment opportunity that would let him trade cryptocurrencies more efficiently, Kidd ran into Uphold, a crypto startup that, while under the radar of the media for a couple years, happened to be focused on just that.  ""When I arrived [at Uphold's site], it was like I was immediately transported to Star Trek-land, because I saw there were dozens of currencies, including crypto and fiat, but also silver and gold,"" Kidd told CoinDesk.  With that, Kidd rather enthusiastically dumped $57 million into Uphold and joined the startup's board in an effort to help the company move forward with its mission.  Speaking to that pursuit, Kidd said:  ""If you take a look at my investment portfolio … you'll see probably the top 20 or 30 portfolio companies of mine all stand to benefit or support Uphold in its effort.""  Integrations ahead?  In interview, Kidd detailed a number of projects in his portfolio that are in various stages of development that could benefit from work with Uphold.  The most advanced of these efforts appear to be a crypto credit card. Specifically, Kidd mentioned that Shift Payments might be able to let Uphold customers spend their holdings almost anywhere major credit cards are accepted.  ""Imagine enabling Uphold to issue cards to all of its members, so any of those 40-plus currencies that they support could be spent anywhere that Visa or Mastercard is accepted,"" Kidd said.  Shift Payments has already launched similar cards with Coinbase and Dwolla, and last year revealed a project with PayPal-owned Venmo.  Kidd continued:  ""That's just like an obvious slam dunk integration.""  Although, for all Kidd's enthusiasm, vice-chairman of Uphold, JP Thieriot, took a more measured tone.  Thieriot clarified that while Uphold has plans to release a multi-purpose credit card later this year, it's still ""exploring"" opportunities and hadn't necessarily settled on Shift Payments as the provider of that product.  Still, Kidd mentioned other projects, including a partnership between Uphold and blockchain identity startup Global ID, of which Kidd is both founder and CEO. According to Kidd, Global ID could make it easier for companies using Uphold's APIs to verify user identities easier.  Plus, Kidd, who has invested in Ripple too, indicated that he'd like to see the addition of XRP, Ripple's native cryptocurrency, added to the Uphold platform.  Although, true to form, Thieriot downplayed this move a bit, stating that Uphold might add XRP, but that's a long ways from an official announcement.  Making it personal  But even with Thieriot softening Kidd's promotion, Kidd has staked a personal investment in the company which seems tailor-made to ensure his interests and the interests of Uphold align.  Of the total investment, 45 percent will come in the form of an exchange of Uphold equity for cash, 20 percent comes in the form of a licensing agreement and 35 percent comes from Kidd putting up a portion of his current portfolio balance sheet.  The latter part is perhaps the most interesting in that the exposure to the assets is designed to protect Uphold against any number of scenarios where the company might deal with a significant negative event, such as being hacked.  ""I'm willing to pledge a certain amount of my balance sheet, or the balance sheet of my venture company – a lot of that is tied up in crypto – as a reserve,"" Kidd said.  Plus, Kidd has committed to collaborating on development.  Specifically, Thieriot said some of the funds will be used for the creation of a research and development lab to streamline new and existing projects.  ""One of the immediate upshots of this collaboration is the formation of Uphold Labs, in which [Kidd] will be active,"" said Thieriot. ""[Kidd] is aware of the existing pipeline of projects which is pretty deep and interesting, and he'll have at least bi-weekly involvement in moving that forward.""  In the black  Perhaps one of the main reasons Kidd is so gung-ho about Uphold is the fact that the company is already making money.  Originally founded in 2014 as BitReserve, last year the company became profitable for the first time, according to Thieriot, six months ahead of schedule. While the company has kept a low profile, it's business seems to have grown substantially.  According to Uphold's site, the company has transacted $2.8 billion in volume from six million transactions.  Coupled with its profitability, Uphold's business transparency also drove Kidd's final decision to not only invest, but put so much skin in the game.  For instance, far exceeding the 10 percent of liabilities required to be held by all large financial institutions by the Federal Reserve, Uphold shows a reserve status of 101.7 percent of its liabilities, or $164 million. The reserve funds include multiple tiers of assets, including $30 million in U.S. dollars, $1.8 million in gold and $50 million in bitcoin.  ""They're prepared to scale, they're doing it in a compliant way, and they're doing it in the U.S.,"" said Kidd, adding:  ""Over the past year, they went from growing very quickly to not making any money to basically being pretty much in the black every day, and quite in the black everyday.""

According to the ABC's current affairs program 7.30, data obtained from the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Scamwatch program indicated it received 1,289 complaints related to crypto fraud in 2017. Losses totalling $1,218,206 were also reported.  Speaking to the show, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commissioner John Price warned that, ""It's been quite well documented that some of these products are scams, so please don't invest unless you're prepared to lose some or all of your money.""  The news comes two months after the country made regulatory changes to more closely control its crypto industry. In December, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) received the go-ahead to monitor Australia's bitcoin exchanges.  The move meant exchanges in the country must register with Austrac and be placed on a dedicated register. They are also required to set up other procedures, including countering the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing, verifying customers' identities, and maintaining some records for seven years,  Regulators and other authorities elsewhere around the globe are also increasingly starting to take action on fraudulent crypto schemes.  CoinDesk reported in January that the New York County District Attorney's Office has shut down more than 70 allegedly fraudulent bitcoin investment sites.  And both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Future Exchange Commission (CFTC) have taken action in recent weeks.  The SEC charged cryptocurrency banking firm AriseBank over alleged fraud and violations of securities rules on Jan. 25, announcing a cease-and-desist order on firm's operations.  Around the same time, the CFTC sued crypto scheme My Big Coin for alleged fraud, and brought two lawsuits against allegedly fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes just a week before.

42380353,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCkD,1519035310,Bottom Confirmed? Bitcoin at 20-Day High Near $11K,"The bitcoin price has rallied 84 percent from recent lows, suggesting a bottom is in place, although a long-term bull revival is still not certain, according to the price charts  Over the weekend, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rose to $11,279.18, its highest level since Jan. 29. As of writing, the BPI is seen at $10,800 – up 1.59 percent in the last 24 hours. However, a bout of profit taking seems to have pushed the cryptocurrency back below $11,000.  While the ""V""-shaped rally from the Feb. 6 low of $5,947.40 certainly paints a bullish picture, investors are still divided on whether BTC has found a long-term bottom below $6,000.  Bitcoin seems to have bottomed out below $6,000 as indicated by bullish doji reversal, but the weekly indicators are still less clear about the long-term prospects for the bulls, as discussed below.  Weekly chart  Last week's green candle marked a positive follow-through to previous week's long-tailed doji candle and confirmed a bullish doji reversal. So, it appears a bottom has been made at $5,873.  That said, the position of the relative strength index (RSI) indicates the job is still half done. As discussed last week, during the bull run (2015-2017), at no point were the bears strong enough to push the RSI below the support zone of 55.00-53.00. However, the RSI did drop below the support zone during the recent sell-off, signaling a bear market.  Further, it still remains below resistance zone of 53.00-55.00 (former support). Hence, a long-term bullish reversal is still not confirmed.  Also, a look at the short-duration chart indicates a key Fibonacci level has come into play. Bitcoin prices on Coinbase's GDAX exchange created a red candle (down day) yesterday at $11,228.25, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $19,891.99 to $5,873.  Daily chart  View  A move of the weekly RSI above 53.00 would confirm the long-term bull reversal and open the doors for a re-test of record highs. However, on the way higher, bitcoin prices could face resistance at $17,174 (Jan. 6 high).  Meanwhile, a drop below $9,017.41 (Jan. 17 low) would add credence to the bearish weekly RSI, and the bearish 50-day MA and 100-day MA crossover, and could yield a deeper sell-off towards $7,000.

42380349,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCdv,1519030825,Bancor Bounce Back? ICO Is Winning Adoption,"When Bancor held its initial coin offering (ICO), it raised a lot of money and a lot of questions. Now, eight months on, the project seems to have found a role in the market.  Announced last week, the Tel Aviv-based project, aimed to make it easier for people to launch their own crypto tokens, revealed it has grown its network substantially since June, when it raised $150 million selling tokens branded BNT. Including BNT, 35 tokens can now be traded on the platform, with more – enough to push the number of tokens offered over 100 – stating they'll integrate with Bancor soon.  As far as token exchange volume on the platform, that has also spiked – going from $3 million per week in November to $37 million per week in January – according to the company.  ""We're one of the few token launches that I can think of, definitely in our [summer of 2017] class that have launched live products and have live users,"" Bancor co-founder Galia Benartzi told CoinDesk.  With that growth, it seems Bancor's value proposition as a liquidity provider for tokens, especially those with too little demand to get accepted by exchanges, is becoming sought-after after all.  Crystal Rose, CEO of Sensay, a messaging and payments project that staked $1 million of its crypto token on Bancor recently, told CoinDesk:  ""I think Bancor is going to play a very important role as the token economy shifts and we see the emergence of tokenization of everything.""  And all this has put a some of the project's critics to rest.  Prof. Emin Gun Sirer and Phil Daian came out strongly against Bancor's large raise, which was backed by Tim Draper and Blockchain Capital, saying at the time that the BNT token wasn't useful. Among other things, the argument was, and remains, that ethereum's native cryptocurrency ether could seemingly fill the role of a medium of exchange between tokens.  While Sirer told CoinDesk his views on the project remain largely unchanged, he did give Bancor credit for its traction, saying, ""Bancor remains a valuable first step in a challenging direction.""  Liquidity for little guys  And the early nature of that step is perhaps best visible in volumes.  Most of the tokens listed on CoinMarketCap's Bancor page have fairly thin markets, although several of the better-known options – EOS, Sirin and Kik's kin, as of this writing – have hit daily volumes of more than $500,000 on the platform.  ""Here you're actually networking the tokens together into a network because every one is automatically convertible to every other one,"" Benartzi said.  To expand upon what Benartzi said, on the Bancor platform, any token on the network can be traded for BNT and BNT can be traded for any of the other tokens of the network. Bancor asks token projects to stake a certain amount of their token and buy and stake a certain amount of BNT, both of which need to be done before the token is ready to trade.  The more that's staked then, the more liquid a token will be, since it can then handle bigger trades.  ""You can think of this like a bandwidth to the network,"" Benartzi said.  In this way, Bancor fills the role of automated market maker, an entity that's always available to trade for a certain instrument. And that's the key, since investors are unlikely to buy a token that they can't exit their position quickly.  As such, Bancor seems to be enticing smaller, less widely-anticipated token projects first.  CoinDesk reached out to most of the projects that currently have a stake on the Bancor platform, but only a few responded before press time.  A decentralized marketplace for services based in Australia, CanYa, announced its integration with Bancor earlier this month, and the firm's founder Chris McLoughlin said it had staked 1.5 percent of its token's circulating supply.  CanYa is currently working on the next generation of its services marketplace, focused on user-friendliness. At that point, the company expects demand for its token to increase, so the Bancor integration is in anticipation.  Storm, a marketplace for micro-tasks, and the previously mentioned Sense project – which both have advisers from Bancor – mentioned the benefits of Bancor's liquidity in a growing ICO market, saying that competition making it difficult for tokens to get included on exchange platforms.  According to Arry Yu, Storm's COO:  ""With Bancor's global community network and their focus on user experience, it was a natural fit for our company.""  Ghost stakes  But while token projects themselves are using Bancor, other, more mysterious, entities are also using the platform.  For example, CoinDesk found a few tokens whose stakes hadn't actually been set up by their issuers. MakerDAO, DragonChain and Kik confirmed that stakes for their tokens had not been set up by anyone on their respective teams.  ""It's important to understand that the Bancor protocol itself is open source,"" Benartzi said.  For someone with a long position in a specific token, creating a stake on Bancor could be seen as a way to help that token grow. And since the platform allows users to take their stake back out and is designed to keep its supply of tokens roughly constant, there's not much risk to putting tokens on the platform.  MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen only realized DAI was on Bancor when it went live, but said, ""I think it’s natural for Bancor since, as a stablecoin, it gives Bancor users the ability to escape the volatility of cryptocurrency whenever they want, without having to leave the Bancor decentralized exchange.""  Two other well-known ICO projects have a stake on Bancor: Gnosis, which did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment, and Status, which declined to comment.  Yet, as mentioned, individual investors or groups of investors could stake tokens to Bancor. And with each new token, the user experience for the participants improves, since they are able to trade between more tokens.  And not only that, with each new token that integrates, it becomes easier for Bancor to convince others to join, Benartzi said, acknowledging that getting these early stakes has been a challenge.  But the platform is continuing its push, announcing a new partnership on Feb. 14, whereby Block.One will implement Bancor on top of its EOS blockchain whenever it goes live.  ""We see the Bancor Protocol as an elegant solution for liquidity that benefits all token holders by offering a completely new paradigm for value exchange,"" Dan Larimer, CTO of Block.One, said in a press release.  And with all this, Benartzi believes Bancor has reached a tipping point, telling CoinDesk:  ""There are enough tokens in the network to see real liquidity.""

42380345,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCYt,1519023654,PC Giant Lenovo Seeks Blockchain Validation Patent,"A new Lenovo patent filing suggests that the Chinese technology giant could look to using blockchain as part of system for verifying the validity of physical documents.  In an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) last Thursday, Lenovo describes a set-up that utilizes digital signatures encoded in physical documents, which can be processed by computers and other machines, to verify the legitimacy of a document. The application was first submitted in August 2016, public records show.  The processing machine decodes the signature and translates it into a digital ""map"" of the document, which can then be compared to the physical copy at hand. The application says that the digital signature represents a ""security block chain,"" with a series of digital signatures representing blocks in the security chain. Lenovo clarifies that its ""security blockchain"" ""refers to a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision.""  It goes on to say that every block contains ""information about the physical document at various points in time.""  Lenovo writes of its product:  ""Using the security blockchain, anyone can validate that they have the current authentic physical document even if multiple paper copies exist and multiple people have made entries in the chain of modification. If any forgeries exist, they will show up as orphaned blocks in the chain. To validate a paper copy, a user of the electronic device takes a picture of the printed code on the physical document.""  Lenovo claims that the benefit of the product is that all parties holding copies of a given document can ensure that they ""are each viewing an accurate copy"" at any given time, eliminating the possibility that the text of the document was substantially altered after an ""ink pen"" signature was applied to it.  This is not Lenovo's first experiment with the blockchain. Last year, Forbes reported that IBM had started working with the company on a blockchain-based invoicing system. At the time, the report suggested that the arrangement was aimed at making the billing and operational data processes more traceable and transparent.

42380346,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCa9,1519011324,The Real Problem With Nocoiners,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      A nocoiner, according to Urban Dictionary, is someone who has no bitcoin. But not everyone who has no bitcoin is necessarily a nocoiner.  Rather, what makes a nocoiner a nocoiner is not simply the absence of cryptocurrency from his investment portfolio, but his sanctimonious attitude about it.  Urban Dictionary’s definition, which was posted in December – about the time the word entered wide usage in the bitcoin community – goes on to describe nocoiners as:  ""....people who missed their opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price ... and who [are] now bitter at having missed out. The nocoiner takes out his or her bitterness on Bitcoin Hodlers, by constantly claiming that Bitcoin will crash, is a scam, is a bubble, or other types of easily refuted FUD.""  In other words, a nocoiner is full of what philosophers call ressentiment, defined by La Wik as ""a reassignment of the pain that accompanies a sense of one's own inferiority/failure onto an external scapegoat.""  The Twitter user known as @crackbagged picked up on this psychological insight in a Medium post in June of last year, warning fellow bitcoiners not to gloat when the price reaches $1 million:  ""The people you told about Bitcoin may turn on you and assault you. You might be accused of witchcraft and thrown down a well, or worse. The mind of a nocoiner (a person who has no Bitcoin) is a dangerous place.""  Marco Santori, a lawyer who's represented bitcoin startups since the early days and now the president and chief legal officer of wallet provider Blockchain, recently tweeted his distaste for the word ""nocoiner,"" writing that ""it has a bitter us-vs-them flavor to it"" and ""smacks of partisan tribalism.""  But nocoiners engage in tribal signalling at least as much as bitcoiners. The nocoiner isn't just skeptical or even bearish about bitcoin. He feigns epistemic certainty that it will fail.  A nocoiner doesn’t simply express doubt about the use cases for cryptocurrency – he declares, unequivocally, that there are no use cases at all, in the face of evidence to the contrary. (A subset of nocoiners will assert that the only uses are criminal, implicitly committing the logical fallacy of appeal to the law.)  The nocoiner mocks the bitcoiner's evangelical fervor, but he is every bit as religious in his convictions – and nowhere near as endearing.  The first use of ""nocoiner"" on Twitter is believed to have been in February 2017, though the term's apparently been used in 4chan forums for several years. But nocoiners have arguably been around since long before Satoshi’s white paper. As long as humans have walked the Earth, perhaps.  In the late 19th century, Nietzsche compared the nocoiners of the day to tarantulas: ""In all their lamentations soundeth vengeance ... and being judge seemeth to them bliss.""  Mea culpa  Cards on the table: I myself was a proto-nocoiner in the late 1990s, a good 10 years before bitcoin's Genesis block.  Working at a daily banking newspaper (a phrase that will be indecipherable to our grandchildren), I sneered at the dot-com boom and regularly gawked at F**ked Company, a website that printed unvetted rumors of layoffs and bankruptcies at the era’s highflying startups (what an edgy name, I thought then).  Incredulous about market valuations for companies with no profits or even revenues, I rolled my eyes and looked forward to the day when the the internet bubble would burst. Once this nonsense is over, I thought, we can concentrate on writing about serious companies. Like Countrywide, ha ha.  In my defense, a lot of those tech companies I scoffed at were indeed frivolous, and most went belly-up or got acquired. But the internet still transformed the economy (though the financial services industry less so) and the subsequent mortgage boom and bust were far more destructive, all things considered.  Even Fast Company is still around, while the tawdry gossip site that spoofed the magazine’s name is long forgotten. Its rapier-like subtlety lives on at the r/buttcoin subreddit.  To be clear: The lesson from that era was not that we should revere entrepreneurs or accept all technologists' claims unchallenged. Rather, keep an open mind, think beyond the quarterly metrics Wall Street obsesses over, question your assumptions about how the world will always work – and don't confuse a beautiful horse (the world wide web, bitcoin) with the flies buzzing around its rear end (Pets.com, Mt. Gox).  In other words, you don't have to hold or even like bitcoin. Just don't be a nocoiner.
