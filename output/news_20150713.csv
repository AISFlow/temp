42426444,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNcDh,1436827328,Judge Orders Corrupt DEA Agent to Forfeit Stolen Bitcoin,"A US district judge has signed a court order mandating a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent arrested in connection with the Silk Road investigation forfeit hundreds of bitcoins to the federal government.  On 9th July, US District Judge Richard Seeborg approved the preliminary order against Carl Force IV, requiring the surrender of roughly 690 bitcoins. The order will be finalized at the time of sentencing.  Force, who plead guilty to extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice charges earlier this month after being arrested in the spring, was one of two agents accused of illegally handling bitcoins during the US government's investigation of the now-defunct dark market.  The forfeited amount includes $13,045 in bitcoin held in a BTC-e account, $17,759.06 used in connection with Engedi LLC, a cryptocurrency venture previously cited in court documents, and $65,658.51 held in an E-Trade account.  The order also approved a $500,000 money judgment against Force.  The announcement follows the news that Shaun Bridges, the Secret Service agent who allegedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin during the investigation, had agreed to a plea deal with federal prosecutors.

42426418,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNbxh,1436817512,Xapo Execs Lose Bid to Dismiss Breach of Contract Lawsuit,"Five Xapo employees have lost their bid to dismiss a breach of contract lawsuit brought on by former employer LifeLock.  The update is the latest in a case first brought to light by Fortune when it revealed LifeLock was seeking damages from the defendants, including current Xapo CEO Wences Casares and COO Federico Murrone, related to the development of IP it says would become the foundation of the bitcoin services firm.  LifeLock  has alleged that the defendants did not disclose the ""nature and extent"" of their role in developing the project, which it argues was created on its computers and using its resources. Xapo has denied the allegations, stating that LifeLock was aware of the project and it relinquished its claim to any technology developed.  LifeLock secured the services of members of the current Xapo team when it purchased Lemon, a digital wallet platform, for $42.6m in December 2013. Xapo has since raised $40m in venture capital, adding former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and ex-Citi CEO John Reed to its advisory board in May.  The full filing finds Judge Peter Kirwan overruling objections by the plaintiffs that the breach of contract suit filed by LifeLock be dismissed for lacking sufficient facts. In his notes, the judge also alludes to an agreement allegedly signed between the companies waiving claims to any bitcoin-related technology created.  Kirwan writes:  ""The letter thus does not clearly release defendant Casares from any or all of the breaches alleged here, and the demurrer does not lie to only part of a cause of action. Even if it were assumed for purposes of argument that it did, that would not absolve Casares of all potential liability ... Among the fraudulent acts alleged in the third cause of action is that defendant Casares misrepresented his 'personal bitcoin storage business' in order to obtain a letter he could later claim was a release from liability related to his disclosure of confidential information.""  The judge goes on to note that LifeLock has alleged Casares ""misrepresented"" Xapo to obtain a letter he could claim released him from liability for pursuing the venture. LifeLock further has disputed whether its representative had the authority to sign the letter.  The defendants in the case will next be required to attend a hearing on 24th July.

42426414,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNbrh,1436812320,Bitcoin Cloud Mining Service Collapse Exposes Customer Data,"A bitcoin mining service called Cloudminr.io has collapsed, resulting in the loss of bitcoins, the publishing of personal user information and accusations of fraud.  Over the weekend, the main Cloudminr page was altered with an offer to sell a list of passwords, email addresses and usernames for 79,267 individuals. One thousand entries from that list were published on the site at the time. The website is currently offline.  Cloudminr, which its owners previously said was hosted in Norway, had been offering mining contracts since November of last year. The service drew criticism for its operational opacity and accusations that Cloudminr was a mining-related Ponzi scheme soon followed.  On 6th July, the primary Bitcoin Talk account for the service claimed that a hack had taken place. Payouts hadn't happened, it was asserted, because of internal concern over the legitimacy of the payment addresses on file.  The message continued:  ""Part of the bitcoins went to hackers addresses instead of our own payment addresses. Currently we are looking for any logs related to the hack and estimating the losses. We need to create a new website from scratch on new servers as hackers usually leave backdoors for later access. Stay tuned.""  The representative, identified only as Adrian, claimed the service was the target of a smear campaign and that access to email and social media contacts had been lost. No further updates have been made by the Cloudminr account since 6th July.  Payout issues appear to have dogged customers of the service, soliciting complaints of underperforming in mid-June. The last payout to Cloudminr customers – which were delayed following a claimed platform shutdown – took place on 28th June.  Whether more information surfaces remains to be seen. For now, customers and observers commenting on the collapse have chalked up the situation as another mining scam to run its course.

42426422,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNc5h,1436806059,Report Highlights 'Areas of Concern' in Ripple Protocol Design,"A report commissioned by secretive distributed ledger consulting group R3CEV and authored by bitcoin developer Peter Todd has raised questions about the ability of the Ripple protocol to serve the needs of global financial institutions in its current iteration.  The release notably comes at a time when Ripple Labs, the corporate entity overseeing the network, has been increasingly attracting the attention of legacy financial institutions interested in bitcoin and the wider blockchain ecosystem. Ripple Labs has raised $37m to date, and partnered with Commonwealth Bank, Fidor Bank and Western Union.  In a companion report, R3CEV researcher Jo Lang asserts that the intent of the effort is to provide clarity to financial institutions as they conduct due diligence on companies and solutions in the nascent industry.  Though critical of some aspects of the company's approach, Lang ultimately found that the problems identified in Ripple's consensus algorithm are not unique to its protocol, writing:  ""When taken as a whole, the risks and indirect incentives discussed in this and the companion paper have the potential to position Ripple Labs as a new trusted third party within the global payments landscape.""  The wording of the report suggests that other evaluations will soon follow, all with the intent of providing a deep dive look into the technological capabilities of the industry's most well-known blockchains and ledgers.  R3CEV's team is led by former Wall Street financial markets expert and managing partner David Rutter, and the group boasts Perkins Coie senior counsel Jacob Farber, Open Mustard Seed chief architect Patrick Deegan and bitcoin industry critic and pundit Tim Swanson as advisors.  Areas of concern  Although it includes praise for Ripple Labs, the R3 companion report to Todd's research identified a number of ""areas of concern"" for large financial institutions regarding the open-source technology offered by the company.  Specifically, R3 highlighted its belief that if more than 20% of Ripple's network nodes do not agree, the system's ledger would effectively fork. This issue, the report said, would be compounded at scale due to the differing settlement needs of the financial institutions potentially seeking to use its payment network.  Perhaps most troubling given the decentralizing nature of the technology, R3 concluded Ripple would not likely result in any significant changes to the currently centralized settlement model.  ""The highly centralized model that the Ripple Network encourages fails to eliminate any need for a trusted third party but rather creates a new type of third party,"" the report reads.  R3 also suggested that the use of a cryptographic token (XRP) by the consensus algorithm effectively creates an ""incentive misalignment"" that puts it at odds with nodes operating on the Ripple network.  ""Ripple still holds the majority of XRP, and it is in their favor for its value to increase,"" the report continues. ""Ripple justifies XRP as an 'anti-spam mechanism' to deter transactions... However, as the volume of transactions increases the server load, transaction speed is slowed while the cost of the transaction and the amount of required XRP continues to increase.""  Ripple's original founder, Jed McCaleb, has notably been involved in a number of high-profile battles over his ability to sell XRP holdings.  Further, R3 suggested that Ripple lacks a ""clearly defined validator incentive"" that would encourage the number of nodes on the network overseeing transactions. Ultimately, the report added, financial institutions would have to weigh these pros and cons when seeking to leverage the company's solutions.  Todd dissects Ripple  In his 16-page analysis, Todd begins by explaining the overall architecture of Ripple, providing an overview of how it has evolved from its original concept of attempting to record debt relationships to a global ledger of transactions and account balances.  After explaining the architecture of Ripple's ledger, Todd dives into a list of open questions that remain regarding the company's approach to network consensus.  In particular, he contends that it is not clear how account balances on the Ripple network can be negative, if it supports single payment verification (SPV) or if there is the ability to shard the Ripple blockchain so that it becomes a series of independent, yet interoperable blockchains, an attribute he argued would be beneficial for the protocol's scalability.  Embedded throughout are insights into how Ripple differs from the bitcoin blockchain, its distributed payment network, such as how the network requires changes to codebase for technology that can be implemented through software elsewhere.  ""For instance, while on bitcoin the implementation of multisig was possible without modification to the protocol in Ripple the lack of extension capabilities such as scripting require a consensus-critical change,"" Todd writes.  Todd concludes that the blockchain technology underpinning Ripple is ""relatively uninteresting"", but that it is currently unclear whether there is the proper alignment of incentives for the network to come to a global consensus on activities carried out on the ledger.  ""A key question that should be answered in future work is if the goals of the Ripple system need global consensus at all? If global consensus can be avoided, or at least its use minimized, many of these issues may go away,"" he adds.  Attack scenarios  Todd next walks readers through a number of theoretical attacks that could take place against the Ripple protocol, discussing his estimates of the cost, scope, duration and probability of the scenarios.  Those discussed include the risk of a ""consensus split"", whereby Ripple is unable to process transactions or a fork is created that allows the attacker to execute invalid transactions. Todd projects that Ripple could survive a consensus split that is either malicious or accidental ""fairly quickly"", due to the ability of the bitcoin network to overcome the scenario in 2013.  A ""transaction flood"" is also discussed, though Todd details how the Ripple protocol's use of a native token, XRP, could deter such efforts. Any attacker wanting to flood the network would need to purchase XRP to execute the transactions, driving up fees in the short term.  Perhaps the most glaring, Todd's writing infers, is the damage that could be done due to a ""software backdoor"", as he finds that Ripple ""does not provide a secure way to download any of their software"".  ""This is a serious omission that has lead to significant monetary losses in the past. Ripple Labs should be following industry best-practice by signing git commits and tags as well as PGP signing their Ubuntu packages,"" Todd added.  Todd ends by highlighting the potential real-world implications of these attacks in an elaborate scenario involving a dispute between the Russian government and Shell Oil, forecasting how these parties might attempt to achieve their aims through coercion on the network.  Reaction  Reaction of the paper, released on Saturday, has so far been subdued, with some criticism being voiced on XRP Talk, a community forum dedicated to the Ripple protocol.  While concerns were raised, however, the report was viewed by some contributors as ""the first serious, non-malicious attempt at pointing out perceived weaknesses in the system"".  Other commenters took issue with the criticism that it is unclear what the incentive is for nodes to participate in the ecosystem and pointed to potential problem areas that are being worked on by the development community.  At press time, Ripple Labs had not issued a response to the paper on its official blog.

42426423,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNc7h,1436796819,"SWIFT Institute Offers €15,000 for Blockchain Securities Research","The SWIFT Institute is offering research teams €15,000 to investigate how bitcoin's underlying distributed ledger technology could impact the global securities ecosystem.  The institute is a financial services research group backed by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which provides a network for global financial institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions.  The grant follows the SWIFT Institute's call for information on the risks associated with bitcoin as a digital currency in 2014 and comes amid a broader shift in emphasis on the technology's use cases.  In its call for applications, SWIFT cites experiments currently in operation at UBS Bank and Nasdaq as evidence of the increasing interest in harnessing blockchain technology for more enterprise-level financial needs.  Outlining the potential applications of the technology, SWIFT writes:  ""Settlement of a securities transaction typically takes two days, often longer, to complete. Blockchain and the distributed ledger have the ability to securely and transparently move securities in seconds or minutes, with automatic clearing and settlement upon trade execution. The theory sounds impressive and desirable. But it is practical?""  SWIFT indicated it is interested to learn what the securities transaction lifecycle would look like on a blockchain, whether it would involve intermediaries such as central securities depositories (CSDs) and if any of today's more widely used blockchains could provide a viable solution to the needs of global securities processing.  ""What are the implications of having one part of the lifecycle on blockchain (say, clearing and settlement), whilst others may not be on blockchain (say, issuance or trade execution)? What is the impact on incumbents in the transaction lifecycle (eg custodians, CSDs, etc)?"" The call for applications asks.  Those who wish to apply must submit a resume and bio and a description of their research project by 7th August.  For more information, read the full grant description.

42426424,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNc9h,1436789446,"Bitcoin Price Surpasses $300, Drops After Greek Bailout","The bitcoin price surpassed the $300 mark over the weekend reaching its highest level since 10th March at 15:00 (UTC), according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  Bitcoin's value reached $300.32 at 09:15 on 12th July, spiking to $313.77 at 14:45 on 12th July.  Despite hovering over $300 throughout the whole of Sunday, the price dropped by 4.8% from $304.22 this morning (07:00) to $289.48.  Emerging theories  Bitcoin has been touted as a safe haven asset during times of economic turmoil, which, according to some, has seen the digital currency gain increasing momentum in the wake of the Greek crisis.  Some media reports have suggested Greece's likely exit from the Eurozone could be behind the cryptocurrency's recent price movements as people look to it as a viable alternative to the euro or the drachma – the country's former currency.  Despite a lack of consensus as to whether the Greek crisis has really influenced bitcoin's price movements, it must be noted that today's decline in value coincided with the announcement that Greece had reached an agreement with Eurozone leaders over a possible third bailout.  The agreement is likely to see the Southern European country keep the euro, thus potentially eradicating uncertainty over a future currency and, in turn, reducing the need for people to look for an alternative means of exchange. This could, as a result, have driven today's bitcoin price decline.  Some commentators took to social media to reinforce the connection between the events in Greece and bitcoin's price movements.  A tweet sent from the Twitter account belonging to Charlie Shrem, a bitcoin entrepreneur and the digital currency's 'first felon', currently serving a two year prison sentence for aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business, added to the speculation, suggesting that fellow Greek inmates were showing an increased interest in the digital currency.    #GreekCrisis continues and Greek inmates now asking me how to buy Bitcoin while in prison. #Bitcoin@rogerkver@ErikVoorhees        — Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) July 12, 2015    Looking at the data  Some bitcoin exchanges reported a surge in EUR/BTC trades from Greece in the wake of the country's crisis.  According to Finextra  , Bitstamp reported an increase of 79% on their 10-week average, which drew some criticism from redditors who questioned whether the exchange previously had a lot of Greece-based customers.  Whilst other exchanges also reported a notable increase in EUR/BTC purchases from within Greece, these surges could be attributed to the fact that some companies – such as Coinbase – canceled fees for euro trades in a seeming attempt to drive bitcoin purchases.  According to Bitcoinity, a data website which offers an insight into the trading volumes of the major bitcoin exchanges, the EUR/BTC trading volume reached unprecedented levels in the last six months, peaking on 12th July.  Price predictions  As a highly volatile digital currency, bitcoin's price has previously captivated the attention of both skeptics and enthusiasts in the past.  Just last week, a new report by Wedbush Securities predicted the price of bitcoin would reach $400 during the next year.  At the time of press, bitcoin's price stood at $282.16.
