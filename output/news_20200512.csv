42383704,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9Ud,1589327555,Blockchain Bites: Will Crypto See Any of the CBDC Action?,"Top Shelf    The world is growing more comfortable with the idea of digital assets, with several nations stepping forward today to discuss the designs of central bank digital currency (CBDC) programs.      Speaking at Consensus: Distributed's Future of Fiat Workshop, central bank executives sent smoke signals regarding CBDC pilot programs. Harvesh Seegolam, of the Bank of Mauritius, the world’s youngest central bank governor, said the island nation is looking to issue a retail digital asset distributed through the established banking system.      You're reading Blockchain Bites: Consensus Edition a twice daily roundup of all the notable news out of Consensus: Distributed. You can sign up for this, and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      This could be a lobbying moment for tech firms and the crypto industry to get in on the action. But Simon Scorer, Bank of England’s Senior Fintech Specialist, said the bank will not be limited by the current crop of technological options. ""We're clear that any choice of technology around a CBDC should be led by a set of requirements and not the other way around,"" he said. That is, if they move forward on a digital pound.      Privacy advocates raised the alarm over the growing sentiment in favor of CBDCs. According to a recent poll from the Bank for International Settlements, a club for central banks, 80% of surveyed countries are in some stage of CBDC research or development. Whatever form these pilots take will walk the balance between privacy and greater visibility into the financial system.      Sheila Warren, head of blockchain at the World Economic Forum, said CBDCs will deliver on promises of more granular financial tracking mechanisms that authorities have made no secret about wanting. But this also opens the door for privacy coins to come into fruition.      As Elena Sofia Giralt said in None of Your Business: Why Our New Virtual Lives Need Crypto Privacy, privacy is not just a blanket release but something you should have a choice over.    The CoinDesk 50    Besu, the Marriage of Ethereum and Hyperledger There have been dalliances between Hyperledger and Ethereum over the years. The latest lovechild, Besu, was designed from the ground up to let large enterprises connect to the public Ethereum blockchain. There are benefits on both sides. On the public, or permissionless, side of things, Ethereum has the largest developer community in crypto, building tools corporations may not even know they need yet. On the other, Hyperledger’s permissioned blockchain is where many of the corporations looking at this tech feel most comfortable. Ethereum’s true believers have always viewed big business using the public mainnet as a signifier for their “world computer” status. With Besu, that claim may become a reality.

Media Diet    JPMorgan Bank Takes on Coinbase, Gemini as Its First Crypto Exchange Customers The move by JPMorgan is notable in a nation where banking services are hard to come by for any firms dealing with cryptocurrencies, which are viewed as a high risk by the banking industry. Accounts for the two crypto firms were approved last month, the sources said, and are now in use.      US Banking Regulator Suggests Federal Licensing Framework for Crypto Firms Brian Brooks, chief operating officer of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the nation's national bank overseer, said he believes crypto companies could fall under a federal licensing regime – if they provide what can be described as payment services. If this is true, it could help ease the hodgepodge of state laws that prohibit some companies from operating in certain jurisdictions.      IBM Blockchain to Offer Decentralized Smart Contract Option The blue-chip IT firm said the IBM Blockchain Platform would upgrade its system to provide a new decentralized governance option and smart contract functionality, by porting over changes made in its base layer Hyperledger Fabric 2.0.      UAE Bank Opens Bangladesh Remittance Corridor Using Ripple’s Blockchain Tech United Arab Emirates-based retail and business bank, RAKBank, is expanding its remittance routes to Bangladesh using Ripple's blockchain technology.      Binance Invests in Regulated Indonesian Crypto Exchange Binance is making a bet on the potential of the Indonesian crypto market, making an undisclosed investment into the Jakarta-based and regulated exchange, Tokocrypto. There is no independent data showing just how big the local crypto market is, but sources speaking to Reuters in February put it at possibly the same size as the country's stock market, despite rigid regulations.

42383682,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y97z,1589326298,Vitalik Buterin Clarifies Remarks on Expected Launch Date of Eth 2.0,"Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has clarified his remarks on the expected launch date of Eth 2.0.      During a Monday appearance at CoinDesk’s Consensus: Distributed, Buterin appeared to confirm a July launch date put forth in February by the lead researcher of the Eth. 2.0 project, Justin Drake.      CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael J. Casey asked if the overhaul to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was ""really coming in July. Are we ready for it?""      ""I think so, yeah,"" Buterin said, before rattling off milestones achieved so far.      Eth 2.0 testnet coordinator Afri Schoedon countered Buterin’s statements on Twitter. “The final spec is not implemented in any client and we didn’t launch a coordinated testnet yet,” he wrote, adding:      In response, Buterin tweeted, “Yeah I did not say July. Perhaps the question contained the word July but I did not hear July when it was asked.” He then sent a second tweet, saying, “OK I definitely should have heard July in the question, it was my mistake.”      Schoedon is coordinating the Schlesi multi-client testnets, one of many test versions of the overhaul preceding Eth 2.0’s eventual launch. He has said Eth 2.0 Phase 0 could launch as late as 2021.      When reached by CoinDesk on Tuesday, Buterin offered a statement:    “I re-listened to the interview. The question indeed contained ‘July’, I don’t recall hearing ‘July’ so it sounds like it’s my fault for mishearing. Apologies for that,” Buterin said via email. “My actual stance is that eth2 is ‘on track’ in that there aren’t any unexpected bumps in the road, testnets are coming along, etc, but I defer to the client devs on timelines and if they are now saying ‘Q3’ more broadly then I believe them.”    Eth 2.0 represents a fundamental shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm like Bitcoin’s to proof-of-stake (PoS).      The transition, which was included in the early plans of Ethereum, has grown to be a contentious topic following delays and missed deadlines.

With daily active bitcoin addresses at the highest level since 2018, interest in bitcoin could be heading even higher.      The world’s first cryptocurrency is now trading above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish technical indicator. This reversal comes after a huge 10% drop in price on May 10 that led to bearish sentiment ahead of the bitcoin halving, which occurred May 11 at 19:23 UTC (3:23 p.m. ET). At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 1% over 24 hours at $8,829.      While the halving was pretty much a non-event for most traders, many are keeping an eye on various bitcoin-related statistics beyond price. Difficulty, which determines how demanding it is for mining machines to mine a bitcoin block, is one example.      ""Definitely looking forward to seeing what the next difficulty adjustment is,"" post-bitcoin halving, Ethan Vera, CFO of mining company Luxor, said during a Consensus:Distributed session Monday. The next difficulty adjustment, which occurs roughly every two weeks, is due May 19.      Read more: Dull Bitcoin Halving Salvaged by Satoshi Tribute in Block 629,999      Another metric to watch is the number of active bitcoin addresses. On May 11, the number of active addresses on the bitcoin network totaled 943,869 - the highest number since Jan. 28, 2018, according to data from Glassnode. That was during bitcoin’s frothy 2017-2018 bubble, when prices went as high as $19,915 on spot exchanges like Coinbase.      “When you read that the halving is bullish for bitcoin, it has to be taken with a grain of salt,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, a quantitative crypto trading firm. “It may be bullish, but only if interest for bitcoin remains over that long term.”      Those who became interested in bitcoin as a result of its halving might be tempted to stick around if the price increases.      “Just like the price surges in 2017 that really brought bitcoin to the wider consciousness, the halving could again see a new wave of ordinary investors who are not steeped in computer science or technology,” said Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro.      Active addresses can’t be attributed to individual holders because exchanges and wallets often generate multiple keys for users. However, all those addresses do mean more activity is occurring on Bitcoin’s network.      Read more: JPMorgan Takes on Coinbase, Gemini as First Crypto Exchange Customers      Of course, some of that growing interest could have nefarious intent, said Constantin Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital. The rise in active addresses could be due to things other than buying bitcoin, such as ""money laundering and the need to obfuscate chain analysis,” he told CoinDesk.      Although it is hard to pin down exactly what all these active addresses are doing, at least some of them have increased trading using more intricate strategies, said ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz. “In 2020, there are more sophisticated institutional traders in the market. They can use futures and options to build complex trades.”      Active addresses can be an indicator of increased usage and interest in bitcoin, but it doesn’t just necessarily mean “number go up,” added Lifchitz. “I don't expect a straight line up for bitcoin in the days ahead. I don't see a drastic 30% jump in price.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are in the green on Tuesday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, gained 1.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).      Cryptocurrency gainers include stellar (XLM) up a mouth-watering 11%, zcash (ZEC) in the green 6.7% and cardano (ADA) climbing 5.7%.

42383676,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4rn,1589316608,"17,000 People Have Filed Claims for Refunds From QuadrigaCX, Auditor EY Says","Nearly 17,000 individual claims have been filed for the remaining assets of defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, totaling anywhere from $167 million to more than $300 million depending on how the asset are valued.      According to a document published Tuesday by Quadriga's bankruptcy monitor, Ernst & Young, over the past year 16,959 proofs of claims have been filed by the exchange's former users, claiming assets in bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin SV (BSV), bitcoin gold (BTG), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), Canadian dollars (CDN) and U.S. dollars (USD). The totals are based on claims filed through May 6, 2020.      Although EY asked affected users to file claims by Aug. 31 of last year, it acknowledged there was no hard deadline; it continues to receive and process claims, though ""the volume of new claim submissions has slowed considerably.""      EY said it would convert all amounts to a Canadian dollar equivalent before distributing, but did not say how it would value the cryptocurrencies.      The firm took over control of QuadrigaCX on Feb. 5, 2019, days after it filed for civil rehabilitation, a form of protection from creditors for firms trying to survive. The Canadian dollar equivalent for the assets at February 2019 prices would be $234 million ($167 million USD). However, if the cryptos are valued at present prices, the total value could be about $431 million CDN ($307 million USD).      Regarding the claims themselves, EY said it had not finished verifying all of the documents it received. Some contain technical deficiencies, meaning they may not be signed or contain some other small error. Other claims showed values that differed from the ones Quadriga had listed in its database, the document said.      The auditor is working to reconcile the differences.      EY has yet to provide a timeline for when users might expect to see their funds returned.      A note written by Miller Thomson, the court-appointed law firm representing Quadriga's users, said the Canada Revenue Agency, the country's tax collector, needed to make a claim against the exchange before any funds could be distributed.      ""As Quadriga failed to file tax returns in the ordinary course of business, the determination of a Canada Revenue Agency tax claim against Quadriga is necessary prior to the Trustee declaring any distribution to Affected Users or creditors generally, as tax claims rank [on equal footing] with the unsecured claims of Affected Users,"" the note said.      Read more: CoinDesk Live: 2019’s Most Catastrophic Crypto Caper      It's unclear how long this would take. While a court has given EY permission to turn over documents to the tax collector, Tuesday's document said this process had not been completed, and the CRA has not yet begun its audit, EY said.      QuadrigaCX went into bankruptcy last year after its founder and CEO Gerald Cotten, who maintained all of the company's private keys and systems, was reported dead.      EY, which was tasked with recovering assets, found that Cotten appears to have used customer funds to margin trade small-cap cryptocurrencies and buy personal luxury goods, including a private plane and boats.      Quadriga's now-former users have been casting doubt as to whether Cotten is indeed dead, and have asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to exhume his body.

42383677,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4t3,1589310061,Stablecoin Supply Breaks $10B as Traders Demand Dollars Over Bitcoin,"The value of assets for all stablecoins surpassed $10 billion Tuesday, having surged by over 70% in just two months, according to Coin Metrics. Stablecoin supply growth comes as more cryptocurrency traders choose to trade alternative cryptocurrencies (or altcoins) using dollar-backed digital tokens instead of bitcoin.      Most of the stablecoin growth comes from tether, which represents almost 90% of the total stablecoin supply. The largest tether markets measured by traded volume are supported by two Asia-based exchanges, Binance and Huobi, according to CoinGecko. Both exchanges support nearly 200 different cryptocurrencies, which makes them attractive platforms for altcoin traders.      See also: Stablecoins Push Ethereum’s Transaction Count to Highest Since July 2019      Almost every exchange offers the choice to trade assets priced in different quote currencies, usually dollars or bitcoins, which determine the value of alternative cryptocurrencies.      Altcoin traders have historically preferred to use bitcoin or even ether as the currency that prices other tokens. But during the past two years, that trend has shifted significantly. Now they mostly trade against stablecoins.      A growth in trading stablecoin quote pairs coincides with considerable overall growth in total altcoin trading volume, according to data from Nomics. But that growth excludes ether and bitcoin quote pairs, which have mostly stayed below their volume highs made in late 2017.      The stability of dollar-backed tokens is a primary advantage over using bitcoin as the quote currency, according to one analyst.      ""Stablecoins have always had an edge over bitcoin as a base trading pair because of its inherent price stability,” said Aditya Das, cryptocurrency markets analyst at Brave New Coin. “Stability means traders feel safer holding a stock of it and using it as a liquidity tool for trading.”      Demand for stablecoin quote pairs in cryptocurrency spot markets has influenced derivatives products as well. For example, BitMEX, the second-largest cryptocurrency derivatives market by open interest, is keenly aware of the shift in demand for more stablecoin-denominated trading products.      ""We have noticed that traders prefer to trade pairs with USD-like denominations as dominance for altcoin trading moved from XBT-based Poloniex to USD- and USDT-based Binance and Coinbase,” said Greg Dwyer, head of business development at BitMEX.      See also: As Tether Supply Hits Record Highs, It Moves Away From Original Home      Earlier this year, BitMEX launched two new futures products: XRPUSD perpetual futures and ETHUSD quanto futures.      “An upwards trend in appetite for stablecoin-quoted pairs makes perfect sense to me,” said Catherine Coley, CEO of Binance.US. “Before and during the 2017 bull market, you had the bitcoin OGs trading in bitcoin-quoted pairs,” she said.

The announcement comes following Kaleido’s emergence as a standalone company last month. The startup revealed Tuesday it was spun out of ConsenSys, the Ethereum-based venture studio founded by Joe Lubin.      “We spun out April 1. It's been exciting for us to take that step forward,” Sophia Lopez, Kaleido’s chief operating officer, told CoinDesk in an email. “In addition to the partnership with R3 and going live with Corda available on the Kaleido platform this afternoon, we have launched the new V2 of our platform and website.”      ConsenSys has been doing some serious belt-tightening of late, cutting about 90 employees last month. A company spokesperson confirmed that Kaleido had been spun out.      See also: Nasdaq Is Using R3’s Corda for Managing Digital Assets      There has definitely been a coming together of large blockchain factions of late, particularly between the Ethereum and Hyperledger communities. It’s not entirely novel for R3 to touch on Ethereum: there was a partnership between Corda and Ethereum-based Truffle last summer, for instance. But generally, the communities have kept their distance. (R3 CTO Richard Brown has stated on numerous occasions that full-broadcast blockchains like Ethereum are a fundamentally inappropriate architecture for enterprises.)      Kaleido provides so-called “consortium-as-a-service,” deploying blockchain networks via multiple cloud and hybrid platforms, and is working with the likes of Microsoft Azure and AWS.      Under the new partnership, R3’s Corda software and “CorDapps” will run on Kaleido’s digital platform.      Kaleido also plays host to the commodities-focused trade finance blockchain Komgo, which includes Citi, ING, MUFG Bank, Shell and others. It is also involved in a payments project with Union Bank in the Philippines, whose future has become unclear after ConsenSys shut down operations in India and the Philippines late last year.      See also: New Layoffs Hit Ethereum Incubator ConsenSys      “Now is the time for consortia to develop stronger business models and position themselves successfully for the long term,” R3 co-founder Todd McDonald said in a statement. “The new offering we are announcing today will support business ecosystems moving into production faster than ever before, to reap the benefits of more efficient cost structures and faster time to value.”      “Enterprises are looking for ways to unlock trapped value and transform risk into opportunity in their B2B networks,” added Kaleido founder Steve Cerveny. “Kaleido and R3 are solving these challenges by enabling customers to use the Kaleido consortium-as-a-service offering powered by R3’s leading enterprise blockchain technology, resulting in business networks moving from zero to one in record time.”      Zack Seward contributed reporting.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/12/r3-corda-partners-with-kaleido-after-ethereum-startup-spins-out-of-consensys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/741f558e81ef659ca8accff81349c66da954dac9-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking briefly during Consensus: Distributed's Future of Fiat Workshop, the BoE's senior fintech specialist, Simon Scorer, underlined the U.K. central bank will not negotiate on its design principles with tech providers, should BoE ever move forward with developing a digital pound.      See also: Mauritius Central Banker Confirms Island’s Digital Currency Plans      ""We're clear that any choice of technology around a CBDC should be led by a set of requirements and not the other way around,"" Scorer said. ""We would not let the choice of technology dictate the design; instead, what we would do is decide what functionality the CBDC requires, what our design principles are, and then we would choose what technology is most appropriate.""      Scorer's presentation at Consensus: Distributed was a run-through of the bank's CBDC discussion paper, which was published earlier this year, and therefore reiterated some of the proposed design principles of which industry observers had already been made aware.      The most notable is the idea that any provisional CBDC would be run as a public-private partnership that would provide citizens with a base-level of aspects to a digital currency without cutting out private initiatives such as libra and thus hampering competition.      See also: Private Companies Could Play Role in Digital Currency Issuance, Bank of England Says      But the key difference in today's discussion, compared to previous ones, was the tone.

42383664,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4dx,1589303012,Telegram Abandons TON Blockchain Project After Court Fight With SEC,"TON is officially dead.      Telegram founder Pavel Durov wrote in his public channel Tuesday that the Telegram Open Network (TON) project would be discontinued due to the company's ongoing legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      ""Today is a sad day for us here at Telegram. We are announcing the discontinuation of our blockchain project. Below is a summary of what it was and why we had to abandon it,"" he wrote.      An accompanying blog post said the SEC's winning of a preliminary injunction in a U.S. court led to the decision because it barred Telegram from launching TON or distributing its gram tokens. The move is an abrupt shift for Telegram, which said less than two weeks ago it would be launching the network in April 2021.      Telegram announced at the end of April its investors could receive 72% of their funds back immediately, or 110% back in a year, once TON had launched. U.S. investors would not be able to take the latter option, Telegram said in a later update. In Tuesday's post, Durov did not say whether all investors would be immediately refunded or how much they'd receive.      Read more: Making Sense of the SEC’s Case Against Telegram      Durov referenced third-party efforts to launch independent versions of the TON blockchain, but said no Telegram employee is involved with these projects.      ""While networks based on the technology we built for TON may appear, we won't have any affiliation with them and are unlikely to ever support them in any way. So be careful, and don't let anyone mislead you,"" he wrote.      TON Labs, a startup that had been running a test network, launched its own version of the network last week, dubbed ""Free TON,"" after Telegram announced further delays.      Durov also took aim at the injunction barring gram distribution worldwide, noting that the judge in his case had indicated if grams are issued, a U.S. citizen might still be able to access them.      ""Sadly, the U.S. judge is right about one thing: We, the people outside the U.S., can vote for our presidents and elect our parliaments, but we are still dependent on the United States when it comes to finance and technology (luckily not coffee),"" he wrote.      The dollar and its influence on the global financial system give the U.S. immense power, Durov said, adding that the country can also influence Apple and Google to remove apps from their respective app stores.      ""So yes, it is true that other countries do not have full sovereignty over what to allow on their territory,"" he wrote.      Read more: Sidestepping Telegram, Devs and Validators Launch Fork of TON Blockchain      Durov closed his post with an appeal to decentralization.

42383673,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4pH,1589299604,CipherTrace Wants to Guide Central Banks on Their Digital Currency Projects,"CipherTrace, a blockchain analytics partner of governments and cryptocurrency exchanges, is pitching itself to a fresh clientele: central banks.      The crypto investigations firm announced Tuesday it is establishing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative. As described by Chief Financial Analyst John Jefferies, the outreach effort will seek to place CipherTrace in the growing conversation around designing and securing CBDCs.      Part of the initiative will center on business outreach, Jefferies said. Partnering with even one central bank would be a lucrative business proposition for CipherTrace. With 80% of central banks polled by the Bank for International Settlements reporting they are studying CBDCs, and with research and development by and large still in the early stages, now is a good time for the firm to get a foot in the door.      Influencing the values guiding that development process is another objective, according to Jefferies. The initiative will focus on bringing privacy, anti-money laundering safeguards and security into CBDCs – three design pillars that also have ramifications on day-to-day use.      Digital currency carries none of the inherent privacy safeguards of physical cash, which Jefferies said he favored “because I don’t like to be tracked.” But that preference died with the coronavirus pandemic, he said. He doesn’t use cash anymore.      COVID-19 is changing how people view money in a quite radical way. First at the user level, with consumers including Jefferies eschewing hand-to-hand exchange, but also at the decision-making level, with monetary authorities including the European Central Bank announcing that it will consider the lessons of the pandemic in its CBDC debate.      But when the digital future of money arrives, Jefferies said he and CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans “both believe in transactional privacy for people.” Neither want a situation where governments with a digital fiat currency can flip anonymity on and off like a switch, a possibility Jefferies raised as a concern with China's digital yuan project.      “In a modern, free society that's not really acceptable,” he said. “Like, I'm personally not going to be eager to carry a digital dollar, a digital euro, if I knew that there's a back door.”      A third goal of the CipherTrace initiative will be to lobby for including blockchain tech in CBDC design.      Some CBDC projects already live on a blockchain. The e-krona trials in Sweden run on R3 Corda, for example. But Sveriges Riksbank is an outlier – many other central banks remain skeptical of a design choice they see as antithetical to centralized control.      This could be a make-or-break CBDC design choice for the company. CipherTrace is a blockchain analytics firm: its tools crawl distributed ledgers, not centralized ones.      Read more: Central Bankers From Canada, Netherlands, Ukraine Call Blockchain Unnecessary for Digital Fiat      As such, CipherTrace will pitch the banks on the “security attributes that distributed ledgers bring to the table that they may not be aware of or may not fully appreciate,” Jefferies said.      That's not to say the firm will rule out non-blockchain-based CBDC projects, though. It will work with central banks regardless of their architecture choice and pose the same questions it otherwise would, on security, anti-money laundering and user privacy.      CipherTrace would also remind central banks of what “blockchain analytics itself can bring to the party” from a monitoring standpoint.      “It takes a little while for people to understand that the traceability you get with digital currencies is far beyond what you can have with traditional fiat,” Jefferies said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/12/ciphertrace-wants-to-guide-central-banks-on-their-digital-currency-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cfa9e07299d053060b5cfd620feac317aaf8bfa8-1200x809.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference, Governor Harvesh Seegolam said the Republic of Mauritius would be embarking on a pilot in the near future, though he declined to share many details.      ""At the level of the Bank of Mauritius, we're currently working on a project and very shortly we'll be making announcements ... with respect to a potential introduction of a CBDC,"" he said.      His comments confirm that the island nation's exploration into the issuance of a CBDC, first revealed last November by former governor Yandraduth Googoolye, is progressing. The nation has been fairly crypto-savvy, creating a licensing regime for custodians and issuing guidance on security tokens last year.      Read more: Mauritius to License Crypto Custodians Starting in March      Seegolam said any CBDC would have to be distributed through the established banking system, even if the central bank issues the actual currency, to avoid the risk of destabilizing the island's financial system.      His panel also featured Lord Meghnaud Desai of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) and Greg Medcraft of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development discussing the different needs and considerations central banks have to focus on for CBDCs. Desai said these considerations need to include the fact that poorer populations may prefer cash, and make heavy use of international remittances.    Island time    The Republic of Mauritius isn't the only island nation looking to issue its own CBDC.      The Marshall Islands has been working to develop its own CBDC for years, having begun work on the project in February 2018. It recently tapped Algorand as the underlying blockchain infrastructure for the token.

The Marshall Islands has a population of fewer than 60,000.      Seegolam indicated the launch of Mauritius' CBDC isn't necessarily imminent.      ""I think we are in a phase where we are all thinking about CBDCs, we are all very interested in introducing CBDCs but there are key fundamental questions that have to be answered first for us to be able to proceed,"" Seegolam said.

42383668,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4iz,1589294213,FireBlocks CEO Pours Cold Water on Libra Excitement,"Enthusiasm for libra, the cryptocurrency backed by Facebook, swirled at Consensus: Distributed Tuesday morning, but Michael Shaulov, CEO and co-founder of crypto transaction platform FireBlocks, was happy to damp it down.      Host Ran Goldi, CEO of liquidity provider First – which has the motto ""We believe in Libra"" on its website – re-emphasized his position very early on: ""I will not be surprised if we see other stablecoins launch on Libra,"" he said within the show's first 15 minutes.      When Goldi wheeled out Shaulov, he pointed out FireBlocks had already facilitated more than $7 billion worth of trades every month. ""I know that by looking at your website, I saw Genesis [Genesis Trading, CoinDesk's sister company] and I saw other large liquidity providers, and I'm sure they're going to be a part of the Libra ecosystem,"" he effused.      See also: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      Goldi then asked his first question, a ""spicy"" one as he called it, about why FireBlocks hadn't decided to join the Libra Association, even though its main rival, custodial provider Anchorage, is a founding member.      Shaulov half-smiled. The room he was in wasn't very well lit, which gave him a menacing presence. ""That's actually a very good question,"" he said, before quickly refuting the idea FireBlocks and Anchorage were, in any sense, competitors.      Then Shaulov turned to the main point: ""We were sort of considering whether we should be part of the [Libra] Association or not, and I think that, in time, we sort of realized that actually it's not clear that being part of the Association would really help us.""      Shaulov didn't elaborate and a stony silence filled the channel. Eight companies, including Mastercard, Vodafone and Visa, have bailed on the Libra Association since its inception not more than a year ago.      Maybe aware he had single-handedly killed the pro-libra atmosphere, Shaulove quickly added: ""If we were part of the Association, I wouldn't be on this panel.""      ""I'll take that as a compliment,"" Goldi sniffed.      See also: Vodafone Is the Latest Big Company to Quit Facebook-Founded Libra Association      Goldi might have hoped Shaulov would have shared his enthusiasm. Earlier in the chat, CoinGecko co-founder TM Lee had criticized Facebook and the Libra Association for spooking regulators with its original white paper. ""Obviously we've done many mistakes,"" Goldi conceded.      Shaulov argued stablecoins, more broadly, had exciting potential, but when Goldi asked what were some of the key features missing from libra, Shaulov didn't need to pause for thought.

We kicked off our virtual event with a 24-hour non-stop live stream featuring more than 50 programs and dozens of esteemed guests.      But the conference is far from over. Today features just as many panels, workshops and presentations as yesterday. We’ve just decided to call it a night at 10:30 p.m. ET.      You're reading Blockchain Bites: Consensus Edition a twice daily roundup of all the notable news out of Consensuse Distributed. You can sign up for this, and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      Here's what my colleague Christine Kim looks forward to today:    Consensus: Distributed continues today for its second full day of virtual programming. You can bet that the lineup of speakers and panelists are equally as decorated as yesterday’s. Here’s what I’ll be watching for on our livestream broadcasting and social networking platform Brella: 1. What’s going on with the crypto markets in Asia and Europe? If you’re a night owl like I am, I highly recommend tuning into the panels about the cryptocurrency industry in China and India. It’s a perspective on bitcoin and crypto not often talked about or shared on Western media outlets. Same goes for the panel about capital controls in Europe. Take this opportunity to learn more about activity in the cryptocurrency markets happening outside of North America.2. Care for a drink with some new and old faces? I’d be remiss if I didn’t put a plug here for my very own colleagues at CoinDesk Research. Noelle Acheson and Galen Moore will be hosting a virtual happy hour sessions with some of the industry’s biggest crypto funds. It’ll take place at 5:30 p.m. (ET) so after deep contemplation on the state of crypto markets beyond North America, I encourage you to swing by with a drink in hand and tune in to this panel.3. Last but not least, am I the only one scheduling one-on-one meetings on Brella? I certainly hope not. One of the great benefits of attending Consensus each year, be it at a hotel in New York City or online through Brella, are the people you meet and the connections you make during the conference. So if you didn’t take advantage of the networking options available to you on Brella during the first day, don’t wait until later and schedule some meetings today. It’s not only our panelists and speakers that have great insights to share but our attendees as well, who, due to the virtual format of our event this year, are part of the most geographically distributed audience CoinDesk has ever seen at Consensus. I hope I’ve gotten you excited for Day Two of Consensus: Distributed. Here we go!  What to watch    10:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. ET The Future of Fiat: Central Bank Digital Currencies Workshop A program dedicated to the rise of CBDCs will feature Raphael Auer, BIS' Innovation and the Digital Economy Unit economist, Raj Dhamodharan Mastercard executive and Sheila Warren of the World Economic Forum, among many other high-profile guest speakers.      1:30 - 3:00 p.m. First Mover With Brad Keoun This program is split into sections dedicated to the economics of mining, especially post-halving, crypto prime brokerage and market surveillance.      2:00 - 4:30 p.m. Programmable Money and the Future of Enterprise Blockchain A look at enterprise use cases for blockchain and cryptocurrencies with appearances by Hyperledger's Brian Behlendorf, EY's Paul Brody and Kaleido's Sophia Lopez, among many, many more.      4:30 - 6:00 p.m. Complete Anonymity: An Advanced Workshop on Using Crypto for Privacy Privacy experts with Nym walk you through how to preserve your anonymity through cryptography and best practices.      6:30 - 7:30 p.m. QuadrigaCX - Yell Into the Void and Get Some Questions Answered The best-titled program of the bunch examines the on-going issues faced by former clients of the defunct QuadrigaCX exchange as they try to get their money back following the mysterious death of the company’s CEO, who took the keys to the vault with him.    Bitcoin halving recap    Yesterday marked the third halving event in Bitcoin’s 11 active years. Now that the mining subsidy has been reduced to 6.25 bitcoin, it’s likely some miners will pull out of a no-longer profitable enterprise. We still don’t know the full repercussions, though some are quick to note how this halving is already subverting expectations.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving 2020, Explained      Price Action Bitcoin slid about 2% Monday, the fourth straight daily decline, to about $8,600. The cryptocurrency's price is down 14% from last week's high of $10,000, CoinDesk's Brad Keoun notes in the First Mover newsletter.      ""The only real surprise was for anyone expecting anything different, given that prior bitcoin halvings had little immediate impact on the market price,"" he said, adding: When the first halving took place, on Nov. 28, 2012, bitcoin's price slid by 0.5%. And on July 9, 2016, the second halving, prices fell by 2.3%.      Read more: Crypto Long & Short: Is Bitcoin More Like Gold or Equities?

Gone virtual    Yesterday some people had the unusual experience of watching a virtual conference in VR.    Consensus Magazine    Crypto in Corona Jeff Wilser has spent the past two years as a nomad. Now under quarantine, he follows up on the communities he had gotten to know during his travels, and finds that the blockchain industry, more than others, is suited to the particular challenges presented by the COVID-19 crisis. What follows is an excerpt from the story published on our site.      Bali, Indonesia My first plunge into the crypto community came in Bali, which, back in January 2018, had a frisky blockchain ecosystem. In Ubud, which is the spiritual (and tourist) center of Bali, you could stumble into crypto traders, crypto start-ups, and crypto meet-ups galore. It seemed that crypto was everywhere. Just before it opened for business I visited the snazzy “Blockchain Zoo,” a high-end consultancy and coworking space, meeting with owner Roberto Capodieci.      The Blockchain Zoo still exists, but Capodieci tells me that the meet-up scene has all but vanished, and that happened long before COVID-19. The Indonesian government, enforcing a law meant to protect the local Rupiah, cracked down on businesses that accepted cryptocurrencies. “Two years ago I could pay for breakfast with bitcoin,” says Capodieci. “Now you can only use Rupiah. That killed a lot of initiatives,” (The price of bitcoin slumping to $3k in 2019, of course, also killed a lot of initiatives.)      Read more: The Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action      Capodieci, who has OG crypto cred – he says he received a test copy of the original bitcoin node software program – and who taught crypto courses at the University of Singapore, is a large man who wears a light beard and a Donkey Kong t-shirt. On the Zoom video he suddenly blanches, then swats his hand at something. “A mosquito just decided to die in my mouth!” He says, laughing. “And I’m not even riding a motorcycle.” (Everyone drives a moped or motorcycle in Bali, even wimps like me.)      There are now fewer mopeds in Ubud. The roads are mostly empty. The borders are closed. The tourists are gone. The few people on the streets do wear masks, says Capodieci, “And the police will stop you if you don’t have one, and give you a mask.”      Meanwhile the Blockchain Zoo has pivoted to launching their own platform, ZooBC, which uses a Proof of Stake protocol. Capodieci says his team of 25 developers can easily work remotely, and they’re working on a beta version of ZooBC–the alpha launched in November.      COVID-19’s impact on their efforts? The way Capodieci sees things, the pandemic is almost a positive. The downside is that he had hoped to be in Dubai and Singapore to meet with potential clients and investors, but the upside, he says, is that everyone seems extra-focused from home. And they’re using the time to add more functionality into beta, which is one of the benefits cited by that survey from Switzerland’s CV Labs.      Capodieci’s tone is almost chipper. “This thing is going to change the way people work. I love it,” he says. “The longer it lasts, the better it is.” He quickly clarifies that he has sympathy for the local businesses, like hotels and restaurants, that are suffering. But he can compartmentalize. Focus on the silver lining. If CV19 has nudged companies to give workers a choice between at-home or in-office, he sees that as a win. “You should be working at a place you love to go to,” he says, “because that’s where you’re spending most of your life.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/12/blockchain-bites-your-ultimate-guide-to-consensus-distributed-day-2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/101cc51353294fedb740d2a3d7e71917dba3d6b0-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383661,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4aB,1589288458,"JPMorgan Bank Takes on Coinbase, Gemini as Its First Crypto Exchange Customers","Its CEO once called bitcoin a fraud but now U.S. banking giant JPMorgan Chase has added its first cryptocurrency exchange customers, CoinDesk has confirmed.      Sources told The Wall Street Journal Tuesday the bank signed two popular regulated exchanges – Coinbase and Gemini, the latter founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.      The fact that both exchanges are regulated in the U.S. was apparently a factor in the approvals, which still took a lengthy period of vetting, the WSJ said. Accounts for the two crypto firms were approved last month, the sources said, and are now in use.      The move by JPMorgan is notable in a nation where banking services are hard to come by for any firms dealing with cryptocurrencies, which are viewed as a high risk by the banking industry. Until now, exchanges and other firms working with digital assets have been served by a few crypto-friendly banking institutions such as Silvergate.      Still, Gemini and Coinbase aren't the first crypto clients for JPMorgan. TokenSoft, a regulated transfer agent and software vendor for security token services, has had an account at the bank since 2017, CEO Mason Borda said on Twitter.      Read more: US Banking Regulator Suggests Federal Licensing Framework for Crypto Firms      Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed event Monday, U.S. banking regulator Brian Brooks said, ""Banks not only have the ability, they have an obligation to serve all lawful businesses. They shouldn't be discriminating because something's a new technology."" Brian Brooks was formerly Coinbase's chief legal officer and is now senior deputy at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.      ""As crypto matures, there are increasingly many companies that have perfectly robust risk management systems and do have an ability to comply with those laws, and they shouldn't have trouble finding bank relationships,"" he said.      With cryptocurrency firms now accepted by a major bank, it's possible other institutions may follow suit. The traditional finance industry has been becoming more open to the financial technology as it proves a worthy investment at a time when the markets' favorite assets are struggling.      So far this year, bitcoin as up 20%, while the S&P 500 stock index is down 9.3% and oil has fallen 66%. Traditional safe haven gold is up just 11.5% at a time when markets have been reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.      In this last week, hedge fund pioneer Paul Tudor Jones II revealed his Tudor BVI Global Fund is now authorized to invest in bitcoin futures. Jones also told CNBC soon after that he holds 1%-2% of his assets in bitcoin. He didn't say whether he invested in bitcoin futures or actual bitcoins.      The WSJ sources said JPMorgan is now providing Coinbase and Gemini's U.S. users with deposits and withdrawals via wire transfer and automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions. It's also helping the exchanges with cash management services, they said.      JPMorgan has also built out its own blockchain settlement service with its own U.S.dollar-backed token, dubbed JPM Coin.

42383678,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4uJ,1589284522,"First Mover: Dull Bitcoin Halving Salvaged by Satoshi Tribute in Block 629,999","Bitcoin's halving, the subject of amped-up buzz, hype and speculation since late 2019, proved anticlimactic on Monday as prices slid for a third straight day and the blockchain network slowed to a crawl.      Industry executives on a CoinDesk halving-countdown talk show, held via Zoom, had to pass the time with technical discussions of the future potential of bitcoin mining computers and how much the network's speed might accelerate over the next four years.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      And then, finally, the network arrived at block number 630,000 – the moment everyone was waiting for. Someone posted a block of code on Twitter showing that the halving had indeed happened. There were some huzzahs all around, and everyone dropped out of the Zoom room. Happy halving!      ""This is more of a holiday for the crypto community than anything else,"" Mati Greenspan, of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, wrote in a note to clients.      Bitcoin slid about 2% Monday, the fourth straight daily decline, to about $8,600. The cryptocurrency's price is down 14% from last week's high of $10,000, when excitement over the upcoming halving reached a fever pitch, based on the number of Google searches.  The only real surprise was for anyone expecting anything different, given that prior bitcoin halvings had little immediate impact on the market price. When the first halving took place, on Nov. 28, 2012, bitcoin's price slid by 0.5%. And on July 9, 2016, the second halving, prices fell by 2.3%.      ""We are seeing buy the rumor, sell the fact at work,"" Russell Shor, a senior market specialist at the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency-trading firm FXCM, said in emailed comments.  Many cryptocurrency analysts have noted that gains related to bitcoin's prior halvings have played out over months or years, not days.  It was bitcoin's third halving since the network launched in late 2009 in the wake of the previous financial crisis. The process was hard-coded into the blockchain's programming as a way of automatically curbing inflation: Every 210,000 data blocks, or roughly every four years, the supply of new bitcoin automatically gets cut in half.  The process has prompted many cryptocurrency investors to predict that bitcoin could work as a gold-like inflation hedge against trillions of dollars of emergency money injections by the Federal Reserve, in response to the coronavirus-inflicted economic crisis.  CoinDesk's Wolfie Zhao noted Monday in an article about the halving that Chinese bitcoin-mining pool f2pool, which won the reward for block No. 629,999, embedded a message into the blockchain record: ""NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed’s Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue.”      This was an apparent homage to Satoshi Nakamoto's iconic ""brink of a second bailout"" message in the original ""genesis"" block when bitcoin was launched in 2009.      In that sense, the halving served to call attention to bitcoin among the broader public, despite the anemic price action of late, analysts said.      ""Even if the halving has a marginal ripple effect, it has been impactful in the psyche of retail and institutional investors alike,"" Rich Rosenblum, a former Goldman Sachs managing director who now leads the markets group at the digital-asset trading firm GSR, said in an email.      The real-world impact of the halving falls primarily on bitcoin ""miners,"" the computer operators who help to secure the blockchain network by sending in quintillions of computations per second to confirm new data blocks, each containing the records of thousands of transactions.      Since the bitcoin produced with each new data block serve as miners' rewards for participating in the distributed network, the halving essentially cuts their revenue in half.      And many of those miners were shutting off older-generation machines on Monday, evidenced by a slowdown in block times. Analysts had predicted in advance that the halving would reduce make Bitmain's popular S9 mining computers, introduced in 2016, unprofitable except in places where electricity was unusually cheap.      The last 10 blocks before the halving averaged 13.3 minutes, compared with an average 8.5 minutes on Sunday. Block No. 630,001, the first after the halving, took 39 minutes to complete.      ""The reduction in mining revenue poses concerns for mining operators,"" the research firm TradeBlock wrote on Monday.      Regarding the price, cryptocurrency bulls kept a stiff upper lip.      Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of the cryptocurrency firm Gemini, said Monday during a panel discussion at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed conference that he and his twin brother and co-founder Cameron ""tend to invest in what we think is cool,"" and in things that are ""authentic to us."" Bitcoin makes their list.      The halving ""marks a particularly significant milestone given the current state of the world we find ourselves in,"" the research firm Delphi Digital wrote Monday in a report.      Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of the investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNBC on Monday there was a ""lot of hype going into the halving.""      Still, he said he expected bitcoin ""to start trading right back up.""      As is sometimes the case with the future of money, the big money may be some way down the road.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $8,763 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,176 | 24-Hr Low: $8,206      Trend: Bitcoin is looking to gather upside traction a day after undergoing its third mining reward halving.      The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands near $8,760, representing a 2% gain on the day. The per block reward for mining on the Bitcoin network were reduced to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC during Monday's U.S. trading hours      Bitcoin rallied by more than 150% in the weeks leading up to the halving. One of the major catalysts for the price rise was the bullish narrative surrounding the supply-altering event.      With the lackluster performance in recent days, though, it seems safe to say that halving was priced in. As a result, the uptick seen at press time could be short-lived, more so, as the technical charts are sending bearish signals.      For instance, the five- and 10-day price averages have produced a bearish crossover, confirming a short-term shift in market sentiment. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and shifts, has crossed into bearish territory below zero. The 14-day relative strength index, too, has violated the trendline rising from March lows.      Prices, therefore, could soon revisit the 200-day average support at $8,041. Note that the long tails attached to the previous two daily candles show dip demand below $8,200. If that area again reverses the pullback, a stronger move toward $10,000 could unfold.      However, if bitcoin penetrates the all-important 200-day average, stronger chart-driven selling could be seen. At press time, that scenario looks unlikely as data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode shows no sign of an uptick in the exchange deposits. The metric indicates that investors are continuing to hold coins for the longer haul. The metric fell by over 10% in the March 12 to May 12 period as jitters from the ""Black Thursday"" crash eased.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/12/first-mover-dull-bitcoin-halving-salvaged-by-satoshi-tribute-in-block-629999,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f49ceaac605578c85d3d6b5ea0692b40ff2c094-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383674,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4qX,1589283634,Third Halving Turns Out to Be Non-Event for Bitcoin's Price,"Bitcoin's price volatility has declined following the network's third mining reward halving event on Monday.      The reward per block mined on bitcoin's blockchain was reduced to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC at 19:23 UTC, when the cryptocurrency was trading near $8,500. Since then, prices have been restricted largely to a narrow range of $9,500 to $9,820.      The quiet post-halving price action stands in stark contrast to the solid two-way business in the $1,000 range of $9,200 to $8,100 observed during the 24-hours ahead of the supply altering event and the buoyant price action seen over the last 13 days. The cryptocurrency leaped from $8,000 to $10,000 in the nine days to May 7 before falling back to $8,100 by May 10.      Bitcoin’s implied volatility, the market's expectation of how volatile the asset will be in the future, has also dropped sharply following halving.      Bitcoin’s volatility on one-month options, which measures the calculated, or implied, mid-rate volatility for an at-the-money (ATM) option, is now seen at 80%, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The figure had clocked a high of 102% before the halving, Meanwhile, the three-month volatility gauge has also declined to 80% from 93% pre-halving.    Event priced in    Bitcoin's lackluster response to the halving is hardly surprising as the event has been extensively discussed over many months and was factored in by the market.      Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference, Cynthia Wu, head of business development and sales at digital assets financial services firm Matrixport, said, ""Halving was already priced in and the cryptocurrency could trade in the range of $8,000 to $10,000 in the near term.""      Bitcoin reversed the sell-off from $10,000 to $3,867 seen in the first half of March in the eight weeks to May 7. The spectacular rise was at least in part fueled by the bullish speculative buzz surrounding the halving. There was evidence of both small and large investors accumulating coins in the run-up to the event. However, an additional price bump failed to materialize, in line with Wu's comment.      Some observers might predict a price drop in the near term, as the halving has doubled the cost of bitcoin production and made older generation mining machines like Bitmain Antminer S9s unprofitable. As a result, some hard-pressed miners could potentially shut down and offload their bitcoin holdings to recover the cost, adding to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency.      See also: First Mover: Dull Bitcoin Halving Salvaged by Satoshi Tribute in Block 629,999      ""S9s miners have already lived longer than expected and bitcoin’s price will have to double for these machines to become viable again,” said Alex de Vries, founder of financial and economic news portal Digiconomist and blockchain specialist, while speaking at Consensus: Distributed on Tuesday.      De Vries, however, added that the hash rate – the computing power dedicated to mining the bitcoin network – is unlikely to suffer a significant drop, as many mining entities are upgrading to the latest generation devices.      In the short term, the uptick in the cost of mining will likely be compensated by the availability of cheap hydroelectric power resulting from the rainy season in China’s Sichuan province, which contributes more than 50% of the network’s total hash rate. Since the halving, the drop in the hash rate has been moderate. The metric is down just 4% to 128.873 exahashes per second, according to bitinfocharts.com.      Looking ahead, bitcoin looks likely to trade in the range of $8,000 to $10,000 for some time, as suggested by Wu. It's worth noting that the 200-day average is located near $8,000. If prices violate the widely tracked support, stronger chart-driven selling may be seen. That could lead to a deeper decline toward $7,400.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/12/third-halving-turns-out-to-be-non-event-for-bitcoins-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7fcbc9dc4e63ba08ae839e69c5894a08a7b4ae2-1200x675.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383660,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4Yv,1589283161,"CoinDesk 50: Besu, the Marriage of Ethereum and Hyperledger","The official marriage of Ethereum and Hyperledger matters.      There have been dalliances between Hyperledger and Ethereum going back over the years. The latest lovechild, Besu, was designed from the ground up to let large enterprises connect to the public Ethereum blockchain.      There are benefits on both sides. On the public, or permissionless, side of things, Ethereum has the largest developer community in crypto, building tools corporations may not even know they need yet.      On the other, Hyperledger’s permissioned blockchain is where many of the corporations looking at this tech feel most comfortable. (Besu graduated to “active” status within Hyperledger in March of this year, placing the project on an equal footing with the likes of Fabric, Sawtooth and Indy.)    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    Ethereum’s true believers have always viewed big business using the public mainnet as a Holy Grail in the quest for “world computer” status. Such a development would make Ethereum a transparent trust layer for anchoring transactions or agreements, bringing the Fortune 500 into a new world of open, decentralized finance.      Businesses are coming round to the idea of a public blockchain connection, too, either running their own nodes or by using some form of safe bridge to the mainnet, said Daniel Heyman, program director of PegaSys, the protocol engineering group at ConsenSys that built Besu.      “While some folks over at Hyperledger think that’s a ‘nice to have,’ there are definitely others who think it’s a ‘need to have,’” Heyman said. “Regardless, a mainnet project brings a lot of optionality to enterprises that otherwise wouldn’t have those choices.”      Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf said Besu was “kind of hedging our bets,” since the client can be used in both permissioned blockchains as well as on public networks.      “I like to keep an open mind,” said Behlendorf. “Eventually, I think the larger, more-successful permissioned blockchain networks will look and feel not unlike many of the public blockchains. So it's not a dichotomy in my book.”      Looking ahead, it’s also possible Besu may blaze a trail in bringing more Ethereum-affiliated projects into Hyperledger. For instance, Axoni, the blockchain builder working with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is due to open source that particular piece of work as part of Hyperledger.      Seeing other enterprise Ethereum projects begin to gravitate towards Hyperledger would be “really exciting,” said Heyman.      “Communities take a lot of work to maintain,” Heyman added. “Ethereum is far and away the most engaged community in the blockchain space, which has happened rather organically. But on the enterprise side of the coin, you typically need to be a bit more intentional to get those communities to form. So Hyperledger’s support is really helpful.”      Behlendorf said that’s where Besu may come in handy – by getting some enterprise blockchain projects to stop focusing on the bespoke in favor of something that can be adopted across multiple platforms.      “[Hyperledger] can play a useful role in helping up-level the whole industry and help everyone save some money at a time when there isn’t really cash to spare,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/12/coindesk-50-besu-the-marriage-of-ethereum-and-hyperledger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f92575bc061eb94033dd13dc108eeaa0a232fb94-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance, the crypto trading leviathan that doesn't like to reveal where it's based, announced Tuesday morning the funding would go toward growing Tokocrypto's business, such as building out new offerings and products, improving the tech stack, as well as expanding its customer base.      Launching in 2018, Tokocrypto became the first exchange to be regulated by Indonesia's Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI) in 2019.      Indonesia is quite strict when it comes to digital assets. Crypto is effectively outlawed as a means of payment and new regulations passed earlier this year require investors to put up high minimum capital in order to trade crypto derivatives.

""Indonesia will become one of the leading centers of the blockchain ecosystem in Southeast Asia. Our investment in Tokocrypto will allow us to explore exciting new opportunities together for the Indonesian market with a regulated local partner to further enable the freedom of money,"" said Binance's founder and CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.

The blue-chip IT firm said last week the IBM Blockchain Platform would carry over the changes in Hyperledger Fabric 2.0 – its base layer – claiming it ""vastly improves"" overall security and usability.      As well as improving performance and data privacy, IBM said in a blog post that the upgrade would completely change the platform's smart contract governance.      ""IBM Blockchain Platform will support Hyperledger Fabric 2.0 and continue to add additional capabilities around the new decentralized smart contract lifecycle management and other new improvements,"" IBM said in its blog post. ""In addition, the platform will allow the user to choose which version of Fabric to deploy and to migrate from one version to another.""      Although IBM says it is ""full steam ahead"" with the Hyperledger Fabric 2.0 integration, it didn't provide a timeframe for when it expects to go live.      See also: Old Rivals Oracle and IBM Want Their Blockchains to Talk to Each Other      On the existing Hyperledger Fabric 1.0, smart contract governance is largely centralized. The ability to propose new parameters is reserved for one entity, while all other parties face a binary choice of either accepting them as they are or refuse them entirely and take themselves out of the ongoing transaction.      While they can still opt to put one entity in control of the parameters, a document issued by the Linux Foundation – the open-source tech consortium that launched the upgrade – says Hyperledger Fabric 2.0 adds a decentralized model where multiple parties can propose and amend parameters before they become active on the transaction channel.      The protocol upgrade also means that rather than the proposing party simply activating the new parameters at whim, a quorum of other transaction parties now needs to explicitly approve the upgrade beforehand.      See also: IBM Blockchain VP: Every Dollar Spent on Blockchain Yields $15 on Cloud      Since IBM launched its blockchain platform in May 2017, clients – generally businesses like the digital platform we.trade – have been able to pick and choose, buffet-style, the distributed ledger features that go along with their own individual requirements.

42383663,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4ch,1589245901,Trust No Dapp: Chainlink Launches Oracle for Provable Randomness,"Chainlink may be solving part of the problem that first drove Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s interest in decentralized applications.      “One day [‘World of Warcraft’ game maker] Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit,” Buterin wrote.      Similarly, Chainlink is rolling out its Verifiable Random Function (VRF) service, where subscribers can gain access to provably random values needed for demonstrating the integrity of smart-contract-based projects such as online games. With Chainlink VRF, you know an application hasn’t been tampered with – all via the blockchain.      Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov announced the new product Monday at Consensus: Distributed.      “A lot of applications can’t exist in a trustless way without randomness,” Nazarov said in an interview.      In short, smart contracts will send a seed to a Chainlink oracle which will generate a random number using Chainlink’s VRF. The resulting number, broadcast back to the application, can be verified as random based on the oracle’s public key and application’s seed, Chainlink said in a blog post.      Oracles partaking in the system will be paid in user fees, Nazarov said, in an attempt to create an internal token economy for data information and security.    PoolTogether partnership    Verifiably randomness is novel service because of the difficulties of getting it right, Nazarov said. Many applications – particularly for gaming – need sources of randomness to create fair systems of play. Proving that the vehicle for selecting randomness has not been manipulated by the originator or an outside adversary is no easy task, however.      Decentralized finance (DeFi) lottery PoolTogether is the first subscriber to Chainlink’s VRF. The savings tool pools interest accrued on dai stablecoin holdings into one pot, and picks a lucky winner every week.      PoolTogether will now switch from its centralized randomness selection method to Chainlink’s VRF for decentralized randomness.      Read more: PoolTogether DeFi App Announces $1M Investment After No-Loss Lottery Payout Tops $1K      “Even seemingly random values, such as a blockhash, can be manipulated by malicious miners attempting to extract value from applications like PoolTogether,” the project’s co-founder, Leighton Cusack, said in a blog post. “This is why we’re excited about a verifiable form of randomness that can be verified using a blockchain’s highly trustworthy signature verification capabilities.”      Chainlink’s Nazarov said the randomness question for protocols is truly a computer science conundrum, one that is most easily addressed through a third-party solution such as Chainlink.      “What we are trying to address is people building applications, not just tokens,” Nazarov said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | MINING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/12/trust-no-dapp-chainlink-launches-oracle-for-provable-randomness,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e473fdf3f660625793b611396170a63a1116771-1500x920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
