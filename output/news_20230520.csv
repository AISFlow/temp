The proposal aimed at raising Terra Classic LUNC burns tax to 0.5%. Following the positive results, KuCoin declared increasing the LUNC network burn rate from 0.2% to the proposed 0.5%. LUNC Network Burn Tax Spikes On KuCoin KuCoin took to Twitter to announce the increase in the burn tax. In its announcement, KuCoin stated that it would facilitate the Terra Classic LUNC and TerraClassicUSD (USTC) increase on its platform following the burn tax activation. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Falls Below Critical Support, Is It Time For You To Buy? Notably, the activation will occur at the designated Terrra Classic block height of 12,902,399 and take effect on May 23. Once activated, KuCoin will pay users more for transactions involving the two crypto assets, LUNC and USTC. Apart from the increased payments, the burn rate tax will reduce LUNC supply. But there’s still a downside to the increased burn rate tax as it will reduce the trading volume. This is why many exchanges rejected such proposals in the past. Notably, KuCoin has always supported such increases even when other exchanges delay. For instance, the exchange first supported a September 2022 Terra Classic burn tax of 1.2% even before the proposal passed. Other exchanges, including Crypto.com, MEXC, and Binance, only later declared support for the burn tax. But after the proposal passed, data implied that the increase reduced the trading volume for LUNC. Many investors stopped trading with the asset due to the spike in fees. Related Reading: NFT Market Takes A Hit: Sales Could Drop Below $1 Billion For The First Time In 2023 Following the outcome, the LUNC community voted to reduce the burn tax to 0.2%, attracting the support of crypto exchanges such as Binance. After the reduction, the Terra Classic community brought up another proposal to increase the burn tax rate, but it wasn’t implemented. Latest Burn Tax Increase Proposal, 3 Others Gain Massive Support While other proposals to increase the burn tax after reducing it from 1.2% to 0.2% failed due to several debates and arguments, the latest one received massive support. One of the reasons proposal 11515 passed was the conservative increase, which wouldn’t spike fees and discourage investors. The proposal focused mainly on reducing the excess supply of LUNC tokens in the market to prevent oversaturation and its associated risks. But, it is not the only proposal submitted to the LUNC community. An active member raised 3 other proposals, plus the burn tax increase to enhance economic policies on the network. The three others aimed at augmenting demand by increasing staking rewards, whitelisting smart contracts to enhance chain utility and volume, and increasing community pool funding to bolster developer funding. -Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",NEUTRAL,LUNC,EXCHANGE | LUNC | REGULATION | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/lunc-burn-tax-set-to-rise-to-0-5-as-kucoin-proposal-receives-approval/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12799793.jpeg

12800649,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534205,1684589535,Bitcoin And Ethereum Supply Drops To Record Lows Unseen Since 2015 And 2017,"Amid the tussle between the bulls and bears in the crypto market over the past week, the circulating supply of both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has reached record lows, triggering speculation about the potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. Data provided by Santiment reveals a significant decrease in the amount of BTC and ETH held on exchanges, suggesting a shift in investor behavior. Bitcoin And Ethereum Supply Plummets On Exchanges According to Santiment’s data, the circulating supply of BTC on exchanges currently stands at a mere 5.7%, marking its lowest level since December 2017 when the cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high of $20,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Confluence Of Bearish Factors and At Risk of Another Decline Similarly, the supply of ETH on exchanges has dropped to 10.1%, the lowest since its inception in 2015. This trend indicates that crypto investors are actively buying and withdrawing their coins from exchanges, opting for alternative storage methods. Santiment tweeted earlier today: Bitcoin & Ethereum both continue to quietly see more and more of their existing supplies move into self custody. Though not a perfect indicator, declining coins on exchanges generally hint at future bull runs, given enough time playing out. Notably, one key reason behind the declining supply of BTC and ETH on exchanges, particularly in the case of Ethereum, is the increasing popularity of staking. Ethereum 2.0’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism has provided ETH holders with the opportunity to stake their coins and participate in securing the network while earning rewards. Stakers lock up their ETH in specialized wallets, ensuring its active involvement in the network’s operations rather than leaving it idle on exchanges. This shift towards staking is motivated by the desire to earn passive income and contribute to the long-term growth and security of the Ethereum ecosystem. On the other hand, the Bitcoin decrease on exchanges is not so clear, however, the possible reason can be attributed to investors looking to keep their BTC holdings for a long time. This could be due to the feared upcoming global recession which has made many turn to the idea of saving funds for the supposed “rainy days.” Implications On The Crypto Market The dwindling supply of Bitcoin and Ethereum on exchanges could have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market mostly positively. Firstly, it suggests a decreasing selling pressure as fewer coins are readily available for trading. This “hints at future bull runs,” according to Santiment. With a limited supply on exchanges, potential buyers might face greater difficulty acquiring these digital assets, leading to increased demand and potentially driving up the prices of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, the reduced presence of BTC and ETH on exchanges may indicate a growing confidence among long-term holders. Investors are likely becoming more inclined to hold their coins in secure wallets or participate in staking, signaling a belief in the future potential and value appreciation of these cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Whale Alert: 1,750 Bitcoin (BTC) Moved To Exchange, Massive Plunge Incoming? This shift in behavior reflects a maturing market where participants are increasingly focused on the underlying technology and long-term prospects rather than short-term trading. Regardless, both BTC and ETH haven’t made any significant movement in the past week. BTC’s price has experienced little upward trend up by 0.3%. BTC has surged from a low of $26,819 seen last Saturday to trading as high as above $27,000 on Thursday. In contrast, ETH’s price has experienced a slight upward trend up by 0.6% in the past week. ETH has surged from a low of $1,795 last Saturday to trading above $1,800, at the time of writing. -Featured image from Shutterstock, Chart from TradingView",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/all/bitcoin-and-ethereum-supply-plummet-to-record-lows/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12800649.jpeg

This would come just a month and a few days after TapTools predicted an exponential increase in the network’s TVL. In this prediction, TapTools, a Cardano portfolio tracker, also reported different factors that could be pivotal to Cardano’s explosive growth in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Shrimp’ Catch Soars To All-Time High Of 1.31 Million Coins – Details Cardano DeFi Ecosystem Hits 500 Million ADA In TVL Data from DeFi TVL aggregator DefiLlama reveals that the total value locked on the Cardano network now stands at 505.114 million ADA. This is equivalent to $186.18 million when converted to U.S. dollars. Source: DefiLlama This new milestone represents a staggering 91.9% increase in total value locked since the turn of the year. Meanwhile, in the last month, Cardano’s TVL has jumped by nearly 8%, indicating a steady adoption of its DeFi ecosystem. On-chain data shows that Minswap is, by a distance, the leading protocol on the network, with a TVL of $55.56 million. In fact, the decentralized exchange boasts a market share dominance of 29.84%. Minswap protocol is followed by Indigo, a collateralized debt protocol, with a total value of $28.5 million locked on it. WingRiders, Liqwid, and Djed Stablecoin are three other notable protocols on the Cardano DeFi ecosystem, with TVLs of $17.51 million, $15.42 million, and $13.71 million, respectively. It is important to note that total value locked is a metric that estimates the amount of cryptocurrency locked in DeFi protocols on a particular blockchain. It is calculated by summing up the value of all the crypto assets locked in various DeFi protocols on a blockchain. TVL can be represented in the native token of a blockchain (as in ADA for Cardano) or in USD. ADA Price Shows No Significant Action A skyrocketing total value locked is often an indicator of increased activity in a DeFi ecosystem. However, Cardano’s impressive TVL growth hasn’t particularly impacted the price of ADA, the blockchain’s native token. As of this writing, one ADA token trades at $0.3655, losing 1% of its value in the last 24 hours. The price of ADA has been moving sideways recently, dipping by only 0.5% in the last seven days. ADAUSD trading at $$0.3652 | Source: ADAUSD chart from TradingView That said, a broader look at the market reveals that ADA has been on a steady decline, losing more than 13% of its value in the past month.

While most of the assets in the crypto market were marked by insignificant price actions leading to little gains or losses, INJ stood out with an excellent price movement to become one of the biggest weekly gainers. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Injective’s price gained by 19% in the last seven days boasting of a market performance only beaten by four other tokens – RNDR, AGIX, MASK, and CFX – in the entire top 100 crypto ranking. INJ initially began the week trading around a price region of $6.08 and soon recorded consecutive gains and losses before experiencing a price hike on May 17 to hit a market price of $6.7 Following this price boost, INJ showed signs of consolidation for the next two days before starting its current bullish run. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Falls Below Critical Support, Is It Time For You To Buy? NFT Surprise Announcement Boosts INJ Price Interestingly, the price rally by INJ in the last week appears to be due to an exciting announcement made by the project developers six days ago. On May 13, the team behind the Injective blockchain tweeted a statement urging the user community to interact more with dApps built on Injective or its L1 chain, stating there could be a chance to receive an “NFT-related surprise.” This announcement sparked much excitement within the Injective community, which has been represented not just in price but also in the network activity. According to a tweet by @Iryna_Everstake, blockchain manager at network validator service Everstake pool, the Injective blockchain recorded a substantial increase in several network parameters over the last week as follows – +688K INJ staked, +470 delegators, +130 new wallets, and +295M in cumulative trading volume. At the time of writing, INJ is trading around $7.0, having gone up 4.73% in the last day. However, it is worth noting that INJ is down by 13.8% from its value as of a month ago. That said, with a circulating supply of 80 million tokens, INJ has a stunning market cap value of $563.7 million.

A report from a leading crypto market intelligence product provider, Messari, revealed the Ripple native currency XRP took the lead in the overall crypto market in Q1. XRP Takes The Lead In Overall Crypto Market According to data from Messari, XRP outperformed other crypto assets with a 55% surge on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis. From the report, the market cap of XRP grew by a whopping 59.9% in the first quarter of the year. The value increased from $17.4 billion on January 1 to $27.4 billion on March 31. Related Reading: Crypto Assets Flow From Ethereum To BSC, Are Users Escaping High Gas Fees? Notably, the growth rate for XRP’s market cap exceeded the cumulative crypto market cap that witnessed a 46% surge within the same period. Messari’s report also showed that XRP kicked off the year with a trading price of $0.35 as of January 1. With the increasing volatility in the crypto market during the beginning of 2023, XRP rallied progressively through the days. As of January 23, XRP’s price hit $0.43 before retracting due to the influence of the bears. The token closed in January with a 19.71% increase in value. The second month wasn’t quite eventful for XRP as the price gradually dipped to $0.36 amid the downtrend in the overall crypto market. However, XRP ended February with a 7.27% drop as the price hit $0.37. Then XRP’s price rally took a more aggressive look in March. The price of XRP ranged from the beginning of March. But it gained momentum from March 21 as XRP broke the resistance level at $0.400. XRP sustained its volatility and pushed higher with a more bullish stance through the remaining days in March. The token rallied beyond the $0.500 region and progressed higher. Messari noted that XRP hit a 10-month high of $0.5850 on March 29, following a two-week price surge of 56%. This price rally was peculiar to XRP, although most crypto assets posted a decline during the period. Finally, XRP closed with a price of $0.54 on March 31, a 43% price surge for the month. The feat pushed the token to an overall price gain of 55% in Q1 2023. XRP Performance Analysis In Q1 2023 Besides the XRP’s price performance, the Messari report also highlighted other performance indicators for the token. The data shows an increase in XRP’s overall network activity metrics in Q1. The total active addresses and average daily transactions surged by 13.9% and 10.7%, respectively, on a QoQ basis. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Confluence Of Bearish Factors and At Risk of Another Decline The total active addresses grew from the receiving addresses, which increased from 47,000 to 55,000 through a 17.1% surge.

LINK’s current price depicts a loss of 87.7% from its all-time high of $52.88 on May 10, 2021. Related Reading: Decentraland (MANA) Leads Crypto Market Gains, Here’s Why The asset has been fluctuating between the $6 and $7 price levels since the beginning of May and is currently at the $6 price level. LINK is also recording a sideways trend on the daily chart, and its trading volume has also tanked by over 32%. The recent price action is primarily influenced by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, regulatory laws and investor sentiment. LINK Price Analysis LINK is in a sideways trend today, forming a red candle on the daily chart. It is trading below its 50-day and 200-Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bearish sentiment. Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 41.30 and dropping out of the neutral zone to the oversold region of 30, confirming the bearish trend. LINK’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is just above its signal line and shows convergence, a bearish signal. Also, the MACD indicator displays a negative value. LINK is just above its nearest support level of $6.362, which has proved critical after the 6.177 price level provided initial support. However, its signals on the daily chart look bearish, hinting at a further price drop for the asset. However, if the bulls mount a rally, LINK will encounter resistance at the $6.753 and the $6.907 price levels. LINK enjoyed a positive price movement in 2023. However, the bears are currently controlling the market. It will likely drop into an oversold region before the bulls rally again. Recent Trends On LINK’s Network Likely To Affect Its Price Chainlink NFTFi NFTFi is a new concept combining NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. It aims at adding value and liquidity to the growing NFT market. Chainlink adopted this technological upgrade enabling lending and borrowing.

12803507,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534232,1684576885,Can BRC-20 Tokens Become The Face of the Next Bull Run?,"In May 2021, a Shiba Inu-inspired coin had retail investors flocking to cryptocurrency. Dogecoin was an unlikely marker of one of the all-time bull run highs. But it goes to show that when you find the right meme, you can chorale a community to show up in force. The rise of Dogecoin felt like cryptocurrency had finally reached its tipping point. Then, the likes of Terra and FTX destroyed consumer confidence, and we all know what happened next. Now we need something to draw us out of crypto winter. Just like Dogecoin did two years ago — and almost to the day — a new BRC-20 token could mark the start of more bullish times for cryptocurrencies. Let’s delve into BRC-20 tokens to discover what they really are. Revealing the captivating rise of a token that could well become Doge’s arch nemesis, and the bellwether of Bitcoin summer. The Rise of BRC-20 Tokens BRC-20 tokens have emerged as a novel “token standard” on the Bitcoin network. BRC-20 tokens make it possible to mint individual satoshis with information about an entire collection of tokens, meaning you can spin up a Dogecoin-like crypto on Bitcoin. They first captured the attention of the diehard crypto community in March 2023, and the market capitalization of all BRC-20 tokens is now close to $1 billion. That said, no individual token had broken out beyond the core community. At least, that was the case — until just a couple of days ago. The ‘Bitcoin Cat’ Taking On Ethereum Trust is lacking in the cryptocurrency space right now, so a bull run looks anything but imminent. But if we can find a point of trust to bring the everyday investors back to the blockchain, then who knows. Perhaps Bitcoin meme coins are the way. After all, Bitcoin is the most trusted cryptocurrency, the OG. And the rise of the BRC-20 token standard shows the trend might just kick start ‘Bitcoin summer.’ All we need is the right meme, and it looks like we might have just stumbled across a contender: a newly-minted BRC-20 token with the face of a recognisably agitated cat deployed onto Bitcoin just two days ago. The token, aptly called $GRUM, saw over 50% of its 21 billion supply minted within the first few hours before soon selling out. This made it the only BRC-20 token in the top-25 by holder count to have minted such a high portion of its supply to such a broad investor base so quickly. The token’s initial success reflected its ‘fair launch process,’ wherein anyone could mint up to one million $GRUM. The absence of allocations ensured a level playing field for all, instilling further trust from the community. But perhaps there’s something more prescient there. Can $GRUM bring back the bulls? The convergence of BRC-20 tokens and the meme coin revolution on Bitcoin has opened up exciting new possibilities in the crypto space. $GRUM, with its swift ascent and rapidly expanding community, showcases its potential to become a new favorite. The move would help more retail investors understand and perhaps join the BRC-20 meme coin wave, which could force the dogs and frogs of Ethereum to take a back seat. This Bitcoin token seems to have the memetic power to draw huge attention.

With no specific positive news to drive sentiment, the token's weekly advance appeared to be mostly a correction after its more than 9% decline last week. Another catalyst that could have supported bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) weekly gain was a new investment strategy by stablecoin issuer Tether, which said that it would use up to 15% of its net realized operating profits to buy the cryptocurrency. Jitters around the banking system, a looming economic downturn, higher BTC network congestion, liquidity concerns stemming from lower participation of institutional market makers and regulatory scrutiny were some of the reasons that led to bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) losses last week. ""A month ago, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was surging, passing the $30K level for the first time since the summer of 2022. Regional banking concerns and rising Fed rate cut bets provided a lot of support for cryptos. The bullish catalysts have now faded away and so has roughly 30% of this year’s rally,"" said OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya. The total crypto market cap currently stands at $1.12T, an increase of 0.16% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . Regulatory Updates Crypto exchange Coinbase Global ( COIN ) was again in the spotlight this week. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday requested an appeals court to reject a petition filed by COIN regarding rulemaking for the cryptocurrency industry as there are no deadlines requiring the regulator to take action on it. Moreover, according to reports, SEC chair Gary Gensler in a keynote speech at a conference on Monday hit back at COIN's petition by arguing that there already were existing rules in place for cryptocurrency markets. ""Bitcoin did not get any favor from SEC Gensler earlier in the week, just the standard comments on how rules are already in place. The regulatory question remains the key for the cryptoverse and traders will have to remain patient,"" OANDA's Moya said. Elsewhere across the Atlantic, the European Union's broad set of cryptocurrency rules received final approval from member states on Tuesday. The rules are meant to fight money laundering and improve transparency in the crypto sector. Meanwhile, lawmakers on the UK Treasury Committee have urged that trading in unbacked cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) should be regulated as gambling.

NFTs that were on the auction block this round included generative art pieces, like Tyler Hobbs’ Fidenza #725 and Dmitri Cherniak’s Ringers #375. Larva Labs-created Autoglyph #187 and CryptoPunk #1326 are also included in the sale.  ""This meticulously selected collection showcases the works of four leading artists who are pushing the boundaries of contemporary algorithmic art,"" Sotheby's writes in its catalog description.  In total, there were seven generative artworks on offer. More NFTs from 3AC's collection will be released in chapters through auctions or private sales in the future.  The highest-priced NFTs from Part 1 of the Grails collection are Fidenza #725, which was estimated to sell for $120,000-$180,000 and Autoglyph #187, which was estimated at $120,000 to $180,000. The NFTs sold for $1,016,000 and $571,500 respectively.  Valuing NFTs  Deep NFT Value, a machine learning tool that analyzes high-value NFTs by exploring previous sales of the digital assets, current market conditions and the unique rarity traits of each collection, estimated that Fidenza #725 was worth 184.4 ETH, or about $335,000. Autoglyph #187, the other highest-value ticket item, was estimated to be worth 205.7 ETH or about $373,800.  ""My understanding is that the estimates are meant to be low so that they get beaten,"" said Nikolai Yakovenko, CEO of Deep Value NFT, told CoinDesk. ""In the case of the Ringers and Fidenzas, [Sotheby's] are making an estimate perhaps above the operating floor price, but well below the premium they expect.""  The upcoming Sotheby's sales are not related to Starry Night Capital's impressive NFT portfolio, which was set up by 3AC in partnership with well-known NFT collector Vincent Van Dough in August 2021.
