42393978,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQN1l,1645141297,China Casts Long Shadow Over Hong Kong's Once-Vibrant Crypto Industry,"Hong Kong Fintech Week was once a buzzing melange of entrepreneurs in T-shirts with bankers and bureaucrats in suits, all discussing cryptocurrency’s role in the future of money.  Last year’s gathering, held in November, was markedly different. Government officials emphasized the potential of greater integration with China and its digital yuan, while conversations about crypto focused on what is deemed appropriate on the mainland.  The contrast points to a larger shift.  As China has tightened its grip on Hong Kong, the city’s digital assets industry has grown uneasy and chastened. Many firms have left Hong Kong or downsized operations. Local regulators were mostly inactive last year, only adding to the uncertainty.  Hong Kong has been an epicenter of crypto throughout the asset class’s development, thanks to one of the world’s strongest finance ecosystems, a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit and proximity to, well, China. (The mainland was once a hotbed of trading and mining activity before a series of crackdowns by Beijing, most recently in September.) Iconic firms, such as exchanges FTX and BitMEX, VC Kenetic Capital and EOS developer Block.one, have their roots in the city.  Now, most of the remaining firms in Hong Kong have backup plans.  Read More: China Crypto Bans: A Complete History  ""They still have a big presence in Hong Kong,” but they're looking at different options for their operations, said Vivien Khoo, co-founder of the Asia Crypto Alliance, a trade association based in Singapore.  Many Hong Kong firms are having “active discussions,"" particularly in light of COVID-19, ""about what it means to be working remotely because that can give them flexibility,” she added.  There are glints of hope. One month into 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) – the city’s equivalent of a central bank – has issued two key papers: one on stablecoins and another on crypto-related exchange-traded funds.  Hong Kong “is beginning to establish the regulatory framework for digital assets that is consistent with its status as a global hub for financial services and wealth management,” said Lennix Lai, director of crypto exchange OKX. “With clarity on the parameters in which the market can operate, investors will no longer be held back by fears over a regulatory backlash.”  Yet while the city’s future in the global crypto ecosystem is starting to take shape, it looks a lot more limited than its freewheeling past. Several industry participants told CoinDesk it was likely that Hong Kong’s regulatory regime would remain stable in the short to medium term but agreed that the long-term prospects were likely bleak.  The China connection  Four of the people who spoke to CoinDesk for this article requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on what their firms deem a politically sensitive topic. Three of those work for crypto financial services firms, while a fourth is a stock analyst.  “It’s hard to expect that you are not allowed to do any crypto in the mainland, but Hong Kong is [going to remain] a paradise” for the industry, quipped one local participant.  As a special administrative region under the “one country, two systems” principle, Hong Kong is territorially a part of China but sets its own laws and regulations.  On paper, Hong Kong’s relative autonomy from the mainland is set to expire in 2047, although many observers, including the U.S. State Department, have noted that China’s central government is already chipping away at Hong Kong’s freedom.  Read more:Hong Kong’s National Security Law Could Threaten Local Crypto Brokerages  The National Security Law that came into force on June 30, 2020, criminalized broadly defined acts of sedition, collusion, terrorism and subversion and granted authorities extensive powers of surveillance, detention and search. As of June, 117 people had been arrested under the law; most of them were politicians, activists and journalists, and the list also included media tycoon Jimmy Lai, owner of popular pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily.  The political risk related to crypto in Hong Kong dates before China’s 2021 crackdown, said Alessio Quaglini, co-founder and CEO of crypto custodian Hex Trust. Hex started looking into a Singapore office “since day one,” which the firm sees as a “backup plan,” he said.  The custodian has since acquired a Capital Markets Services license in Singapore and is waiting for a crypto license, he said.  Year of no light  The feeling on the ground got grimmer last year. There was little news from Hong Kong regulators, and what was announced made firms wary.  On May 21, 2021, Hong Kong authorities proposed fines up to $640,000 and seven years imprisonment for unlicensed exchange activity. Compounding this was the mainland’s increasing influence on the city and its staunch anti-crypto stance.  Around mid-2021, the market’s perception was that regulators felt that “If you’re not licensed, we want you out of Hong Kong, fast,” particularly in light of the potential for fines and imprisonment, said Khoo.  Read more:'Block Kong': Dim Sum in a Crypto Hub  On Sept. 24, 10 of China’s top national finance and tech government institutions declared all crypto-related transactions illegal. While this was not the first time China has restricted crypto, it was the first time several of the country’s top agencies issued a comprehensive action plan that left little room for interpretation.  Following the announcement, the sentiment on the future of crypto in Hong Kong soured, one analyst in the city told CoinDesk, adding that their company has since forbidden them from publicly discussing crypto.  After the mainland tightened its policy, Hong Kong’s biggest retail-focused licensed trading platforms that offered crypto funds, Futu and Tiger Brokers, said they will stop users from buying crypto products on their platforms starting Oct. 1.  A Futu representative told CoinDesk the move was “in response to relevant regulatory guidelines” but didn’t clarify whether they were referring to China’s guidelines. Tiger Brokers did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  ‘Nice place to hang out’  For the time being, Hong Kong is under an opt-in licensing regime for crypto firms. To obtain these optional licenses, firms have to follow the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) recommendations.  The only license for automated trading, which is necessary for operating a crypto exchange, has been granted to OSL Digital Securities. None have been granted since OSL received its license in December 2020.  While there’s a lot of talk about China’s influence in Hong Kong, “At least for now, crypto regulations are decided by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC),” said Henri Arslanian, leader of the crypto practice at consulting giant PwC.  The SFC has expressed that it is not a fan of crypto derivatives. FTX, one of the world’s largest trading platforms for digital asset futures, moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas the day after China announced its crackdown. FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said at the time it wasn’t in response to “recent news.”  COVID-19 restrictions – which have only intensified in the past few months – make it hard to hire in the city, “So, there is already some movement away from Hong Kong,” said Leonhard Weese, president of the Blockchain Association of Hong Kong.  Serving overseas customers out of Hong Kong is a cushy option, Weese said. All the big players already act under the assumption that “Hong Kong is a nice place to hang out in, they’re not interested in selling their products to the Hong Kong market because it’s too small and complicated,” he said. So, even if authorities cut their access to the local market, it won’t be a big problem, Weese said.  Instead, these companies want to serve the world, and there is little indication that might not be acceptable to the regulators in the future, he said. Even if things change, they can easily pick up and leave.  New licensing requirements in Hong Kong  The Hong Kong government had announced plans to propose an anti-money laundering bill in the 2021-2022 legislative session that is based on a consultation paper drafted by the FSTB in November 2020. The bill’s licensing regime for crypto exchanges is envisioned as a barrier against money laundering, and, unlike the current one, it would be mandatory.  In response to a CoinDesk inquiry on whether the crackdown on the mainland will affect rules in Hong Kong, the FSTB reiterated its position that virtual assets are not legal tender and pointed to the territory’s existing regime.  The SFC did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment while the HKMA referred the inquiry to the other two agencies.  The November FSTB paper recommended requiring licenses for virtual asset service providers, including crypto exchanges, and limiting their services to professional investors, among other measures.  Hong Kong law defines professional investors as individuals or corporations who have a portfolio worth upwards of HK$8 million ($1 million) or companies with more than HK$40 million ($5 million) in assets.  Still, with a full draft of the bill yet to be publicly available or discussed in Hong Kong's Legislative Council, many crucial details are hanging in the balance.  The scope of the licensing regime is not totally clear, said Weese. It is unclear if smaller over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges and bitcoin ATMs will be allowed, or what kind of risk is going to be put on individuals that just trade OTC with their friends, he said.  For many exchanges, getting a license will mean that “Their entire systems and products are going to be massively crippled” because they can only offer spot trading and only serve institutional investors, Weese said.  Many firms are preparing to “fly under the radar” to avoid regulatory attention while figuring out how to change their business model such that they can go global, reach new user bases or somehow avoid falling under the licensing regime, he said.  One person who works for a Hong Kong-licensed crypto firm described the unlicensed companies as living “on another planet,” in that their behavior and attitude toward regulations is completely different from those of licensed firms.  Big-picture worries  Given the mainland’s draconian policy on digital assets, Hong Kong’s dwindling independence is reason for concern for the local crypto community.  “The Chinese government is taking over and slowly changing the system,” and it is only a matter of time before it trickles down to crypto, another source in Hong Kong’s crypto industry said.  In the last two years or so, people in Hong Kong have lost confidence in the fact that its legal system is completely separate from mainland China’s, and they are more likely to bite their tongues when talking about crypto, Weese said.  Generally speaking, bitcoin conversations often devolve into political discussions about freedom and the limits of the government, which is increasingly a taboo topic, Weese said. If you try to come up with real-world examples, you might get into all sorts of issues that are highly controversial in a city where the government has seized funds from civil rights organizations.  Aside from regulatory backlash, Hong Kong firms are closely tied to China, so a dwindling crypto industry in China does not bode well for Hong Kong’s ecosystem.  The crackdown has been a problem for Hong Kong asset managers who have clients in the mainland, the analyst said, because communication is now considered risky.  At the same time, many Hong Kong firms have research and development or back offices in China, Arslanian pointed out.  “If you want to be a financial center, tech talent is important,” said Arslanian, adding that Singaporean companies often outsource tech development to India, and Hong Kong crypto firms usually work with Chinese engineers.  But China’s latest policy targets tech talent working for overseas exchanges in China as well.  The question for these connections will be where Chinese regulators draw the line, Arslanian said, and whether foreign exchanges that don’t serve Chinese clients will be allowed to do research and development in China.  The future of crypto in Hong Kong  Peer-to-peer crypto trading will likely remain vibrant in Hong Kong because it is very difficult to stop and allows for quicker transactions in a cash-based society, Weese said. These trades could be increasingly scrutinized by authorities looking for money laundering, such that large transactions will draw attention, the association head said.  But what will happen to virtual asset service providers (VASPs) is unclear.  Khoo and her co-founder, Su Yen Chia, view the HKMA’s papers as encouraging developments.  “At least now people know that the regulator is looking into it, providing some direction, [...] and they're asking for comments and feedback from the industry,” Chia said.  The paper also firmly distinguishes HKMA’s views from mainland policy. ""On paper, they are looking at stablecoins as a payment tool,"" she said, in contrast to the mainland where no crypto can be used in commerce. For crypto assets not related to payments, HKMA is “looking at how it develops hence, they are not stymying innovation,” Chia added.  The city’s regulators are keen to keep their competitive edge vis-a-vis markets like Singapore, Khoo said.  The proposed regulatory framework for digital assets in Hong Kong fits within Beijing’s wider framework for crypto, Omer Ozden, CEO of Beijing and New York-based venture capital firm RockTree Capital, told CoinDesk. The mainland government wants to avoid systemic financial risk.  The “blue sky” scenario is that the rules proposed by the FSTB, already some of the world's most stringent, are the ones that remain in place in the medium term, said the analyst.  If new rules come, licensed firms will be the winners, and unlicensed ones will face increasing regulatory pressure, the analyst said.  The exchanges that are still based in Hong Kong are going to move operations “silently but consistently” away from the city, Weese said.  “Regulatory clarity is always welcome as it legitimizes the asset class,” Esme Pau, head of emerging technology at stock brokerage China Tonghai Securities. But whether Hong Kong’s stockbrokers can offer digital asset-related products remains an open question, she said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/17/china-casts-long-shadow-over-hong-kongs-once-vibrant-crypto-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e1a653defb0a7cc44c21cd40bb322f12329e0a9-2328x1728.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Inflation.  Investors resumed their defensive posture as Russia seemed once again on the way to invading neighboring Ukraine. Even as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken requested a meeting with his Russian counterpart, a mortar attack in the Donbas region of the Ukraine damaged multiple buildings, according to different reports.  The appetite for high-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, tumbled. At the time of publication, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at about $40,600, down about 8% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was off similarly. All other altcoins in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap were in the red.  Crypto's plunge coincided with a similar move down among U.S. equities, particularly more-volatile tech stocks. The tech-laden Nasdaq fell nearly 3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively.  Reports of firing in a border region and accusations that Moscow is orchestrating a false flag operation, or an intent to pin the blame for starting conflict on Ukrainian forces, ""has ratcheted up tensions and led to more investors seeking less risky positions,"" wrote Susannah Streeter, senior Investment and markets analyst for U.K.-based, asset management firm, Hargreaves Lansdown, in an email.  In a week that featured separate reports on January's Producer Price Index (PPI), which rose to 9.8%, and the U.S. central bank's ongoing inflationary concerns discussed at its most recent meeting, investors returned to gold, which rose over $1,900 at one point Tuesday, and other lower-risk assets. ""The price of gold, seen as a safe haven in times of crisis, has risen by another 1.37% to $1,896 an ounce, an 8 month high,"" Streeter wrote.  At the time of publication, gold was trading at $1,898.  ***  Meanwhile, nearly two weeks after a meeting between its president President Xi Jinping with Russian President Vladimir Putin, China continued to weigh its response to the rising Ukrainian border tensions as it tries to balance its economic ties with Russia and the West. China imports a significant amount of oil from Russia but is also concerned by potential U.S. trade restrictions that would likely result from aligning too closely to Russia.  In a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Xi called for a diplomatic solution to the brewing crisis, according to a report from China state media on Wednesday.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Pullback Deepens; Minor Support at $38K-$40K  Bitcoin (BTC) pared earlier gains after sellers reacted to overbought conditions on the charts. Resistance between $44,000 and $46,000 capped upside moves over the past month, which contributed to price weakness.  BTC was down 7% over the past 24 hours. Lower support at $38,000 and $40,000 could stabilize the current pullback into the Asia trading day.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is oversold, similar to what occurred on Feb. 3, which preceded a 20% price jump. This time, however, the $46,000 resistance level could keep sellers active toward stronger support at $30,000.  Further, a series of higher price lows from Jan. 24 was broken on intraday charts, indicating a loss of upside momentum.  Important events  3 p.m. HKT/SGT (7 a.m. UTC): UK retail sales (Jan.

42393979,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQN6t,1645134865,Questions Swirl Around NuMiner’s ‘Best in Class’ Bitcoin Mining Rig,"When a previously unknown company claimed to have created a bitcoin mining rig far superior to the industry standard this month, many in the mining industry raised eyebrows.  Since then, the red flags have kept piling up: An artificial intelligence hardware company claimed a photo of its product was appropriated to create the rig’s marketing materials. The chipmakers supposedly involved with the rig said they were unfamiliar with the project. The rig manufacturer admitted it had misnamed the lab that certified the machine, and did not provide enough information for CoinDesk to corroborate the second lab it named.  It’s still unclear exactly what is going on here. But the situation offers a stark reminder that crypto remains a noisy industry where investors get bombarded daily with bold claims that invite scrutiny. Particularly in the era of publicly traded mega miners, where the financial gains at stake are enormous, investors can never be too careful.  Let’s back up a little.  On Feb. 3, Sphere 3D (ANY), a Toronto-based data management company, announced it was acquiring 60,000 mining rigs for about $1.7 billion from NuMiner Global, a New York-based company that appears to have popped out of thin air.  A search on the New York state company registryyielded zero results for “NuMiner.” The company claims to be affiliated with NuMiner Technologies Ltd., for which practically no information is publicly available.  NuMiner said its rig, the NM440, generates 440 terahashes per second (TH/s) of mining power, or hashrate, with a power efficiency of 20.2 joules per terahash (J/TH), according to the company.  Such specs would make these miners the best on the market by a significant margin. It would top the world’s biggest mining manufacturer’s newest mining computer, Bitmain’s Antminer S19 Pro+ Hyd., which boasts a hashrate of 198 TH/s and efficiency of 27.5 J/TH and uses liquid cooling technology to reduce heat, noise and power consumption.  Sphere 3D’s stock surged more than 40% after the announcement of the deal with NuMiner. Shares have given back some of the gains since then, according to TradingView data.  The doubts  When the news of NuMiner’s deal broke, Luxor Technologies, the crypto software and services company, cast doubt on the story.  “When we saw Gryphon's preorder yesterday, we were highly skeptical but gave the rig the benefit of the doubt due to Gryphon's press release,” Luxor tweeted. (Sphere 3D is merging with bitcoin miner Gryphon Digital Mining in a reverse merger transaction.)  However, Luxor added there are “too many red flags” to consider the NM440 a legitimate mining machine.  Meanwhile, Fred Thiel, CEO of one of the biggest publicly traded miners, Marathon Digital, also tweeted that he was skeptical of NuMiner’s claims and voiced concern about the cooling technology, or lack thereof.  “Based on the picture, I’d be concerned as to how this miner pushes enough airflow to stay cool enough to operate in [a] typical mining environment,” Thiel tweeted. “Definitely not designed for immersion based on the picture.”  Volt Equity, a San Francisco-based investment firm, also was quick to express its skepticism about NuMiner and opened a short position on Sphere 3D stock. Volt tweeted it had reached out to the lab that NuMiner said had tested its NM440 miners, and said the lab denied it ever tested the machine. The lab also told CoinDesk it never tested the machines.  Who runs NuMiner?  There is very little publicly available information about the company, but there are some clues about who is on the team behind this supposedly stellar hardware. NuMiner Global has three people listed on its website, but none of them seem to have much experience in crypto or mining.  The company’s CEO is Iain Kennedy, who most recently was a vice president of enterprise technology and supply chain at Canadian Tire, a retail company involved in the automotive, hardware, sports, leisure and housewares sectors. Prior to that, he was the global chief information officer at BlackBerry, the onetime smartphone pioneer, and global chief operating officer at Spin Master, a Canada-based “global children’s entertainment company.”  The chairman of NuMiner is Tony Melman, who is also Board Chair and CEO of Nevele Inc., a consulting firm specializing in mergers and acquisitions. He also served as CEO of Acasta Capital and of Acasta Enterprises. The latter was a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that defaulted on its debt in March 2018. Melman left the company that month, according to the Globe and Mail newspaper. Prior to Acasta, he was managing director and partner at Onex, a major Canadian asset management company, for 22 years.  Melman was also appointed to Sphere 3D’s board as part of the $1.7 billion purchase agreement.  The third person listed in the website is Bruce Brent, ​​an independent director, who is chief financial officer at real estate firm The Matthews Group, president of a family office and chairman on the boards of a renewable energy company and another aerospace firm.  Affiliate NuMiner Technologies doesn’t seem to have much public information either other than the press release naming Thomas Hsu as CEO. The company also appointed a special research and development (R&D) adviser named Richard Lee, who, according to NuMiner Technologies, is a former R&D director with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).  NuMiner representatives did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment about this entity.  The merger  Upon completion of the deal, the surviving company would take Gryphon’s name. Analysts at Canadian investment bank PI Financial gave Sphere 3D a “buy” rating in October, saying it would become one of the top five mining firms in the world once the merger is complete.  A few weeks later, the merger was delayed by a quarter while the company awaits “regulatory and shareholder approvals.”  Sphere 3D has faced its own troubles. It just settled a bankruptcy case in a Utah court, in which some former and two current directors were accused of securities fraud and misrepresenting information to investors. Sphere 3D is named the defendant in the case, but the bankruptcy actually pertains to a subsidiary. Sphere 3D CEO Peter Tassiopolous and director Vivekanand Mahadevan are the two defendants in the case who are still serving on Sphere 3D’s board.  Sphere 3D filed to dismiss the allegations brought against it, including securities fraud, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and breach of fiduciary duty, but a judge ruled against the company late last year, allowing the bankruptcy case brought by another firm to proceed. The companies disclosed the settlement in a court filing Monday.  “Due to SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] regulations, the company has limited ability to share information with media and investors,” a spokesperson for Sphere 3D told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “The best source for current news and information about Sphere 3D is the ‘Investors’ section of the Company's website.” That section of the company’s website only has details about the company’s financial information including its capital structure, news releases and SEC filings.  The denials  In its press release announcing the mining machines, NuMiner said they had been tested by TÜV Nord’s certified lab BACnet Testing Laboratories. The lab denied the claim in an email to CoinDesk. BACnet pointed to the list of products for which it does quality control, which yielded zero results for crypto mining computers.  NuMiner also claimed it is working “in coordination with” TSMC, the world’s biggest chipmaker; electronics manufacturer Foxconn; and fabless chip designer Xilinx.  TSMC told CoinDesk that NuMiner “is not a direct customer.”  A Xilinx spokesperson told CoinDesk: “To the best of our knowledge, NuMiner has only purchased five computer cards through one of our distributors. We have asked for our company name and logo to be removed from its website, along with any associated marketing materials.”  Electronics maker Foxconn did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  On Feb. 7, Cerebras, a California-based AI hardware firm, tweeted that a “crypto mining startup” company had misappropriated a photo of its CS-2 system. In an email to CoinDesk, Cerebras confirmed it was referring to NuMiner and noted: “In fact, you can see the Cerebras logo at the bottom of the system.”  Other than the Mountain Dew-hued details, the images are pretty much identical.  Cerebras said it had contacted NuMiner and the company has since removed the photo from its site. CoinDesk later confirmed it had disappeared.  Gryphon Mining, for its part, told CoinDesk on Feb. 8: “No comments on this topic for now. NuMiner has information they need to release first and it’s not our place to comment at this time.""  The rebuttal  NuMiner said on Feb. 10 that it previously misidentified BACnet Testing Laboratories as its testing lab. Instead, the lab is called BTL Inc., a Taiwan-based testing company, certified by TÜV Nord, the company said in a statement.  “The performance specifications of the NM440 have been independently validated by leading global testing company TÜV Nord’s certified lab BTL Inc., a testing company based in Taiwan,” the statement reads.  The company also noted that the original image of NM440 was taken down after NuMiner was “recently made aware of a similarity in the product’s image to another product on the market.” The original image was “drawn for marketing purposes,” the statement said.  “NuMiner is confident its revolutionary technology will transform bitcoin mining, enabling customers to reduce energy usage and increase profits,” the updated statement continued.  TÜV Nord’s Taiwan office confirmed to CoinDesk the BTL lab is certified for ISO:17025, a basic standard for laboratory testing around the world.  However, BTL lab was unable to confirm whether they have tested NuMiner’s rigs. The lab requested a test report number, which NuMiner hadn’t produced at the time of publication.  The results of CoinDesk’s inquiry into NuMiner’s mining rig are far from conclusive and the mining world is still waiting with bated breath to see whether the mysterious company will produce sufficient evidence to convince its doubters there is indeed a new major player in the crypto mining rig manufacturing arena.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,"Eliza Gkritsi, Aoyon Ashraf",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/17/questions-remain-about-numiners-best-in-class-bitcoin-mining-rig,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/449299921dc62b3fe1dc8f9aa372dd33101ab9ef-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416683,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWsau,1645132818,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Decline as Traders Position for Volatility,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies traded lower on Thursday, partly due to elevated tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Global stocks also declined while gold, a traditional safe haven, continued to march higher.  On Tuesday, U.S. diplomats provided no sign of a resolution between Russia and Ukraine, despite earlier talks of a de-escalation. The back and forth between country leaders has resulted in choppy trading conditions over the past few days.  In crypto markets, some traders expect higher volatility. For example, over the past 24 hours, more than 10,000 BTC flowed into spot exchanges, according to data compiled by CryptoQuant. That could signal a preference among traders to sell tokens rather than hold in digital wallets.  Meanwhile, bitcoin option traders remain uncertain about future price direction, placing a 50% probability that BTC will trade above $40,000 by September. Neutral sentiment combined with the steady decline in trading volume and volatility suggests many buyers remain on the sidelines.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Higher volatility  Bitcoin's short-term implied volatility is starting to rise from extreme lows, which means traders expect greater price moves over the next few weeks.  ""Implied volatility is likely to pick up again, specifically in bitcoin, rising back up to 90%,"" Don Kaufman, co-founder of TheoTrade, a trading eduction website, said during an interview on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" show.  ""I don't want to go long crypto until you see bitcoin down to the lower $30,000 handle,"" he added. However, if countries impose sanctions on Russia, cryptos would experience near-term volatility, but could eventually attract greater inflows, according to Kaufman.

42421848,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSRZ,1645131866,What Are Music NFTs?,"Although many people associate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with digital pictures sold as blockchain-based assets, there are many other applicable categories. One fast-growing ecosystem in the NFT industry is music NFTs.  On the surface, music NFTs may appear like the blockchain alternative to buying tracks on iTunes. However, when you buy a track on iTunes, you only buy the right to listen to that music. There’s no asset ownership on iTunes – only a license to listen to what you’ve just paid for. In contrast, music NFTs let anyone listen to tracks but also confer ownership over that file through an NFT.  Music NFTs might sound counterintuitive: Why buy the music you can already listen to? The answer to that question is the same as buying JPEGs anyone can right-click and save. Markets, or people, find value in ownership of provably unique and original assets.  For some, that value could come from a closer relationship with the artist they like. For others, it could be financial exposure to an artist who they believe will thrive. If the artist becomes successful, the value of the music NFT they’ve invested in could rise.  Music NFTs can generate lucrative revenue for some artists. One music NFT supporter @Cooopahtroopa estimated that Bajan rapper Haleek Maul made $226,800 in music NFT sales on Catalog, while his annualized Spotify earnings are just $178. When asked about the figures in the tweet, Maul confirmed to CoinDesk that he's made 81 ETH from five Catalog sales, which at the time was worth more than $250,000.  There is a wide range of potential use cases for music NFTs. They can be used to grant access to discounted concert tickets, special areas at concerts or meetups with the artist. It all depends on how the artist wants to structure the NFTs they issue. After all, as Wired editor Kevin Kelly has long argued, all artists need are 1,000 true fans who will support them – and NFTs help capture that idea for an increasingly digital world.  Unless specified, music NFTs give buyers no royalty or copyright claims – just as jpeg NFTs don’t either by default. But there’s also a growing subsector of royalty-oriented music NFTs that we cover below.  Music NFT marketplaces  Although the largest NFT marketplace OpenSea has a dedicated catalogue for music NFTs, most artists prefer to launch on music-specific marketplaces.  Catalog is the primary marketplace for single-edition music NFTs, a category known as 1/1 in the NFT world. It’s built on the Zora protocol, which also powers the OpenSea competitor marketplace by the same name. As of February 2021, artists have sold $2 million worth of music NFTs on Catalog.  Some artists prefer to release limited editions, e.g. 10 NFTs tied to one track, as opposed to 1/1s. For this, a popular option is Sound.xyz, which runs almost daily drops where collectors or traders can mint editions of a music NFT. These freshly-minted NFTs can be resold immediately on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible.  Other platforms that also let artists mint 1/1s include Foundation, Arpeggi and FormFunction.  Platforms specialize in different music genres. Groovetime caters to dance music NFTs, and HEAT is another platform that’s yet to launch. Beat Foundry enables minting generative music, a genre involving collaborations between humans and computers.  Music NFT DAOs  DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, are like crypto-based investment co-ops.  Some DAOs offer grants for NFT artists. MusicFund distributes membership via NFTs, and holders vote each month to donate ETH to three musicians through the community fund. The top three artists receive 0.6 ETH, 0.25 ETH, and 0.15 ETH, respectively. In addition to receiving funds, the artists also gain recognition. Bel, who won MusicFund’s second round of grants, went on to release singles on Catalog. (Although it’s not a DAO, another music grant-maker in crypto is Audius, which runs Audio Grants.)  Other DAOs are investment oriented. Noise DAO began with 65 initial members who have pooled together 1,720 ETH so far, with the mission of incubating NFT artists and investing in music NFTs.  In addition to investments, some like to keep it fun – Friend with Benefits threw an oversubscribed party during NFT.NYC in June 2021 that included DJ sets by Caroline Polachek, Doss, Pussy Riot, Channel Tres and others.  Royalties  Normally, music NFTs only certify on-chain ownership of a token tied to a music file. They don’t confer any more rights beyond that – no royalties, most importantly.  But there are platforms seeking to change that.  Royal helps artists mint royalty-bearing NFTs, which they call Limited Digital Assets, or LDAs. LDAs facilitate sharing the revenue from streaming royalties with fans who hold NFTs. In October 2021, 3LAU minted the platform’s first LDA for his song Worst Case and associated artworks. NFT holders receive 50% in the streaming royalty rights.  Opulous is another platform that’s trying to integrate royalties into music NFTs. It lets token holders retain a share in the music copyright through an agreement established with the artist.  The platform also has other innovative features: Artists can take out DeFi loans against the value of royalties they generate over a year. DeFi investors can stake cryptoassets to provide funding and receive high returns – though the DeFi risks remain.  Music NFT videos  Perhaps because it’s a more capital-intensive venture than other aspects of music NFTs, there aren’t many music video NFT projects.  Glass.xyz is one exception. The fledgling platform lets creators mint videos as NFTs and upload them on the platform. But uploads are subject to Glass.xyz community decisions.  If successful, music NFT videos could change the ad-based Web 2 model that relies on the quantity of views. It’s the 1,000 true fans theory all over again.

42421675,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovUr,1645131585,Why Ethereum Users Tolerate Exorbitant Gas Fees,"Ethereum’s volatile and sometimes extraordinarily high gas fees has been a major topic of conversation. Critics often cite the network’s fees as a fatal flaw that makes it unusable, opening the door for an “ETH killer” to dethrone it as the primary smart contract execution platform. At the highest level, the requirement to pay high fees in order to execute transactions undermines the blockchain’s central pillar of inclusivity.  Not all users have the ability to pay high transaction fees. But Ethereum cannot be written off because of its high cost to use. To understand this perspective, you need to grasp the network’s fee mechanism and the innovations currently being developed and deployed.  What is gas and how does it work?  Gas is the fuel needed to execute transactions on the Ethereum network. On the Ethereum blockchain, gas refers to the cost necessary to perform a transaction. Different types of transactions cost varying amounts of gas depending on their complexity. For example, a simple transfer of ETH requires less gas than transferring ERC tokens or swapping assets on an ETH-native decentralized exchange (DEX).  Each block on the network has an upper bound on the amount of gas it can accept (a gas limit) before it becomes invalid. The gas limit of blocks changes over time, depending on a number of factors. Thus, not all transactions at any point in time will end up in a given block.  Since every action on the network requires gas, and there is a limit on the amount of gas used in each block, miners confirming transactions choose those with the highest gas (reward) first. The rest get pushed to later blocks or don’t get selected at all. Thus, gas acts as a user's bid for block space. This dynamic results in expensive network fees when an increased number of users are bidding on a limited number of space per block.  Read more: What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?  What do high fees really mean?  Spending $10, $50 or $150 per transaction is not ideal for most crypto users. Ethereum 2.0, a network-wide upgrade to make the blockchain more scalable, could not come soon enough. Nonetheless, high fees today suggest that users value ETH block space at a massive premium. High fees may be temporary, but it’s interesting to ask why people put up with them at all.  ETH users can go to Solana, BSC or any other smart contract platform to execute the same transaction for pennies on the dollar. But the vast majority don’t because they believe Ethereum is a better platform, and are willing to pay a premium to use it. This is a positive indication that fees aren’t a weakness, as many are inclined to think. Rather, it is indicative of Ethereum’s stickiness that other “ETH killers” lack.  Why users still choose Ethereum  The primary reason Ethereum remains superior to its counterparts, and thus worth the cost, is that it is fairly decentralized. Decentralization is key for network security and preventing a chain from being hijacked by those validating it. (Network security relates to the security of the blockchain itself, as opposed to the security of the chain's smart contracts. A contract on any chain is only as secure as a developer builds it to be.)  This doesn’t mean other chains are less decentralized, necessarily. But with alternative chains, validators have a greater probability of individually or collectively working to reorganize blocks, reverse transactions and carry out other malicious actions. A comparative analysis of Ethereum and its closest competitors illustrates that it is the most decentralized smart contract blockchain in the space.  Anyone with the ability to set up a miner can validate Ethereum transactions with its current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model. This low barrier to entry benefits decentralization and, in turn, network security. Additionally PoW requires computational input to approve transactions, which dislocates control over supply from control over the network. Validators simply can’t purchase more ETH to gain outsized power over the network. Instead, they must buy an amount of computational power greater than 50% of the network’s total in order to take it over. The incremental cost to do so is high and would destroy the network (and thus the investment made to acquire the computational power), which disincentivizes validators of PoW networks to attack it.  After Ethereum switches to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, you will need to acquire 32 ETH to validate the network. That equates to ~$84,400 at current market price and ~$155,800 at ETH’s all-time high. The capital requirement to validate transactions once ETH 2.0 launches seems daunting, and it might reduce the number of validators on the network, and therefore Ethereum’s decentralization, but on a relative basis, it’s low. Glassnode indicates that there are ~107,700 addresses with 32 ETH, meaning there are over 100,000 potential validators when the migration is complete. This is positive from a desirable decentralization perspective.  Innovations in Ethereum  Innovations in and around Ethereum have been set in motion, in part, because of ETH’s high costs. ETH 2.0, or Serenity, is a network upgrade with a focus on scalability, sustainability and efficiency. The centerpiece of the upgrade is rooted in a migration from its current PoW consensus mechanism to PoS. PoS will allow ETH 2.0 to reduce its environmental impact and implement scalability features with marginal compromises to network security.  Sharding will target lower fees and better scalability. If demand continues to rise, however, the net impact on fees could be marginal or negative in some instances given the network’s gas fee mechanism. Splitting the network into 64 shards will allow it to scale to an estimated 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). This would be a substantial increase above the network’s current capacity of 30 TPS. However, the rollout timing of these features is still largely unknown.  Development and adoption of layer 2s (L2s) has contributed to scaling ETH in the present by lowering fees and boosting transactional throughput. Transactions handled on L2 are done off-chain (not on the Ethereum blockchain), which insulates them from the current pitfalls of using Ethereum mainnet (Ethereum layer 1).  Decentralize finance (DeFi) applications and centralized companies alike have turned toward L2s; Uniswap recently launched v3 of its platform on Polygon, and CEX.IO also integrated with the layer 2 scaling solution. Despite being in a developmental stage, the amount of value locked (TVL) on Ethereum L2s has eclipsed $5.5 billion (~1.7 million ETH distributed across the ecosystem).  Read more: Are Current Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Cheap Enough?  Improvements and increased volume  Ethereum’s volatile and often expensive gas fees can make the network difficult to use at times. However, the network’s sustained use amid high fees, juxtaposed with the rise of layer 2 and other ETH developments, brings a clear message to the surface. The high ETH fees actually prove that users deem the network superior, and, as such, costs are being addressed in multiple ways. Improvements in the ecosystem’s reach and usability will continue as capital inflows sustain and more users tap into it.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MATIC,Konstantin Anissimov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/17/why-ethereum-users-tolerate-exorbitant-gas-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8412da2da3129f27d24d9139259aea9829b63fb-2048x1366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393980,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQNC1,1645128629,Helium Network Passing Half-Million Hotspots Could Fire Up HNT Price,"The Helium Network, a crypto-powered distributed network of long-range wireless hotspots, has amassed over half a million miners across the world in just two years and is expected to cross the 1 million mark in the next six months.  Now, some crypto-market analysts are asking if Helium’s HNT token is poised to rise in value – and what the risks might be.  A Helium hotspot is a small device that plugs into a regular electric outlet, taps into existing internet service and provides long-range connectivity to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hotspot owners are rewarded in cryptocurrency – the HNT tokens – for operating the hotspots.  Helium uses a ""burn-and-mint equilibrium"" token model, with two units of exchange: HNT and Data Credits (DC). Users wanting to use the network to transfer data use DC, which is set at a fixed rate of $0.00001 per 24 bytes of data. When DC is acquired, HNT is burned — reducing the supply of HNT.  So that's what might drive appreciation in the price of HNT: Greater usage of the network would theoretically make the tokens scarcer, and thus more valuable.  Sean Farrell, vice president of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CoinDesk in an interview that based on node growth and adoption, “people might be underestimating how quickly Helium could take the market share from incumbent wireless carriers over the next few years.”  Helium’s HNT token has been trading in the $20-$40 range since the start of the year and is down 32% in the last three months. HNT reached an all-time high of $54.81 in November when bitcoin also reached its all-time high of $68,700. The price is currently around $26, according to data from Messari.  Looking at the current wireless market, Farrell expects the value of holding tokens in the Helium network to be valued higher than equity in a wireless carrier.  He compares Helium with T-Mobile, which currently has the largest existing 5G network and a market capitalization north of $150 billion. Helium currently has a market cap of $2.9 billion.  “Even this comparison falls short since a significant advantage of the network is the decentralization of hardware costs,” said Farrell. He added that the distributed nature of the Helium network also allows for expansion into geographic areas that would otherwise be unprofitable.  “Hence, the market potential for Helium is likely larger than the existing wireless market,” said Farrell.  At the current pace of growth, the network is adding 80,000 new hotspots monthly, according to Frank Mong, Helium’s chief operating officer.  Farrell said that a significant damper for the price right now is the cryptocurrency's general availability to U.S. investors – possibly introducing the risk of regulatory intervention under applicable securities laws.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines securities as fungible, negotiable financial instruments that represent some type of financial value, usually in the form of a stock, bond or option.  Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has previously said: “I think that the securities laws are quite clear. If you’re raising money from somebody else, and the investing public has a reasonable anticipation of profits based on the efforts of others, that fits within the securities law.""  “It’s possible that [HNT] would be considered a security by the SEC and therefore is not listed on any domestic exchanges,” said Farrell.  When asked whether Helium was concerned whether HNT might be deemed a security, Helium’s Mong said, “We feel confident that our HNT incentive-based network serves a utility purpose to connect sensors to the internet. Ultimately, that is a question best left to a regulatory body.”  Will Coinbase list HNT?  Coinbase, the biggest U.S. crypto exchange, does not currently list HNT. The token is listed on FTX’s international exchange and Binance.US.  Coinbase has flirted with the idea of listing HNT, but there has been no follow up so far. In July 2020 the company wrote in a blogpost it had added HNT as an “asset under review” and that it was “conducting engineering work to potentially support the assets.”  CoinDesk reached out to Coinbase to ask whether it had plans to list HNT this year and a spokesperson responded with, “We don't comment on specific assets.”  “I wouldn’t be surprised if Coinbase lists HNT soon,” said Gerald Votta, head of GameFi research at Quantum Economics. “With A16Z already having invested a lot of money in Helium, I think Coinbase will list eventually, '' added Votta. A16Z is shorthand for Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that's investing heavily in the crypto industry. In August, A16Z alongside others invested $111 million into the Helium Network.  ""Helium represents an entirely new business model for deploying wireless networks at scale at a fraction of the cost,"" Ali Yahya, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said at the time in a statement. “Helium built and deployed an entirely new wireless network from scratch and achieved global adoption across more than 11,000 cities around the world in less than 24 months. It is the fastest rollout of a new wireless network ever, a truly impressive and remarkable feat.”  According to Votta, HNT is priced a little over fair value.  5G miners  “This is because the only real use case for Helium is to use HNT to pay rewards to miners,” said Votta. “Until Helium adds more circles to its Venn diagram and has more utility, the speculators are in control.”  Adam Nasli, head analyst at international broker BrokerChooser disagrees with Votta's take, saying that Helium’s real-world use case gives the project a valuable edge.  “Through physical devices, hotspot owners provide wireless connectivity for real companies and real people,” said Nasli. Lime, the scooter- and bike-sharing company, uses Helium to track the locations of its units.  Farrell predicts that once Helium rolls out 5G miners, a few more partnerships and establishes on-chain governance, “the network will garner more retail attention and actual usage.”  In October, DISH, a U.S. direct-broadcast satellite provider, announced a partnership with Helium. The company was the first major carrier to use the Helium Network’s blockchain-based model with customers deploying their own 5G hotspots.  Votta predicts that after the DISH partnership progresses, the ecosystem will expand with multiple new use cases, pushing the price of the token up.  Nasli notes that some investors might still be hesitant about Helium because HNT’s value is largely driven by the wider crypto market, making it unpredictable and volatile. There is a strong correlation between the prices for bitcoin and HNT; over the last three months, the correlation works out to 0.8.  “This high correlation makes it unpredictable, affecting its value,” said Nasli.

Though with models running with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, this electricity use seems to be minimal since their process for transaction validations is staking. But the story is not the same for those running with Proof-of-Work (PoW) such as Bitcoin. Mining is the associated process through which the PoW models could validate their network transactions. However, the process consumes lots of electricity as it uses highly computational equipment to solve cryptographic puzzles. This high energy consumption led to several crackdowns on crypto mining in different countries, especially Bitcoin, in 2021. The move was in line with the argument that such practices facilitate environmental pollution.

42393984,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQNbf,1645125876,How the 'Big Short DAO' Bet Against the Crypto Market and Won,"In late November, a pseudonymous crypto trader behind the Twitter handle @GiganticRebirth issued a warning to his legion of over 85,000 followers.  “High confidence interval that we're very late in the cycle [and that cycles still exist],” he wrote. “Secure your freedom if you've won it.”  @GiganticRebirth, who also goes by GCR (an acronym for Gigantic-Cassocked-Rebirth), said he was feeling increasingly bearish about the cryptocurrency market, which had just enjoyed a 20-month-long bull run that showed no signs of stopping.  As others shilled predictions of “a new crypto supercycle” or “bitcoin to $100K,” GCR was planning a different, contrarian trade: a big short, or a major bet against overvalued altcoins that would generate massive profits if his bearish views played out.  To pull off the trade, he says he assembled a smattering of part-time crypto researchers, ranging from a professional poker champion to a medical student. They shared their findings with each other in a Discord channel and traded on their own.  GCR says he shorted nearly 30 different tokens across multiple exchanges at the height of crypto fervor last November. In January, he tweeted out a screenshot of a trading dashboard from the FTX crypto exchange, purportedly showing big profits from the gambit.  And without quite wanting to reveal his true identity, he now wants to tell his story.  “The market consensus is that no one saw this coming,” GCR told CoinDesk in a phone call. “I saw it coming, I took action.""  Over the past 13 years, the crypto industry has minted billionaires who were early to bitcoin and held onto the asset as its price mounted a seemingly inexorable climb.  But in the notoriously volatile world of cryptocurrencies, timing these rapid market cycles has proved far trickier. In fact, there's no telling whether profitable trades can be replicated in the future.  The crash that started in late 2021 and extended through January sent the total crypto market capitalization plummeting from a high of $3.1 trillion in November to $1.7 trillion in late January, nearly wiping out half of its value. Breaking even during a market downturn is difficult; profiting is even harder.  GCR's tale offers also a window into the quirky world of crypto markets, where individual traders sometimes team up to speculate on volatile asset prices, hoping their collective assessment proves right.  To corroborate the key elements of GCR’s story, a CoinDesk reporter talked to him and several of his collaborators via phone calls, Telegram messages and Discord chats. Nearly all of them declined to provide their real names, asking to be identified only by their pseudonymous Twitter and Discord handles. However, GCR has a reputation, as evidenced by the high five-figure following he has built on Twitter in the past year. He also regularly appears – under the moniker Gigantic-Cassocked-Rebirth – on the FTX exchange’s Top 100 Traders leaderboard, which ranks users by profit and loss. (Currently he’s No. 12).  With faint echoes of “The Big Short,” Michael Lewis’ book (adapted into a hit movie) about Wall Street misfits who bet against the frothy U.S. housing market, here is the story of how one independent crypto trader appears to have predicted last year's market top, collaborating with a ragtag team of alpha hunters.  The Bitcoin ETF trade  It all started in October, when a group of crypto traders assembled in a Discord chat to focus on one of the biggest market catalysts of the year: whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would grant approval for a hotly anticipated bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).  If the group could spot and digest the decision minutes, even seconds, before the rest of the market, they might be able to profit off a move in bitcoin’s price.  To prepare, the team of pseudonymous collaborators – they didn't share their real names with each other on Discord – spent days researching arcane regulatory filings and coding web-scraping bots.  On Oct. 15, 2021, at 4:15 p.m. ET, a web-scraping bot pinged the Discord group as soon as an announcement went up: A new SEC filing had just been posted regarding the Proshares Bitcoin ETF.  The news: approved (or technically, not opposed). The bot notification gave the group enough time to buy bitcoin before much of the world had time to process the bullish news. The price of bitcoin instantly popped to about $59,000 from $57,100.  A ‘decentralized’ hedge fund  The team behind the ETF experiment called itself RebirthDAO, a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" founded by GCR.  In most blockchain-related conversations, a DAO is a decentralized organization powered by a token that confers voting rights; this was really just an informal group that met in a Discord channel.  “The idea was to form a decentralized hedge fund,” GCR told CoinDesk in one of a series of phone calls and Telegram exchanges. “A space where people could get together and look for alpha.”  Alpha refers to the excess returns that some investors seek to pocket above and beyond typical market returns, known as beta. The pursuit often relies on bespoke strategies; in both crypto and traditional financial markets, alpha is difficult to achieve and trading secrets are closely guarded.  “GCR had told me early on that DAOs were going to change the industry,” Discord user fungible0x, a member of the group who acts as liaison between GCR and the moderators, told CoinDesk in a Discord call. “From the beginning, he knew there were many smart minds to collaborate with in crypto. He saw a vacuum for that kind of space.”  Forecaster  GCR, the driving leader behind RebirthDAO, regularly ranks high on a closely watched list known as the FTX Top 100 Traders by PNL or “FTX Leaderboard.”  The moniker, he says, was a randomly generated username from FTX that he has stuck with throughout the years.  To prove he was the same trader as shown on the FTX Leaderboard, GCR briefly changed his display name there to a Gmail address, and then communicated with CoinDesk via email with that account.  The leaderboard is not only a scorekeeper for the FTX exchange’s 100 most profitable trading accounts, but also doubles as a who’s who of the crypto industry’s top traders; making the cut is considered an impressive feat. Other highly ranked traders include Three Arrows Capital, seen as an industry heavyweight.  Since mid-2020, GCR has amassed a cultish legion of over 85,000 Twitter followers. The account has attracted speculative retail “copy-traders” who trade according to his recommendations.  His tweets have ranged from theses on shorting frothy metaverse tokens to calling the SHIB run and other dog-coin phenomena.  Before crypto, GCR says he cut his teeth trading political prediction markets on the popular betting site PredictIt.  In addition to his market calls, his political tweets have ranged from correctly predicting the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer to betting on the underdog run of French Presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse.  Since switching over to crypto, GCR’s contrarian market calls have earned him recognition from Three Arrows Capital's Su Zhu.  “For 3 1/2 years, I did not take a single day off,” said GCR when asked about his trading background. “You have to sacrifice literally everything.”  “He’s a benevolent assassin,” RebirthDAO member and Discord user Pxeo said of GCR in a phone call with CoinDesk. “He’s very good at cutting through things to get to the truth of the situation. There are no better market sentiment accounts on Twitter.”  Frothy signs  On Nov. 22 - just 12 days after bitcoin peaked around $69,000 but at a time when some commentators were still calling for a $100,000 price by year-end - GCR tweeted out his most controversial prediction yet.  He was “back and shorting” the market, just as bitcoin and Ethereum's ether notched new all-time highs and some crypto traders crowed that a ""supercycle"" might carry prices even higher.  “You just had every froth indicator. The total market cap of all crypto in November was at its peak, over $3 trillion,” said GCR. “There was peak euphoria and belief in eternal cycles. It was really contrarian at the time.”  In addition to perceiving a gloomy macro climate, GCR also had strong conviction in seasonality. In 2017, just before the last prolonged bear market, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had begun falling in December; by early 2018, it was a full-blown meltdown.  To GCR, the signs pointed to an obvious new trade: short the market.  He believed the best way to profit off of the inevitable sell-off would be to bet against overbought altcoins, which stood to lose up to 90% of their value in a bear market.  “We knew that the Fed was going to signal a more hawkish stance,” said GCR. (A more aggressive approach by the Fed to tame inflation would undermine the “digital gold” case for bitcoin and/or spur selling by investors who viewed the cryptocurrency as a risk asset. And where bitcoin goes, the rest of crypto follows.)  “Everyone had been saying for all of 2021 that they would sell everything, lock in gains,” GCR went on. “Once the sell-off started to actually happen, people found increasingly convoluted excuses for why the cycle would keep on going.”  After the success of the ETF project, RebirthDAO set its sights on a new trade: a big short.  “Everyone dropped what they were doing and started research on what he presented as the best opportunity,” said fungible0x.  Inflationary altcoins  On Nov. 26, GCR put out an open call to his legion of Twitter followers: He was hiring researchers to look into the distribution, unlocking and vesting schedules for dozens of tokens.  “The vast majority of the market had a piece of these tokens when they went up,” said Pxeo. “Some people even had them since they were a couple of cents. They thought, ‘How can you short it?’ It’s unnatural.”  Upon an initial coin offering (ICO) or initial exchange offering (IEOs) – somewhat similar to initial public stock offerings, but for cryptocurrencies – projects typically sell a portion of their liquid tokens to the public, while other illiquid portions are allocated among team members, the project's treasury and venture capital investors.  These locked tokens follow a years-long vesting schedule that sets out what percentage of the token supply will be unlocked and eligible to be sold at specific time intervals.  The tokens are typically characterized by a big difference between their fully diluted market capitalization and circulating market capitalization. A high ratio is associated with a large proportion of ""locked"" tokens – those that can't be transacted or traded.  “It creates a level of inflation that will require an incredible amount of new money to sustain the baseline price,” GCR explained to CoinDesk.  Eventually, the thinking went, any unlocks – predetermined schedules at which locked tokens are deemed available for trading – would flood the market with a massive supply of additional tokens, depressing prices.  Alpha hunters  Although there are nearly 3,000 members in RebirthDAO, only 50 to 60 members have earned an exclusive ""Alpha"" designation, which allows those members to access restricted chat rooms and discussions where profit-generating trading ideas are exchanged.  To gain admission, a prospective member must ""audition"" by sharing some of their winning trading strategies with a handful of DAO administrators, who evaluate candidates based on the quality of their alpha. (No payment is required.)  “It became really clear during the ETF project that there were some superstars,” said fungible0x, who said the DAO closed to new members due to capacity constraints. “We had to really focus the effort. The best way to do that was to create an ‘alpha’ group.”  CoinDesk was granted access by GCR to the group's Alpha chats (without an audition). Conversations in the Discord channels focused on several trading themes, including ""The Big Short,"" ""Macro Task Force"" and ""News Trading,"" as well as multiple web-scraping bots.  According to the group’s ""Introductions"" channel, members’ backgrounds span from former poker champions to medical students, with many having had trading experience in crypto or traditional financial markets.  “The spirit is just sharing and pushing the group to see if we can literally predict what will happen to the market through our ability to research,” said an Alpha member of the group, Pxeo. “Working together, we were definitely getting more information.”  The Big Short  While GCR provided a targeted list of tokens and the central trading thesis, the analysts would independently research the unlocks and then reconvene to iron out any conflicting information.  “Token unlock schedules are surprisingly public, but very vague,” said Pxeo, who contributed to The Big Short project. “They’re usually just a non-interface graph. You have to ask the project devs to verify.”  Alpha members were encouraged to personally speak with the team members assigned to the tokens in question to pinpoint accurate figures, which often diverged from data on sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap.  They also relied on blockchain analysis, such as following project treasury wallets, liquidity provider wallets and project team wallets.  “You can already know on the project side that an unlock is coming, but you don’t know what dates or how many tokens,” said fungible0x. “We looked at anything on-chain and not on-chain to put together the distribution of the specific token in question and verify the unlock schedule.”  After weeks of research, the researchers identified a list of about 30 highest-conviction tokens to short.  “It’s a large project because there were so many coins,” said Pxeo. “But it became obvious in the first two to three days that the best way to short was through the Solana ecosystem.”  Pxeo said some of the identified Solana-based tokens included SERUM, STEP, SOLENS, OXY and FIDA.  “The metaverse coins were also complete garbage,” continued Pxeo. “They had no infrastructure. It was so obvious.”  Other shorted tokens, according to GCR, included Gala’s GALA (-77% from November all-time high), IoTeX’s IOTX (-80%), The Sandbox’s SAND (-64%), Ethereum Name Service’s ENS (-80%), Gitcoin’s GTC (-76%), Livepeer’s LPT (-75%) and Axie Infinity’s AXS (-69%).  These tokens have all massively underperformed bitcoin (-45%) and ether (-49%), as well as the broader cryptocurrency market (-45%).  “Most altcoins will never recover back to their all-time highs,” GCR told CoinDesk.  “The vast majority will trend to zero and be replaced with new narratives and new rotations. Things can go much much lower than people realize.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | TOKEN SALE,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/17/how-the-big-short-dao-bet-against-the-crypto-market-and-won,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c0492c7e2050e3eb4d56d5a7da12b981ce7dbe1-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

They’re going to go into bitcoin,"" said Kaufman, appearing on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" show on Thursday. ""This is how they’re going to circumnavigate it.”  The back and forth over Ukraine continued today, with President Joe Biden saying a Russian invasion was imminent and Russia expelling Bart Gorman, the U.S. deputy chief of mission to that country. Meanwhile, Russia Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu said troops have been redeployed away from Ukraine. The news has helped send the S&P 500 stock index down 1.5% and the Nasdaq lower by 2%. Bitcoin's price has crumbled nearly 7% to $41,175.  Kaufman, nevertheless, said the bull case for bitcoin is supported by the rise and prominence of decentralized finance (DeFi), which could essentially stifle sanctions altogether. Whether Russia goes that route is another question because there have been mixed signals of late. Those include the Bank of Russia arguing for a crypto ban in favor of its own central bank digital currency, while President Vladimir Putin's Ministry of Finance appears to be at least flirting with the idea of welcoming, regulating and taxing digital assets.  Quantum Economics analyst Jason Deane agrees that bitcoin remains a viable and valuable avenue in Russia to hedge some of Biden’s threats, but sees any big moves as part of a longer-term scenario. “The theory is that uncertainty in traditional markets – all linked to a fiat system already under pressure – would drive capital tobBitcoin and make Russia look for alternatives,” he told CoinDesk. “It’s a hard call whether the asset is mature enough for that to happen.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Brian Evans,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/17/are-heavy-russian-sanctions-a-potential-bull-case-scenario-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2aa0f4cbbb687aaf7e7786dfa6854a6bc7f29f51-2880x1800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375266,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6yU7,1645125733,Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Touts Essay Collection in ETHDenver Talk,"At the opening keynote of the Schelling Point ETHDenver mini-conference on Thursday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin signaled his ongoing transition to a role as a public intellectual, announcing a forthcoming book and lecturing on developmental theories in different technological fields.  In a talk titled “The e-theory-um blockchain,” Buterin discussed the intellectual underpinnings that drive blockchain development.  Touching on a 2019 lecture from Peter Thiel that argued “crypto is libertarian, AI [artificial intelligence] is communist,” Buterin argued that the dichotomy is “oversimplified” but can be used as a rubric for discussing what drives crypto’s ongoing progress.  Instead of discussing the technology on its hypothetical political properties, the focus could instead be on the “intellectual properties” of the tech, he argued: in this case, the difference between what he categorized as “theory” and “empiricism.”  The talk was inspired by a recent Twitter thread from the 28-year-old developer, which riffed on an emerging meme pitting “wordcels” against “shape rotators” – loosely, terms for different types of cognitive proficiencies, with wordcels favoring theory and language and shape rotators embracing empiricism and math.  In the talk, Buterin argued that while crypto development is driven by mathematical and social theories, tech fields like AI instead rely on empirical testing.  Innovations such as private-key cryptography, for instance, didn’t result from taking AI agents and modeling attack vectors over and over; instead, it arose from creating hard mathematical theories to generate security guarantees, Buterin said.  Theory is often viewed with suspicion, he said, because the math-based guarantees can turn out to be wrong and therefore catastrophic; a consensus mechanism failing could wipe the value from a blockchain completely.  “Crypto, specifically, because of its decentralization, is decidedly on the theory side,” Buterin concluded, arguing that emergent technology that impacts social structures, such as crypto, could nonetheless benefit from theory-based development.  Book drop  As he was exiting the stage the technologist also announced a book: “Vitalik Buterin: Proof of Stake,” a collection of essays.  In recent years Vitalik has stepped away from active development of Ethereum, but has been a prolific writer, addressing topics such as cross-chain interoperability and the need for artificial wombs, among other topics.

42421679,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovWv,1645125079,Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger Still Hate Crypto,"Yesterday, Berkshire Hathaway, the temple of 20th century industrial capitalism, led by “the Oracle of Omaha” himself, Warren Buffett, invested in the largest “neobank” in Latin America. Brazil’s Nubank has some (very) indirect exposure to cryptocurrency, which caused a stir given Buffett’s long-time aversion to all things crypto and blockchain. Has Buffett, a man known for eating the same McDonald’s breakfast every day, changed his mind?  It would be a very big deal indeed if he did. Berkshire Hathaway is one of the most profitable corporations ever. Buffett’s investment thesis is taught in business schools around the world. Lehman Brothers asked Buffett for a bailout in 2008 – before imploding (he declined). And so far he has stayed at arms length from bitcoin, famously calling the digital asset “rat poison, squared.” A reversal, even just a softer view, would be great for validation.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But some stories are too good to be true. To start, this isn’t even the first investment Berkshire made in Nubank – it took a $500 million stake a few months before the company went public in December 2021. And while the bank does offer roundabout bitcoin exposure through its investment arm, at this point it just looks like a single BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Buffett’s right hand man, Berkshire Vice President Charlie Munger, did the press rounds yesterday afternoon to clear the air. At a Daily Journal conference in Los Angeles, Munger reiterated the famed financial duo’s hatred of crypto. ""I certainly didn't invest in crypto. I'm proud of the fact that I avoided it. It's like some venereal disease,” he told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer.  That said, in the same interview, Munger suggested that although he wished crypto had “never been invented” or was regulated out of existence it’s likely to stick around for the long haul. “We can't do much about it, so we spend our time on the matters we can do something about,” he said. (He did say, if he were the “benign dictator of the world,” he’d make it “infeasible” to make short-term profits from securities.)  This gets at something much deeper and much more interesting about the state of the crypto markets. Crypto, the great disrupter, is increasingly embedded within the financial system. Over the past two-plus years, more than a handful of formerly skeptical institutions have begun rolling out crypto services. JPMorgan offers crypto to wealthy investors, despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s deep skepticism. Its competitors have similar offerings. Billionaire investors, like Munger and Buffett’s peer Ray Dalio, discuss bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge.  See also: Ray Dalio, Wall Street's 'Oddest Duck,' Shares the Bitcoin Mind  Munger said the asset class is nothing more than “heavily promotional capitalism.” But it’s also an industry that, whether you like or not, people can no longer avoid. Even though Nubank is not a “crypto” firm, it’s likely to increasingly take on exposure to the region’s blockchain industry. The Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America found that crypto-related venture spending increased tenfold in 2021 compared to the year before. Two of Latin America’s latest unicorns, or private firms with at least a $1 billion valuation, Mercado Bitcoin and Bitso, are crypto exchanges.  There’s money to be made in the crypto industry, in part by disrupting the very industries and practices that made Berkshire Hathaway so profitable. But that doesn’t necessarily mean crypto is incommensurate with Buffett’s “value investing” tenets. You don’t even need “dog tokens” to finance a real-world monstrosity like the “Munger dorm.” Crypto, like any market, would basically go to bed with anyone. Whether that makes it a “speculative orgy,” as Munger said, or a going concern is an open question.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/17/warren-buffett-and-charlie-munger-still-hate-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/904c98d902f547f800f72d6e5f617670613368fc-1518x1018.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Such a trend can be bearish for the price of the coin as investors usually deposit their ETH to exchanges for selling purposes.

42417124,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6hLB,1645121625,You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022,"Crypto may have started out as a discreet decentralized economy, but now that the nearly $2 trillion sector has gone mainstream enough to occupy coveted Super Bowl ad space, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is well clued in.  The IRS classifies cryptocurrency as intangible property for tax purposes, which means the profits you make from selling virtual currency are subject to capital gains taxes. This holds true whether you bought bitcoin or altcoins on a crypto exchange like Coinbase, or simply used an app like Venmo or PayPal to buy and use cryptocurrency.  It’s at the forefront of tax professionals’ minds this year: TurboTax now asks upfront when beginning your 2021 tax return whether or not you traded crypto last year. And if you do your taxes on paper with the help of a certified public accountant (CPA), you should at least be prepared to tell them your 2021 crypto earnings. (This is easier when you plug your wallet into a crypto portfolio tracking app that can calculate your capital gains and losses in minutes.)  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  But what exactly does the IRS consider to be “earnings” when it comes to crypto – and what triggers a taxable event? Let’s take a look at how the IRS classifies the following scenarios.  Surprise crypto tax bills to watch out for in 2022  Did you get gifted an NFT, buy everyday goods with crypto or earn enough crypto to push you into a new tax bracket? Here are some common “surprise” crypto taxes and how experts suggest you stay prepared.  Gifted crypto and airdrops  Crypto was a popular present last year. According to a BlockFi survey, one in 10 people gave crypto as a holiday gift.  However exciting crypto may be, if you gave it as a gift, you should be aware of IRS rules on gifting. There’s a $15,000 gift threshold for 2021, meaning the giver doesn’t have to pay taxes on the gift as long as it's worth $14,999 or less. If the value of the gift is over $15,000, the tax burden falls on the generous donor, who must file IRS form 709.  “If my parents give me $10,000 in bitcoin, that's not taxable income for me,” said David Kemmerer, CEO and co-founder of CoinLedger, a crypto tax reporting software.  But there are some nuances. If you are given crypto and it gains value and you experience a capital gain when you sell it (either for U.S. dollars or a different cryptocurrency), you’ll be required to pay capital gains taxes on the amount you profited – not the entire amount you sold it for.  Capital gains taxes are also calculated based on your income and how long you held the asset before selling. (Learn more about how the IRS calculates capital gains taxes.)  NFTs  Anyone on social media has likely heard of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by now, but few know how they are taxed.  Read More: 5 Things to Remember When Paying Your NFT Taxes  The IRS has yet to release definitive guidance on NFTs, but it’s worth noting that British tax authorities recently made the country’s first seizure of NFTs during a fraud investigation and tax crackdown. Of course, U.S. citizens can’t look to other countries for precise tax guidance, but it’s becoming clearer each day that consumers shouldn’t try to sweep NFT purchases and trades under the rug.  Until the IRS issues more nuanced guidance, tax professionals advise treating NFTs as virtual assets just like any other crypto. There are three things to watch out for here:  The $15,000 gift threshold for NFTs: Gifting and/or airdropping NFTs is not taxable as long as the value is under $15,000. Some of the more expensive NFTs are currently valued at higher than that, with famous NFTs like Bored Apes starting at six figures. If you're giving someone a five-figure piece of digital art over the $15,000 threshold, be prepared to fill out Form 709 and pay gift taxes.  Capital gains taxes apply when you sell NFTs: Selling your NFT for fiat currency, cryptocurrency or another NFT is a taxable event. You’ll be taxed on the income you make, calculated by subtracting your cost basis from the gross proceeds you get from selling. Capital gains taxes range from 0% to 20%, depending on your income and how long you held the assets.  Buying NFTs is also usually a taxable event: Because NFTs are almost always bought or sold in crypto, there are multiple transactions between fiat and cryptocurrencies that result in capital gains or losses. Purchasing an NFT is therefore commonly a taxable event – even if you don’t sell it for a profit.  One last possibility is that the IRS could classify NFTs as collectibles – similar to stamps, antiques or trading cards. If they were to do this, the capital gains taxes would be slightly higher than normal, at a rate of 28%. For now, most CPAs suggest sticking to normal capital gains laws, though that could always change.  Gaming reward tokens  A growing number of people worldwide are making an additional income via play-to-earn video games that reward players with decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens that can hold real-world value and can be exchanged for either crypto or fiat (government) currencies.  Read More: Avoid Crypto Tax Headaches: What You Need to Know if You Bought or Sold Crypto in 2021  While this new source of cash has benefited many, the crypto earned within these online games is not exempt from taxes.  “Reward tokens will fall into a similar taxable bucket to staking rewards,” said Kate Waltman, a CPA who focuses on cryptocurrency and digital assets. “Staking” is an advanced DeFi process that lets traders earn passive income on their crypto in exchange for letting the blockchain lock it for a period of time (usually months). All gamers aren't necessarily well-versed in DeFi, so it’s important they are aware of how the IRS will tax their crypto earnings.  “Those rewards are going to be taxable, versus playing traditional video games where you may earn rewards in the game, but they are only usable inside the game,” Waltman said. ""The tricky piece here isn't so much knowing that it's taxable, but rather knowing how we value those tokens?”  According to Waltman, the IRS hasn't offered concrete regulation yet with respect to these details. “I think a lot of people have been playing video games and earning crypto reward tokens and may not realize they actually hold value,” she said.  Bumping up to a higher tax bracket  A lot of people made money on crypto last year, according to Waltman. Some, therefore, broke the $200,000 adjusted gross income (AGI) threshold for the first time – and may have higher taxes than normal.  In this case, new high-income earners will need to pay the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT), a 3.8% tax that’s added onto your capital gains, dividends and royalty income.  “If you're an individual and your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000, then you trigger this Net Investment Income Tax on top of your normal capital gains tax that you're already paying on,” said Waltman.  The income threshold jumps up to $250,000 for people who are married filing jointly, and down to $125,000 for those married filing separately.  Learn more about the NIIT on the IRS website.  Buying coffee and everyday goods with crypto  Buying goods and services with crypto – even small purchases like buying a coffee – might trigger a taxable event in the eyes of the IRS.  Here’s why: Paying for everyday items involves exchanging a digital currency (e.g. bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, etc.) for fiat currency (e.g. the U.S. dollar). Prepaid crypto debit cards and crypto credit cards make this process so seamless it may not seem like it’s worth telling the IRS. However, small transactions throughout the year can add up to a significant sum. Those who buy everyday goods and services with crypto should therefore keep good records.  This brings us to our next point …  Crypto rewards cards  “So these are really interesting,” said Waltman. “From a tax perspective, it's kind of complex.”  Popular crypto debit and credit cards like the Gemini Mastercard and the BlockFi bitcoin rewards card have made it easy to buy items in the store using crypto. In addition, users can earn crypto rewards, such as 3% back in bitcoin on spending.  These cards can either simplify IRS crypto reporting or, in other cases, open them up to even more taxable events with their crypto.  Read More: The 7 Types of Crypto Tax Nightmares  Rewards generally aren’t taxable, noted Waltman, and are treated just like credit card points and airline miles you earn after meeting certain spending conditions. Consumers who use debit cards that allow them to spend in U.S. dollars but earn in crypto don’t have to report their rewards until they exchange them for fiat or another cryptocurrency via a purchase or on an exchange.  “That's a really interesting way to start accumulating and acquiring crypto without it being taxable income to you right away,” Waltman said.  However, if your crypto rewards card is a prepaid card, and you’re actually paying with a balance of crypto each time you swipe your card, there is an exchange happening behind the scenes that require IRS reporting.  “Bitpay, for example, allows you to pay with your crypto,” Waltman said. “When you swipe the card it very quickly and simultaneously makes a conversion for you from bitcoin to fiat. That exchange will have capital gains.”  Read More: A Complete Guide to US Crypto Taxes 2022  CORRECTION (Feb. 17, 17:05 UTC): The article originally stated that the recipient of a gift over $15,000 may need to report that as income, but it has been corrected to say that the only donor of a gift is responsible for associated tax reporting.

42421845,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSOT,1645119655,Investing in Crypto: Alternatives to Bitcoin and Ether,"If you’re new to cryptocurrency investing, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking bitcoin and ether – the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum – are the only solid, safe investment options in the market. And while many maximalists might agree with you, alternative cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) are clearly on the rise.  According to the latest figures, bitcoin dominance as measured by market capitalization has fallen from 69% to 42% of the value of the total crypto market over the last year, while altcoins have risen from 11% to 21%. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and DeFi-related protocols are two likely catalysts for this change, as an increasing number of holders diversify into tokens tied to the rapidly growing ecosystems.  Diversification is important for managing and growing a portfolio, particularly if you’re new to investing. U.S billionaire Warren Buffett once said, “Diversification is protection against ignorance.” Isolating your investment to two coins out of the over 17,000+ possible options can not only amplify your risk but can also minimize your potential profits.  As such, it is advisable to look beyond the appeal of bitcoin and ether and consider allocating part of your portfolio to other promising crypto assets.  What you should look for when choosing an alternative crypto  When searching for alternative investment options in the crypto market, it’s important to evaluate the options you are considering to determine the ones that best fit your investment strategy. Factors to evaluate include;  Availability: This means how many exchanges or platforms list the particular crypto asset. Is it easy to buy and sell large volumes at any given time? Is the token supported across multiple blockchains?  Roadmap developments: When investing for the long-term, you’ll want to make sure the underlying cryptocurrency project has a strong future development plan, including the addition of new features, partnerships and updates. These should help support the corresponding token’s price over time and attract new investors to the project.  Investment viability: It is critical to analyze the viability of the digital assets you are considering investing in. You do not want to invest in a cryptocurrency whose value could potentially fall before your investment time horizon elapses. As such, you must identify the utilities of the token, how it stacks up against other competing projects and the strength of the community backing it.  Crypto sector: When choosing a coin to add to your portfolio, it is crucial to avoid investing in a cluster of coins that tend to all move in tandem. In the crypto market, the prices of digital assets tackling similar industries or crypto sectors often rise and fall at the same time. For example, having too many DeFi tokens would likely expose you to unnecessary risks, especially during times when the DeFi market experiences a slump. To prevent this, you should spread your portfolio across various crypto sectors, including NFTs, DeFi, layer 2, crypto exchanges and the metaverse.  Here are some of the digital assets that should be on your radar.  Decentralized applications' platform coins  Solana (SOL)  Solana is another fast-emerging blockchain ecosystem looking to displace Ethereum as the largest hub for decentralized applications (dapps). Like Binance Smart Chain, Solana’s goal is to create a more affordable and faster means of accessing and transacting on the blockchain apps.  In particular, it focuses on optimizing decentralized finance (DeFi) such that DeFi apps can become accessible on a larger scale. Moreover, it has begun to make moves in the NFT space, thereby creating more reasons for users to engage with its network. As such, SOL, which is Solana’s native digital asset, has increasingly appealed to investors and dapp users alike such that its price grew by over 10,000% in 2021.  Also, the network hosts a vibrant staking economy with over 74% of the total supply of SOL currently being staked. For those unfamiliar with the term staking, it is the process of depositing or locking away an amount of tokens on a blockchain to become eligible to take up the role of a validator, or an active participant of the network, and, in turn, earn rewards.  Cardano (ADA)  Similar to how Solana and Binance Smart Chain are trying to dethrone Ethereum, Cardano has created a highly sophisticated infrastructure designed to eliminate some of the flaws of established crypto networks.  While the development of Cardano kicked off in 2017, it was not until 2021 that the team launched an upgrade that allowed the blockchain to provide smart contract functionality. This made it possible for Cardano to host and facilitate the creation of native decentralized applications that use smart contracts for their operations. Due to this infrastructural advancement and other factors, ADA, the native token of Cardano, experienced a 650% gain in 2021.  It is also worth mentioning that Cardano has one of the most attractive staking ecosystems, with 64% of ADA’s total supply currently being staked.  Layer 2 projects  Polygon (MATIC)  Another digital asset that has performed strongly in the last year is Polygon. Unlike the digital assets and networks mentioned thus far, Polygon does not see itself as an Ethereum killer.  Instead, it looks to optimize the Ethereum ecosystem by creating bridges between multiple different blockchains to create better interoperability. Polygon can also handle Ethereum transactions on its own blockchain, making them cheaper and faster, as well as helping to reduce congestion on Ethereum.  The project's native token, MATIC, is an Ethereum-based digital asset used as the settlement currency on Polygon and the cryptocurrency accepted for paying fees. Remarkably, the value of MATIC rose by 13,000% in 2021, making it a viable option for investors.  Loopring (LRC)  Like Polygon, Loopring is a layer 2 solution that looks to optimize the Ethereum ecosystem. More specifically, Loopring provides an off-chain solution that sits on top of Ethereum’s blockchain and processes transactions using a type of scaling technology called zero knowledge (zk) rollups.  As the name implies, zk rollups involve taking a batch of transactions, rolling them up into one transaction and creating a validity proof that shows all transactions inside the rollup are valid. The rolled up single transaction is then recorded on the blockchain. In short, it groups transactions together to make processing them faster, cheaper and more efficient.  It’s stated that, with the help of Loopring’s off-chain processing, Ethereum can increase its transaction throughput capability by 1,000x.  Over 2021, LRC token rose 1,160% and reached a new all-time high of $3.86 before correcting.  Metaverse tokens  Decentraland (MANA)  Decentraland is one of the torch-bearers of the explosive NFT market. The metaverse-like platform boasts a vibrant economy anchored by NFTs and the promise of owning a piece of a virtual world. Simply put, Decentraland is an increasingly-expanding, Ethereum-based pixelated virtual world where users can purchase parcels of land, build structures on them like casinos and theme parks and ultimately monetize them. While the land on Decentraland is represented by NFTs called LAND, the platform also issues its own utility token, called MANA, that players can use to buy avatars and in-game items like wearables on the platform’s native marketplace.  Also, users must burn MANA before they can acquire LAND tokens. This is part of the deflationary systems put in place to sustain the value of MANA. Notably, MANA, in tandem with the NFT market, had a record-breaking year in 2021, with its price soaring over 4,000%.  The Sandbox (SAND)  The Sandbox shares some similarities with Decentraland in that it is a virtual world powered by NFTs. In essence, it promotes creativity as it supplies building tools with which users can build, monetize and trade NFT-based digital assets. As a platform that depends on user-generated content, The Sandbox has also ensures that its users can participate in the governance and future planning of the project. This is where the SAND token comes into play.  The SAND token is a critical component of the platform’s governance system and allows holders to contribute actively to the development of the project. Also, SAND is the settlement currency for buying NFTs on the platform’s marketplace. Like MANA, SAND had an impressive run in 2021 and soared in price by over 15,000%.  Crypto exchange utility tokens  Binance coin (BNB)  Binance coin (BNB) is the utility token of the Binance ecosystem, which features an exchange service, a staking solution, a payment service, blockchain application networks and a crypto loan product. Simply put, BNB is to Binance Smart Chain what ether is to the Ethereum blockchain.  For the better part of 2021, BNB was featured among the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap and notably outperformed bitcoin and ether. BNB gained 1,344% in 2021, while bitcoin was up 73%, and the value of ether rose by 455%.  This was largely due to the growing adoption of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) among DeFi and NFT users and developers. For those unfamiliar with Binance Smart Chain, it is considered one of the top alternatives to Ethereum because of its lower transaction fees and high transaction processing capabilities. And so, it is no surprise that its native digital asset has found success.  Crypto.com coin (CRO)  Crypto.com, the Singapore-based company that recently bought the naming rights to the Los Angeles arena, previously called Staples Center, operates a crypto exchange, a payment solution and a blockchain application network.  At the center of all this is Cyrpto.com coin (CRO) which serves as the utility token that users receive as rewards or utilize as the currency for settling fees. More importantly, CRO is the native token of Crypto.com’s two blockchains: the Crypto.com chain and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible Cronos chain. Part of the on-chain utility of CRO is that it anchors the staking economies of Cronos and Crypto.com chain. Owing to the growing affluence of Crypto.com and the fact that users have access to a myriad of applications, it is no surprise that CRO is one of the promising crypto exchange utility tokens out there. Notably, the digital asset gained 850% over 2021.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/investing-in-crypto-alternatives-to-bitcoin-and-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7cc9db8d650bdad190b9fcef3f7a3e8a551df6-2041x1469.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421688,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovYz,1645118331,"Bitcoin Is a Bad Way to Fund the Ottawa Protest, and That's a Good Thing","Bitcoin has been advertised as a viable way for getting funds to the truck convoy protestors in Ottawa when fiat-based tools like GoFundMe don't work. But it has proven to be a less-than ideal way to fund the trucker convoy. And that's a good thing for Canadian democratic society.  The 20-day Ottawa protest has long since transitioned into illegal territory. Like any other illegal protest on Canadian soil, it needs to be ended. Unreliable funding only helps to reduce the mischief, especially if that funding can be nudged into functioning even less reliably.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  Don't get me wrong. As a Canadian, I realize that democratic protest is vital. It is one of many ways for citizens to change minds and initiate change. Money is integral to supporting protest. And the Ottawa trucker convoy – which started as a protest against coronavirus vaccine mandates – has aptly demonstrated the power of several new protest-friendly, internet-based financial tools: crowdfunding, instant personal bank transfers and bitcoin.  A GoFundMe campaign to fund the Ottawa convoy began on Jan. 14, hitting $7.9 million just a few weeks later. When the campaign was canceled by GoFundMe on Feb. 4 for breaking its terms of service, a replacement campaign hosted on competing U.S. crowdfunding site GiveSendGo beat that amount within a few days. It currently stands at $9.5 million.  A parallel bitcoin fundraiser, organized by a trucker-support group called HonkHonkHodl, on Tallycoin, a bitcoin-based crowdfunding site, quickly raised 21 bitcoins ($900,000). Another $400,000 was reportedly donated to organizers via Interac e-Transfer, Canada's version of Zelle.  Read more: Dan Kuhn - Humans Are the Last-Mile Problem of Bitcoin Crowdfunding for Canada Truck Protest  When protest becomes illegal, it's the task of the police to step in and break it up. Any inability to do so on their part hurts one of the other key pillars of democratic society: rule of law. If the law no longer functions, Canada would quickly descend into a state of perpetual chaos.  By Feb. 9, the protest had reached the illegal stage. That day, the Ottawa police department notified protestors they were engaging in mischief, a criminal offense. The ""unlawful blocking” of streets was resulting in citizens being denied the ""lawful use, enjoyment and operation of their property,"" declared the police department's press release, and the convoy was henceforth required to cease its blockade of downtown Ottawa.  But the protestors didn't comply.  When protests are illegal, law enforcement has a number of tools at its disposal to restore order including arrests, fencing, space control and negotiation. But the Ontario provincial government added an additional lever that (as far as I know) has never been used to control an illegal Canadian protest: It shut down the convoy's massive crowdfunding campaign.  Ontario's attorney general secured a restraint order from an Ontario judge freezing all donations received via the convoy's two GiveSendGo campaigns. The restraint order, which was issued under Section 490.8 of Canada’s Criminal Code, also extended to GiveSendGo funds already transferred to convoy organizers, including the convoy’s non-profit organization. The legal justification for the restraint order was the usage of the funds to commit the ""indictable offense of mischief.""  GiveSendGo boasted that the restraint order didn’t apply to it, but it was an empty boast. Any Canadian bank that received a wire transfer from GiveSendGo for credit to the convoy’s bank account was obligated to immediately freeze it, on pain of breaking the law. The order had neatly crippled the $9 million in crowdsourced funds.  Read more: Canada's Trudeau Enacts Emergencies Act, and Crypto Is Included  Although the Tallycoin bitcoin fundraiser was not named in the restraining order, it was no less vulnerable to being frozen than the funds on GiveSendGo. The coordinators of the bitcoin fundraiser had envisioned distributing the 21 crowdfunded bitcoins to the same set of convoy leaders who were beneficiaries of the GiveSendGo campaign. The convoy leaders would then convert the bitcoins into Canadian dollars via an exchange and spend them.  It's pretty easy to spot the weakness. The very same judge who issued a restraint order on the nonprofit organization's GiveSendGo funds could have also issued it on the bitcoins raised on Tallycoin by the nonprofit. No bitcoin exchange in Canada was going to touch those funds, thus confining the 21 bitcoins to the same purgatory as the $9 million in GiveSendGo funds.  The coordinators of the bitcoin fundraiser have since shifted to a complicated strategy of paying bitcoins directly to truckers, the idea being to avoid single points of control. But evading centralized infrastructure means subjecting truckers to all of bitcoin’s pain points, reducing the fundraiser’s effectiveness so it shouldn’t be much of a concern to law enforcement.  Efforts to quell the illegal protest have since crescendoed with the federal government's invocation of the Emergency Measures Act, a law that gives the federal government extra powers during times of national crisis. Among other things, the Emergency Measures Act temporarily allows Canadian financial institutions to freeze accounts of any individual or business affiliated with the illegal blockades. A court order need not be secured, and the government says it will protect the banks from being sued for damages.  In addition, financial institutions must disclose to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or Canada’s intelligence agency, CSIS, whether they are holding funds for participants in the protest.  The measures will help foil bitcoin person-to-person funding attempts. The RCMP has sent letters to Canadian cryptocurrency exchanges asking them to cease dealing in 30 different bitcoin addresses, presumably those involved in the Tallycoin fundraiser. Because bitcoin transactions are public and traceable, exchanges will be able to freeze trucker accounts if they are linked to the embargoed addresses.  The powers afforded by the Emergency Measures Act make me very uncomfortable. It's one thing to use regular legal channels like Section 490.8 of the Criminal Code to secure restraint orders on large actors involved in mischief and unlawful blockades. That seems like a reasonable addition to law enforcement's arsenal of tools for ending illegal protests. We know it worked. The $9 million in GoFundMe funds are immobilized.  But it's a completely different thing to introduce special measures for freezing any and all accounts associated with the protest, and to do so without a court order or the opportunity for citizens to take banks to court. Undeserving Canadians who may have donated $20 to a cause they didn't entirely understand could get caught up in the blast radius.  Canadians don't yet know all the gritty details that led the government to invoke the Emergency Measures Act. But when the time comes for the automatically mandated official inquiry into the government's actions, the government will have to prove to citizens that it meant to prevent something more than just the ""unlawful blocking” of Ottawa streets, but something truly sinister. Until it does so, the powers afforded by the Emergency Measures Act should worry all Canadians.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/17/bitcoin-is-a-bad-way-to-fund-the-ottawa-protest-and-thats-a-good-thing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/699c584640eb1f5dd84419c6ac04bd56ad40dae6-5093x3395.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The $205 million pot was announced Thursday by Multicoin Capital, Reciprocal Ventures, gumi Cryptos Capital, NGC Ventures, CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group and HashKey.  The fund will provide grants to teams building dapps using The Graph’s querying technology spanning sectors as diverse as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), marketplaces, cross-chain infrastructure and the metaverse – a shared, interactive and potentially immersive digital environment.  “Whether consumers are on board with Web 3 or not, Web 3 is making its way to us,” Deng Chao, managing director of HashKey Capital, said in a statement. “Developers need decentralized Web 3 solutions, like The Graph, that are designed to be accessible.”  Developers use The Graph to access blockchain data through open inter-program communication protocols (API) called subgraphs. The retrieved data is used to power a wide array of dapps, making The Graph a key component of Web 3 infrastructure.  Growth-orientated crypto projects often start funds to lure developers into building applications for their blockchain or to incentivize developers to use their product. Last month, ​​privacy-focused blockchain Secret Network announced $400 million in funding, including a $225 million ecosystem fund. The Near blockchain announced a staggering $800 million in grants funding toward the end of last year, including a $250 million ecosystem fund.  “Many of the blockchain applications and protocols that people are interacting with today are powered by centralized platforms and solutions providers,” explained Craig Burel, a partner at Reciprocal Ventures, one of The Graph’s backers.  “In the near term, it will still remain this way until more decentralized alternatives are available. To expedite that future, we have come together with some of the biggest players in the crypto industry to provide strategic capital and resources to developers aligned with The Graph’s mission to bring web3 to fruition,” Burel said in a statement.  The Graph Foundation raised $50 million last month in a private sale of its GRT token. The sale included allocations to Tiger Global, Reciprocal Ventures and Fintech Collective.

The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), announced by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco on Thursday, will evaluate which types of crimes involving crypto might need more resources to investigate and prosecute these cases.  The team will be headed by longtime prosecutor Eun Young Choi, according to a press release.  Monaco announced the new unit during a keynote address at the Munich Cyber Security Conference, saying the unit will conduct its own blockchain analysis and seizing of assets involved in crimes.  ""I think we are sending a message that cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies should not be considered a safe haven,"" Monaco said in a question and answer session following the keynote.  The team will focus on crypto exchanges, mixers, tumblers and other types of digital asset infrastructure providers that might allow for ""the criminal misuse of cryptocurrencies,"" according to the release.  Ransomware will also be a key focus, according to Monaco, who said law enforcement officials have to ""bust [the] business model"" for launching these types of attacks.  ""The NCET will enhance the Criminal Division’s existing efforts to provide support and training to federal, state, local and international law enforcement to build capacity to aggressively investigate and prosecute serious crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets in the United States and around the world,"" the release said.

BIT Mining announced in May a plan to invest $9.33 million to construct and operate a data center in Kazahkstan with a total power capacity of 100 megawatts (MW). However, during its quarterly earnings report this morning, the company said that deal had been terminated.  The move won’t affect BIT Mining's bitcoin mining machines deployed in third-party data centers in the country, said the firm.  It’s another data point showing the continued difficulty miners are facing in Kazakhstan as the national grid operator moved first to ration electricity to crypto miners, and then to cut them off completely. On Dec. 2, CoinDesk reported that Bitmain-backed miner BitFuFu - following weeks of power rationing in Kazakhstan - abandoned its mining rigs there and purchased new ones to set up in the U.S.  BIT Mining, meanwhile, continues to ramp up data center investment in the U.S., saying development of its Ohio mining site is expected to be completed in the first half of this year. The location will have a total planned power capacity of up to 150 megawatts.  Turning to Q4 operating results, the company reported revenue of $495.8 million, up 26% from $393.1 million in the previous three months. Helping to boost revenue were deployments of mining machines in Hong Kong and the U.S., and stronger mining pool business thanks to rising cryptocurrency prices.  The company’s Q3 revenues were revised lower by $33 million because of a reclassification of commissions charged to mining pool customers, Vice President Danni Zheng told CoinDesk via WeChat on Thursday.  Shares are down 2.6% in late-morning U.S. trading, with miner peers also sliding alongside a 4% decline in the price of bitcoin (BTC).

42375264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6yXt,1645110000,Sequoia Capital Looking to Raise Up to $600M for New Crypto Fund,"Storied venture capital firm Sequoia Capital is looking to raise $500 million to $600 million for its first sector-specific crypto fund. The fund is one of the first sub-funds launched after the firm’s major restructuring, announced in October.  Sequoia’s restructuring shifts the firm away from a traditional venture capital structure and timeline of returning the investments of limited partners (LP) within 10 years. Sequoia now funnels all investments through the Sequoia Fund, an open-ended liquid portfolio of public positions in a select group of companies. The fund then allocates capital to a series of closed-end sub funds.  Sequoia Crypto Fund is one of the first sub-funds. In an interview with CoinDesk, a company official also confirmed a $900 million to $950 million Ecosystem sub-fund that lets select founders of portfolio firms invest in other related companies, and a $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion Expansion sub-fund focused on growth-stage companies.  Crypto venture capital funds hit new highs last year as digital asset prices rallied. In November, Paradigm launched a $2.5 billion fund, topping a $2.2 billion fund raised last summer from Andreessen Horowitz to become the largest VC fund in crypto history.  Investing in the ‘full stack’  The Sequoia Crypto Fund will primarily focus on investing in liquid tokens and digital assets.  “While we’ve invested in both equity and tokens over the last five years, many have asked that we take a more active role in managing our tokens, including staking them, providing liquidity, participating in governance and trading through their platforms,” said Sequoia partners Michelle Bailhe, Shaun Maguire and Alfred Lin in the announcement post.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Bailhe said the fund is investing “full stack,” including in layer 1 protocols, layer 2 add-on systems, the data layer, decentralized finance (DeFi), centralized applications, payments, gaming, Web 3, non-fungible tokens (NFT), and consumer and enterprise infrastructure.  “I think the interesting thing about this moment in crypto is that some people are approaching each of those sectors with more token-driven models and some people are approaching it with equities,” said Bailhe. “We wanted to have a full stack product, from seed through liquid tokens, for the founders we work with across all of these sectors.”  Why a crypto-specific fund?  Despite the launch of a crypto-specific fund, Sequoia will continue to partner with crypto teams across the seed, venture, growth and expansion funds, which have combined commitments of over $7.5 billion.  Why, then, would Sequoia also launch a crypto-specific fund?  “Part of why Sequoia has never had a sector specific fund is that we think it’s a superpower for everyone to share information and sit really close to each other,” Shaun Maguire told CoinDesk.  “We wanted to have a balance where we can move really fast and really nimble with an expert level knowledge of crypto, but also [make sure] the learnings are being shared across all of Sequoia,” Maguire added.  Maguire noted that people at Sequoia “have been around crypto for a long time,” but the sector became more of a firm-wide effort in the past year.  “Last year, over 20% of the entire firm’s investments went into crypto in the U.S. and Europe,” Maguire noted.

Today's show will feature guests:  Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy, Circle  Don Kaufman, co-founder, TheoTrade  Market Moves  By Lyllah Ledesma  Bitcoin (BTC) is down 2% on the day, falling in line with broader markets as traders continue to assess the geopolitical tensions between Russia and the U.S. over Ukraine.  Unable to break the $45,000 mark over the last seven days, bitcoin’s relationship with global markets continues to strengthen, despite previously having been touted as an uncorrelated hedge against inflation.  Futures contracts tracking the U.S. S&P 500 share index fell by 0.5% on Thursday, and futures tracking the tech-stock-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 0.6%.  “Bitcoin quite clearly is still viewed as a 'risk-on' asset at the moment and declining in line with broader assets and tech,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin, was trading in the $44,300-$43,100 range over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was trading at $3,054 at press time, down 2.5% over the same period.  For the short-term, bitcoin’s choppy trades in sync with equity markets could continue, according to Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer of Stack Funds. “However, we believe that crypto (BTC) is beginning to show some relative strength to other assets.”  Dibb predicts that in the medium term, bitcoin will break $50,000 again, though a push past the all-time high near $69,000, set last November, may take a little longer.

Yield Guild Games, the eponymous token of the YGG gaming guild, a DAO that generates yield by providing laborers for play-to-earn games, was down 7% on-day, according to CoinGecko.  Axie Infinity’s AXS token, the largest token for a play-to-earn game, posted losses of nearly 6% by the start of the European business day.  Sandbox’s SAND and Decentraland’s MANA followed, with losses of 5.8% and 2.5% respectively.  Metaverse stocks fell. Meta (formerly Facebook) is down 2% on the day and 5% for the last week. So far the stock has posted a 31% decline during the last month as confidence wanes in Mark Zuckerberg’s ambition to transform Facebook into a metaverse-centric company.  HTC, the Taiwanese producer of virtual reality headsets that are considered an essential tool for VR-based vision of the metaverse was up 1% during the Asia trading hours. During the past half-year the stock is up nearly 80% as retail investors in Taiwan latch on to the idea of it being a proxy for the broader growth of the metaverse.  GPU Supply Improving as Proof-of-Stake Shift Continues  By Sam Reynolds  According to analysis by European tech research firm 3D Center, pricing for graphics cards continues to decline as supply improves because of slackening demand from miners preparing to shift towards proof-of-stake protocols.  The report said that while the median price for a graphics card is way above the manufacturer's suggested retail price, it’s trending downwards — a 30% decline since December for median pricing of Nvidia cards and 37% for AMD.  During an earnings conference call with stock analysts on Wednesday, Nvidia said its cryptocurrency Mining Processors (CMP) revenue fell to $24 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, down 77% on quarter.

42421667,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovLZ,1645105800,Bitcoin’s Value Depends on Its Decentralization,"People sometimes ask me for a single reason why I think bitcoin is an attractive investment. It’s simple: Bitcoin is the hardest monetary asset ever created.  By “hardest” I mean “hardest to create more of” – it’s the monetary asset in which I have the highest confidence that the supply is limited. It’s like gold, but better.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it in your inbox every Thursday.  While currently the annual rate of both gold supply and bitcoin supply is roughly 2% of the quantity that has already been mined, bitcoin’s annual rate of production falls by 50% roughly every four years until it falls to zero sometime next century. Therefore, based on the current supply schedule, bitcoin’s annual rate of issuance will be roughly half of gold’s and will continue to fall, making it significantly more scarce than gold.  Gold’s scarcity – and therefore its value – is constrained by its high cost of production. Gold is too expensive to manufacture by nuclear fusion, and it’s also expensive to mine. In contrast, bitcoin’s supply is constrained by its decentralization, which springs both from its original design and its history.  Decentralization is the key  Decentralization isn’t a goal unto itself. Instead, decentralization is key because it makes the Bitcoin network maximally resistant to attack from anyone who might seek to change its monetary policy and thereby threaten its inherent scarcity.  No other cryptocurrency comes close to Bitcoin’s level of decentralization, and it seems unlikely that any ever will.  So what makes bitcoin (BTC) the most decentralized digital asset?  Satoshi is a ghost  The most straightforward way to change an organization is to influence its leader. Bitcoin has no leader. Its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, has managed to remain pseudonymous for well over a decade. And ever since Satoshi ceased communicating with the Bitcoin community, no individual or group has managed to exercise enough influence to make significant changes to Bitcoin’s monetary policy.  No other digital asset can make this claim to having a long track record without influential leadership. There is no leader to coerce, no committee to bribe, and no constituency strong enough to change it.  Running a node is 'easy as (Raspberry) Pi'  One of Bitcoin’s most important decentralizing factors is the ease with which a user can run a node. Such nodes both relay transactions through the network and also verify the entire transaction history. This allows anyone to verify the entire transaction history of Bitcoin and also make sure that future transactions comply with the rules of the protocol, including the fact that no bitcoins are double-spent and that the overall supply is strictly limited. All this can be done with less than $300 worth of computer gear and a low-bandwidth internet connection.  For digital asset networks that support higher numbers of transactions or offer greater feature functionality, higher memory and bandwidth requirements result in lower numbers of nodes that tend to be managed by corporate entities instead of individuals who are invested in the network’s success.  If advances in computation continue as they have in recent years, we may soon live in a world in which people can run Bitcoin nodes on their smartphones. This could drastically increase Bitcoin’s node count, which would further decentralize the network.  Bitcoin mining spreads coins  Bitcoin’s mining process requires expenditures on both equipment and energy. This has caused distribution of bitcoins from miners to individual holders over the years because miners have been forced to sell significant numbers of coins in order to fund their operations. This system contrasts with proof-of-stake systems, which tend to reward small groups of founders with free coins at the beginning and then allow them to maintain their stakes over time and avoid selling coins to fund the energy expenditure required for mining.  While some publicly traded bitcoin miners have managed to raise capital in order to accumulate bitcoins on their balance sheets, this strategy has yet to survive one of Bitcoin’s notoriously brutal “winters,” in which companies reach the end of their funding runways and have to cough up coins in exchange for fiat money. Perhaps this time will be different, but in the meantime it’s probably safe to assume that some miners will eventually have to sell off some of their bitcoins.  Moreover, this distribution of coins from miners to new investors is augmented by the sale of coins by early investors. Just as with companies like Amazon, early investors sell off their holdings over time as the value of those holdings grows, so it is with Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin has already been around for 13 years and reached a total network value approaching $1 trillion suggests that bitcoins have already spread significantly. As bitcoin’s value increases, large holders will likely diversify out of bitcoin as new participants build their positions.  13 years of conflict have proved Bitcoin’s decentralization  When the U.S. Constitution was inked, it was a great idea but it had yet to be tested in the real world. Centuries later, the governance system detailed in the Constitution has so far proven robust to challenges and attacks.  Bitcoin has likewise survived numerous challenges in its 13-year history, culminating in the Block Size Wars. In this struggle, a group of companies with interests in Bitcoin attempted to change the protocol to allow an increased number of transactions per second. A vocal minority of node operators and developers resisted this change, based partly on the risk that increasing the block size would increase the size of the blockchain and therefore make it more difficult to run a node. Such a change could have reduced the number of nodes in the network, thereby reducing its decentralization.  The lesson drawn from this conflict was that Bitcoin would not be changed by an economically powerful group of individuals seeking to impose their will over the objections of the average users of the network. The oligarchs were forced to bow to the will of a group of vocal plebs. And, crucially, this power dynamic proved Bitcoin’s decentralization.  Bottom line  Thanks to its design focused on implementation, lack of identifiable leadership, low barriers to running a node and proven track record of resistance to co-opting, Bitcoin reigns as the world’s most decentralized monetary network. This makes it the monetary asset with the most credible scarcity.  In my view, in a world where fiat money appears to be losing its purchasing power at a high rate, these qualities make Bitcoin the most attractive monetary asset to hold, and the best long-run risk-adjusted investment opportunity available.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING,Andy Edstrom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/17/bitcoins-value-depends-on-its-decentralization,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42421852,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSWj,1645105800,How Much Crypto Should Be in a Portfolio?,"Advisors have been dismissive of crypto ever since bitcoin came on the scene in 2009. And understandably so: Due to regulatory restrictions, advisors can’t simply log on to Kraken, Gemini, or Coinbase and add a small sprinkling of crypto to their clients’ portfolios, some of which they’ve been managing for decades.  “Advisors can’t touch those retail exchanges with a 10-foot pole,” says Ben Cruikshank, the head of Flourish, a crypto platform for registered investment advisors (RIA). “They don’t have something like a big exchange where people can sign up in five minutes and open an account.”  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it in your inbox every Thursday.  Furthermore, the classic “if it isn’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality also keeps advisors from putting their clients’ retirement investments – and their companies’ reputations – on the line.  “Advisors have very successful practices and they’re managing a lot of money,” says Ric Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP). “They’re managing hundreds of millions of dollars, often billions of dollars – and they are doing very well.”  For the most part, investment returns have been favorable, Edelman argues – just look at the performance of the stock market in the last three years, averaging somewhere around 20% a year.  “Why disrupt that?” explains Edelman. “The advisors have a stable, steady practice.”  But then came bitcoin’s epic all-time high of over $68,000 in October and consumers couldn’t ignore their crypto curiosity anymore. However, crypto is unlike any asset class that’s ever existed, which means advisors can’t follow the same old rules.  Historic allocation rules of thumb  Advisors’ notions of proper portfolio management is rooted in modern portfolio theory, says Edelman. This theory was shaped by Nobel Prize-winning philosophies from the likes of economists such as Harry Markowitz, William Sharpe and Eugene Fama. Behavioral finance research says this: If you aren’t going to make a material allocation in your portfolio, you shouldn’t make an allocation at all.  “No financial advisor would ever say to a client, ‘Buy one share of Microsoft,’” Edelman explains. “What’s the point? If you’re not going to make a meaningful allocation, it’s not going to move the needle.”  This way of thinking is part of the reason why common asset allocations include a rough minimum of 10% for a certain type of security. “Advisors routinely tell their clients to put 60% of assets into stocks and 40% into bonds,” Edelman says. “They don’t tell clients to buy 1% of stocks.”  But what about when it comes to crypto?  Crypto allocation recommendations  A 2019 Yale study found that 4% to 6% is an appropriate amount of a portfolio to allocate to crypto. The study included all cryptos, naming bitcoin, XRP and ether specifically. Financial advisors, certified financial planners and other money experts are increasingly beginning to rally around a 1% to 5% asset allocation recommendation for crypto. And interestingly, the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro invested 1% of its treasury reserves in crypto last month, which will make for an important case study on a governmental level.  A 1% allocation, according to Edelman, is something of a magic sweet spot. It’s small enough that a market crash would be almost undetectable while still exposing average investors to potentially double the returns they would see without it. While the amount of institutional investment in crypto seems to be making a total collapse less and less likely, consumers and advisors are understandably still holding their breath. Therefore, Edelman notes, 1% is enough of a contribution to be considered “material.”  Edelman plugged this pattern into a hypothetical scenario involving what he describes as a typical portfolio containing a 60/40 asset mix. Historic data from around the time of bitcoin’s historic 2017 bull run shows a 1,500% rise in bitcoin’s price, followed by a dip of 84%. A portfolio with no bitcoin would see returns of around 7% in one year (estimated conservatively) and, thanks to compound interest, 14.5% in two years. But changing that asset allocation slightly to 59/40/1 – a 1% addition of crypto – the potential gains could jump to 22% in year 1 and 15.4% in year 2 (with the 85% dip), ultimately coming out ahead.  And in the rare event that crypto crashes entirely, the 59/40/1 allocation still results in a 6% return in year 1 and 13.4% in year 2, says Edelman.  “This shows that the allocation can materially improve the return but the downside risk is insignificant,” he says.  Bottom line  While crypto is still a nascent asset class, a growing number of advisors are invested in finding credible information to share with their clients. Financial professionals arguably need to stay knowledgeable about the digital asset ecosystem and remember there’s often better advice to give to a crypto-curious client than to just avoid the asset class altogether.  For clients who are interested in adding a small but material allocation of crypto to their portfolio, advisors can start with just 1%, always thinking about the potential risks compared to the possible rewards. In fact, some argue that 1% is not only a safe place to start but the best allocation for most everyday investors.

42375265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6yWd,1645098219,BofA Says Chainlink Likely Driver for DeFi’s TVL Growth to $203B,"Chainlink could accelerate the adoption of next-generation blockchain use across finance, insurance, supply chain, gaming and gambling, Bank of America said in a research report following a fireside chat with Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov.  The market-leading decentralized oracle network (DON) has seen major adoption. Chainlink is the likely driver behind the growth of decentralized finance’s (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) to $203 billion as of Feb. 15, a gain of 313% year on year, analysts led by Alkesh Shah wrote in the note on Wednesday.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without needing to use traditional middlemen.  The adoption and growth of DeFi last year was driven by the “ability for hybrid smart contracts, or self-executing and tamper-proof digital agreements, to verifiably and securely access real-world data through oracle nodes like market prices, time of day, weather and GPS location,” the report said.  As of Feb. 15, Chainlink oracles secured more than $60 billion deposits into smart contracts, up from $7 billion at the end of 2020, the bank said.  The oracle network generated more than 2.5 million verifiably random numbers for non-fungible token (NFT) distribution and gaming, up from almost zero at the end of 2020, the report said.  NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items, and can be sold or traded. “Oracles also enable the next generation of blockchain use cases, which require real-world data and could disrupt mature industries,” the bank’s analysts said.  Bank of America noted that over 1,100 projects leverage Chainlink’s network, and companies including the Associated Press, AccuWeather, Sportmonks and 800 others have launched oracle nodes to monetize their data.  LINK, the network’s native token, is the 22nd largest crypto by market value at $8.1 billion, the report said.

He stressed that his departure is not absolute or instantaneous. ""I'd emphasize this is a change of role, and there's a transition period. I'm not suddenly gone"" he said in a LinkedIn message to CoinDesk.  Nicoll said he is stepping away ""primarily [because] the stress involved is overwhelming.""  ""There is a further complication that my employer for my day job is moving into the blockchain space, leading to a risk of conflict of interest if I remain as a director,"" he added. Nicoll is a software engineer at Google.  The Dogecoin Foundation, which also boasts Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as an adviser, was re-established in August, having initially been set up in 2014 before being dissolved as it became inactive over time. The foundation's aim is to support dogecoin's development through advocacy, governance and trademark protection.  ""I have confidence in their ability to steer Dogecoin into the next phase, in a way that I do not have the mindset for,"" Nicoll said.

In addition to taking control of the $3.6 critical mark, sellers also reversed the global growth trend of December 2020. In mid-January 2022, sellers broke the $3.6 mark with a powerful weekly candle and still keep it under control. Attempts by buyers to regain control of the CRV market have so far been quite unsuccessful. Trading volumes on the weekly timeframe continue to fall and indicate the beginning of a global correction in the CRV market. Buyers are more likely to be able to test the $3.6 range several times in the global timeframe. However, this will only worsen their situation and clearly show the weakness of buyers. Therefore, investing in CRV cryptocurrency at current prices is quite dangerous, as there is a high probability that the price will fall to $1.94. This is the first serious liquidity zone from which a new growth wave can begin. Though, even if the $3.6 range is taken under control, the trend of buyers will not be restored. It will become weaker and after the local growth wave with the target of $6, the global correction will still begin.

In addition to regularly choosing coins to be added, the trading platform will allow project creators to apply for their tokens to be listed, Bitpanda said in a statement Thursday.  “Crypto investors know that being early is critical to success, that’s why we decided to list new batches of cryptocurrencies on a weekly basis, such that our community is able to access cutting-edge crypto assets with a tap, straight from their Bitpanda account,” CEO Eric Demuth said in the press release.  Bitpanda currently offers its more than 3 million users access to 1,000 digital assets. Since it was founded in 2014, the exchange has expanded beyond crypto to offer trading in stocks, precious metals and exchange-traded funds (ETF) through a mobile app.  Before new cryptocurrency and token projects are listed, they will be vetted and go through a due diligence process handled by Bitpanda’s asset listing committee.  The requirements for new cryptocurrency projects include reviewing the market cap and stability.  Bitpanda became Austria’s first unicorn startup after closing a series B funding round at $170 million in March last year.  In December, it launched its first exchange-traded cryptocurrency note (ETC) which tracks the price of bitcoin and is traded in euros.

42421212,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrdN,1645063154,How Brands Can Co-Create in a Metaverse,"What is the metaverse exactly and how should brands think about adapting to it?  We asked Wan Wei, head of Ecosystem at Multiverse Labs, a decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem based in Singapore that supports early-stage technology companies. She will appear at Crypto State by CoinDesk, our virtual community event tour, when it stops in Southeast Asia on Feb. 24. The discussion will explore the metaverse and its implications. The tour is in partnership with Luno, like CoinDesk owned by Digital Currency Group. Register for ""Metaverse: Gimmick or Distributed Innovation?"" here.  CoinDesk: I’m a Martian who has just landed on Planet Earth. Tell me what the metaverse is in three sentences.  Wan Wei: Hi, Martian. The metaverse can be conceptualized as the next iteration of today’s mobile internet. It revolutionizes how we interact with one another, promotes entrepreneurship among communities and allows us to build truly inclusive societies and industries. The open metaverse, powered by Web 3, is immersive (identifiable as a new, real or imagined world), interactive (you can interact with the metaverse and communicate with avatars) and social (your friends are there).  What’s the most important thing you do at Multiverse Labs?  I am in charge of nurturing the Multiverse ecosystem to ensure that loyal supporters and stakeholders are engaged and excited about what we are co-creating. My role is cross-functional and independent of whether our stakeholders identify themselves as “tech-savvy” or not.  We work with large real estate companies, fashion houses, record labels, gaming studios and NGOs to serve global communities. I’m personally excited about some of the future DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) we will be building that serve our growing communities.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  How will metaverse environments redefine how we use the internet?  Let me use what Multiverse is building as one example to illustrate how metaverse environments can help us build a better internet.  Ownership: In a decentralized ecosystem and environment like the Multiverse, you own your own data. This is disruptive because it is completely different from centralized platforms where corporations own and monetize user data. With control over how public or personal data is stored, we will be able to collectively move towards a fairer internet. The public can choose whether to be compensated or not when someone else asks for permission to use their data.  AI In The Metaverse: Experimentation in the metaverse is advanced and upgraded through partnerships with virtual humans powered by AI in the Multiverse metaverse.  Inclusivity: With a tokenization monetary model, any person can be a shareholder, investor, or create their own personal economy. We can expect to see more “digital-native” organizations that exist solely on the internet in the near future.  What will be the most important applications within the metaverse? Gaming? Art? Finance? Porn?  I think the most important applications within the metaverse are found in gaming and fashion.  You see, the immersive, interactive and social aspects of the metaverse are already present in many mobile games today. If we conceptualize the metaverse as the next iteration of today’s mobile internet (in-game format), then inevitably P2E [play to earn] and GameFi are huge applications within said metaverse.  The key difference between a game and a metaverse is then the extent of real-world economic value that games can bring. For example, can I put food on the table and pay for medical expenses by playing a game?  The fact of the matter is that with games like Axie Infinity, people can support themselves financially. As of Aug. 9, 2021, Axie Infinity recorded 800,000 average daily users, with its daily trading volume surpassing $33 million. GameFi is fascinating because it's an elegant intersection between gaming and [decentralized finance] and should be commended for the role it plays in the future of all of our working habits.  According to Morgan Stanley, demand for digital fashion and luxury goods is expected to reach $50 billion by 2030. Furthermore, the immersive, interactive and social aspects of the metaverse are already present in many trending fashion circles today, with or without any particular metaverse. In the luxury fashion spaces, [non-fungible tokens] solve authentication issues that are apparent in tangible luxury products. This helps to protect brand identity and future revenue streams for the fashion industry as a whole.  The fashion sector is incredibly social, and over the past decade a movement has shifted the paradigm towards a hybrid retail model that fully incorporates digital fashion. The metaverse unveils a new possibility in the fashion industry because runway collections can now defy physical reality. Want to buy virtual wings that allow your pet BabyKong to fly in Decentraland? Want to have a fashion show underwater, and an extravagant digital couture gown that flows gracefully under the sea? The possibilities are endless.  Should we worry about single companies dominating the metaverse just like certain corporations dominate the internet today?  That is a very good question!  When it comes to open and closed metaverse, the power of open source far outweighs the risk of corporate domination.  One of my favorite Web 3 thought leaders, Naval, says that open source can be defined by a problem that only has to be solved once. Big tech companies can and will definitely try to dominate the metaverse, and in my opinion they will fail. I am of the view that open and closed metaverses will peacefully coexist, with a likely 20-80 [percent] market dominance ratio in the next 10 years. This is because digital assets can be made interoperable across blockchains and provide a wealth of benefits to open the metaverse.  Companies that involve themselves in the open metaverse from early on are also likely to attempt domination. I do think there is a risk that one or two public blockchain protocols might hold a larger than proportionate market share in the open metaverse world.  However, if their code is open source, I don’t see this temporary dominance as a problem either. This is because users who suffer major issues with any protocol have access to competent coders who can quickly create inventive solutions. The protocols or projects “on the top” have to actively work alongside users and failing to do so will result in a quick loss of market share.
