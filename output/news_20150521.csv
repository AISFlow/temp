42378187,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdTx,1432237824,Consensus 2015: Digital Gold and Wences Casares in the Spotlight,"Two Consensus 2015 speakers, Nathaniel Popper and Wences Casares, are in the spotlight this week, mainly because of Popper's new book. We're also announcing the addition of Hernán Botbol, a co-founder of the hugely popular Argentinian social network, Taringa!  Digital Gold, the book that takes a long, unflinching look at the individuals behind the rise of bitcoin, hit the shelves this week.  We published an extract from Digital Gold detailing the inner workings of Charlie Shrem's BitInstant, which was a high-flying bitcoin startup with funding from the Winklevoss twins – until it all came crashing down.  Shrem was nabbed by federal agents in a New York airport on money laundering and other charges; he is now serving a two-year sentence in a federal prison.  Digital Gold's author, Nathaniel Popper, normally covers Wall Street for the New York Times. He's fresh off launching his book at the New York Public Library with a panel discussion with Union Square Ventures' Fred Wilson, the Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin and bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen.  'Patient zero' for bitcoin  Another protagonist in Popper's book is Wences Casares, the founder of bitcoin storage and wallet firm Xapo.  The book reveals Casares' pivotal role in getting a swathe of Silicon Valley and Wall Street's elite hooked on the cryptocurrency. Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and investor in Blockstream, has called Casares ""patient zero"" for bitcoin in the Valley.  Digital Gold contains accounts of Casares demonstrating how bitcoin works at high-powered gatherings organised by the investment bank Allen and Co.  At one such retreat in Tucson, Arizona, Popper tells us that Casares sent $250,000 in bitcoin to Business Insider founder Henry Blodget after setting the publisher up with a brand new bitcoin wallet of his own. The coins eventually found their way back to Casares, after being passed around the high net-worth crowd who marvelled at the speed of the transfers.  Casares isn't content to stop at introducing bitcoin to the rich and powerful. Part of Casares' plan to take bitcoin mainstream is a partnership with Taringa!, a social network that Wired has described as ""the Reddit of Argentina"" – a useful way of thinking about a service that boasts 75 million monthly unique users.  Bitcoin for content micropayments  Taringa! users currently assemble all sorts of content to be shared on the network, from home recipes to Lionel Messi listicles. The network sells ads against this content.  The Xapo tie-up will let Taringa! split the ad revenue with its users, paying the funds out in bitcoin. The network's co-founder, Hernán Botbol, says bitcoin payments are important because more than half of Latin America's online users don't have a bank account or credit card, making it difficult to send payments to users for their share of ad revenue.  The micropayments programme is currently invite-only, with plans to expand it to more Taringa users. But Botbol and Casares will have a unique data-set around bitcoin micropayments for content by September, when they will discuss their findings at CoinDesk's inaugural conference – Consensus 2015.

42378188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdVD,1432231308,North Carolina House Seeks Oversight of Bitcoin Activities,"A bill calling for specific regulation of digital currencies such as bitcoin has been approved by the North Carolina House of Representatives and has moved to the state Senate for further deliberation.  House Bill 289  seeks to enact a new Money Transmitters Act (MTA), which would specifically address the transmission of virtual currencies such as bitcoin.  It was submitted by Republican Representative Stephen M. Ross, who outside of his capacity as a state representative serves as a vice president and investment officer at Wells Fargo. He filed the bill on behalf of the North Carolina's Commissioner of Banks (NCOOB).  Rep. Ross was unavaialble for comment. When asked about the bill, a spokesperson for NCCOB told CoinDesk:  ""Like existing law, the bill requires bitcoin transmitters to obtain a license from our office. The Bill, however, clarifies that only virtual currency transmission involving a personal, family or household purpose (as opposed to business-oriented transmission) is subject to the Money Transmitters Act. It also defines virtual currency consistently with federal financial regulation.""  The existing MTA, enacted in 2001, already regulates non-bank companies that engage in the business of transmitting funds on behalf of others in a bid to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.  According to a summary redacted by North Carolina's General Assembly (NCGA), House Bill 289 would replace the current statutory article with a new one, incorporating much of the existing law and shed additional clarity on specific features requested by the NCOOB.  ""These [virtual currency] payment systems are currently subject to the act, but industry has requested clarification of the law to take into account the changes that have occurred since the law was written,"" the summary states.  It goes on to explain:  ""It would exclude certain business-to-business money transmission activity. It would revise the cost structure by replacing the examination fee and the annual renewal fee with an annual assessment based on North Carolina transmission volume. It would convert the annual license into a perpetual license.""  One vote against  The Bill was approved by the House of Representatives on 12th May, with 117 votes in favour and one against.  Representative Mark Brody was the sole legislator to vote against the Bill. Speaking to CoinDesk, Brody outlined why he thought that regulating alternative currencies such as bitcoin would not be a good idea.  Brody said that he had been badly affected by the 2008 market crash, which in turn, made him understand the fragile nature of the economy. In interview, he attributed that weakness to existing federal policies.  He explained:  ""The federal government is a political animal and it will hurt the currency for political reasons [...] and I oppose the regulation of alternative currencies because [...] they may be the only stability that we have, that is why I voted against the regulation of these alternative currencies.""  Brody went on to suggest that he might seek to have that language removed at a later juncture, either through an amended bill or by way of an entirely separate bill.  Growing legislative interest    The bill's passage through the North Carolina House of Representatives comes amid growing activity among state legislators in the US in regards to digital currency.      State agencies are also looking at the issue closely, most notably in the case of the New York State Department of Financial Services' BitLicense proposal, which is expected to be released in its final form sometime in the next week.    When asked about the timing of the bill submission, a spokesperson for the NCCOB told CoinDesk that the effort began following FinCEN's 2014 guidance for money service businesses.  The spokesperson explained:  ""In 2014, we began receiving applications for virtual currency licensure under the Money Transmitters Act. At that time, we realised that while virtual currency transmission was subject to the existing MTA, that version of the law left many issues unresolved.""  The spokesperson went on to say that the agency initially began to approach digital currency oversight through rule-making, but ultimately opted to pursue a legislative route.  ""Throughout 2014, we held multiple stakeholder meetings, both before and after the bill was drafted,"" the spokesperson added. ""After incorporating as much stakeholder input as possible, we felt that the bill was ready for introduction in 2015.""  Community debate  As one might imagine, a legislative effort that is perceived to impose additional burdens on companies working in the digital currency sector drew criticism from some quarters of the bitcoin community.  The bill has been labelled an ""Anti-Bitcoin Act"" by BitcoinRegs.org, a self-supporting group of North Carolina-based bitcoin advocates, which said in a statement:  ""House Bill 289 is wrong for the economy of the state of North Carolina, and if passed in other states, would harm the bitcoin ecosystem at large.""  Other startups in the bitcoin space have voiced support for the measure. San-Francisco based Coinbase weighed in to debate via a blog post, which acknowledged:  ""As a nascent technology, regulation surrounding bitcoin has been a difficult issue for some regulators and policymakers. Despite these difficulties, North Carolina is a state that is promoting innovation and regulatory efficiency into its regulatory framework via the next generation of its Money Transmitters Act (MTA).""

42378171,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdDb,1432227754,Bitcoin Firm Coinapult Opens to US Market,"Bitcoin payment processor and storage provider Coinapult is now seeking customers in the US market following a services integration with Crypto Capital.  The bitcoin firm did previously offer its bitcoin wallet service to US customers but said that the country's users were blocked from its website in July last year as the company was not a licensed money transmitter.  By opening an account with Crypto Capital, a licensed money transmitter in Panama, Coinapult will now allow its users to deposit, withdraw and transfer fiat currency.  A Coinapult spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""Coinapult is not a licensed money transmitter business, and as such, we did not offer our services to the US market. Now that Crypto Capital will act as a money transmitter on Coinapult's behalf, we are excited to reopen services to the US.""  ""From both a legal and financial perspective, any fiat movement between Coinapult and our customers will be handled through Crypto Capital functioning as a licensed money transmitter on behalf of Coinapult,"" the spokesperson continued.  According to Crypto Capital's website, customers are provided a ""segregated fiat account"" to US users. Clients that offer software products to bitcoin users, the company states, are then able to move fiat currency in and out of these accounts.  Crypto Capital will perform know your customer (KYC) checks on behalf of Coinapult.  Hot wallet attack  Coinapult's most well-known product is a service called LOCKS, which allows users to peg the price of bitcoin to gold, silver, British pounds, US dollars and euros.  The company's wallet service was hacked in March this year, resulting in a loss of 150 BTC (approximately $42,900).  The Panama-based startup restored its services the following month. The spokesperson said that the company was hoping to introduce client-side multisig functionality by the end of July.

42378189,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdWT,1432201116,Seagate: Ripple Funding Shows We're Serious About Blockchain Tech,"A desire to become an ""active participant"" in the blockchain technology space is what drove $13bn data storage company Seagate to invest in Ripple Labs, according to its senior vice president Dave Morton.  A leading maker of hard drives for desktop PC and laptops as well as servers and data centers, about half of Seagate's current value, according to Forbes, is due to its successful transition to enterprise cloud products.  However, in an interview with CoinDesk Morton revealed the logistics of moving and shipping these products are currently outdated when compared to the company's more modern product offerings.  He said:  ""Our supply chain is very broad. There's over 286 components that go into each of our drives, we pull over 51 elements out of Mother Earth and obviously we manufacture in a lot of foreign locations where there's a lot of exchange risk.""  The difficulty of managing this development process is what makes the ""Internet of Value"" made possible by Ripple Labs appealing, he added.  Founded in 2012, distributed payment network provider Ripple Labs uses the Ripple protocol and its own native digital currency (XRP) as a way to move money internationally. The company recently came under fire for wrongdoings in its early days, paying part of a $700,000 fine for FinCEN violations.  Today, Morton doesn't believe that Ripple's technology is ready for Seagate to use, but he argued that due to this enormous potential, his company was eager to participate in its $28m Series A fundraising announced this week.  ""To be able to move our operational cash globally in a free way that is transparent is very important to us,"" he said.  The round included a notable cross-section of Asian and US investors, including IDG Capital, China Rock Capital and AME Cloud Ventures. Seagate funded only one companyhttps://www.crunchbase.com/organization/seagate-technology, Reduxio, in 2014 and Ripple is its first investment in 2015.  Blockchain use cases  Seagate's business model would seem to lend itself to two popular use cases for blockchain technology: the ability to move payments and the ability to track the positioning of supply chains, as seen in California-based startup Skuchain.  Morton sees Ripple's platform as one that would let Seagate keep an eye on the development of both use cases, maintaining both are ""very interesting"".  ""We have 3 million components a day in flight, so you can just imagine the power that this can possibly have down the road from a supply chain perspective, whether that be cash flow or economics,"" he said, adding:  ""We process over hundreds of thousands of invoices a quarter, you get into the process of how this improves the supply chain, it's pretty remarkable.""  When asked why Seagate wouldn't yet seek to use the technology, Morton suggested that the murky legal status of blockchain technology around the globe was a deterrent.  ""Obviously we would like to be a key user. We'll work with the proper authorities and companies and our own providers, our banks,"" he remarked.  Ripple and bitcoin  Morton also touched on why, in his opinion, the ""agnostic"" nature of Ripple has a competitive advantage over the bitcoin network.  ""You can do commodities, dollars, yen, euros versus it being just bitcoin. We want to take more of a holistic approach,"" he said, adding that he remains a fan of bitcoin.  In this light, Morton said Seagate remains primarily interested in seeing whether blockchain technologies can help solve real problems for its business, whether that solution comes from a provider like Ripple Labs or an alternative.  ""Reduction of friction, this is the immediate need within our space,"" he explained. ""As we get more and more global, this is going to be something that folks are very interested in solving.""  Morton concluded:  ""We're serious about some of these use cases being thought about and resolved. We think there are some technology and business gains to be had.""
