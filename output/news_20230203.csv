The Bitcoin narrative could change over the course of 2023, as negativity seems heavily priced in and emerging tech could offer relief to negativity. The Bitcoin bottom seems likely in 2023 prior to the eventual block halving of Bitcoin in April of 2024. We value Bitcoin at $25,000 while leveraging three variables, number of wallets, expected value contribution of each wallet, and the amount of Bitcoin in circulation. We think investors can anticipate Bitcoin to reach $33K by beginning of next year, implying 50%+ returns from current levels. We like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) at $23,000 or in the low $20,000s range and would start to accumulate from these levels despite the widespread negativity in the cryptocurrency market. We also want to buy Bitcoin on any major drop below the $20,000 level too, as we don’t really believe in timing the Bitcoin market, but we do like studying the long-term fundamentals and find the oversold nature of the coin a great spot to buy from, as opposed to making short-term trades. We just don’t think we can bottom fish all that effectively, and while we don’t allocate a substantial sum to Bitcoin, we do allocate something to Bitcoin at all times. Perhaps adjusting weightings and making some additions or subtractions over the course of years as opposed to trading the daily charts or making short-term decisions on short-term price swings. Right out the gate, we’re going to disclose that we’re Bitcoin permanent bulls, and believe in the underlying merits of the coin as a value storage. As is the case with our analysis, we like to dig deep, and in this particular case we’re going to do a deep dive on what could be major price drivers to Bitcoin in 2023 and our thesis on Bitcoin over the next 12 months and why we value it at $33,000 by beginning of 2024. We think long-term investors would appreciate our presentation as we feel conviction in always maintaining a long position on Bitcoin regardless of price, but we let pricing dictate how much BTC we hold onto. 2023 a bottom in sight? One of the indicators we like to watch when determining the strength or weakness of demand in the BTC market is Bitcoin dominance. We believe that the market is mostly formed around Bitcoin investors. Upon realizing the value of Bitcoin, traders, speculators, and entrepreneurs go off to derivative assets and tokens, and collectively experience more volatility in relation to Bitcoin in those other markets thus causing the proverbial news cycle of scandal, fraud busts, etc. By following these trends closely we arrive at the conclusion that we’re near a Bitcoin cycle bottom, and while we’re near the bottom it’s not indicative of the exact timing for loading up on positions in order to generate returns from the intra day or weekly charts. Instead, we view the drop in Bitcoin dominance to a similar range low 40% to high 30% range indicative of 2018 where speculators got so exhausted by selling out of alternative coins that they started pulling out of the alts and started flooding back into Bitcoin. As the market started bottoming towards the beginning of 2019, Bitcoin dominance started to surge again, and went back to the 50%-70% dominance level as the market started to peak on November 21st, 2021 at a price of $65,000 or so at the peak. Basically, we’re at the point where the oxygen is starting to get so thin in the alt coin market, we’re expecting the proverbial flood back into Bitcoin and so as a consequence the market for cryptocurrencies improves on a directional shift back into the value storage coin. During a Bitcoin cycle bust, GPU hardware gets flooded back onto the market, and the main reason miners dump the semiconductors is because of over-production of coins, and instead they’d rather sell the hardware and buy the BTC at a discount, which is why the GPU makers are going through the per-usual secondary market flood of GPU boards causing the price of tapped out silicon to drop at this point in the cycle. Bitcoin turned the semiconductor market into an exhaustible commodity, so when Bitcoin network demand for hardware drops, so does the computer hardware market. So, we’re starting to see signs of stress across semiconductor names, which is also indicative of cycle bottom in Bitcoin, because if the hardware starts to improve, it’s because the miners noting a sudden price reversion in Bitcoin will inevitably buy-up global semiconductor chip supply again. Figure 1. Bitcoin at the low of the Bitcoin dominance cycle Coinmarketcap Bitcoin Dominance Chart (Coinmarketcap) So, Bitcoin dominance isn’t always a be all, end all indicator, but for the most part we find ourselves at a point in the cycle, where there’s demand distributed among a bunch of alt coins and Bitcoin interest among the coins is near the 2018 lows on the charts, which is indicative of one of two things: there’s a bit lower to go below the 35%-40% threshold or we have already found bottom. Eventually prices will trend back up anyways, which is why we think now isn’t the time to distribute, or reduce weightings, now is the time to add to your weightings and add to your holdings long-term. Reasons for Bitcoin bottoming out in 2023 and rallying eventually: We think market participants disperse into even more speculative coins at the bottom of a Bitcoin market cycle in order to earn returns back from the eventual bottoming. Cryptocurrency algorithms are particularly effective at trading mass sentiment, and can move Bitcoin into alternative tokens and vice versa very quickly. We think traders and algorithms are making the last set of trades before gearing up for the bottoming. The closer traders get to a BTC bottom the more likely they are to also buy cheaper or more speculative coins in an effort to make back losses from the bear market. Bitcoin is the primary asset to watch if you’re expecting some recovery in crypto asset prices with Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) mostly mirroring the directional move of Bitcoin. If you’re hoping for a bottom in the cryptocurrency market the Bitcoin market has to bottom in order for the rest of the market to recover. Coming out of the Bitcoin market bottoming, speculators will take note of various other data points to support their thesis. Macroeconomics and on-going inflation creates a bias for Bitcoin to move higher on higher interest rates. Inevitably more fiat currency in relation to Bitcoin will revert to the same trends that have dictated the price of Bitcoin trending higher. Bitcoin supply growth is much slower than fiat supply growth, and with so many sources of demand for Bitcoin, and the continued growth of the Bitcoin network, we anticipate that the underlying thesis of adoption continues. Decentralized networks, decentralized autonomous organizations (also known as DAO), and the lack of a central figure opens the opportunity for other established technology players to enter the space and drive further adoption. We often forget that in the middle of a bear market there’s somebody accumulating Bitcoin in a bid to get rich off the next Bitcoin rally, and in so doing leverage whatever inherent advantages they carry into the Bitcoin ecosystem, which further supports the adoption thesis. Bad news on Bitcoin has gotten a bit stale, and while nobody’s announcing from the rooftops to buy Bitcoin we propose a Bitcoin price target based on the long-term historical trend of adoption and pricing, and anticipate that some value can be derived from total network activity to arrive at a fair value comparison from prior-years. In other words, the volatility of Bitcoin certainly diminishes the appeal of the coin when prices are dropping, but when the inverse cycle starts to take effect, the news cannot stop emphasizing how many new Bitcoin millionaires there are. Bitcoin price prediction our black box We spent a lot of time coming to this point, or coming up with a way to value Bitcoin, and thus we have theorized a rational way or framework for valuing Bitcoin on a predictable basis. Bitcoin Price forecast summary: Bitcoin price target of $24,731 for 2023. Bitcoin price target of $44,063 for 2025. Bitcoin price target of 112,164 for 2030. Now, keep in mind that we use data that marks the end of the year, so the pricing trends generally do not capture the peaks of each year but rather the overall trend in data, so we can derive a fair value estimate. The further the price of Bitcoin gets from our fair value estimate the more undervalued we are, and the more conviction we have that we are buying Bitcoin at a steep discount. Also, the inputs to our model will change each year based on the data on users, amount of contribution value of each user, which will necessitate us to update our model with new data each year to arrive at a fair value estimate. Figure 2. Bitcoin Pricing Model 2013-2022 Data Series Trade Theory Bitcoin Pricing Model (Trade Theory) Figure 3. Bitcoin Pricing Model 2023-2025 using data from 2013-2022 Trade Theory Bitcoin Pricing Model (Trade Theory) So, when we value Bitcoin, we found that the number of Bitcoin wallets tends to trend higher over time based on the values we’re working with. Of course, we abbreviate some of the years, but when measuring the value of Bitcoin we work from 2013 all the way to 2022 using real data or a 10-year data set to arrive at an expected value calculation. Meaning that our data starts to get more reliable at this point. Most people want to wait until an Index fund has 10 years of return history before buying one, and with Bitcoin having about 10 years of reliable or useful data that’s meaningful for our time series we feel confident that our forecast method will render some predictable value over time. The value of wallets tends to increase on the blockchain ledger by an average amount of 9.345 million per year. We anticipate that over time each wallet contributes a certain amount of value to the total market value of Bitcoin and this contribution of value tends to go in cycles based on the expanded data series. So, with these two variables fixed and set to grow over a set value over time we derive our price estimate based on the third factor that’s also expected to be predictable, which is the expected supply of bitcoin on the network. We define those three values as being constants and contributing to our model assumptions over time, and so we arrive at our 2023 Bitcoin price estimate of $24,000 and 2025 price estimate of $44,000. But, how do we get to a $44,000 Bitcoin price target by 2025? Figure 4. Bitcoin Price Forecast 2023 to 2025 Trade Theory Bitcoin Price Forecast (Trade Theory) Well, we know that there’s a defined supply of bitcoin based on the bitcoin hash rate, logarithmic function, it’s going to increase at a slower rate over time, and yet the amount of value per bitcoin wallet is set to increase over time. This is the growth function of average value per user, or average amount of value attributed to each contributing wallet to the Bitcoin blockchain at this point in time. So, this value tends to fluctuate based on the data, but we try to simplify the observation by using the end-point of the year, which provides added upside to our estimate. However, to explain how this model works, we basically multiply the average contribution value of each wallet, and multiply this by the amount of wallets to define the total market cap of bitcoin. We then divide by the total coin in circulation to arrive at an exact value per Bitcoin. The value of the Bitcoin network seems to grow at a set function over the past 10 years and the number of wallets seems to grow at a constant rate over time (which drives our adoption thesis). We then find the expected market cap per year, and divide by the expected coin in circulation based on the expected number of coins based on the block nonce rate . 1) We know that the expected value of total coins in circulation will be 19.24 million 2023 versus 19.85 million in 2025, we know that the average contribution value per wallet is growing at an average rate of $1,331 per year, and also expected growth of new users on the Bitcoin network will be 9.345 million new users/wallets per year, so we derive a fair value estimate based on the number of variables we’re willing to measure. 2) The amount of new users there will be, the average value contribution of each additional user, and work backward to multiply the amount of users by the average value contribution to arrive at a projected market capitalization. Basically if each user contributes x value to market cap, then the total user base when multiplied by average value contribution = Bitcoin market cap. We then divide the future market capitalization by the absolute number of coins based on the block rate, or number of coins available in the given year to arrive at an exact price per Bitcoin. 3) To make the model work, you will need to adjust key inputs, like the average growth in wallets, the average value of each wallet (which fluctuates), and the amount of coins in a given year. We think these values yield a more predictable value, but the science of studying pricing trends in Bitcoin is quite limited and not as established like stocks. This method could be used to value other cryptocurrency assets aside from Bitcoin, which we hope to illustrate in the future. Figure 5. Bitcoin Price Forecast 2020s to 2030s Trade Theory Bitcoin 10-Year Forecast (Trade Theory) The number of wallets could shrink or increase drastically at any given moment but when measured over a longer data set the value seems to be fairly consistent and growing. However, that variable alone might not affect the total value of coins, so we capture that assumption as well by averaging the amount of market cap per wallet, which is the average value contribution to market value per wallet user. By integrating these factors into our model we arrive at an estimate of $112,000 by 2030 and perhaps a high of $150,000 by 2030 assuming 30% variance, which is reasonable given BTC volatility. Figure 6. 10-Year Bitcoin Price Model Bitcoin 10 Year Forecast (Trade Theory) Basically, we think we capture the main factors that drive the price of bitcoin, which is 1) the number of users, 2) the average contribution value per user, 3) the delta in added value per users, 4) the delta in the number of additional users 5) also the amount of coins that are expected to be in circulation. We use the end-point of the year somewhere between December 28, and January 1st of each year to define the values of our model and to eliminate statistically wide ranges of numbers. It’s why our model might only capture 3/4th of the move for the particular year, implying that there could be an incremental 30% upside to our 2024 forecast, which is captured in the error bar, implying Bitcoin trades between a range of $30k to $45k if you're optimistic, and perhaps $25k to $35k if you're bearish. Bitcoin is our top blue chip commodity idea for 2023 We think it’s buying season for Bitcoin investors, and we hope people leverage our assumptions and methods in their own excel models to derive their own values on Bitcoin. In the end, Bitcoin is an open source community, and Seeking Alpha is an open community of contributors who contribute to the collective knowledge and understanding of investing. We hope that investors can find some comfort in knowing that there’s some quantifiable approach that’s somewhat approachable and at an accountant's level of reasoning to derive a fair value estimate. We think analysts and investors can feel more confident when buying Bitcoin at this point in the cycle when investing into the Bitcoin market. It’s why we encourage investors to continue to follow the market closely, and understand that while we may define a certain price point, it’s likely that given the historical volatility of Bitcoin, that pricing can deviate due to any number of factors, both good and bad. Meaning that if we find a statistically significant observation point, it’s likely that pricing will simply pass through our long-term trend line, and it’s unlikely that it would define a specific resistance or support level for that matter. We think the inputs to our pricing model are quantifiable factors impacting the pricing of Bitcoin, and are direct inputs into the value of Bitcoin, and will inevitably drive the value of Bitcoin higher on the assumption that hashing rates remain constant, and the network is still operating at the future date of our projection. We recommend Bitcoin to our readers; we don't think it's wise nor is it possible for investors to buy the bottom. We think investors can anticipate Bitcoin to reach $33K by beginning of next year implying 50%+ returns, which is phenomenal returns and beats the abundance of alternatives like index funds or large equity funds.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4575246-rational-method-for-pricing-bitcoin-2023-and-beyond?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8764279.jpeg

Emergent Fidelity was the company which held 56 million shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD) stock, an asset that quickly became a subject of key interest among several companies for the value it could bring FTX creditors. The shares were also pledged as collateral to bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi, which placed its own claim last year.  Bankman-Fried has argued he should retain control of the shares. Nevertheless, federal officials moved to seize control of the assets in January.  Those 56 million shares of Robinhood are worth more than $600 million at today's closing price. Bloomberg reported the only other asset owned by Emergent Fidelity was $20.7 million in cash.

Unfortunately, for bears, it likely didn't start until COIN was in the $50s rather than when it was in the $30s. This massive rally over the last few sessions could get worse for shorts in the coming days/weeks. Still, caution is warranted for bulls after a 46% rally in just two sessions. About a month ago I covered Coinbase ( COIN ) stock for the first time. The core thesis of that note was COIN's short interest, an imminent death that had been greatly exaggerated given the cash on the balance sheet, and the possibility of regulatory tailwinds. The latter coming to fruition far down the line if government actors try to push consumers toward regulated exchanges rather than things like Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) or other DEX platforms that DeFi users would likely advocate more for. It has been only a few short weeks since that article was published and we already have a COIN price that has rallied 150%. Is the worst over or should bears get ready for more pain? Revisiting the Squeeze Thesis In the spirit of Groundhog Day, let's look at all the same charts again. Just one month later, we have a share price that has nearly tripled and a short position that is actually larger than it was when I wrote the January article. Data by YCharts At the time, the short interest was 17% of the shares outstanding. As of January 13th, the figure is now over 19% as the short position was just under 44 million shares following the last update. We won't know for another week what the short position was at the end of January. But we do know that the bears had not even started covering yet as of mid-January when the share price closed a few pennies below $50. Additionally, the shares available to sell are still well below November levels according to iBorrowDesk: COIN Shares Available (iBorrowDesk) Here we can see a small bump in shares available for selling but there hasn't been a sustained move higher in that figure. Judging from this, I don't think long term bulls who are underwater have thrown in the towel yet on this rip and I think that explains why we've been seeing explosive intraday moves in COIN shares like we saw Thursday, Wednesday, and on January 27th. Coinbase Bonds (Business Insider) Even the corporate bonds have moved higher in the last month having rallied from under $50 in late December to just under $59 today - though they are still trading at a sizeable 41% discount to the issue price. Flashing Overbought We have a COIN share price that just closed Thursday over $81 and a broad market that has been looking for any reason to justify buying equities. With FOMC in the rearview mirror, the Nasdaq has broken out of resistance that goes back all the way to Q4-21 and has held multiple back-tests of the 200 day moving average: Nasdaq Daily Chart (TradingView) From where I sit, the market had been waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's FOMC commentary Wednesday and he didn't say anything that scared bulls enough to pump the brakes on FOMO buying stocks. It is important to note that the Nasdaq is now up almost 7% since Powell started talking on Wednesday. The market is extremely overbought on this rally. As is Coinbase having now rallied 45% in just two days: COIN Daily Chart (TradingView) Coinbase's 14 day RSI is over 77. This is the most overbought COIN shares have been since October 2021. Of course, things don't go up in a straight line and the stock probably needs to back-test some resistance levels before it tries for another high. I would imagine there are a lot of traders who have piled into this stock on the momentum shift and some of them may be looking to take some profit after such a strong move. But until the stock closes under the 200 day moving average decisively, I don't think the pain is over yet for the short side. Summary Risk markets are getting very extended short term and the tech stocks that have been hit really hard over the last year or so have been noticeably outperforming year to date. For COIN bulls specifically, it's important to remember that Coinbase is still a company that has some fundamental problems. Exchange Volumes (CoinGecko) Even on this big move up in crypto prices over the last several days, Coinbase exchange volume is somewhat flat and very much lagging competitors like Binance ( BNB-USD ). While I do still maintain that it would be bullish, my regulatory tailwind speculation likely won't play out for some time if it ever even does. Until then, Coinbase is probably a better trade than investment in my opinion. But the squeeze thesis doesn't seem stale to me yet. While I have already personally sold my COIN long, I do have open buy orders much lower than Thursday's close and would ride this one again should those orders fill prior to another leg up. As of mid-January the squeeze hadn't even started yet. I doubt it's over already. But after such a massive rally over the last two days, buying at $85 Thursday was FOMO. I view it as a hold until there is a reasonable dip.",NEUTRAL,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4575225-coinbase-are-the-bears-dead-yet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8760586.jpeg

42435055,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoaUA,1675462159,Decentralized Lending Protocol Centrifuge Accrues $6M Unpaid Debt,"Some $5.8 million of loans in two lending pools are overdue on the decentralized lending protocol Centrifuge, according to data by blockchain credit analytics platform rwa.xyz.  The distressed debt includes consumer loans and invoice and trade receivables financing, per Centrifuge’s loan dashboard.  Centrifuge, led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), acts as a credit marketplace between lenders and borrowers and relies on blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi). Asset originators can turn their traditional, non-crypto assets such as mortgages, invoices or consumer credit into non-fungible tokens (NFT) and use them as collateral to get financing from accredited investors for an interest payment. The protocol has grown to one of the largest blockchain-based real-world asset lending platforms with some $130 million of total value locked on it.  Centrifuge confirmed the distressed debt in an email, but the protocol’s representatives are not involved in discussions between investors and asset originators.  The unpaid loans on Centrifuge stand out among other debt-ridden lending protocols in that loans originated on the platform are supposed to be separated from crypto market turmoil.  Rival lending platforms such as Maple and TrueFi accrued bad debt last year because primarily digital asset trading firms and market makers used the protocols to borrow cryptocurrency without minimal collateral to finance their operations. As the crypto market crashed in 2022 taking some high-profile casualties, including hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and FTX-corporate sibling quant shop Alameda Research, multiple borrowers became insolvent and defaulted on loans.

Another pool, which payments firm Alternative Payments uses to finance invoices and accounts receivable for businesses, has some $650,000 of loans with missed payment out of the $6.4 million outstanding. Alternative has not returned CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.  Centrifuge’s loan dashboard also shows there are four loans worth $3.3 million late with payment in its REIF pool, which provides capital to finance commercial real estate mortgages. However, REIF Financial Investments, which is an investment company that focuses on commercial real estate acquisitions, said in an email that all loans had an option to extend with an additional 12 months, thus avoiding default.

Even with historic losses, management continues to pay itself very well. Any investment in the company remains an unnecessary, Hail Mary bet on Bitcoin. The Quarter MicroStrategy (MSTR) reported another lackluster operational quarter and really bad GAAP loss thanks to mark-to-market losses on its Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hoard. To the extent that any fundamental matters at all, these numbers in no way support the current market cap. I'll also add that the company's unsecured bonds remain below par, implying zero value for the equity. At this point, the software business only matters as a way for the company to cover interest costs on its debt and perhaps a reason for management to get stock compensation (which I'll address below). That said, the software business is still moribund. The company likes to tout its subscriber growth even though it's still less than 15% of revenue. Total revenues were down 1% for the quarter. Even being very generous and using constant currency (without using the same on expenses) revenue growth is uninspiring at 4%. MicroStrategy Revenue Breakdown (Q4 Earnings Presentation) The company makes you work to figure out expenses excluding the noise in the Bitcoin markdowns, but using the below, operating expenses came in at $112 million versus $113 million last year, with some savings on the sales and marketing line (likely a currency benefit). Putting that together means about $20 million of EBITDA for the quarter and $80 million for the year. I think that implies the core software business is worth about $500 million at best. MicroStrategy Expenses Breakdown (Q4 Earnings Presentation) Operating a moribund software business and running an underwater, massive leveraged bet on Bitcoin (even after the rally year to date) doesn't strike me as something that warrants huge compensation to management. This management certainly disagrees. They paid out about $63.6 million in stock compensation in 2022 with Q4 being the biggest quarter of the year at $17 million. Call me crazy, but I believe a management team whose bets on Bitcoin cost investors about $4 billion last year doesn't deserve such riches. Stock Compensation by Quarter (Q4 Earnings Presentation) Effects of the Rally As of the close going into earnings, Bitcoin had rallied about 42% year to date. That move added ~$945 million ($7,005 x 135,000) to the value of the company's holdings. Using $292.13/share (closing price going into earnings) MSTR's market cap grew $1.7 billion ($150.56 x 11.3 million shares) year to date. Somehow every dollar of Bitcoin's rally translated into $1.80 of rally in MSTR stock. I have mentioned MSTR bonds in prior articles. The stock rally has led to a move higher to the mid-$80's in the .75% 2025 convertible bonds (the stock is approaching the conversion price). The 2027 convertible bonds are much farther away from the conversion price and therefore are still in the $40's. More importantly, the 2028 secured bonds, which have a lien on a specific number of Bitcoin and the software operations of the company, are still in the low-$80's and yield about 9.5%. I'll restate that: secured lenders have so little faith in this company's prospects and the security from Bitcoin are demanding 9.5% (almost 6% higher than treasuries) to lend to this company. Despite this concern among bondholders, shareholders have granted the company about $750 million of excess premium from this year's rise in the company's Bitcoin. Risks The risks to playing with any company with a valuation that makes no fundamental sense is that valuation can get more out of whack. If you're going to play from the short side, you have to structure trades that cap your downside in a rally. I also recommend sweeping profits when the stock breaks down. There has been an epic rally in the worst quality/most speculative stocks this year. I believe much of that rally has been driven by a growing view that the Fed would cut interest rates later this year. If interest rates continue to rally, stocks like MSTR might trade higher or at least not break down. If the opposite happens, look out below. Conclusion Nobody who owns MSTR has articulated reasonable justification, in my opinion, why they choose to make a play on Bitcoin with an overleveraged, underwater vehicle that charges high management fees (see the stock comp portion of this article) instead of just buying Bitcoin on margin at a brokerage account at somewhere like Interactive Brokers (IBKR). They certainly can't explain why they are giving $1.80 of market value for every $1 gain in Bitcoin. In my opinion, this stock is for people who neither appreciate risk, valuation or management quality. Stocks like MSTR work when animal spirits have untethered the market from any kind of economic or fundamental reality. It can pay off to just close your eyes, throw money into the market and hope for the best. I consider that a recipe for disaster, but some people treat the market more like a casino than a place to carefully invest capital.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4575217-microstrategy-closing-your-eyes-and-praying-not-investment-strategy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8759425.jpeg

Robinhood is caught in the middle of controversy tied to the disproportionate ownership of Sam Bankman-Fried who is facing allegations in court tied to the FTX exchange failure. Robinhood is heavily overvalued even if Bitcoin rallies to $60,000+. Robinhood's price target starts at $3.50 which implies -66% downside on FY '24 estimated earnings. We give Robinhood a strong sell rating, given poor metrics and low likelihood of achieving meaningful scale with retail accounts. Robinhood (HOOD) has a difficult set-up heading into its Q4 earnings call in which the company is expected to report earnings February 8th, 2022. Though the company has yet to announce an earnings date, we think a combination of bad press, and tough earnings results will keep the stock price suppressed. We also acknowledge that growth metrics are a bit more compelling when compared to Coinbase (COIN) on a near-term basis as Robinhood reported -1% y/y sales growth in Q3 '22 versus Coinbase -55% sales growth in the prior quarter. Given HOOD's added exposure to equities and the launch of various crypto-specific services, we think the business has improved its positioning in the marketplace, but was unable to drive a compelling enough argument to drive adoption of the stock trading platform as 12.2 million Q3 '22 MAU metrics are weak versus prior-year's 21.3 million Q3 '21 MAUs. We think the company can address some product specific issues, which could bring back users, we're also assuming HOOD can turn profitable on a near-term basis a bit sooner than Coinbase. But, the quality of the business is subjectively worse in some regards when compared to Coinbase, as it has less exposure to a crypto-themed recovery and the on-going fraud investigation of Sam Bankman-Fried has managed to pollute the green retail broker. We estimate that Robinhood will report full-year revenue and diluted EPS results of $1.38 billion FY '22 and -$1.16 loss per share. This compares to consensus estimates of $1.37 billion FY'22 revenue, and a diluted loss of -$1.12 per share. Our Robinhood Bear thesis In terms of underlying fundamentals, we think the retail brokerage has over-extended itself with spending, share based compensation, and various other non-essential expenses. The announcement of layoffs suggests the company could return to profitability, but the pathway to profitability is littered with corpses scattered everywhere. Figure 1. Brokerage profitability in the United States Data by YCharts For the most part, the brokerage business is supposed to be extremely profitable (10%-40% profit margins with 20% being the mid-point for specialized brokers with investment banks). We haven't seen any profits from Robinhood on a GAAP or even on an adjusted basis since going public. Even in an extremely bullish year with risk assets performing well, we haven't seen Robinhood perform all that well. We currently value Robinhood on the basis of FY '24 earnings of $0.20 diluted EPS per share and apply 22x forward earnings to arrive at our $3.44 price target, which implies -66% downside from current levels. Therefore, we have a strong sell rating on the stock based on forward estimates, and our own internal estimates of the stock. We anticipate a quicker return to profitability than consensus analysts on retail fueled demand and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) price recovery, which is why we forecast profits in FY '24. Even in an optimal environment, we believe Robinhood will produce lower margins, which is why our exit valuation is so low when compared to other analysts. Given the added costs of running a retail brokerage, and cryptocurrency exchange, while also offering Bitcoin wallet custody services it will severely hamper the businesses' ability to generate a profit. The lack of trading volumes paired with the lack of deposit growth makes the stock extremely unappealing on a fundamental basis. Figure 2. Robinhood clients perform about as well as ARKK Fund holders lately J.P. Morgan (J.P. Morgan) As a consequence, the J.P. Morgan analyst who measured the performance of client assets and the overall drop in total value to be mostly driven by poor returns among retail investors, which further drives the argument that while Robinhood tries to make itself accessible to lower value accounts, the profit margins from smaller accounts is small, and the lack of institutional services and lack of trust among larger accounts makes it difficult for Robinhood to generate positive ARPU growth despite the large amount of client assets on the platform. Kenneth Worthington from J.P. Morgan goes on to elaborate, ""Robinhood's November metrics highlight the significant wealth destruction its users have suffered in recent years, both in good and bad markets. November AUC was $70.2bn, significantly below net cumulative funded deposits of $89.1bn. Since inception, Robinhood customers have lost $18.9bn or 21% of their investments."" Figure 2. Robinhood Average Revenue Per User figures lackluster Robinhood ARPU metrics from Q3 earnings presentation (Robinhood) We think the poor performance among retail traders, and the likely issues tied to its platform, which are numerous, have caused bigger traders to leave the platform. It's why the ARPU metrics are so bad when compared to the peak of the Bitcoin market. But then what else could go wrong with the stock? The Sam Bankman-Fried Episode Sam Bankman-Fried and ""his 56 million Robinhood shares"" are a big problem for HOOD shareholders currently. While, we are compelled to dislike the broker for a variety of reasons we think investors should steer clear given the overwhelming noise tied to the on-going investigation into SBF. We find ourselves objectively not liking the retail brokerage on numerous fronts, as we think the stock is trading in a precarious position following the recent FTX (FTT-USD) bankruptcy and on-going Sam Bankman-Fried trial . Based on the most recent report, the court case continues and details tied to the investigation suggest that SBF is in the fight for his life. We know the public optics are extremely bad, as he's allegedly done a lot of damage to FTX customers over the past 3-months. SBF allegedly purchased Robinhood shares from a separate fund referred to as Alameda Research to purchase the Robinhood position valued at 56 million shares, and is being ordered to transfer those assets as part of a sale to cover for losses of FTX, which the main creditor BlockFi is litigating and also liquidating assets to resolve. Currently, the courts are in a dispute to allocate Sam Bankman-Fried's Robinhood stake, which is valued at $568.4 million currently. For all we know, 56 million HOOD shares could be sold on the basis of a court ruling, which could have devastating impact on HOOD stock at any given moment. It's too big of a block of shares sold too quickly, as 56 million shares represents 6.34% of the total share outstanding. Assuming there's a sale, it would be equivalent to the amount of liquidation insiders do following an IPO, or the amount of capital raised from a secondary offering, implying an added -30% share price headwind. If Robinhood was sold the way the U.S. Government dumps Bitcoin via public auction, it would have a very material impact on the price of the stock. Reports also suggest that BlockFi is turning to other sources of liquidity like unloading its mining equipment valued at $160 million, thus prompting a sell-off in BTC-USD, as miners continue to unload hardware for a variety of reasons, likely adding pressure to semiconductor names in this environment as well. We anticipate that following the sale of the mining equipment to shore-up financial losses at BlockFi, the firm will continue to battle SBF in court over the rights to his Robinhood shares. The affiliation of Sam Bankman-Fried is bad news for shareholders, because it drags down the perception of the stock, its brand, and trust among retail investors. SBF might have signed a collateral agreement that's binding to FTX and BlockFi, which is why the fallout for HOOD shareholders will be noticeable regardless of which way the court ruling goes. It's worth noting that bears have backed-off Robinhood over the course of the year, as the stock has a short interest of 8.24% currently, versus the 16.45% short interest, which peaked back on May 15th, 2022. We think the stock has the worst trading set-up among many of the stocks we follow, and it's also just as dependent on a cryptocurrency themed recovery when compared to Coinbase. However, we want to emphasize that the issues tied to the on-going settlement of FTX, BlockFi, and SBF should bear no material concern to Robinhood stakeholders. SBF's involvement keeps the stock price suppressed in the near-term given the controversy tied to court hearings and on-going investigations will show up in news headlines related to Robinhood thus pervading a negative news cycle in the stock. Robinhood financial model deep dive We forecast that Robinhood will eventually grow sales following the cryptocurrency winter, assuming client assets start to grow. When determining the long-term performance of Robinhood we value the firm on the basis of a high single digit profit margin figure, which is at the low-end in the brokerage business, but extremely generous given HOOD's historic profitability. Typically, brokerages generate profits in the 10%-40% range. We don't think Robinhood will ever achieve high profit margins with retail type accounts, and the associated costs of providing cryptocurrency custody, cryptocurrency related products, while also offering access to conventional securities, options, and margin trading. Basically, the two products cost a lot to support, and it's why we like the focused and more disciplined approach of Coinbase in the space, as it's easy to get caught between product transition during a difficult environment. The other alternative is Interactive Brokers ( IBKR ), which is a more conventional stock broker that is releasing various cryptocurrency trading products and Bitcoin mini-future contracts to be more competitive in the space. We believe investors can avoid Robinhood by simply allocating to a portfolio of Coinbase, SoFi Technologies ( SOFI ), and Interactive Brokers to achieve the best outcome from both categories rather than getting caught up in a difficult profit narrative transition. Figure 4. Robinhood Worth Less Than You Think Robinhood Valuation Model (Trade Theory) We value HOOD on a blend of P/E, EBITDA, and Sales multiple. HOOD gains momentum from an eventual Bitcoin bottoming and a return to the $60,000+ level. Assuming the Bitcoin market recovers, the accounts recover, and so does the amount of fees on managed assets. We anticipate that these outcomes are fairly likely given the historical nature of cycles in the market, and it's why we forecast that HOOD's revenue and earnings will eventually reach higher than its FY'21 peak year results. Keep in mind our model also forecasts a $4.3 billion valuation, whereas the company has $6.25 billion cash on the balance sheet, so a combination of cash burn, and negative sentiment could cause the stock to trade below tangible book value. Realistically anything could happen over the course of a cryptocurrency winter. What we don't acknowledge is the amount of upside investors might anticipate even in the event of a Bitcoin cyclical recovery mainly because Robinhood's margins aren't going to be at the level of conventional brokers when the market does turn. And, because Robinhood supports so many financial trading vehicles, low operating margins get combined with low value accounts. As a consequence, we arrive at the conclusion that Robinhood will become profitable, but the profit contribution from retail accounts will disappoint investors. We anticipate that the stock will trade at a discount even in the profit scenario, because the growth metrics paired with profitability metrics will illustrate how overvalued the stock is... even as the business profile matures. As a consequence, we value the business on the basis of persistently low operating profit margins until they provide services that appeal to bigger account size customers similar to IBKR and COIN. Until those issues get resolved, HOOD becomes a low margin broker that services the cryptocurrency market and stock market concurrently, thus requiring higher cost to maintain accounts, and also justifying a lower valuation due to the on-going cash burn rate. Keep in mind, we value HOOD using the same exact multiples as we did with our COIN analysis , to arrive at a $3.44 price target upon applying the firm's WACC of 8.4% to arrive at our target price. We think both firms will exit the cryptocurrency winter with great growth comps, and suppressed multiples, as investors will wise-up to the annualized growth trends and cyclical nature of Bitcoin by trading the exchanges at lower valuations. We anticipate that the stock will trade at $3-$5, as the near-term headwinds tied to the SBF fallout, weakness in underlying business fundamentals, and the lengthiness of the Bitcoin bear market limits material upside in the stock. Final thoughts heading into the quarter The company might emphasize that deposits growth, or various other levers could be used to drive stock price performance. Based on the most optimistic scenario we could create, we still come up with an intrinsic value estimate that's lower by -66% when compared to where it's trading. Nothing about the SBF court outcome will benefit Robinhood shareholders as the amount of expected dilution from the case settlement could have a devastating impact on the stock similar to the impact of a secondary offering. We also dislike the lack of cost discipline tied to the business, and how it's being justified to expand both categories concurrently but without any emphasis on it benefiting the retail client's returns. The lack of focus leads to an inferior retail trading product, and a lagging cryptocurrency product that barely got separate wallet functionality in the year 2022. Keep in mind, Coinbase has provided users with their Wallets on the exchange since inception of the cryptocurrency exchange back in 2012. It doesn't make sense how brokers want to maintain custody of cryptocurrencies without providing digital wallets tied to their brokerage account. The announcements of earnings results probably doesn't do much to reassure shareholders until there's a spot price recovery in Bitcoin, or unless there's some announcement of institutional brokerage services. The stock has managed to recover to about $10 per share mostly on broad S&P 500 market recovery. We think the stock trades closer to $3 to $5 over the course of the year, as on-going losses tied to its core businesses, and the poor positioning in the follow-on cryptocurrency cycle puts a pervasive ceiling on the stock until they work out a way to drive margins and volumes in a way that makes sense to more fundamentally minded investors.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4575206-robinhood-has-substantial-downside?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8757653.jpeg

42435062,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoaXW,1675458470,Options Automated Market Maker Lyra Deploys to Arbitrum Network,"Lyra, an automated market maker for crypto traders to buy and sell options, is now a multichain protocol after successfully launching its Newport upgrade earlier this week.  Initially only running on Ethereum layer 2 chain Optimism, Lyra has expanded to Arbitrum, another layer 2 platform, and integrated with decentralized exchange GMX perpetuals, a derivative trading product without an expiration date.  ""Paul,"" a core contributor for Lyra, told CoinDesk, “One of our main drivers of launching on Arbitrum and GMX is that we noticed that there were distinct communities forming on each chain. There are users that only use Arbitrum and users that only use Optimism. We realized it doesn’t really make sense to just wall ourselves off to only one subset of users.”  Before the upgrade, Lyra’s market maker vaults (MMV) paid swapping fees for every collateralization and hedging trade. For example, when a trader buys a call option contract on ether (ETH), Lyra’s MMVs would purchase ether from a spot exchange, incurring a fee. Once the trader’s position has closed, Lyra’s MMVs would sell back the ETH used for collateral, incurring yet another fee.  As a result, the process was inefficient and liquidity providers in Lyra’s MMVs had lowered yields from the swapping fees.  Now, Lyra’s MMVs don’t need to swap the base asset like ETH to collateralize or hedge every time a trader buys an option contract. Instead, options are now partially collateralized in cash, while Lyra hedges its exposures by using GMX perpetuals as a source of liquidity.  As a result of the Newport upgrade, the Lyra Twitter account indicated that swapping fees “should be reduced with cost savings passed onto [liquidity providers] in the form of higher yield from the same amount of trading volume.”  Total notional trading volume on Lyra passed $1 billion for the first time on Jan. 16, and in the past 30 days, Lyra’s trading volume increased 8.4%.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ARB,Sage D.

The U.S. added a whopping 517,000 jobs in January, 98% higher than the prior month, and 172% higher than expectations. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, while the labor force participation rate rose to 3.4%.  Investors may view the robust job market negatively as it suggests the economy is not cooling as much as other economic data indicates, and may prompt the U.S. central bank to extend its current series of rate increases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said taming inflation, which topped 9% at one point in 2022, remains a priority.  Central bankers must weigh the United States’ own interest obligations, along with recessionary concerns, as they mull additional changes to monetary policy that would staunch rising prices. The United States interest payments have increased 41% since the first quarter of 2022.  The options traditionally available to governments to manage debt obligations include raising taxes, reducing spending or increasing borrowing. The combination of these factors can send markets downward.

42435076,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoaiQ,1675457100,Legal Expert Says Mango Markets Exploit Case Is Wake-Up Call for DAOs,"Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) will likely consider implementing legal structures following the exploit of Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Mango Markets, according to Benjamin Bathgate, a partner at Canadian-based law firm McMillan LLP.  Bathgate, co-chair of the fraud law group at McMillan for over 15 years, said that “a whole bunch of issues are wrapped” into whether DAOs can make legal settlements. That’s partly because a majority don't have legal structures in place, he said.  “In many situations, the DAO is just a collection of users,” Bathgate, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday. “It’s a community of users, perhaps with a core contributor doing the coding.”  In October, crypto trader Avraham Eisenberg took to Twitter to declare he had been part of the group that exploited Mango Markets, a cryptocurrency exchange, for more than $100 million by manipulating the price of the exchange’s native token MNGO.  Eisenberg appeared to have avoided civil liability after returning $67 million of the stolen funds and reaching an agreement with the Mango Markets DAO. However, Bathgate called the settlement “ill-advised” and one that was “doomed to fail from the beginning.” Eisenberg currently faces commodities fraud, commodities market manipulation and wire fraud charges.  Bathgate said the case against Eisenberg is also different and “unusual to some extent” because Eisenberg’s name was made public. In other exploits, a supposed bad actor isn’t as easy to find. However, because Eisenberg outed himself, “it does raise the question: If you’re doxxed are you going to make these arguments now in the court of law?’  Mango Labs, a Wyoming-based limited liability company that governs the Mango Market DAO, is seeking to claw back the remaining $47 million, arguing that the deal was made under duress. Bathgate, however, said it is unlikely Mango Labs’ settlement will hold up, and to that point may be a wake-up call for the DAO ecosystem.  “There's going to be a reality check because these kinds of settlements are not likely to be enforceable by the courts,” Bathgate said. He added that it may prompt wider conversations about the structures of DAOs, including whether “some form of LLC [or] limited liability structure” will be implemented.  However the lawsuit is decided, the important takeaway is that having an LLC can help a DAO bring a claim to court on behalf of its users.  “That's going to be one of the interesting approaches. Are we going to see more of that and that legal construct so that they can act on its [the DAO's] behalf and take steps on its behalf?” Bathgate said.  But that may not settle the issue entirely, Bathgate cautioned, because it raises questions for DAO community members about settlement law and a proper binding settlement.  “What constitutes agreement by the users?” Bathgate asked. “Does simply clicking on a vote for a proposal crafted by the principles of the DAO for settlement, does that mean you've agreed to it and are bound by those terms and conditions?”  Eisenberg’s lawyer, Brian Klein, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

42411232,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKTU,1675456389,Why Crypto Is Not an 'Industry',"New concepts are complicated enough to talk about without having to struggle with vocabulary. It’s not so much the need to occasionally use arcane terms; it’s also that long-established words can be inadequate and better ones are not yet in circulation. One painful example is a word I need to use several times a day, knowing it is inaccurate.  I’m not talking about the word “crypto,” although I certainly could – it used to refer to cryptography, which is not necessarily blockchain-related. I’m referring to a description of what we are actually doing here.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Those of us who frequently talk about crypto invariably fall back on using the collective term “industry” to include any project building on a blockchain, issuing a token or helping assets move from one owner to another. But is “industry” correct? I looked up various definitions, and this is what I found.  Investopedia: “A group of companies that are related based on their primary business activities”  Collins: “All the people and activities involved in making a particular product or providing a particular service”  Vocabulary.com: ""A group of manufacturers or businesses that produce a particular kind of goods or services”  You get the drift. The most common definitions imply that an industry has a common purpose and is composed of businesses engaged in a similar activity.  Skimming through the main crypto news sites this morning, there are articles about crypto exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) platforms, decentralized lenders, game developers, new blockchains, custody services, data storage, asset managers and more. What is the common business activity here?  We could argue that it’s the promotion of blockchain technology. But should the classification of an industry focus on its technology, or its activity? Take the health-care industry, for example – its common thread is the well-being of people, using whatever technologies it can. Or the insurance industry, whose common purpose is to provide coverage to any kind of entity. An industry united by the desire to promote a new technology rather than satisfy needs doesn’t sound very, well, industrious.  See also: What Is Blockchain Technology? / Learn  To put it another way, is the tech the “big deal,” or is what it can do more important? Those building will probably argue that the tech is a pretty big deal, and they’re right – but the tech is not going to make much of an impact on the world without use cases. And isolating the technology in its own industry grouping could hamper its impact by creating distance between it and the activities it wants to disrupt.  To be fair, this lexical confusion started with the “tech industry.” The term started out as a grouping for companies such as IBM, Oracle and Microsoft that build computers and/or software, and has since expanded to include robotics research, headset manufacturing, payments, video conferencing and mattress retailers.  Extrapolating the pattern, this sounds like a maturity issue. “Tech industry” was fine when the building of the tech was more a focus than its uses, because those uses were still nascent. But categorization was needed, a mindset was formed and other companies wanted the “cool” label.  The crypto industry is in a similar situation: In the early days, construction of cryptography and blockchain was prioritized. Now, however, the focus is also on use cases, which complicates the categorization – but habits have been set and labels happily adopted.  Invested with meaning  This brings us to why categorization matters more than most realize. Industry labels are important because of investment specialization and indices. Just as good venture funds can help projects find synergies with others in different markets, good crypto investors can also lift entire groups through connections and collective learning. And just like the market is overrun with tech exchange-traded funds (ETF) that contain a curious amalgam of business activities, so we will soon have crypto ETFs (based on listed shares but eventually also tokens) that span a range of industries.  See also: Bad Vibes from the Word 'Crypto' Have Some Calling for a Rebrand  We’ll know our category is maturing, though, when the labels blur and possibly even fade away – when we care more about what a project does than how it works. When we see blockchain-based payments companies make it into financial services ETFs. When tokenized shares of Meta Platforms (the former Facebook) and Nvidia power a metaverse ETF alongside native tokens such as MANA and SAND.  Labels matter a lot for regulation, too. Lawmakers seem to understand that they can’t regulate “technology,” but they can make sure that technology companies don’t abuse data and don’t get too big. Yet, we see many calls for regulation of “crypto” as if it was one activity, without understanding that it is already too sprawling to be regulated comprehensively.  But there is a glimmer of linguistic hope on the horizon. The fact that we even have a “crypto industry” – that it isn’t just lumped into the “tech industry” bucket – is confirmation that what we are working on is truly innovative and unique as well as a sign that, finally, the tech label is evolving. The same will eventually happen to our area.  And just as technology evolves, maybe vocabulary should also. Maybe it’s time to retire the word “industry,” at least in its application to tech and crypto. It does, after all, conjure up images of manufacturing in physical locations.  So, what then? “Sector” is too broad – it’s currently best applied to economic segments, such as “services sector” or “public sector.” Personally, I prefer “ecosystem” – it sounds more community-driven, less technology-specific and more flexible as to ultimate goals. More encompassing, collaborative and welcoming, even for those who don’t work in blockchain-related projects.  See also: A Dictionary for Degens | Opinion  “Industry” will no doubt still creep into my writing with frequency as some habits are hard to suppress (and as my inner thesaurus will rebel against repeating “ecosystem” too much).

The app’s discontinuation comes as the firm struggles to build its business while regulators ""clarify the regulatory environment surrounding crypto,"" according to tZero's tweets. It also comes roughly one year after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered the company to pay $800,000 for violating federal disclosure rules. Users will have to withdraw their assets from the app before tZero Crypto's shutdown on March 6. Until then, the platform's custodian will continue to custody customers' crypto.  TZero Crypto was launched in 2019 with the idea of creating the first platform where customers could trade cryptocurrencies, blockchain-based securities and traditional stocks with a single app, pending regulatory approval. But those aspirations were complicated by the firm’s run-ins with regulators and other controversies.  In January of last year, the company paid $800,000 to settle an SEC order that alleged the firm neglected to properly disclose that it had shared order information with both a broker-dealer affiliate and Blue Ocean Technologies, a trading partner in Singapore it acquired at a later date. Regulators also issued a cease-and-desist order as part of the settlement.  Before the settlement, the firm had already had its fair share of problems due to scandals within its parent company’s executive suite. In August 2019, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne stepped down from his position as head of the company over allegations that he had become entangled with a Russian spy.  In his resignation letter, Byrnes wrote that he did not want his ties with the Russians to overshadow the company’s ventures, especially its foray into blockchain-based technology and the crypto space.  The latest decision to shutter the tZero Crypto app may not signal the end of tZero’s ambitions to offer digital asset securities to its clients, however.  “Our regulated affiliates will be playing a key part in bringing compliant digital asset securities to the market including crypto assets that can be lawfully offered on a regulated securities platform,” tZero tweeted.

42435064,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoabi,1675455240,"MakerDAO Constitution Would Fund Sustainability Efforts With 20K MKR Tokens From Reserves, Emissions","An early draft of MakerDAO's proposed governance constitution would have the DAI stablecoin issuer join the fight against climate change with 20,000 MKR tokens (around $14 million) to fund sustainability campaigns through 2040.  Written by the crypto group’s founder Rune Christensen, the wide-ranging document identifies “scientific sustainability” as a core principle worth incorporating into Maker’s politics and operations. The proposed fund represents one of the strongest statements on climate change to come from a decentralized autonomous organization. ""The details about this fund will be revealed at a later date,"" said a MakerDAO representative.  The climate call-out adds a new angle to MakerDAO’s hopes of disrupting the status quo financial infrastructure – as most every crypto project seeks to do. According to Christensen, who has long advocated for climate action, MakerDAO has a responsibility to act.  “At the time of the Maker Constitution the world is headed off a cliff with runaway greenhouse gas pollution pushing the biosphere past critical climate tipping points that will cause disasters for centuries to come. Immediate action is required,” the preliminary draft of the Maker constitution says.  Through the Scientific Sustainability Fund, MakerDAO will use MKR reserves and initial MKR token emissions to fund awareness campaigns geared toward combating misinformation as well as promoting ""energy solutions that have proven, real life track records of achieving scalable decarbonization,"" according to the draft.  The constitution states that direct funding of coal energy will not be allowed.  The proposal has been viewed over 500 times, with 10 replies and 24 likes in the discussion forum since it was created three days ago. Most of the replies did not touch on the subject of climate change.  However, a member of Maker’s governance core unit team, LongForWisdom, expressed his disapproval about Christensen’s usage of the words “immediate action is required.” LongForWisdom said, “This is great in a speech, or if you’re trying to convince someone to approve this as a proposal. Ultimately, though, it creates ambiguity that weakens the document as what is essentially part of a legal code.”  On Twitter, in response to the 20,000 MKR being allocated to fight climate change, Moneysupply.eth, a risk analyst and governance contributor for several decentralized protocols, including MakerDAO, wrote, “So here’s a contrarian take: I am not convinced this specific initiative is the best path forward but [decentralized finance] desperately needs to start winning the battle for public opinion, the alternative is all of us in jail and the rest of the world buying their bug rations with cbdc [central bank digital currencies].”  Although Christenson published his climate-forward draft Constitution for MakerDAO this week, the concept of sustainability can be traced back to the first-ever public MKR vote in September 2018, a vote on guiding principles.  One of the principles was sustainable finance. “This means that Maker will be biased towards, for example, renewable energy that provides a long-term global benefit, while being biased against funding fossil fuels and other assets that create long-term risk, said a Maker blog post from August 2018 related to the first vote.  Moreover, Christensen discussed climate change in “The Case for Clean Money” in 2021, well before this attempt to codify the principles for the DAO.  “By tapping into the fundamental features of blockchain we can develop verifiable processes to ensure all Maker collateral is in sustainable and climate-aligned assets that consider the long term impacts of financial activity on the environment,” Christensen wrote at the time.  The proposal indicated the draft of the Maker constitution is a work in progress and will continuously be updated and modified. In order to be enacted, the proposal needs to move past the request for comments (RFC) phase, which is where the proposal sits currently. The community is still reviewing the document and the writer is redrafting based on community comments.The RFC phase has a minimum duration of four months. Afterwards, Christensen can submit the proposal to the governance cycle where people can evaluate and vote on the proposal.  Rune Christensen did not return a request to comment by press time.

Krug joined Pantera in 2017 to help manage the Liquid Token Fund. On a recent investor call, he revealed that the fund had lost 80% during 2022, taking a 23% hit in November alone in the aftermath of collapsed crypto exchange FTX. The letter didn’t specify why Krug was leaving.  “While Joey is a friend and we are naturally sad to see him leave, we expect the transition to be seamless,” Pantera founder and Chief Executive Officer Dan Morehead wrote in the letter. “His responsibilities will be absorbed by the Executive Committee and our deep bench of 65 experienced investment and operations professionals.”  The committee, which will have management oversight over the firm, includes Morehead, longtime partner Paul Veradittakit and Jasper Lewitton, who joined Pantera last summer as president. Lewitton’s work history includes a decade-long stint at Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates.  Morehead also used the letter to announce two new hires: Katrina Paglia as general counsel and chief compliance officer and Marc Selfon as chief financial officer. Paglia joined from Coinbase, where she worked as associate general counsel in support of digital asset and exchange products. Selfon, who will join Pantera in April, spent over 13 years at private equity giant Apollo Global Management as a managing director in the credit and private equity divisions.  Morehead revealed in the letter that Pantera’s near-term road map includes launching a successor to its Blockchain Fund in the second half of 2023, reiterating plans laid out last year as the initial fund prepared to close with $1.3 billion in committed capital. The new fund will be called the Pantera Fund V because it will be the firm’s fifth venture-focused fund.

42411237,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKWn,1675452505,Fed Policy Win Could Harm Bitcoin’s Wall Street Narrative,"Economic data and other indicators, including a more upbeat mood in financial markets, point to a real possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve will defy earlier expectations and successfully engineer a soft landing in the world’s biggest economy.  If so, that could yet again force bitcoin-favoring investment advisers to return to the drawing board on how to frame this hard-to-categorize asset as something newcomers can understand and hold in their portfolios. My advice to them: Don’t bother, not because I think bitcoin is worthless, but because all efforts to explain it within the language and logical framework of traditional financial markets will continue to fail when the real explanation for its value lies elsewhere – such as in the streets of Lagos.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Consider the various buy-bitcoin narratives that have been hoisted upon Wall Street.  There was the once-common description of it as an inflation hedge. That pitch died with bitcoin’s market collapse last year right when consumer prices were surging – the opposite of what you’d want a hedge to do.  Then there was the related but more nuanced digital gold story, where bitcoin is thought of as a scarce digital asset that provides a long-term store of value in the face of political and economic uncertainty. It also hasn’t played out so well. Most of the post-2021 wave of late-adopting institutional and individual newcomers have suffered wealth destruction.  Finally, there’s the long-game idea that you should own bitcoin as a warrant or option on a future collapse in the dollar-centric international monetary system, a bet that confidence in the central bank stewards of that system might eventually evaporate. This too is being challenged, at least for now, by recent economic evidence.  The dollar collapse narrative  Let’s break that third narrative down.  Some saw the economic situation in late winter 2022 as a perfect storm to bring to an end the age of the U.S. economic and monetary hegemony, and thus as a test of the theory of bitcoin as an option on monetary collapse.  A nuclear-armed Russia was at war with Ukraine, supply chains were choking due to COVID-19 and war disruptions, and inflation was at its highest level in 40 years. The concern was that the Fed, which had embarked on an aggressive set of rate hikes, would not only fail to break the back of entrenched inflation but its actions would create such severe hardship that it would be forced under overwhelming political pressure to backtrack. That failure, some believed, would ultimately lead to a loss of confidence in the world’s most powerful central bank and, by extension, in the dollar. By contrast, bitcoin would shine as a reliable math-driven alternative, immune to such human failings.  Come 2023, that gloomy prediction really hasn’t transpired, not in the broadest sense. Even with hundreds of thousands of layoffs in the tech and financial sectors, unemployment is stunningly low – the 3.4% rate registered Friday for January was the lowest in 53 years – and the latest payroll expansion of 513,000 for the same month smashed forecasts for a mere 187,000 gain.  Meanwhile, inflation, though still high, is easing. The U.S. consumer price index showed an annualized advance of 6.5% in January, down from 7.1% in February. And while the institute for Supply Management’s January survey of purchasing managers showed a deeper contraction for the U.S. manufacturing sector than in December, suggesting a recession is in the cards, forward-looking projections are starting to look more optimistic.  This week, the International Monetary Fund upped its 2023 forecast for the world economy to 2.9%, up 0.2% from its October forecast. Also, a rapidly rebounding stock and bond market seems increasingly convinced that a best-of-both-worlds scenario is emerging, with inflation cooling and the economy simply slowing to a manageable rate of growth without a harsh economic collapse. That view was strengthened by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s relatively sanguine take on the outlook for inflation and interest rates during a Wednesday press conference following the Fed’s widely expected quarter-point rate increase decision.  If those projections prove correct, then Powell and his fellow voters on the Federal Open Markets Committee will have earned back some of the respect they lost in 2021, when they were criticized for waiting too long to realize that rising consumer prices weren’t just a “transitory” COVID-related problem. The Fed will still have its many critics, of course, but it would be a huge stretch to argue that there was a fundamental loss of confidence in the central bank or in the currency it manages.  In other words, it seems increasingly unlikely that anyone will get to exercise their bitcoin option on the dollar’s collapse, at least this time around. And, as such, that particular justification for buying doesn’t appear to be standing up.  Bitcoin's bigger value proposition  What to make, then, of bitcoin, which briefly topped $24,000 this week and has had its best month in a year?  Well, the simple answer is that investors everywhere are recovering their risk appetites and that as financial conditions ease, money is flowing into risky assets everywhere, of which bitcoin is considered one.  But that's a rather unsatisfying answer. We’ve just gone through an exercise showing how a variety of arguments for investing in bitcoin have failed. Why does bitcoin have any value at all? Just because people have money to spend shouldn’t mean they’ll spend it on something worthless. What, then, is the fundamental value proposition that continues to drive people to buy bitcoin?  I think it lies far, far away from Wall Street.  Right now, bitcoin is proving it has value in developing economies where financial freedom is under attack, such as:  Nigeria, where the government has taken draconian steps to ban cash to force adoption of its digital currency, people have reportedly flocked to bitcoin to protect their wealth. One measure of that demand: a huge premium for bitcoin in Nigeria over the price in dollars in the U.S. – almost double.  Lebanon, whose banking system has all but collapsed. There, I’m told, wholesale wine prices are often quoted in bitcoin. Also, people like the guy featured in this CNBC piece have figured out how to make living with makeshift mining farms spread around the country.  Vietnam, which last year again topped Chainalysis rankings for cryptocurrency adoption. One reason for that: with only slightly more than 30% of all adult Vietnamese having a bank account, the country has one of the world’s lowest rates of financial inclusion.  All the other countries on Chainalysis’s top 10 crypto adoption index. Other than the United States, which sits at number five, the list is made up entirely of emerging market countries: the Philippines, Ukraine, India Pakistan, Brazil, Thailand, Russia and China.  So, if you’re now feeling like financial conditions are restoring your appetite to invest, and are looking to justify adding bitcoin to your portfolio, don’t try to map it against the standard risks and opportunities in a traditional Western financial market. Instead, look to the many places in the world where the local financial system is deficient due to politics, insecurity or a general failure of institutional infrastructure.  In those places, bitcoin is proving it has utility. And if it’s useful there, it has to be valuable.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

His agency is “working towards another strong year of precedent-setting cases,” Behnam said in remarks prepared for delivery Friday at an American Bar Association event. He said budget increases at the CFTC will help support “growing our enforcement and surveillance teams.”  “The CFTC has brought important, precedent-setting cases against those who illegally offer derivatives or leveraged, margined or financed digital asset products to US customers or operate within the United States,” he said He promised to use “the full breadth of the commission’s authority” in going after illegal transactions in digital assets.

42410852,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs2Ek,1675442075,"Nigeria’s Bitcoin Premiums May Better Reflect Country’s Demand for the Dollar, Not Crypto","Nigeria’s bitcoin premiums – where the cryptocurrency was listed on local trading platforms for 60% above market prices – made headlines this week. Although the news was celebrated by the bitcoin community on social media, the inflated bitcoin prices may not reflect a heightened demand for the asset but a continued demand for the U.S. dollar as the country’s local currency suffers.  It all started when a number of media outlets drew attention to the high premiums, which they attributed to cash withdrawal limits placed by the Nigerian government on its citizens as it worked on swapping old bank notes for new ones. But the ATM withdrawal limits were initially imposed on Dec. 6 last year, and the government had been easing the limit since before doubling down again in January.  If bitcoin demand went up as a result of the cash jam in the country, the premiums should have spiked as the ATM limits were imposed in early December.  “But essentially, what we were seeing was that it was just this constant premium,” said Conor Ryder, research analyst at digital asset data provider Kaiko, who looked at prices going back to a few days before the withdrawal limit was imposed and saw “the premium didn't substantially increase at all,” as a result of the ATM limit order.  Nigeria’s bitcoin premiums are not a new phenomenon and they typically reveal the discrepancies between official and unofficial U.S. dollar exchange rates in the country. Although the government sets the official rate, thanks to the country’s chronic currency devaluation problem, the dollar sells for much higher on unofficial local forex markets.  Even if the bitcoin prices on international peer-to-peer platforms such as Paxful are calculated based on Nigeria’s official U.S. dollar exchange rate, the unofficial rates may actually reflect how most Nigerians are accessing the foreign currency – by dishing out a lot more naira per buck.  “That's really the rate to use. And if you use that rate, it's barely traded at a premium at all. I think it's quite close to the price of bitcoin,” Ryder said during an interview with CoinDesk.  He added that the overall reaction to the news of the premiums might have been a “bit overblown.” But that is not to say Nigerians aren’t paying more for something.  Read more: In Nigeria, One Bitcoin Can Cost $68,000. Here's Why.  “They are paying a premium. It's just probably more for the U.S. dollar rather than bitcoin, which tells you they're in a kind of desperate need, I guess, to move into a more stable currency like the U.S. dollar,” Ryder said.  But the logic that premiums indicate bitcoin is in demand isn’t exactly flawed either because bitcoin premiums show up in other markets like South Korea, where the local currency is comparatively stable.  When there is a dramatic increase in demand for crypto in South Korea, and when local selling rates in Korean won are converted back into U.S. dollars, “you're seeing that they're actually paying a higher rate in their local currency than they would have been in the U.S. market,” Ryder said.  None of this, however, takes away from the fact that Nigeria is a big crypto adopter. Its tech-savvy, young population has embraced Web3 and has, in times of trouble – from protests against police brutality to combating inflation or government controls – turned to crypto as an alternative to naira.  So it’s not a stretch to imagine how crypto – from bitcoin to dollar-backed stablecoins – could play a role in mitigating Nigerians’ currency troubles, Ryder said.  “Bitcoin would fix some of the problems that they're having with access to cash,” he added.

Titled “Nouns: Nountown,” the comics will feature a storyline about the tokens within the Nouns ecosystem. The series will be authored by David Leach, senior editor at Titan, and illustrated by Danny Schlitz, who has previously worked with brands such as Disney, Marvel, Netflix and Warner Brothers.  The comic books, which will be minted as NFTs in April, will be securely vaulted by Web3 security provider 4K Protocol. Post-mint, buyers can redeem their digital tokens for a physical copy or purchase the physical book in stores.  Adam Fortier, comic industry veteran and founder of ComicsDAO, told CoinDesk that he’s enthusiastic about Web3 technologies bringing a new life to classic categories of content.  “If there was any space that embodied the essence of NFT in the physical world, it would be comic books,” said Fortier. “They're totally interested in different stories and willing to try something out, but you also have the collectible aspect.”  Additionally, the project hopes to expand the Nouns intellectual property (IP), which operates under a CC0 copyright classification. Anonymous co-founder of Nouns 4156 told CoinDesk that releasing a digital and physical comic book will inspire community members to seek new ways to extend the brand’s creativity.  “The intent was always to try to build something that was infinitely extensible, to try to build what could hopefully become the world's largest open-source brand,” said 4156. “This specific collaboration is one more step in that direction.”  Nouns, which mints Ethereum-based generative NFTs every day to raise money for its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), has been putting its funds into other Web3 activations over the past few months. In December, Nouns announced a partnership with the Australian Open to create an NFT collection inspired by the tennis tournament.

The token commenced the year at $16.66K compared with the $23.35K print as of early morning trading. But it's still down some 65% from its November 2021 all-time high given the downfall of the Terra ( LUNC-USD ) blockchain and subsequent high-profile implosions, including crypto lender Celsius Network ( CEL-USD ) and crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ). In the eyes of Edmond Goh, head of trading for crypto market maker B2C2, institutional investors (e.g., hedge funds) are becoming more active with crypto trading than individual retail investors, as reported by the Journal . He told the newspaper that last year his firm saw over 45% of client trading flows originate from retail versus 34% year-to-date. Perhaps retail investors' waning participation in crypto can be attributed to increased lack of trust in the emerging space (following the alleged FTX fraud) in addition to a shortage in regulation. Earlier this week, legend investor Charlie Munger called for the U.S. government to ban crypto like China did in 2021, citing ""wretched excess"" as a result of a regulation gap. Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at financial services platform Marex Solutions, told the WSJ that some large investors who had shorted bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) -- or wager on lower BTC prices -- were now covering those positions in a move that seemingly contributed to the token's rally.

42435074,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoak6,1675431917,Craig Wright's UK Case Against 16 Bitcoin Developers to Go to Full Trial,"The U.K. Court of Appeal ruled that a claim by Craig Wright's Tulip Trading against 16 Bitcoin developers should go to trial in London. The claim was originally dismissed in March 2022.  The claim alleges that the developers owe ""fiduciary duties"" and ""duties in tort"" to re-write or amend protocol code in order to give Wright access to 111,000 bitcoin (BTC) from two wallets whose private keys were allegedly stolen and subsequently erased in a hack. One of the wallets Wright claims to own, the 1Feex wallet, holds nearly 80,000 BTC associated with the hack of Mt. Gox – the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that went bankrupt after a series of hacks between 2011 and 2014. His ownership of those coins is, as such, contested.  The case was first heard in the England and Wales High Court last year by Mrs. Justice Falk, who concluded that Tulip had not “established a serious issue to be tried.” Wright subsequently appealed Falk’s judgment and a 2-day hearing was held at the end of 2022 in the Court of Appeal.  In its judgment, the Court of Appeals said the claim presents a ""serious issue to be tried"" and cited four grounds for the appeal to succeed, including that the relevant area of law is developing, uncertain and complex and thus warrants a trial.  In fiduciary-beneficiary relationships, fiduciaries are legally required to act in the best interests of beneficiaries (e.g attorney-client relationships). Tortious duties require a relationship where the service provider is expected to reasonably protect an individual from some form of harm, failing which, the individual may be entitled to monetary compensation (e.g. doctor-patient relationships).  Wright is essentially asking the court to treat developer-user relationships the same way it treats attorney-client and doctor-patient relationships.  Bitcoin Core developers work on the key software underpinning Bitcoin, focusing their efforts on a variety of improvements (privacy, security, user experience, etc.) at the base layer of Bitcoin. They are often volunteers who may sometimes accept funding grants or donations in support of their work.  Read more: Craig Wright Demands Bitcoin Developers Give Him Access to Stolen Mt. Gox Coins  Wright contends that Bitcoin developers can easily change the protocol's code in order to return the keys to those funds to him.  Last year, Wright’s other company, nChain, developed a blacklist manager for the Bitcoin SV network (BSV). The tool allows users to freeze and confiscate BSV coins as long as they provide legal documents proving rightful ownership. Many see this as an affront to the Bitcoin ethos of decentralization and censorship resistance.  In 2021, the London High Court gave Craig Wright's lawyers permission to serve papers to the 16 developers, even if they don't reside in the U.K. The developers include Cory Fields, Peter Todd, Roger Ver, Pieter Wuille and others who have worked on the Bitcoin network.  A legal representative for 14 of the developers said the Court of Appeal felt inclined to send the case to trial because the developers were all outside the jurisdiction of the court, City AM reported. A full trial is expected next year.  Craig Wright is a computer scientist who claims to be Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. In October, Judge Helen Engebrigtsen held in a court case in Norway, involving a claim by Wright that someone named Hodlonaut defamed him, that Hodlonaut “had sufficient factual grounds to claim that Wright had lied and cheated in his attempt to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.”  CoinDesk  See also: Craig Wright’s Blacklist Resembles Bitcoin ‘Kill Switch’ Satoshi Never Followed Through On  UPDATE (Feb. 3, 14:10 UTC): Changes attribution to court ruling, adds partial reason for appeal's success in second paragraph.

42410856,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs2LM,1675430748,UK Crypto Rules Set a Modest Post-Brexit Divergence From the European Union,"The U.K.’s new crypto rules are part of a program of regulatory divergence from the European Union, the supranational bloc of which it was until recently a member – but some crypto advocates are underwhelmed by the extent to which the country is really using post-Brexit freedoms to carve out a unique niche for itself.  A policy paper published Wednesday lays out how the Treasury wants to use powers set out in the Financial Services and Markets Bill – a law which, from the start, the government billed as a chance to finally set independent financial rules.  “The Government will move at pace to implement a more agile and more internationally competitive set of rules that will harness the potential of U.K. financial services to stimulate growth,” the government’s then-Economic Secretary Richard Fuller said in his opening speech on the bill in September, referring to other provisions of the law that “roll back or reform all European Union legislation for financial services that remains on our statute book.”  With the EU set to vote imminently to formally pass its Markets in Crypto Assets regulations (MiCA) into law, U.K. politicians are keenly aware they must move fast amid global competition.  “The EU has just agreed to a comprehensive regime for regulating crypto exchanges and crypto assets more broadly, and [U.S. President] Joe Biden has said that he is looking to do something similar,” said opposition party Treasury spokesperson Tulip Siddiq at an October bill committee meeting. Siddiq said slow rulemaking “risks leaving our country behind in the fintech and blockchain race.”  Now, the broad thrust of the U.K.’s approach – influenced by then-Finance Minister and now Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s 2022 vow to make the U.K. a crypto hub – has been made clear, but experts point out how similar the proposals are to the EU’s framework.  “This looks like it will mostly follow, at least in terms of scope and approach, what the MiCA regulation is doing,” Diego Ballon Ossio, senior associate at U.K.-based law firm Clifford Chance, told CoinDesk. “The U.K. is positioning itself with a regime that is as comprehensive as a European regime.”  Whatever discrepancies emerge between the two jurisdictions will be keenly watched by crypto companies looking for the easiest and safest place to do business – and some have noted London has a different legal strategy.  “These proposals do not constitute an entirely new regime in the same way that the European Commission has approached MiCA, rather [the U.K. Treasury] plans to work with what we already have and extend our existing framework to this asset class,” Albert Weatherill, financial services partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, said in an emailed statement.  For Mark Aruliah, senior policy adviser at Elliptic, the U.K. may be a step ahead of the EU – in particular because the bloc chose to ban interest payments on stablecoins, which are crypto pegged to the value of other assets like fiat currencies. He thinks that by setting strict standards for stablecoin issuers, the EU could discourage decentralized finance, which uses these assets for payments.  “The U.K. legislation – and we obviously haven't seen the detail – may not address that. It might just be silent on it,” he said, in which case U.K. players will get better liquidity spreads and lower cost. “That’s better in the U.K., I think there's more flexibility.”  Historically, lending rates on U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins were 9% to 13% – and even if those have calmed during the crypto winter, central banks across the world have been raising the interest rates for cash, making zero-reward stablecoins relatively less attractive.  The U.K. plans to have multiple regimes for the crypto sector including one for stablecoins. In its January 2021 consultation on stablecoins, it said the crypto should be subject to existing payments legislation, with the Bank of England regulating major stablecoins that could have an impact on the whole financial sector.  Read more: UK Crypto Industry Welcomes New Stablecoin Rules, Awaits Guidance  Unlike the EU, the U.K.’s crypto proposals leave out areas like settlement and financial advice, but include crypto lending, Dea Markova, managing director of Forefront Advisers told CoinDesk. That’s perhaps because some high-profile lenders such as Celsius Network and Voyager Digital failed in the period since MiCA was first proposed.  The U.K. also ventures into areas the EU left ambiguous – such as the knotty question of whether exchanges have to publish a white paper of investor disclosures for widely-traded assets like bitcoin (BTC), Markova said.  “The U.K. approach does not leave bitcoin, [ether] or other tokens generated via mining or validating out of scope,” she said. “They will be subject to admission and disclosure requirements.”  In other areas such as the treatment of non-fungible tokens, there could also be more divergence, she said – though it’s unclear how because in both cases the detail has been left to rule-making by regulators at the Financial Conduct Authority and European Securities and Markets Authority.  A key strand of the U.K.’s Brexit debate has been whether the country will be able to forge its own path or, in effect, continue to take dictation from its close neighbor. For Ballon Ossio, the jury is still out.  “Whether we are taking rules or setting rules, I don't know,” he said. “So much for Brexit freedoms.”  Read more: UK Crypto Firms to Get Broad Laws, May Need New Authorization",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Jack Schickler, Camomile Shumba",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/03/uk-crypto-rules-set-a-modest-post-brexit-divergence-from-the-europe-union,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5207abe99d21398f4276e3adaba5360b4e815e1-7108x4681.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435068,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoaf4,1675425943,Core Scientific to Hand Crypto Mining Rigs to NYDIG to Extinguish $38.6M in Debt,"Core Scientific (CORZ) will hand over about 18% of its crypto mining rigs, or 27,403 machines, to lender NYDIG in exchange for extinguishing $38.6 million in debt, according to a Feb. 2 filing with the bankruptcy court for the southern district of Texas.  Core, which as of the end of December 2022 operated 153,000 machines for its self-mining operations, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year. The NYDIG deal has yet to be approved by the bankruptcy court judge.  The bear market in crypto has taken a toll on the mining industry, particularly on leveraged firms, as high energy prices coupled with a low bitcoin price have led to consolidation and capitulation. Core borrowed about $77.5 million from NYDIG to buy mining equipment starting October 2020, but has essentially stopped paying off the loans since the end of the third quarter.  The agreement will bring ""substantial benefits"" because the value of the machines is lower than the outstanding principal and the machines are no longer needed for its operations, Core said in the filing. Prices for bitcoin mining rigs have dropped about 85% in the past year, according to data from Luxor Technologies.  On Jan. 31, Core agreed to borrow $70 million from investment bank B. Riley. On Feb. 1, NYDIG filed a reservation of rights letter with the court saying it might object to the financing if Core didn't finalize an agreement over its own debt. The lender has previously argued that it isn't well-protected against the diminution of the value of the machines under the post-bankruptcy financing arrangements.  About 60% of the machines posted as collateral for the NYDIG loans are Bitmain Antminer S19s, an old model, whereas around the rest are newer Antminer S19j Pros.  Earlier in 2023, Core moved to reject its hosting contracts with Celsius Mining, which is also bankrupt.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/03/core-scientific-to-hand-crypto-mining-rigs-to-nydig-to-extinguish-386m-in-debt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4838ef4103430d0eb462dcc854d4041b6690a5bf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The solution ostensibly ends worries about what would happen to customer funds if Binance and WazirX end their collaboration, but seems to have further escalated the fight between the two crypto exchanges.  ""As an exception, we have invited Zanmai to work out arrangements with us to withdraw any remaining assets in the relevant accounts after [Feb. 3]. However, the responsibility ultimately lies with the Zanmai team to make the withdrawals expeditiously,"" Binance said.  In a tweet on Friday at 14:58 UTC, WazirX said it had begun the process of transferring assets to multi-sig wallets, and that it expects the process to be completed ""within the next few hours.""  History of Binance-WazirX spat  The public spat between Binance and WazirX began on Aug. 5, 2022, when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted claims that ""Binance does not own any shares in Zanmai Labs, the entity operating WazirX and established by the original founders."" Zhao's comments had come hours after India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the properties of WazirX director and co-founder Sammer Mhatre on the same day on suspicions that the exchange had helped 16 fintech companies launder money.  In the days to follow, Zhao stirred panic among users of WazirX. Zhao said Binance could, if it wanted to, shut down the Indian cryptocurrency platform, and advised its users to transfers their funds to Binance.  ""Binance provides wallet services for WazirX. WazirX domain is transferred to our control. We were given a shared access to an AWS account. We could shut down WazirX. But we can't, because it hurts users,"" Zhao tweeted.  ""If you have funds on WazirX, you should transfer it to Binance. Simple as that,"" he said.  In an interview with CoinDesk at the time, Nischal Shetty, the co-founder of WazirX, rebuffed Zhao's claims about not controlling the WazirX exchange. ""WazirX is the technology which we sold to Binance,” he said. He has legal documents proving the sale but is unable to share them, again due to legal reasons. “What I really want is a solution,” Shetty said.  Shetty had spoken to CoinDesk over the past few months, saying his team has been in discussions with Binance for several months to work out the ownership issue.  In the months to come, macro economic factors coupled with India's harsh taxes and the crypto contagion exacerbated by the FTX collapse saw WazirX laying off 40% of its workers. Given that WazirX later disclosed that 90% of its user assets are held in Binance wallets, it was unclear what impact Binance and WazirX decoupling would have on WazirX.  Binance’s threat and exception  The solution appears to have come after a threat by Binance, which CoinDesk reported on last week based on emails it had seen.  ""On 26 January 2023, we offered Zanmai a choice between retracting the false public statements (and continuing to use our services) or terminating the use of our wallet service,"" said the Binance blog. ""Since Zanmai has refused to clarify their misleading statements, Zanmai has till 3 February 2023 (23:59 UTC) to remove the funds from the accounts that they used for WazirX’s operations.""  The blog further said that since the ""deadline is near"" and ""users whose assets are deposited with WazirX might have legitimate concerns about what will happen to their holdings in light of these events,"" Binance said.  It added it made an exception: ""Zanmai have informed us of their intention to withdraw the assets from the relevant accounts. On our end, we are doing everything we can to facilitate this process.""  WazirX did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

8722564,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518514,1675422554,"Cardano Price Faces Make-or-Break Moment, Can Djed Propel ADA?","The Cardano price is experiencing a strong year-to-date (YTD) increase of around 62%. Nevertheless, ADA is facing a crucial make-or-break moment in the 1-day chart, which could decide the long-term trend. At press time, the ADA price was at $0.40, registering a slight 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours, with a 5.4% gain for the week. This puts the price just below the critical resistance zone between $0.405 and $0.42 after ADA broke out of a downtrend in mid-January that has lasted since June 2022 (blue line in the chart). The zone between $0.405 and $0.42 served as extremely strong support for the price from May to early October 2022, before the downside break happened on October 10. Since then, support has turned into key resistance. To make matters more complicated, the 200-day EMA is now approaching the top of the resistance zone at $0.42. Related Reading: Cardano Adds 50,000 New Wallets As ADA Market Cap Surges The 200-day moving average is an indicator that determines the long-term trend of an asset. When the price breaks above the 200-day moving average indicator, it usually signifies a trend reversal and a return to bullish territory. The fact that the 200-day EMA and resistance zone are now coinciding presents the Cardano (ADA) price with a make-or-break moment. If the price can breach this level, ADA bulls could gain the upper hand. If the bulls fail, there could be a retest of support at $0.373 and subsequently the 100-day EMA at $0.348. New Cardano Stablecoin To Drive Price Above Resistance? In addition to a boost from macroeconomic events and the broader financial markets, ADA investors can also hope for a Cardano network-intrinsic reason for a rally such as the overcollateralized stablecoin Djed launched on the mainnet on Tuesday. Related Reading: Cardano’s Aggressive Development Activity Will Withstand Bear Assault At $0.3? A whopping 1.85 million DJED were minted since the launch. However, growth has remained modest for now. While Djed’s TVL was $10.35 million according to DefiLlama’s data, it has since increased only slightly to $11.67 million. The basic principle of the Djed stablecoin is to use the volatile value of ADA to create a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the USD. This makes ADA a kind of reserve currency. Since Djed is an overcollateralized stablecoin with a reserve ratio of 400%-800%, it theoretically has the potential to create a considerable shortage in the supply of ADA and thus influence the price. The stablecoin currently has a reserve ratio of 633%, which means that each DJED is backed by more than six times its value in ADA. However, with currently 29.4 million ADA, Djed does not yet draw the large volume to have an impact on the price. In total, Cardano has a circulation supply of 34.6 billion ADA. Thus, it remains to be seen whether Djed can continue to grow and thus contribute to a supply shortage for ADA.

Still, the mood in the market is as positive as it was back then.  That's the message from funding rates, a mechanism that keeps the prices of bitcoin perpetual futures contracts in sync with the spot market price. When perpetual futures are trading above spot, the funding rate is positive and holders of bullish long, or buy, positions pay bearish shorts to keep their trade open. The opposite happens when perpetuals trade below the spot price.  Analysts track the funding rate to gauge the mood of leverage traders. The higher the funding rate, the more excited traders are about price prospects and the more willing to pay a premium to keep their upside bets open.  As of Thursday, the annualized bitcoin perpetual funding rates across major exchanges including Binance was 8.491%, the highest since Dec. 3, 2021, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  Back then, one bitcoin was priced around $57,000, or 2.5 times the current market rate of $23,400. The cryptocurrency set a record high of $69,000 in November 2021.  The funding rate flipped positive in mid-December last year, indicating seller exhaustion. The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at the turn of the year and has rallied over 40% since then.  ""There has been a clear shift in market sentiment post-[December) CPI with funding rates well into positive territory and price volatility on the rise,"" Dessislava Laneva, a research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said in a tweet referring to the U.S. consumer price index.  The CPI fell to 6.5% in December, the sixth straight monthly deceleration in price increases. The data convinced markets that the Federal Reserve was likely to pivot to liquidity-boosting interest rate cuts later this year.  Early this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the inflation picture and downplayed concerns of a severe tightening-induced economic slowdown, bolstering the pivot hopes.  Focus on US nonfarm payrolls  The U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC is likely to show the world's biggest economy added 185,000 jobs in January following December's 223,000 increase, according to Reuters estimates sourced from FXStreet.  The unemployment rate is forecast to tick slightly higher to 3.6% in January, while average hourly earnings, or wage growth, is expected to print at 4.9% year on year following December's 4.6% rise.

42421939,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQSAm,1675417477,Bankman-Fried Family Subpoenas Opposed by US Government in FTX Filing,"Proposals for FTX and a committee of its creditors to subpoena founder Sam Bankman-Fried, his immediate family and senior staff of the bankrupt crypto exchange have been opposed by the U.S. Trustee, a branch of the Department of Justice dealing with bankruptcy.  The plans, set to be discussed at a Wednesday hearing, would duplicate any independent examination of the exchange’s downfall, U.S. Trustee Andrew Vara said in a legal filing made Thursday. An independent examiner has yet to be appointed. The examiner issue will be discussed at a Monday hearing, with new FTX Chief Executive Officer John Ray set to give testimony.  “If the Court directs the appointment of an examiner, then his or her charge could be to investigate the same web of entities and transactions” as the proposed requests for information, Vara said. “The bankruptcy court has an obligation to prevent unnecessary expenditures in the administration of an estate.”  FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, and Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO the same day, to be replaced by restructuring expert Ray. In a Jan. 25 filing, FTX's new management said Bankman-Fried, his brother Gabriel and his parents could potentially have valuable information about what happened to funds allegedly misappropriated from the company before its collapse.  Potentially key witnesses are not cooperating, FTX said, adding that co-founder Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, head of FTX's trading arm Alameda Research, expressly declined to provide requested information.  The U.S. Trustee also opposed a bid to seek information from those who might know about a more than $300 million hack and subsequent laundering of digital assets that took place on Nov. 11-12, whose alleged identities have been redacted from court documents.  A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has been among those calling for an independent examiner into the FTX affair rather than letting the company do its own probe. In the parallel case of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, examiner Shoba Pillay produced her report last Tuesday. In a Feb. 1 filing, Vara argued appointing an examiner for FTX was effectively required by law given the sums at stake.

42421957,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQS2S,1675410603,India Reveals IMF Is Working With G-20 for Crypto Regulations,"For the first time since taking over the G-20 presidency, India has officially revealed details of the ongoing work around how to regulate crypto.  IMF is working on a paper in consultation with India that will focus on ""aspects of the monetary policy and the policy approach to crypto assets,"" said Ajay Seth, secretary, Department of Economic Affairs.  Seth also revealed the IMF had led a meeting with representatives of developing economies about the paper in January. The details confirmed CoinDesk's earlier reporting around the IMF's role in the G-20's crypto-related discussions.  ""There's going to be a 135-minute seminar on crypto assets on the policy response (during a G-20 meeting later this month) and for that again the IMF is preparing the finalized paper that will form the base,"" he added.  India assumed the presidency of the Group of 20 – the intergovernmental forum of the world’s 20 largest economies including the European Union as a bloc – on Dec. 1, giving it the responsibility of shaping the group’s agenda. On the eve of taking over the presidency, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said regulating crypto assets will be a priority.  Sitharaman reiterated this on Friday, saying, ""We are also looking at a global SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) to be available to be agreed upon for regulating crypto assets"" for the meeting later this month that will see G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors come together.  ""Whilst recognizing the central bank as the authority for issuing crypto currency, the rest of the assets which are being created outside which are using very useful financial technologies, even those will have to be discussed because regulation cannot be done by any one country singularly, it has to be a collective action because technology doesn’t group any borders,"" Sitharaman added.  India's position on whether crypto is legal or not has been completely clear since it imposed stiff taxes in 2022 but didn't declare crypto as being legal.  “I don’t wait till regulation comes into place for taxing people who are earning profits,” the Indian Finance Minister said when asked how a nation can tax something that it doesn’t acknowledge is legal.  ""The question of legality will come only if something is declared illegal. Crypto assets are not illegal in this country,"" Seth explained, becoming the second official to give clarity on the matter.  India's draft bill for crypto regulation has been in cold storage because the government wanted global consensus first.  ""We had prepared a bill (which) went through internal discussions. Thereafter there was a consensus that we have to deal with it at the global level,"" Seth said.  In terms of next steps for India in shaping global crypto policy, the plan is to take the progress of the IMF paper from consensus at the G-20 to the crypto assets working group of the Financial Stability Board and then ""all countries put together"" because crypto is an asset class that can be traded across the board and thus ""it requires all countries"" to accept the policy, Seth said.

According to a notification from Apple received from Apple, the Cyberspace Administration of China deemed the app “includes content that is illegal in China” because its an “Information Services with Attribute of Public Opinions or Capable of Social Mobilization.”  Damus, the app, lives on top of Nostr, a decentralized social network that bills itself as “censorship resistant.” Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is backing the development of Nostr with a donation of 14 BTC (worth $245,000 at the time of donation).  Even getting Damus listed in Apple’s global App Store proved difficult for the company, as its decentralized nature means there is no moderation of content. The app was rejected multiple times by Apple, according to tweets by Damus, because Apple requires apps to have a mechanism for users to flag objectionable content and block abusive users.  In China, any online platform listed in an online marketplace or accessible by users in-country requires an Internet Content Provider (ICP) license.  As part of the rules, ICP-licensed entities are prohibited from publishing content that “opposes the basic principles determined in the constitution of China”, “damages the honor and interests of the nation”, and “disseminates rumors, disrupts the social order or undermines the social stability,” amongst other things.  The inclusion of support for the Bitcoin Lightning Network is another reason why authorities don’t look kindly on the project because crypto is banned within the country.  ICP-licensed entities are also required to maintain real-name information and IP addresses of those posting and producing content, while providing them to authorities upon request.  In addition, China has a ban on foreign investment in any internet news information service.  Will this change anything?  Despite China’s ""great firewall,"" there are hundreds of thousands of people who reside in the country active on Western social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter thanks to the wide availability of Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.  Members of the crypto community based in China who spoke to CoinDesk say the impact of this ban won’t make much of an impact because many Chinese use VPNs and have their phone’s App Store set to the U.S. or Hong Kong marketplaces.  Part of Damus’ popularity, according to one person, involves the perception that a sort of airdrop is coming to early users, especially those who sign up a lot of new users via their referral code.

The move was announced in August 2022, around three months after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's new government took over from the previous labor administration under Scott Morrison. The new government said at that time it would be taking a ""more serious approach to work out what is in the ecosystem and what risks need to be looked at first.""  ""Token mapping is the process of identifying the key activities and functions of products in the crypto ecosystem and mapping them against existing regulatory frameworks,"" the paper said.  Australia has been in damage control mode ever since the crypto contagion of 2022, which was exacerbated by the FTX exchange collapse. The authorities have been clamping down on several companies after having missed acting on its own concerns around Sam Bankman-Fried's company. In December it moved to tighten safety around crypto announcing it would establish a framework for the licensing and regulation of crypto service providers in 2023.  “Australia’s token mapping exercise is the first of its kind by a national government, going back to first principles to understand crypto and map it to an existing regulatory framework,"" said Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs and former regulator at the Monetary Authority of Singapore. However, the biggest question was how Australia would tackle Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Ang added.  The token mapping consultation paper also revealed it's plans around crypto regulation.  The plan is to ""release a (separate) consultation paper proposing a licensing and custody framework for crypto asset service providers in mid-2023"" because ""after token mapping, licensing and custody reforms are the logical next step for crypto reforms in Australia.""  The purpose of this consultation paper would be to identify appropriate obligations and operational standards for crypto asset service providers and how they safe-keep assets for customers.  The government will seek feedback for the crypto asset consultation paper to be released in mid-2023 around the role of government in regulation of the crypto eco-system, potential safeguards for investors, and how to prevent scams.

This suit comes after a series of investigative reports by YouTube journalist ""CoffeeZilla"" who outlined in a three-part series why he believed the project was fraudulent.  Counsel for the plaintiff alleges that Paul and his associates executed a “rug pull,” a term in Web3 where a crypto developer solicits token or NFT purchasers by promising certain benefits, but the project never materializes or the developers abandon the project shortly after launch and abscond with the purchaser’s funds.  ""As part of Defendants’ NFT scheme, Defendants marketed CryptoZoo NFTs to purchasers by falsely claiming that, in exchange for transferring cryptocurrency to purchase the CryptoZooNFT, purchasers would later receive benefits, including, among other things, rewards, exclusive access to other cryptocurrency assets, and the support of an online ecosystem to use and market CryptoZoo NFTs,"" the filing reads.  Instead, the suit alleges, the defendants transferred millions of dollars of crypto into wallets controlled by the defendants.  Plaintiffs allege that Paul and his associates engaged in fraud because they knew that the game was non-functional and had an obligation to disclose their “material failures” to purchasers.  Additionally, the plaintiffs, among other things, allege that Paul and associates engaged in fraudulent representation, a conspiracy to commit fraud, violated Texas’ Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and engaged in unjust enrichment.  “The wrong done to Plaintiff by Defendants was attended by fraudulent, malicious, intentional, willful, wanton, or reckless conduct that evidenced a conscious disregard for Plaintiff’s rights. Therefore, Plaintiff seeks punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial,” the filing reads.

Prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried has been in touch with current and former employees of FTX as well as Alameda. Bankman-Fried has been in touch with Ryne Miller, the current general counsel to FTX US, which prosecutors allege was an attempt to influence future witness testimony.  “I would really love to reconnect and see if there’s a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other,” Bankman-Fried wrote in an email to Miller, according to a previous Department of Justice filing.  Bankman-Fried is also said to have reached out to new FTX CEO John Ray to “offer assistance.”  On Feb. 1, a judge modified Bankman-Fried’s bail conditions to prohibit him from contacting former or current employees of Alameda Research or FTX. He is also banned from using encrypted chat apps like Signal.  Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s counsel, said the former executive needed to be in touch with the former employees – including the company’s in-house therapist George Lerner – as they are an “important source of personal support.”  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have also asked the court to remove the bail condition that prohibits him from accessing and transferring his crypto assets held by FTX.  The court has also allowed the names of the currently unidentified people who co-signed Bankman-Fried’s $250 million bail bond to be made public, after the next hearing regarding bail. CoinDesk was among the media companies that filed suit to get these names unsealed.  ""The public has a clear and powerful interest in who these allies may be,"" the law firm Klaris made on behalf of CoinDesk. ""The risk of illegitimacy and public scandal cannot be evaluated without knowing who Bankman-Fried’s guarantors are.""

Bitcoin was recently trading just above $23,500, down 1.8% over the past 24 hours but still well above last week's support near $23,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market value has risen about 40% this year amid investors' growing optimism about inflation and the economy. The Federal Reserve's 25 basis point (bps) increase bolstered markets' sense that bankers were succeeding in their quest to staunch stubbornly high prices.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment manager 3iQ, said that despite its recent gains bitcoin was still trading below its 200-day moving average.  ""We believe that as we get nearer [to the 200-day average] – which is a huge fundamental catalysts for bitcoin, and we have no reason to believe it won't be again – that [bitcoin] will see an even further move higher,"" Connors said.  Connors comments dovetailed with a CoinDesk report that bitcoin and the S&P 500 were approaching an easy-to-track bullish technical signal – a golden cross. A golden cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the security's price moves above its 200-day SMA, producing a cross on the price chart  Ether fared similarly on the day, dipping late to also fall 1.8% from Wednesday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands near $1,650. Other major cryptos declined late in the day to flatten or also drop into negative territory. APT, the token of layer 1 blockchain Aptos, plunged 6.5% to lose some of the ground it has gained this year. APT rose more than any other token in January. GALA, the token of the Gala Games play-to-earn platform declined 5%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's performance, was recently down 1.8%.  Equity markets enjoyed a banner day with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 rising 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively as investors' hopes about inflation outweighed their concerns about disappointing fourth-quarter results on Thursday from Apple and Alphabet and a wider slowdown in the once fearsome technology sector. ""Financial markets believe inflation will decline more quickly than the Fed is currently thinking,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.  3iQ's Connors noted increasing interest recently in 3iQ's crypto exchange traded funds, part of larger wave when investors poured more than $200 million into these types of products in January, according to crypto data provider group Crypto Compare.  ""We had more smiles,"" Connors quipped. ""We had to bring in some new coins to satisfy inflows. That was good. And it wasn't kind of crazy numbers. It was it was a nice healthy number.""  Connors added that current growth is sustainable. ""I think the [price] entry point is so good. If people are buying, they're the type of people who really want in. So there's not FOMO going on right now even though we're up. I really like this layer of buyer coming in here because they've done the work, they've shaken off the FTX debacle as a bad actor, a fraud.""

The miner said in a release on Thursday that the decision was made to cover some of its expenses. ""With bitcoin production increasing and becoming more consistent, we made the strategic decision to sell some of our bitcoin, as previously planned, to cover some of our operating expenses and for general corporate purposes,"" Marathon Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel said in a statement. The company still holds about 11,418 bitcoin in its reserve.  The move bring the miner's strategy inline with some of its peers, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), which started selling some of its mined bitcoin last year. Marathon was among few remaining miners who continued to hold onto its mined bitcoin, even after indicating that it may sell at some point. The decision likely came after the price of bitcoin rose about 40% in January. The miner intends to continue to sell some of its mined bitcoin this year, to fund its monthly operating costs, according to the statement.  The miner had an operating hashrate or computing power of 11 exahash per second (EH/s) in January and plans to reach 23 EH/s near the middle of 2023, the statement said. Bitcoin network's hashrate is currently around 282.55 EH/s, implying Marathon has about 4% of the global computing power.  Marathon said it mined a record 687 bitcoin, which is up 45% from December. ""The improvement in our bitcoin production was primarily a result of our team’s ability to work in tandem with the new hosting provider in McCamey, Texas, to address the maintenance and technical issues at the King Mountain data center that had suppressed our bitcoin production in the fourth quarter of 2022,"" Thiel said.  The shares of the miner rose on Thursday with the broader market. However, the shares fell about 4% in after-market trading as bitcoin lost some of its momentum from the earlier rally.

8694230,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574872-bitcoin-new-war-beginning?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1675383706,Bitcoin: A New War Is Beginning,"Summary A new NFT project called Ordinals was just launched that utilizes Bitcoin's block space. This project is very controversial within the Bitcoin community and in some ways harkens back to the block war from several years ago. In my view, this new civil war within the BTC community is probably going to be fought through transaction fees. This will ultimately be very bullish for BTC miners in my opinion, but it does potentially create problems down the line. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could be heading for another civil war. It would not be the first time the Bitcoin community has engaged in an internal conflict, but this one could be just as impactful. In many ways, what has given the idea of Bitcoin credence is the faith that it is a monetary system without censors or permission for usage. But every few years the Bitcoin community faces an internal challenge and I believe we now have a new one that could ultimately turn into a much deeper conversation about what Bitcoin is and what its future is going to look like. In this article, we'll dive into what Ordinals is, why Ordinals exists, why Ordinals is controversial for Bitcoiners, and we'll assess what impact a battle over Ordinals could have on the price of Bitcoin down the line. What is Ordinals? Simply put, Ordinals is an NFT project on Bitcoin. It works by creating a numbering system for each satoshi that is mined when new blocks are created. A satoshi, or sat, is the smallest unit of division of a full Bitcoin. Each one is worth a fraction of a penny at $24K BTC. These sat identifiers make it so that some sats have more unique or rare numerical properties than others - you can probably think of it in the same way that paper dollar bills can be collectible based on rare serial numbers. Through Ordinals, Bitcoin's block space is now being used to create NFTs through inscription on this new satoshi numbering system. Ordinals was created by Casey Rodarmor, a software developer who saw a need for NFTs that are stored on blockchains themselves rather than off-chain. Casey explained that problem well in his blog post about inscription with the Ordinals project: For an NFT to be a digital artifact, it must be decentralized, immutable, on-chain, and unrestricted. The vast majority of NFTs are not digital artifacts. Their content is stored off-chain and can be lost, they are on centralized chains, and they have back-door admin keys. This is a legitimate concern , and it is something that I've explored as well in Blockchain Reaction. While I believe there is a perfectly viable solution to the off-chain data problem that doesn't necessitate Bitcoin's block space being utilized for monkey jpegs, I'm not actually opposed to Bitcoin being adopted in other ways that are bit more interesting than just ""stack sats and hope the price goes up."" Some Important Bitcoin Voices Don't Like This Ordinals has created a debate in the Bitcoin community over how the chain's block space should be utilized and which type of transactions have merit. For the purists, Ordinals is essentially sacrilege and against what Bitcoin's founder Satoshi Nakamoto would have wanted. There is some merit to that argument. Back in late 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto was not on board with an idea to create a DNS-like service through Bitcoin because of the scalability problems that would come with trying to pile too much data into a small block space. This is what Nakamoto said in the Bitcoin Talk forum at that time: Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately. Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other. BitDNS users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either. The thinking that Bitcoin should be protected from the potential spamming of the block space has even led to some Bitcoin developers entertaining the idea that miners could censor transactions related to Ordinals; which would be a very big deal if it were to happen as it could be argued that censoring what happens on the chain is very much against the original ethos of Bitcoin. But if it were to actually happen, censoring transactions on-chain wouldn't be the first time Bitcoin has failed to live up to the original intention. The Last Civil War The original goal of Bitcoin was to be a peer-to-peer payment network and that has simply not been the case. In fact, it could be argued that the HODL approach to Bitcoin actually goes against developing true utility through usage. In my view, a big reason why some in the Bitcoin community have adopted a HODL approach to Bitcoin is precisely because using the network for peer to peer transactions at the base layer is not actually feasible at scale. This is why the ""Bitcoin is digital Gold"" narrative overtook the ""Bitcoin is digital cash"" narrative. Bitcoin's inability to scale at the base layer is why the Lightning Network exists. And the scaling problem is also why Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) exists. BCH is the product of the last Bitcoin civil war several years ago that consisted of two camps; ""big blockers"" and ""small blockers."" When BTC was originally constructed, there was a 1 megabyte block size limit at launch. This is very small and only allows about 7 transactions per second on the base layer chain. In the years leading up to the 2016 halving, there was discussion among the core developers about increasing the block size from 1 MB to 20 MB. This move was contested and the ""small blockers"" ultimately won out. The ""big blockers"" hard forked BTC and created BCH, a chain with a block size limit of 8 MB. And that gets us to the possibility of another Bitcoin fork. Is Ordinals a controversial enough topic that it could lead to Bitcoin forking yet again? I don't think that I'd go that far yet. But this argument over block space could conceivably escalate in a different way. A Fee War is More Likely When a user wants to create an Ordinals NFT, they have to pay a higher transaction fee to inscribe the data in a Bitcoin block. If Ordinals is successful, we're going to see an increase in the transaction fees that are paid to Bitcoin miners. Those fees are generally a very low percentage of the total block reward but we are starting to see that percent tick up since Ordinals was launched in late January: Transaction fees as % of BTC Block Reward (Hashrate Index) If the Bitcoiners who don't like the Ordinals project want to stop what they view as network spam with a true free market solution, they're going to have to start using the base layer chain more and be willing to pay transaction fees that are large enough to incentivize miners choosing their transactions as the priority. The risk to a fee war would be transaction fees that become so onerous that only very large value transactions can happen on the chain. Which could theoretically disincentive opening Lightning Network channels enough that it actually slows adoption of the chain's scaling layer. Main Takeaways I don't think Ordinals is a flash in the pan. We saw what the NFT craze in 2021 did to Ethereum's (ETH-USD) transaction fees: ETH Native Unit Transaction Fees (Messari) Ordinals is at the beginning of what it will become and we're already seeing NFTs globally starting to catch a bid again. Unlike the past bull market in NFTs, Bitcoin won't sit this one out. Ordinals is now a major point of conversation within the Bitcoin community. How the opponents of that block space usage deal with it is yet to be seen. But if there is a competition brewing for block space, fees are likely going to have to increase considerably. This will be very good for Bitcoin miners and probably Bitcoin's nominal dollar price as well. It just might not be great for actually using Bitcoin for payments. But the HODLers don't seem to be using it for that anyway.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574872-bitcoin-new-war-beginning?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8694230.jpeg
