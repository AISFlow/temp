42399362,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixfV,1474652830,Global Banks Partner to Form Blockchain Payments Network,"Bank of America, Santander and the Royal Bank of Canada have today announced they’ve joined forces to create a global blockchain payments network using Ripple’s distributed ledger technology.  UniCredit, Standard Chartered and the Westpac Banking Corporation have also joined the effort, which seeks to form the foundation of a global network that performs a similar service as SWIFT inter-bank messaging but with near-instant settlement times. Canadian bank CIBC is also participating.  Fundamental to the Global Payments Steering Group’s early mission is the creation and maintenance of a payments transaction rulebook and formalized standards that they intend to then take to international standards-making bodies.  Marcus Treacher, Ripple’s newly hired global head of strategic accounts, told CoinDesk in an interview:  ""The messaging today across borders is Swift. The de facto way everyone moves money through countries is Swift. That’s what we think we can do better with Ripple.""  Treacher invoked cross-border payments solutions like the one Santander announced in May, in which bank employees could issue payments between banks using Ripple's network.  The news closely follows the announcement that the firm had raised $55m earlier this month to expand its existing projects. Ripple has raised more than $90m in venture capital to date.  The backbone  Right now, the banks involved are focused on hammering out the rules of play, according to Treacher.  The first step is a standardized agreement that establishes the terms and conditions which a bank must agree to in order to join, detailing how transactions will be processed and what kinds of information will be exchanged.  The second step involves creating a “functional standards document” that will allow the various banks to interact across currencies and jurisdictions. First on the GPSG’s list of priorities is to develop these foundations, followed by creating administrative services to assist the banks.  Previously, Ripple handed over management of its Interledger protocol to the Internet standards body, W3C, and Treacher says his company would like to do something similar to replace the ISO's current 20022 payments standards for messaging.  The banks involved say they see the development of network standards as a key goal for advancing the technology.  ""As ever, the devil is in the details,"" said Julio Faura, head of research and development at Santander, in a statement. ""We are joining the GPSG in order to contribute to the definition of the standards and processes which the industry now needs in order to move ahead and build better payments networks.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

42399370,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixjR,1474644055,Swiss Financial Infrastructure Firm Testing Blockchain,"A major financial infrastructure provider in Switzerland has partnered with blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings to build a proof-of-concept focused on securities market infrastructure.  SIX Securities Services and Digital Asset will create a “roadmap” for how the technology can be applied across the entire securities life-cycle.  Distributed ledger technology is “key” to the future of SIX Securities’ post-trading business, according to Division CEO Thomas Zeeb:  Zeeb said in a statement:  ""We need to understand it, and more importantly, its applicability and future flexibility in order to keep ahead of the game. Partnering with Digital Asset is a way to accelerate our own development plans and leverage their experience in this area.""  The project aims to demonstrate how to build and incorporate distributed, encrypted, straight-through processing tools into existing securities transaction flows. Following the completion of the roadmap, the companies plan to move to create a production-ready service.  SIX Securities is part of a wider set of services which play a foundational role in the infrastructure for Switzerland's financial sector, including its primary stock exchange and post-trade settlement services.  Last year, SIX Securities conducted 409m settlement transactions and 31m settlement transactions, for a total volume of 3.1t Swiss Francs ($3.17t), according to its annual report. The company generated about $43m in profit during that time.  Founded in 2008 as a result of the merger of SWX Group, Telecurse Group, and the SIX Group, the company also offers exchange services, financial data and is a card payment processor in Switzerland, Austria and Luxembourg.  Later this month in Geneva, the firm will showcase an early distributed ledger prototype at the Sibos conference.

42399351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixXd,1474624861,World's Largest Mining Company to Use Blockchain for Supply Chain,"The world's largest mining firm by market value intends to begin using the ethereum blockchain to improve its supply chain processes.  BHP Billiton  revealed at the second annual Global Blockchain Summit that it will use blockchain to record movements of wellbore rock and fluid samples and better secure the real-time data that is generated during delivery. According to BHP geophysicist R Tyler Smith, the new system will enable benefits for its internal efficiency while allowing it to work more effectively with partners.  Smith explained that BHP relies on vendors at nearly every stage in the mining process, contracting with geologists and shipping companies to collect samples and conduct analyses that drive business decisions that occur with parties distributed across continents.  ""With blockchain, we would share data between the vendor and ourselves, and have a constant understanding of where it is,"" Smith told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Everything right now is being tracked through spreadsheets.""  Smith explained that, with the help of a solution developed by blockchain startups BlockApps and Consensys, BHP intends to begin requiring that its vendors use the technology to collect live data this year.  While introducing a new technology to an existing operation may seem risky, Smith said he's confident in the user experience the app will provide.  ""The web application is designed for the vendor. The vendor will see a dashboard and options on what to do that are very streamlined to their job,"" Smith said.  More broadly, Smith noted that the UK and Australia-based mining firm is distributed globally, and that because of this, he foresees more ways that its internal entities could use blockchain for more enhanced data sharing.  In addition working with ethereum, BHP is also running its own nodes on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that is increasingly being used in conjunction with blockchain systems.  Smith added: ""We are looking at lots of different use cases.""  As ranked  by ‘Big Four’ accounting firm PwC in June of this year, BHP Billiton was the largest mining firm by market capitalization for 2015 and 2014.  Proving provenance  Far from using blockchain as a form of currency, BHP’s solution envisions how its existing processes could be replicated on a blockchain as a way to prove benefits of the technology.  Smith said that the use case proves blockchain solutions can achieve decentralized file storage, multi-party data acquisition and immutability, all aspects that he believes will enhance the supply chain.  For example, the location of the well, he said, cannot be edited, but other aspects can be updated with new metadata to reflect relevant information, and that data that will also be immediately accessible.  Under the hood, the blockchain won't be moving between addresses, but rather changing its state, updating data fields by logging in with a standard username and password.  While certain elements of the system are the same, he said that overall the platform provides new efficiencies.  ""The data is more transparent, we can see where the analysis was provided by a vendor or ask if we need to do more robust analysis,"" Smith said.  Moving to production  The product launch is also a milestone for BlockApps, the blockchain startup that built the BHP solution and that recently closed a pre-Series A funding round that value of which was not disclosed.  Kieren James-Lubin, founder of BlockApps, sees the collaboration with BHP as one that has significance for the broader blockchain space as it is ""not about value movement"".  ""There are so many financial use cases and this is one of the first instances where we’re using it for a non-financial scenario,"" he told CoinDesk.  James-Lubin said that the app also helped his startup learn more about the needs of enterprise institutions, helping it advance and iterate on a user experience that would be accessible to those who are less familiar with its inner-workings.  ""The requirements that we’ve surfaced have been a tremendous help to us in feeding back into the platform,"" he said, concluding:  ""Where the tech needs to go, the direction is increasingly that it is going to come from the enterprise.""

42399374,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixoM,1474604886,China's Financial Firms Urge Regulators to Help Mature Blockchain,"China's major financial institutions sent a clear message to innovators in the blockchain industry today, asserting that governance and oversight should not be replaced in any larger transitions to new financial technology.  Speaking at the second annual Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai, the Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH), the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation (CSDC) and the National Internet Finance Association’s Blockchain Research Task Force all discussed how they see the emergence of blockchain technology and its potential impact in China.  Leading the conversation was Lihui Li, of the blockchain research task force and the former director of Bank of China, who perhaps most forcefully struck this tone.  Lihui told the audience:  ""We see that centralization is not feature native to the blockchain… [but] decentralization is not a good choice. I think that the application of new technology in [the] financial industry should not be decentralized and ungoverned and deregulated.""  Elsewhere, CSDC's Dai Wenhua called for regulators to become involved in the industry as a way to prevent what he called its potential ""illegal applications"".  Notably, Dai cited incidents like the collapse of The DAO, the first large-scale ethereum smart contract, and the hack of major Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitfinex.  ""We know The DAO has been hacked and Bitfinex has lost some of its bitcoins, it has shown the loopholes in bitcoin technology, and that means new technologies will bring new risk,"" he said during his morning talk.  Overall, the representatives displayed an understanding of the technology equal to their peers international, with talks referencing technical bottlenecks that remain to be overcome by technologists.  Calls for collaboration  Like bank tech provider Sinodata in yesterday's talk, Li Ruiyong, vice general manager of Shanghai Clearing House, said his firm is eager to work with partners that could help them further this effort.  Li acknowledged that financial firms should not shy away from potential efficiencies, while also calling for increased study to be conducted on the technology.  ""Blockchain technology will have [a] great impact on the financial industry, and for our clearinghouse. It is important for us to research these new [opportunities],"" he said.  Li also noted the rising interest in the technology from his company’s peers, citing Nasdaq and the Depository Trust and Clearing Company (DTCC) as examples of how blockchain is being deployed for specific use cases already.  He added:  ""We can see it is playing an important role in the financial industry, but it cannot work alone even if we are going to build a brand new ecosystem.""

42399361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixeW,1474595748,Blockchain to Drive Wanxiang's $30 Billion Smart Cities Initiative,"Auto giant Wanxiang announced today that it will use blockchain technology as part of its newly announced smart cities initiative.  Revealed at the Wanxiang-sponsored Global Blockchain Summit, the company intends to invest ¥200bn ($30bn) over the next seven years into a project that will find it purchasing 83 million square feet of land in Hangzhou on which it will build a new development designed to promote technology innovations.  To better support this effort, Wanxiang is also seeking to fund blockchain entrepreneurs working on efforts that may be aligned with its objectives.  Wanxiang vice chairman and executive director Feng Xiao told CoinDesk:  ""We can't tackle all the use cases that might arise from the smart city project. That's why we're opening it up to use cases from all over the world.""  The move is the latest that finds Wanxiang emerging as one of the most aggressive enterprise firms in embracing blockchain technology.  In mid-2015, a Wanxiang-owned subsidiary purchased $500,000 worth of ether, the native cryptocurrency that powers the public ethereum blockchain, while its parent company launched Fenbushi Capital, a $50m venture fund focused on blockchain.  Though no government is involved in the Wanxiang smart cities project, the concept is similar to other efforts globally. Earlier this year, Dubai's government innovation arm revealed it is seeking to incorporate blockchain as part of its smart cities effort.  Representatives from Wanxiang said it is in talks with IBM and Microsoft on how they might support the effort.  Smart cars  While grand in scope, the announcement also included details about how Wanxiang might incorporate the technology into its main product lines. For example, Wanxiang is seeking to use blockchain as a way to cut the cost of its electric cars by using it to help confirm and enforce property rights.  ""We want to use blockchain to manage IoT, and use it help devices to interact with each other. Smart appliances can be managed with blockchain,"" Feng told attendees today.  Wanxiang, which owns US electric car maker Karma, announced earlier this summer it would build a $375m plant to produce battery-powered vehicles, and here, too, Feng said he sees applications for blockchain.  One example Feng said has strategic importance is using blockchain for battery tracking. Wanxiang intends to lend out the batteries to car buyers, while retaining ownership of the devices, as a way to reduce the upfront cost for purchasers.  In this instance, he said Wanxiang would register its batteries on a blockchain, and use a blockchain system to monitor their use.  ""We see the blockchain creating a way to track all the batteries through their lifecycle so we know when we can bring it back,"" he said. ""That way we can reduce the cost of our cars.""  Today, Wanxiang monitors and collects data from its batteries, but that the company believes blockchain might prove more effective. By ensuring data integrity, he said, better analysis might later be conducted.  Someday, Feng said, Wanxiang could not only improve its cash flow with blockchain, but create new financial products for this goal.  ""There could be a way for us to securitize the battery and make it into some sort of financial product, to sell it out to financial institutions in order to get more cash flow,"" he added.  Overall, he said he remains confident that the technology can meet its potential and help drive the larger smart cities initiative, concluding:  ""Even if you fail, the cost is minimal.""  Update: An earlier version incorrectly stated that Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, not Fenbushi Capital, received $50m to fund blockchain startups.

42399355,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixcY,1474592437,"IBM, China UnionPay Develop Blockchain Loyalty Points Exchange","IBM is working with a Chinese credit card company to to create a blockchain-based system for trading loyalty points.  In a proof-of-concept revealed today, IBM and China UnionPay have developed a platform that allows customers to trade points earned through purchases and other incentivized behavior with one another. It's a concept that can be applied to the exchange of frequent flyer miles, mobile phone bills or gas cards.  He Shuo, director of China UnionPay’s Electronic Payment Research Institute, described the demo in a statement as a ""breakthrough"" in the electronic payment industry.  Shuo said in a statement:  ""The joint research efforts between China UnionPay E-payment Institute and IBM Research has enabled the successful exchange of bonus points among banks using blockchain technology, which embeds trust into transactions.""  The prototype was built on a private network of the beta-version Hyperledger Fabric network, highlighting how banks can ensure that loyalty points are only exchanged between accepted partners.  Further, it is designed to integrate online and offline channels via blockchain, enabling China UnionPay cardholders to go to supermarkets and malls equipped with special point-of-service (POS) devices and exchange bonus points for goods.  The loyalty points network is being positioned as a way to attract new customers and encourage customer loyalty through increasing the kinds of rewards available, by opening up incentives between banks.
