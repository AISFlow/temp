The Washington Post reported Tuesday that this new organization would focus on both education and legal changes as part of an effort to normalize relations between crypto startups and lawmakers. Coinbase, Circle, Digital Currency Group, Polychain Capital and Protocol Labs are among the association's founding members.  One of the association's first employees is former Senate aide and Overstock.com blockchain lobbyist named Kristin Smith. She told the Post that she would ""guide"" the organization as it starts out, saying, ""I've been spending a lot of time doing a lot of the basic education work in this space ... I'm excited to focus exclusively on these issues.""  Further, Politico reported that Protocol Labs general counsel Marvin Ammori and Hangar founder Josh Mendelsohn will advise the group.  Coinbase chief legal and risk officer Mike Lempres told the Washington Post that the organization would bring companies together to advocate for reasonable regulation, saying:  ""The Blockchain Association is an effort to get the preeminent companies in the space together so [policymakers] know they're hearing from companies that welcome regulation when it's appropriate ... We're not companies looking to game the system, but trying to develop a legal and regulatory system that'll stand the test of time.""  The Blockchain Association will specifically focus on tax law and how know-your-customer/anti-money laundering rules relate to crypto exchanges and startups, at least at the beginning, according to the report.  Coin Center's executive director, Jerry Brito, told the Post that the think tank was ""happy to see this organization stand up.

Ivan Semagin, deputy director of the financial development department of the bank, told attendees of the forum that the regulator had tested conducting ""an experimental ICO based on the existing infrastructure"" in the Bank of Russia's sandbox.

""In the framework of the 'sandbox' ... technically everything went well, but there were a lot of issues from a legal point of view,"" he explained.  He did not explain what these legal concerns were.  The test was originally announced in May, when Russia's largest state-funded retail bank, Sberbank, together with Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD), said they were working on a test ICO. The experiment was expected to involve a company named Level One as an ICO issuer, Sberbank as the ""issuance coordinator and anchor investor"" and the NSD as the custodian, recording and settling transactions, as well as safeguarding the assets.  At the time, Sberbank senior vice president Igor Bulantsev said in a statement that ""many Sberbank clients are interested in this type of investment, and we plan to promote this service proactively once the appropriate legislative framework comes into effect; we will be one of the drivers to institutionalize and popularize this type of transaction.""

The securities regulator alleged that Crypto Asset Management LP (CAM) and its principal, Timothy Enneking, had marketed itself under false pretenses, alleging that Enneking raised more than $3 million in late 2017 and claimed that the company was ""the first regulated crypto asset fund in the United States.""  According to the SEC statement, Enneking and the company agreed to the SEC's cease-and-desist order and will pay a penalty of $200,000, without admitting or denying the agency's findings. Enneking didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Although this isn't the first time the SEC has issued cease-and-desist letters to companies operating in the crypto space, it is the first that found fault with registration statements made by a cryptocurrency investment company.  Separately, the SEC accused TokenLot LLC and its owners, Lenny Kugel, and Eli L. Lewitt, of acting as unregistered broker-dealers. The agency said that TokenLot – described as a kind of ""ICO Superstore"" – ""received orders from more than 6,100 retail investors and handled more than 200 different digital tokens, which the SEC found included securities.""  As in the case of CAM, Kugel, Lewitt and TokenLot didn't agree to or deny the SEC's findings, but agreed to pay $471,000 in disgorgement plus $7,929 in interest.  Lewitt and Kugel will also pay $45,000 each in penalties and ""agreed to industry and penny stock bars and an investment company prohibition with the right to reapply after three years.""  ""The penalties in this case reflect the prompt cooperation and remedial actions by TokenLot, Kugel, and Lewitt,"" Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said in a statement.  Notably, their deal with the SEC also states that they will find ""an independent third party to destroy TokenLot's remaining inventory of digital assets."" How this process will play out is unclear at this time.  Both the SEC orders referenced its 2017 DAO report, which paved the way for a series of SEC enforcement actions against alleged fraudsters in the ICO ecosystem. At the time, the agency said that securities law in the U.S. could apply to token sales.  Since then, senior officials at the SEC, including its chairman Jay Clayton, have made ICOs a significant priority for the agency.

42429638,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0S5h,1536683941,US Judge Rules ICO Frauds Fall Under Securities Law,"A U.S. federal judge has ruled that a criminal case against two reportedly fraudulent initial coin offerings fall under securities laws.  District judge Raymond Dearie ruled Tuesday that the case against a pair of allegedly fraudulent ICOs conducted by Brooklyn resident Maksim Zaslavskiy would proceed, denying the defendant's motion to dismiss. Bloomberg first reported the news.  As previously reported, Zaslavskiy has been accused of committing securities fraud for selling tokens which represented shares in a real estate venture and a separate diamond business.  However, prosecutors claim that neither of these ventures actually bought the assets customers were investing in.  In the motion, Zaslavskiy's lawyers argued that ""securities laws are unconstitutionally vague as applied"" to the indictment against the defendant.  However, Dearie wrote, ""Congress' purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called,"" citing a previous ruling.  He added:  ""Stripped of the 21st-century jargon, including the defendant's own characterization of the offered investment opportunities, the challenged indictment charges a straightforward scam, replete with the common characteristics of many financial frauds.""  As such, securities laws as they pertain to the indictment and charges against Zaslavskiy are not vague, Dearie ruled.  Notably, Dearie did not say whether ICOs are specifically securities, instead saying that this ""can only fairly be a question of proof at trial, based on all of the evdience presented to a jury.""  He added that ""Zaslavskiy's primary contention – that the investment scheme at issue did not constitute a security, as that term is defined under Howey, is undoubtedly a factual one.""  Howey test  The judge provided more detail on the how the Howey test – the U.S. standard for determining whether something is a security – might apply in Zaslavskiy's case, writing:  ""The question is whether the 'elements of a profit-seeking business venture' are sufficiently alleged in the indictment, such that, if proven at trial, a reasonable jury could conclude that 'investors provide[d] the capital and share[d] in the earnings and profits; [and] the promoters manage[d], control[ed] and operate[d] the enterprise.'""  ""For present purposes, we conclude that they are,"" he added.  That being said, an independent analysis of the Howey test as it may apply will be required for a final determination at trial.  Dearie echoed a previous decision he'd made in the case, when he first ruled that a jury would decide whether Zaslavskiy's token sales qualified as securities offerings. This past May, Zaslavskiy appeared for a hearing on the merits of his case.  While his attorneys argued that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cannot regulate token sales as securities, prosecutors said the point was moot as no tokens had ever been developed.

42381183,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Gf5,1536677965,Stellar Gets Another Boost With TokenSoft ICO Services Expansion,"ICO services platform TokenSoft is officially launching support for projects on the Stellar lumens protocol.  The company – which helps crypto startups navigate through legal compliance procedures in the U.S. and internationally – announced Tuesday that it would extend its offerings to include the Stellar platform, having previously assisted ethereum-based projects.  TokenSoft co-founder Mason Borda told CoinDesk that his company had been looking into Stellar since the first quarter of 2018, citing its level of ""maturity"" as the reason for accepting it to the platform.  ""We feel that [the Stellar network], the tool sets and the underlying infrastructure do provide the maturity for us to provide official support. We're excited to announce that if you want to receive payments for lumens, we can provide support,"" he said.  Having seen demand for Stellar in late 2017, Borda said the team was a "" little bit skeptical"" initially, since Stellar isn't known for enabling token issuance. However, he added:  ""We noticed that not only was there demand for Stellar, but also entrepreneurs and companies were beginning to use Stellar.""  This increased demand and adoption convinced the team that projects would continue to launch on Stellar, he said.  Indeed, TokenSoft has seen ""a steady stream"" of requests for assistance launching on the network since earlier in 2018, Borda continued, adding that ""we will see more and more of this in the coming months.""  He declined to name any specific projects that TokenSoft might be working with, but said he anticipates ICOs will begin in earnest over the next few months.  While Borda does not see TokenSoft expanding support to any other protocols just yet, he did note that TokenSoft's tools are not dependent on any particular blockchain.  ""We consider our tools and services to be sort of agnostic of what underlying blockchain these things launch on, and the reason is that regulations are consistent regardless of what blockchains or tool sets you're using, sort of underlying your product,"" he said.  The news comes as another boost for the Stellar project, after it was revealed Monday that blockchain startup Chain has been acquired in an undisclosed deal by Lightyear.io, a startup building on the Stellar protocol.  The deal see both firms combining to form a new venture called Interstellar, with Chain CEO Adam Ludwin to serve as Interstellar's CEO, and Jed McCaleb, the creator of the XRP and Stellar protocols, taking on the role of CTO.  Ludwin told CoinDesk at the time that Interstellar will not be involved in the Stellar lumens (XLM) market, adding:  ""It's about the platform layer to make the network as powerful and useful as possible for those organizations that want to leverage stellar,"" he continued.

Ayre allegedly sold unregistered securities in the form of the HempCoin token, which was said to represent an investment in his ""worthless"" company, Rocky Mountain Ayre (RMTN). FINRA announced the charges on Tuesday, adding that it filed a legal complaint against Ayre for misleading investors as well.  HempCoin was claimed to be ""the first minable coin backed by marketable securities,"" according to promotional materials tied to the token sale. Ayre also contended that HempCoin was ""the world's first currency to represent equity ownership."" However, the token was never registered as a security and Ayre failed to apply for an exemption, according to FINRA.  Ayre first acquired the rights for HempCoin in June 2015. Investors mined or traded the token on two different cryptocurrency exchanges through October 2017, the FINRA's statement claims. The company's common stock was also traded publicly in an over-the-counter (OTC) market.  ""In addition, FINRA alleges that, from January 2013 through October 2016, Ayre defrauded investors in RMTN by making materially false statements and omissions regarding the nature of RMTN's business, failing to disclose his creation and unlawful distribution of HempCoin, and making multiple false and misleading statements in RMTN's financial statements,"" FINRA added in its statement.  Ayre has the chance to defend himself in front of a disciplinary panel if he chooses to respond to the claims. If he is found guilty, he may be fined, censured, suspended or permanently barred from the securities industry, as well as forced to pay restitution for damages.  Though Tuesday's announcement marks the first time FINRA has taken action against a cryptocurrency broker, the SRO said earlier this year that it would begin collecting information about such activities from its members.

At press time, the price of XRP is $0.26, according to CoinDesk's Market Center.  In Ripple's counter case at the Supreme Court in California, the firm claimed that the two had agreed a deal for a joint commercial venture, alleging R3 had not stuck to its end of the bargain.

42381177,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94GYn,1536669053,Major French Soccer Club Plans to Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency,"Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), a major French soccer team in the country's top league, is planning to issue its own cryptocurrency as a way to incentivize participation from its fans around the world.  PSG, which boasts prominent players including Brazil star Neymar, announced a multi-year partnership on Tuesday with a Malta-based blockchain startup called Socios that will tackle on the technology for the so-called Fan Token Offering.  According to a French news site, PSG is now eyeing a deadline of spring 2019 to start issuing its proprietary tokens, making it potentially one of the first soccer clubs anywhere to do so.  Rather than a monetary role for PSG's coin however, the goal is to allow fans who hold the token to be able to vote for and decide on less strategic matters, such as team jersey choices or opponents in friendly matches, the report said.  Token ownership will further give fans access to more exclusive offers such as meeting with players or participating in certain matches, the report added.  By adopting blockchain as the underlying technology for the issuance, PSG said the hope is to make the polling process more secure and transparent, with transactions being publicly visible.  PSG's chief partnership officer Marc Armstrong commented in the announcement:  ""Paris Saint-Germain is determined to leverage the opportunities that cryptocurrency can provide. This revolutionary technology will have an important impact on the club's overall business strategy and the way we engage with our fanbase.""  With the news, PSG follows other European soccer clubs into embracing the idea of blockchain and cryptocurrency.  CoinDesk reported last month that seven major clubs in the U.K.'s Premier League including Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, and Leicester City inked a deal with online investment firm eToro to allow sponsorship payments in bitcoin.  And, in August, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) said it had completed a ""successful"" trial of a blockchain-based ticketing application for a match between two top Spanish clubs.

42381182,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94GcZ,1536663616,Bitcoin Price Awaits Next Move as Trading Range Narrows,"Bitcoin (BTC) is being squeezed into a tight trading range with neither bulls nor bears having the upper hand, and a decisive move either way will likely set the tone for the next trend going forward.  The $1,000 drop witnessed during a 24-hour period in the middle of the last week turned the tide in favor of the bears. As a result, the cryptocurrency was facing a risk of a drop to $6,000 over the weekend.  Despite expectations, the sell-off unexpectedly ran out of steam at a low of $6,119 on Saturday. More importantly, the cryptocurrency has printed higher price lows in the last four days, signaling bearish exhaustion.  Meanwhile, the bulls have not been exercising their buying power either, as indicated by the lower price highs around $6,400. So, it seems that the investor community is evenly split on the immediate prospects for the bitcoin market, leaving the cryptocurrency directionless.  That said, the direction of the range breakout will likely play a big role in determining the short-term price trend.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,320 on Bitfinex, representing a 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Hourly chart        Looking at the hourly chart, BTC is being squeezed between the two lines representing lower highs and higher lows. In technical parlance, this narrowing price range is referred to as the ""symmetrical triangle"".  A downside break of the range would add credence to the bearish pennant breakdown seen in the line chart and the rising wedge breakdown seen in the candlestick chart, with prices potentially dropping below $6,000 (February low).  On the other hand, an upside break of the symmetrical triangle could allow a stronger corrective rally towards the 10-day moving average (MA), currently located at $6,660.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The bears are also boosted by a rising wedge breakdown seen on Sep. 5.  While either side could gain the upper hand going forward, prices are more likely to see a downside break of the symmetrical triangle, the hourly chart suggests.  View  The next violation of the narrowing price range on the hourly chart will likely set the tone for the next move in BTC.  A break below $6,260 (lower end of the symmetrical triangle) would bolster the already bearish technical setup and open up downside towards $6,000 (February low).  A move above $6,375 (upper edge of the triangle) would allow a corrective rally to the 10-day MA of $6,660, though the sustainability of gains is under question.

42381180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Gdp,1536658255,IMF Advises Against Crypto as Legal Tender in Marshall Islands Report,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised against the Republic of the Marshall Islands' plan to introduce a digital currency as a second legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.  The Marshall Islands – a remote chain of islands in the central Pacific – passed a law on the issue in February, aiming for the planned ""Sovereign"" cryptocurrency to boost the local economy and counter the increasing risks of the nation becoming disconnected from the global financial system.  However, following a period of consultation with officials from the islands, the IMF published a paper on Monday advising against the move. According to the paper, the Marshall Islands economy is now ""highly dependent"" on external aid, as the country faces constant climate change and natural disasters.  The only domestic commercial bank in the country is now ""at risk of losing its last U.S. dollar correspondent banking relationship (CBR) with a U.S.-based bank,"" due to tightened due diligence across financial institutions in the U.S.  The IMF argued that the introduction of a cryptocurrency as legal tender may backfire, if a lack of comprehensive anti-money laundering measures eventually leads to the U.S. bank cutting ties with the country.  The IMF continued:  ""In the absence of adequate risk mitigating measures, the issuance of a decentralized digital currency as a second legal tender would not only increase macroeconomic and financial integrity risks but elevate the risk of losing the last U.S. dollar CBR.""  Should that happen, ""external aid and other flows could be disrupted, which would result in a significant drag on the economy,"" it argued.  While the IMF is specifically advising in this case on the social and monetary systems in the Marshall Islands, it perhaps offers a window into the thinking of the global monetary organization on whether cryptocurrencies should be elevated to the status of legal tender in the traditional financial system.  The paper also follows recent remarks made by IMF officials who argued that the rapid growth of crypto assets poses a threat to the demand for fiat currencies.  As such, they argued that central banks should raise their game, adopting desirable features of cryptocurrencies to better compete with the nascent technology – a move described as ""fight fire with fire"" by the IMF chief Christine Lagarde.

42381172,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94GSV,1536652808,Ethereum's ASIC Rebellion Heats Up With New Effort to Brick Big Miners,"""When mining ether won't pay for power anymore, what will you do?""  The question – posed on an ethereum forum Thursday – is emblematic of a growing anxiety among the miners who today dedicate both computing power and machinery to securing the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.  Grappling with the emergence of ethereum ASICs, or specialized mining hardware built to maximize the software's rewards, the forum features no shortage of miners stating their intention to move their kits to other cryptocurrencies.  ""What is the ether value when all the miners quit?"" another post asks.  The statements come in advance of an ethereum software upgrade scheduled for October. Dubbed Constantinople, the change, to be conducted via a hard fork, is set to reduce the amount of coins paid out to miners from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block, as currently coded by developers.  While that won't necessarily break the bank of miners, the changes could add up quick. According to figures from Etherscan, about 6,000 blocks are currently found per day, with about 17,000 ETH (roughly $3.4 million) being paid out to miners by the protocol.  Yet, should ASICs become a more popular tool for mining ether, smaller hobbyist miners could be even more hard-hit by the proposed adjustment. As such, signs suggest ethereum miners are beginning to back a code change that would prevent ASICs from dominating the platform.  Bolstering the movement, according to several sources, is the belief that the proposed issuance reduction won't impact all miners equally. Rather, some think it's likely to concentrate mining power in a small number of pools with access to cheap electricity and with the resources necessary to purchase ASICs.  ""This community of small miners, hundreds of thousands, is now faced with the economic reality that selling their used hardware may be a better outcome than continuing to participate in ETH,"" Brian Venturo, CEO of mining company Atlantic Crypto, told CoinDesk.  Believing that the presence of small miners is necessary for the decentralization and security of the network, proponents of GPUs — a general purpose hardware that is easier to access than ASICs — are advocating a code change that would remove competing hardware from the platform.  ""The entire foundation of ethereum is decentralization, that's the foundation of it, that's the theme,"" hardware supplier and leading developer behind the code change, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, told CoinDesk.  She continued:  ""The only kind of hardware that's naturally decentralized, and that means that it's available in mass quantities to multiple individuals that aren't inherently involved in cryptocurrency, that don't have financial motivation, that's a GPU card.""  Preparing for battle  Minehan, then, is prepping the code changes for its possible inclusion into Constantinople, currently scheduled for October.  ""The goal is to staff up and have people working on that full time,"" Minehan said.  In her effort to block ASICs, Minehan joins several major cryptocurrencies — most notably, privacy-centric cryptocurrency monero — in what has been termed ""crypto's war on miners.""  A grassroots movement started back in January, the trend can be linked to several batches of specialized hardware developed, mainly by the China-based mining giant Bitmain, for cryptocurrencies that were previously only mineable with GPUs.  But Minehan not only believes the type of code change she's advocating for will remove ASICs from taking over ethereum, she also thinks it will lead to performance gains for GPU miners as well.  That's because, built on an algorithm named ProgPoW, the code is designed to maximize on the characteristics of GPU hardware, using 80 percent of the overall graphics card toward computing the algorithm, instead of the 10 to 20 percent that is typical of cryptocurrency mining.  Because of this, Minehan said that if a hardware designer tried to build out a ProgPoW ASIC — which is to say a specialized chip with the sole function of computing ProgPoW — it would just end up resembling GPU hardware.  ""One of the really cool features of ProgPoW is if you were going to implement this centralized hardware, an ASIC, then you would end up just mimicking a GPU card,"" Minehan told CoinDesk.  In this way, Minehan said that the algorithm draws a lot on Ethash, ethereum's current mining algorithm. While Ethash was built to resist ASIC hardware, by adding in a dataset, named a DAG, which increases incrementally over periods of time, it seems manufacturers have gotten around that barrier.  Distinct from Ethash, ProgPoW forces changes to the algorithm itself every epoch, meaning that ""it's impossible to have fixed function hardware,"" Minehan said.  Minehan, then, calls it an ""extension of ethereum"" that has been built especially with GPUs in mind.  She told CoinDesk, ""That's inherently what PropPoW is, it is a lesson in how to make algorithms tailored to hardware.""  Two kinds of hardware  In interview, Minehan was adamant of the importance of general purpose hardware for the health of the ethereum network.  ""I don't think the ethereum developers realize just how, pardon my language, but how fucked they are, when the new generation of ethereum ASICs publically gets to the market,"" she said.  In her mind, that's because, while the current ethereum ASIC isn't a huge improvement on the GPUs used today — aside from being slightly more efficient when it comes to electricity usage — rapid improvements in hardware means that GPU and ASICs will become increasingly polarized.  According to Minehan, the problem with this isn't just that, it's also that ASICs by nature are bound to a specific algorithm, and as such, can effectively lock miners into securing on particular protocol.  She explained:  ""When you're locked into one coin it causes a lot of competitive behavior, a lot of dangerous behavior.""  That's because, while the primary market for GPUs is the gaming industry, there's no other use for custom-built ASICs other than mining crypto. This means that ASIC manufacturers and miners are more directly incentivized to protect their investments — even if it means interfering with the direction of the network.  This is especially concerning given that ethereum is planning to switch its mining process to a technology called proof-of-stake, which will do away with the need for mining hardware entirely, Minehan contended.  ""We believe proof-of-stake is the natural progression of ethereum, and we want proof-of-stake to be out there, but the network will be incredibly vulnerable if only ASICs are allowed to play,"" she said.  ASIC manufacturers, she continued, are ""naturally incentivized to keep ethereum on proof-of-work,"" so much so that it might mean splitting ethereum when it comes time to make the switch.  ""They will do everything in their power to keep it on proof-of-work which includes maintaining a large portion of the network hashrate,"" she concluded.  Not in Constantinople  The implementation of ASIC-resistant code is being heralded by developers as a ""reasonable compromise"" for GPU miners on the network. As such, developers are taking time to investigate ProgPoW for its potential inclusion into ethereum's codebase.  Speaking to CoinDesk, communication officer for the Ethereum Foundation, Hudson Jameson, confirmed that he's been working to gain an understanding of the viability of ProgPoW implementation.  Jameson has been in contact with some of ProgPoW's stated reviewers, including GPU manufacturers AMD and Nvidia.  ""Once I'm done doing that I will work with some people from the community and experts in ProgPoW to continue to assess it's viability as a replacement for Ethash,"" Jameson told CoinDesk. ""ProgPoW will certainly be discussed in upcoming core developers' calls as we continue to assess it.""  Yet, it's still unclear whether there's sufficient support to implement such a change.  For example, arguments exist that the increased hashrate that comes from ASIC hardware is actually a positive for network security. Others warn that ProgPoW might have unexpected impacts — like damaging the investments of miners who had optimized their GPU cards for mining Ethash.  Aside from that, developers are adamant that the change cannot be included in Constantinople. Alluding to this, Afri Schoedon, the communications officer for ethereum client provider Parity Technologies, told CoinDesk that an ASIC effort ""will not happen"" in the upcoming hard fork.  ""Constantinople is final,"" Schoedon told CoinDesk.  Jameson echoed this, telling CoinDesk, ""There is no way ProgPoW can go into Constantinople,"" but rather that it has the possibility of being included in the following hard fork (nicknamed Istanbul), currently planned for eight months after Constantinople.  The delay might be disheartening to the many miners calling for ASIC-resistant code. With rapidly diminishing returns, there's a chance that the GPU mining community will have moved to new cryptocurrencies by the time Istanbul comes around.  But regardless, Minehan and her team are still optimistic.  She said:  ""I just want to have it all done and finished and then just point to it and say look guys it's done, it's ready, adopt it if you want it, don't adopt it if you don't, I don't really care, but don't say it's not ready to be implemented because it's finished.""

The country's Ministry of Civil Affairs released an action plan for 2018–2022 on Monday, which outlined several areas in which it aims to use internet technologies to improve the transparency of social service activities.  Part of the plan indicates the ministry will make a decision on a blockchain solution to be used for upgrading the current charity tracking system by the end of 2018, with completion of the project planned by 2020.  The move comes at a time when China's charity activities have been mired in controversy after online scandals in recent years have led to public distrust of the system.  In its plan, the ministry notified provincial and municipal agencies that the blockchain network will integrate existing government charity databases at all levels with online donation services operated by the private sector. In this way, data on charitable donations made through a variety of services will become visible to the public faster using a distributed network.  Currently, besides traditional charity organizations, internet giants such as Alibaba and Tencent have also launched their own donation services via mobile applications.
