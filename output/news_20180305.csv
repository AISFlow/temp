42380399,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYPp,1520290805,Canadian Regulator Warns Against 'Illegal' Crypto Investment Scheme,"A finance regulator in the Canadian province of New Brunswick has warned residents about investing in a so-called ""cryptocurrency bank"" and its associated token.  In a March 5 statement, representatives from the Financial and Consumer Services Commission (FCSC) sounded the alarm about Bitcoin-bank.io, which according to its website promises a daily return on deposits through the use of a ""BTCB"" token. The site notably restricts the days on which the token in question can be bought or sold, stating that the first such ""selling day"" isn't until April 23.  According to the FCSC, the Bitcoin-bank offering is illegal.  ""The commission took a close look at the website after becoming aware the cryptobank was advertising its investment opportunities on a Canadian online classified site,"" the regulator said in a statement. ""Since it is not registered to trade in, or advise on, securities or derivatives in New Brunswick, it is illegal for Bitcoin-bank.io to carry out these activities in the province.""  Additionally, a claimed California address is fake, the commission said upon investigating the location, and that some of the marketing materials distributed by promoters contain fictitious information as well.  ""The review also revealed that many of the photographs accompanying team profiles on the website had been taken from other sites with fake names attached, and that content had been copied from other websites,"" the FCSC said.  The alleged cryptocurrency scam is the latest to take shape in Canada, which has seen a number of schemes solicit investors in recent months.  Last year, Canadian police issued a warning over a bitcoin tax scam, where fraudsters claiming to be part of the nation’s Revenue Agency threatened some 40 victims with jail time for unpaid taxes. Those victims were told to withdraw bitcoin from a bitcoin ATM and send the funds to the scammers, and police estimated that the victims sent 340,000 Canadian dollars ($267,000).  It's not clear if the commission will take any further action against Bitcoin-bank.io. In its message, the FCSC advised would-be investors to do their homework before putting their money into anything, concluding:  ""Becoming an informed investor is the best way to protect your money. Informed investors don't leave it to chance.""

42380409,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYZt,1520271653,Webster's Dictionary Adds 'Cryptocurrency' and 'Initial Coin Offering',"One of the world's most established dictionaries has gotten a cryptocurrency update.  Merriam-Webster announced Monday that it has added terms such as ""cryptocurrency,"" ""blockchain"" and ""initial coin offerings"" to its word lists as of this month. The additions came amid more than 800 new entries.  In unveiling the move, the company said that it aims to help clarify the ""sometimes perplexing domain of digital financial exchanges,"" striving to use examples as a guiding point.  ""The sometimes perplexing domain of digital financial exchanges opens a window into a subject that requires explanation for many of us, hence the detailed definition of cryptocurrency as well as an entry for initial coin offering, which refers to the first sale of Bitcoin-like digital currency,"" Merriam-Webster wrote.  ""Cryptocurrency"" is defined as ""any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority,"" going on to note that the system records transactions and used cryptography to prevent counterfeit or fraudulent transactions.  Similarly, the term ""blockchain"" notes that it is a digital database used within a decentralized network. However, unlike the other two terms, "" initial coin offeringhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/initial%20coin%20offering"" does not have a working page as of press time.  The additions are notable, coming nearly two years after ""bitcoin"" was first added to the dictionary. Indeed, the listings point to the increasing profile of such words in the public lexicon, though it remains to be seen if terms like ""mining"" receive a cryptocurrency-themed update in the future.

42380414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYev,1520257523,The Father of the JOBS Act Is Helping Build a Next-Generation ICO,"David Weild IV is calling for a Jobs Act 2.0 with blockchain at its core.  While that might not seem surprising coming from any other investor – since the act (formally called Jumpstart Our Business Startups) has yet to generate the growth in initial public offerings (IPOs) it was supposed to – this stance from this particular investor is notable since Weild himself is often called the ""Father of the Jobs Act"" for his research into the destructive nature of the equity markets on businesses.  ""People call me the Father of the Jobs Act, but it’s not the act that I would have written if they’d given me the pen,"" said Weild, who is now head of investment banking firm Weild and Co. Holdings. ""That’s probably my biggest frustration with a process which is really based on compromise and collaboration.""  Yet out of this disappointment and the subsequent research, Weild undertook to look for possible solutions, and he became enamored with blockchain, and more importantly, it's role in offering an alternative to IPOs.  In Weild's original 2010 research paper, credited with helping inspire the creation of the Jobs Act, he blamed the drop in IPOs largely on a lack of support for aftermarket business services that help make going public profitable for the post-trade world at large.  ""These small-cap offerings require intermediaries that are adequately compensated to find the other side of the trade, and when you deprive that marketplace of the oxygen that’s required to sustain it, you end up with an erosion of the entire ecosystem of support providers,"" Weild told CoinDesk.  But by tokenizing securities and moving them to a blockchain, he believes the problem can be solved, primarily in that it might, over time, eliminate the need for intermediaries altogether.  He continued:  ""Today trusted, third-party intermediaries have provided the requisite credibility in these marketplaces. That gets moved to the blockchain, so the intermediaries, the trusted banks, are no longer needed.""  Right to ICOs  With his interest piqued, Weild, who is the former vice-chairman of Nasdaq, has taken on formally advising two blockchain startups, both which deal with crypto tokens created out of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Firstly, Weild is working with blockchain-based adtech provider Kochava, which he met through one of Weild and Co.'s subsidiaries that specializes in mergers and acquisitions.  Kochava had previously launched an alpha version of its advertising platform, called XCHNG, which a number of venture-backed ad agencies were testing. But now the company is making plans for an ICO, whereby it'll launch a token that enables an advertising exchange.  The second company Weild is formally advising is Templum, which raised $2.7 million in traditional venture capital to build an alternative trading system (ATS) for trading regulated crypto assets. At this early stage, Weild is not only advising Templum on how its future customers might capitalize on blockchain technology but how the company itself might do so.  While Kochava and Templum might seem very different, they have one thing in common that makes Weild the perfect adviser – the Jobs Act.  Reg D ready  Both startups are part of an increasing number of blockchain-based companies looking to take advantage of Reg D 506 (c) of the Jobs Act.  While the securities law restricts investment to accredited investors, it also opens up the world of advertising those token sales to a number of different outlets, what many think is a huge win for ICO issuers.  Kochava plans to implement its token sale through the simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) framework, which was created to allow issuers to use Reg D, and in turn, stay on the right side of the Securities and Exchange Commission (although its yet to be seen whether the SEC agrees). And already, Templum has entered into a purchase agreement subject to regulatory approval that would let them raise capital in accordance with Reg D.  Going forward, Weild has a pipeline of as many as 10 more blockchain firms he's advising through both the fundraising process and potential mergers and acquisitions.  If he succeeds with any or all of these projects, he thinks the original goal of the Jobs Act could finally be realized using the blockchain-based technology that has allowed entrepreneurs to raise more than $9 billion.  Still, Weild concluded on a measured note, saying:  ""The process of taking all this interest in ICOs and moving it into a securities compliant process is going to take a while.""

Indeed, comments on social media indicate investors now expect XRP price to extend Monday's gains ahead of an alleged appearance by CEO Brad Garlinghouse on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" Tuesday. Also said to be on the program is Coinbase COO Asiff Hirji, a possible coincidence that's raising conjecture the major U.S. exchange will add support for XRP trading.  Currently, Coinbase offers trading for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ether, meaning the addition of XRP could enable a new outlet for retail trading.  Still, while details about the appearance are scant (it's not clear if the two will be appearing together, and neither has tweeted plans for the show), XRP is trading at $1.05, having appreciated 16 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.  Yet another potential driver is a surge in South Korean trading volumes, with four out of top 10 exchanges by trading volumes being based in the Asian nation. Indeed, Bithumb, in particular, has seen its XRP trading surge more than 30 percent on the day.  The rumor mill might keep XRP well bid for another 24 hours. That said, the price chart analysis indicates better days ahead of the XRP token.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  XRP formed a base around $0.86 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the Dec. 7 low to Jan. 4 high) and staged a solid rally from the rising trendline support (drawn from the Dec. 7 low and Feb. 6 low).  The relative strength index (RSI) has turned bullish (above 50.00 and rising).  The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA trend northwards, indicating short-term bullish setup.  The only factor that could be listed as the one favoring the bears is the bearish 50-day MA and 10-day MA crossover.  However, long-term moving average crossovers are lagging indicators. So, XRP looks set to take out the descending trendline (drawn from the Jan. 28 high and Feb. 17 high) resistance.  Long positions rise  View  XRP will likely close today (as per UTC) above $1.04329 (descending trendline resistance on the daily chart), signaling a bullish breakout on the charts. Prices could then revisit $1.38 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) and $1.4060 (Jan. 28 high).  On the downside, a daily close (as per UTC) below 0.8610 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement) would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change and would allow for a deeper sell-off to $0.5729 (Feb. 6 low).

42380405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYUr,1520251225,Coinbase Hit by Lawsuit Over Alleged Insider Trading,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been hit by a class action lawsuit over alleged insider trading during its launch of bitcoin cash.  According to a court document dated last Thursday, the case has been brought by Jeffery Berk, representing a group of investors that placed trading orders on Coinbase or its order book trading platform GDAX from Dec. 19–21, 2017.  Based on the complaint, the case takes aim at Coinbase's launch of bitcoin cash (BCH) trading in the same month, with the plaintiffs accusing the company of tipping off insiders ahead of the formal launch. As such, the group accuses the firm of negligence, and is seeking damages, the amount of which will be decided at trial.  As previously reported, San Francisco-based Coinbase first announced in August that it would support bitcoin cash – a new crypto asset that was forked from the bitcoin blockchain in November. At the time, the exchange said the new service would go live by Jan. 1, after which investors would be able to withdraw bitcoin cash.  When Coinbase launched BCH trading on Dec. 20, BCH prices spiked just prior to the announcement and accusations soon appeared on social media suggesting that employees of the firm might have tipped off others in advance. The company responded to the claims by announcing it would conduct an investigation into whether any staff members may have violated its insider trading rules.  However, the plaintiffs allege that the firm has never revealed the full results of its investigation and that it has violated California’s Unfair Competition Law.  The complaint states:  ""When Coinbase’s customers’ trades were finally executed, it was only after the insiders had driven up the price of BCH, and thus the remaining bitcoin customers only received their BCH at artificially inflated prices that had been manipulated well beyond the fair market value of BCH at that time.""

42380417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYjx,1520247658,Make-or-Break Level? Bitcoin Pauses at Key Resistance,"Bitcoin's price is flirting with key resistance on the technical charts and could either break higher towards $17,000 or dip once more below the $10,000 mark.  Having clocked a high of $11,599 earlier today, bitcoin is now trading at $11,473, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). While the cryptocurrency has spent the better part of the last 42 hours above $11,000, a convincing break above the key resistance level of $11,600 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) has remained elusive amid lighter trading volumes.  Twenty four-hour trading volume stands at $6.17 billion today, compared to $7.28 billion seen a week ago. And, notably, although BTC has appreciated by more than 20 percent since the Feb. 25 low of $9,304, volume has hardly increased over the same period.  Sluggish trading volume could be a cause for concern, although an argument could be made that the market has merely normalized as the market euphoria seen in December and early January has faded.  Still, volumes may rise sharply if bitcoin sees a convincing break above the key resistance.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  BTC closed yesterday (as per UTC) above the descending trendline (white dotted line) resistance and $11,306 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high), signaling a bullish breakout.  However, the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance at $11,600 is proving a tough nut to crack. Prices did clock a high of $11,623, but quickly fell back below $11,500  The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA are trending northwards, indicating a short-term bullish setup, while the 50-day MA continues to slope downwards in favor of the bears.  4-hour chart  View  A high volume breakout (daily close as per UTC) above $11,600 would open the doors to stronger gains towards $17,000 (inverse head-and-shoulders target as per the measured height method). On the way higher, the pair may face resistance at $14,584 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement).  On the downside, a move below $11,050 (previous day's low, strong support as per the 4-hour chart) would abort the immediate bullish outlook and could yield a drop below the $10,000 mark.  In that case, the dip could be short-lived as the 5-day MA and 10-day MA are sloping upwards.  Bearish scenario: Failure to take out the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle in the next 48 hours followed by a break below the descending 50-day MA ($10,240) would suggest the corrective rally from the Feb. 6 low of $6,000 has ended. Bitcoin prices could then proceed to revisit $7,960 (Feb. 2 low).

42380410,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYb9,1520244031,China's Biggest Political Event Sees Blockchain Praise,"Chinese policy advisors from across various sectors are weighing in on domestic blockchain development during the first days of an ongoing annual political event.  Commonly known as the ""Two Sessions"" – comprising the National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) – the event this year has already seen a wide range of comments on blockchain from provincial and municipal representatives to CEOs of major internet firms. The event started on March 3.  The NPC is China's top legislative arm, which proposes policies and oversees its enforcement, while the CPPCC serves a consultative function for lawmakers, with its membership coming from corporates and political parties, as well as ethnic groups in China. Both events are hosted every spring over the course of 10–14 days at national, provincial and municipal levels.  While the topic of blockchain has yet to make it to the lawmakers' agenda, comments from CPPCC members have brought attention to the tech to both local and national political events.  Applications are key  While China has already clamped down on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fiat-to-crypto order book trading since September 2017, the government is still stepping up its support for turning blockchain technology into real-life applications.  Speaking to that effort, Pony Ma, CEO of Chinese internet giant Tencent, said in a press Q&A session during the CPPCC conference that his firm is actively exploring various scenarios that could see the application of blockchain technology, according to a report from Sohu.  Ma commented:  ""Although the invention of blockchain is [excellent], the key to its future lies largely in actual applications. Meanwhile ICOs remain highly risky. We do not intend to participate in launching our own cryptocurrency.""  Echoing that comment, Li Yanhong, CEO of search giant Baidu, said that, while blockchain technology is revolutionary, it's still a very early stage, according to China's tech news Leiphone.  The comments are largely in line with recent developments of the two internet firms, as Baidu and Tencent have both recently launched blockchain-as-a-service platforms in order to facilitate companies that seek to develop applications using the tech.  Meanwhile, Zhou Yanli, currently a CPPCC member and former vice chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, doubled down on his belief that blockchain applications promise to play a major role in improving the efficiency of the insurance industry in China.  China has already seen joint efforts in piloting blockchain application within the insurance industry. As reported, in April 2017, a group of 10 insurance companies said it had completed a blockchain trial in the country.  Calls for change  Yet as interest in the technology grows, some policy advisors are casting doubts on aspects of the blockchain industry.  For instance, Zhou Hongyi, chairman of internet security firm Qihoo 360, commented:  ""The only real application of blockchain I can see so far is bitcoin. And yet in the history of blockchain development, lots of exchanges and wallets have been hacked, which proves blockchain technology needs serious security improvement.""  Meanwhile, Ding Lei, CEO of internet technology firm NetEase, believes that a lot of the current attention given to blockchain is driven by speculation.  ""Applications should be developed in accordance to actual market needs, instead of just using the name of blockchain for speculation,"" he said.  Addressing the issue of speculation, Wang Pengjie, a CPPCC member from minor political party Zhi Gong, proposed a regulatory framework that would potentially treat tokens as public stocks, saying:  ""A regulated cryptocurrency exchange platform under the oversight of People's Bank of China and Securities Regulatory Commission would serve as a formal way for companies raising funds through ICO and trading cryptocurrencies.""  Cities take a focus  While the event has seen notable comments at the national level in Beijing, city-level conferences have also discussed ways to foster blockchain developments.  According to Leiphone, in China's Guangxi Province, policy advisors from the provincial CPPCC have already proposed the drafting of crypto-friendly guidelines to attract firms that design, develop and implement blockchain applications.  Similarly, CPPCC members at a city-level conference in Chengdu suggested that the local government should have a policy in place to build an incubation center to foster adoption of blockchain technology in the city's financial services.  Meanwhile, the mayor of Hangzhou, the city where e-commerce giant Alibaba is headquartered, said it would make blockchain one of its top priorities for 2018, in an effort to foster quality development in the field.

42394023,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsdlgN,1520240421,"Major Blockchains Are Pretty Much Still Centralized, Research Finds","At the beach, they say, all your troubles melt away.  But that's not entirely the case for researchers who spent part of this week at the Financial Crypto 2018 conference on the Caribbean island of Curacao, discussing the decentralization of the two largest crypto protocols, bitcoin and ethereum –or where they're lacking in this regard.  Presented on March 2, a new paper, titled ""Egalitarian Society or Benevolent Dictatorship: The State of Cryptocurrency Governance"" by University College London researchers, delved into the topic further by measuring how many developers are contributing to and commenting on cryptocurrency codebases.  For one, the researchers looked at ""commits"" – bundles of changes a developer proposes to make to the codebase. According to the paper, 7 percent of all the files in the Bitcoin Core software were written by one developer, while about 20 percent to ethereum were written by a single coder.  As such, this signals that ethereum is ""a little"" more centralized than bitcoin is in this regard, said Sarah Azouvi, a UCL computer science PhD student and co-author of the paper.  It's an interesting take as it relates to the fierce debates happening within the ethereum community right now, as two sides go head-to-head on an ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 867.  EIP 867 looks to establish an easier process for recovering lost funds via software changes – a controversial topic that stems back to The DAO hack in 2016, when ethereum developers decided to reverse transactions in order to give victims their funds back.  Yet, even though many similar discussions regularly take place on GitHub, the overall pool of users involved was more limited than Azouvi, and many others, expected.  She told CoinDesk:  ""It's still not a lot of people. Most of them are making just a couple comments here and there. A few people are doing most of the discussion.""  The decision-makers  But ethereum's debate over lost funds wasn't the only reason for attendees in Curacao to discuss the network. Another reason highlighted by the paper was governance, as most of the major code changes are still written by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin himself.  ""He stands out from the rest,"" said Azouvi.  The findings aren't exactly surprising, as this has been a point of contention for some time, whereby many believe Buterin has too much power over the network for it to truly be called a decentralized blockchain.  Even developer Jason Teutsch, who created ethereum scaling protocol TrueBit, joked that Buterin can be counted on to take care of everything when asked about governance. Although, on a more serious note, he argued the recent debates just showcase how hard governance can be in general, saying there's often no way to make everyone happy.  Teutsch told CoinDesk:  ""It's a hard problem. It happens in every governance system. Every time something changes, someone is unhappy.""  Not that unusual  Yet, even though governance seems more centralized than people might expect from projects that cherish decentralization, the UCL researchers note this isn't so unusual.  For instance, ethereum and bitcoin development have similar levels of participation as other open-source projects, such as programming languages Clojure and Rust.  ""It's not that different, though, even though the community is focused on decentralization. They all behave quite similarly,"" she said.  Plus, the paper concedes that ""measuring levels of centralization by looking at the code or by looking at specific sources"" is inherently limited.  Along these lines, researchers from IC3 argued during the conference that there are also technical ways to measure how decentralized a cryptocurrency project is.  In particular, they looked at how long it takes blocks to propagate across the network how and geographically distributed nodes are, determining that ethereum outperforms bitcoin on both these fronts.  And one audience member added yet another angle, noting that decentralization of the cryptocurrency's economy is also an important factor that was being missed in the research presented at the conference.  The right to vote  But with interest in the decentralization of cryptocurrency networks on the rise, one might think solutions were also being considered.  Yet, researchers and developers at the conference were largely neutral on issues facing ethereum and bitcoin, saying they wanted to steer clear of the politics surrounding the decision-making on the protocols.  ""I don't want to take a political position. I'm interested in technical solutions, but I'm not going to take sides,"" Teutsch said about ethereum's recent debates in particular, then pointing to better voting mechanisms as a possible way to deal with contentious debates.  Azouvi seemed to shy away from taking a position also, saying, ""We don't propose a new system. We count how many people are doing what.""  Although, she continued, echoing what Teutsch said: ""[Ethereum] could benefit from having a more formal governance model. It's difficult because even if you want to have a more formal way of decision-making, it's hard to decide who writes it. Then there's the question of who gets to vote.""  ""They could try to make sure everyone who's able to is able to have their vote,"" she suggested.  Still, Azouvi noted voting opens up a whole new can of worms:  ""Voting itself is a hard problem. It's non-trivial.""

According to a report from Nikkei, the new initiative will see the group of licensed cryptocurrency exchanges, represented by two trade organizations in Japan, working towards rolling out standards in April for the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA) in an effort to improve security measures among them. The group will also work toward developing standards for activities around initial coin offerings.      The new organization's formation, the name of which has yet to be determined, came after the two trade groups – the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) and Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) – reached an agreement last week.  Taizen Okuyama, president of foreign exchange trading firm Money Partners Group and chairman of the JCBA, and Yuzo Kano, CEO of exchange startup bitFlyer and the head of the JBA, will serve as the chairman and vice chairman of the new group, respectively.  The move confirms previous reports about an effort to develop an SRO for Japan's cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem.  The idea was put forward as a way to shore up public confidence in the wake of a hack that resulted in the theft $500 million worth of the NEM token from Coincheck, one of the Japanese exchanges that have yet to be fully approved by the FSA.  As previously reported, Coincheck hasn't been approved yet by the financial regulator because of security issues, which the FSA said it had alerted Coincheck about prior to the heist.

42421803,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXtyDl,1520226014,Tether Might Still Be Crypto's Ticking Time Bomb,"Tanzeel Akhtar is an independent British journalist whose work has been published in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, FT Alphaville, Investing.com, Forbes, Euromoney and Citywire.      Often, when a cryptocurrency tanks, holders of a rival coin will tease them with ""SFYL"" – sorry for your loss.  But the entire industry needs to keep an eye on Tether’s USDT token, because if something were to happen to it, the result could be everyone’s loss.  That’s because the coin, also known as tether, has become a pivotal source of liquidity for the crypto markets. Without wanting to further spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in a community that's had more than its share, a collapse of tether would be extremely bad for these markets, causing a ripple effect and, in the worst case, conceivably toppling exchanges.  To be sure, so far, tether has lived up to its description as a so-called stablecoin, whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Trading data shows tether has generally hovered around $1, occasionally dipping as low as $0.80 or jumping as high as $1.10.  But the company’s online critics have long alleged that Tether, which has close ties to the crypto exchange Bitfinex, has been issuing more USDT than it has dollars in the bank, in order to drive up the price of bitcoin.  That’s a problem for investors because tether is rare among cryptocurrencies in that it carries counterparty risk – in other words, the possibility one party to a contract may not fulfill its end of the bargain. In Tether’s case, the ""obligation"" is redeeming USDT tokens for dollars.  An audit by the firm Friedman LLP was supposed to prove that USDT was fully backed. But recently Tether abruptly announced that its its relationship with Friedman had ended. It remains unclear who dumped whom and why.  Now, with no audit forthcoming, the doubts are as pervasive as ever.  When contacted for this column, a spokesperson for Tether would say only, ""Regarding the audit, we have no further comment.""  Systemic risk  It would be one thing if the risk were confined to traders holding tether, which according to CoinMarketCap ranks among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, with a market cap of over $2 billion.  But Weiss Ratings, a decades-old investment research firm that recently began evaluating cryptocurrencies, iswarning investors that Tether poses a risk to the whole ecosystem, explaining:  “Tether is the only ‘cryptocurrency’ with trading volume that regularly exceeds that of its market cap. This means the entire Tether supply changes hands regularly, sometimes more than once a day. ... This is important to know because it tells us that Tether is used for trading A LOT. It’s one of the main sources of liquidity in the cryptomarkets.”  Hence, Tether could be described as ""systemically important,"" which is the polite term regulators use for ""too big to fail."" Don't count on a government bailout, though.  The Weiss report goes on:  “Liquidity is the lifeblood of a market. It’s what makes prices stable and seamless trading possible. The consequences could be far-reaching. What happens if Tether does turn out to be shaky? ... What if this large source of liquidity suddenly evaporates?”  Aside from the mysterious severing of ties with the auditor, Tether’s had a number of other problems.  In November of last year the company claimed that ahacker snatched nearly $31 million of the token from the company’s own wallet. More recently, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sent subpoenas to both Bitfinex and Tether.  Another view  There is a more charitable and nuanced interpretation of this situation, however, than the one offered by Jordan Belfort, the Wolf of Wall Street – who in a recent interview with The Street called Tether a “massive fraud.” (Takes one to know one?)  To understand the alternative explanation, you have to remember how tether, which was created in 2014, ascended to its current prominence.  In April last year Bitfinex had its wire services  suspended by Wells Fargo. In order to continue trading, tether became a substitute for wire transfers for Bitfinex and possibly other exchanges that had a hard time getting or keeping bank accounts.  According to Bitmex research, Tether itself may have the same problem, and this would help explain why it’s been so cagey about its finances:  “We suspect that Tether may have struggled to find appropriate banking relationships. ... We believe this is likely to be the primary reason for the apparent lack of transparency, rather than a lack of USD reserves. The transparency that some Tether stakeholders seem to expect may not be possible in the financial sector when the underlying activity is not clearly authorized or regulated by the authorities.""  We have yet to see how things pan out on the Tether front but for now investors should be cautious and sit tight – whether they’re holding USDT or another crypto coin.

An application  for an ""Expedited Virtual Currency Transaction System"" published on March 1 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) details a method by which private keys – the strings of numbers and letters used to transact or otherwise control one's cryptocurrency holdings – are swapped from a buyer to a seller behind the scenes.  The aim of the concept is to narrow the amount of time it takes for payments to go through between a consumer and a merchant, avoiding the process of sending a transaction and waiting for it to be included in the next block on the network. To do this, PayPal proposed a way to create secondary wallets with their own unique private keys for buyers and sellers. The system would transfer private keys corresponding to an exact amount of any given cryptocurrency.  As the filing explains:  ""The systems and methods of the present disclosure practically eliminate the amount of time the payee must wait to be sure they will receive a virtual currency payment in a virtual currency transaction by transferring to the payee private keys that are included in virtual currency wallets that are associated with predefined amounts of virtual currency that equal a payment amount identified in the virtual currency transaction.""
