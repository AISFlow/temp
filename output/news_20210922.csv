The digital asset is currently down with the rest of the market, which is suffering in the wake of the Evergrande situation in China. The market has been in a downtrend as the situation has evolved. Its biggest ties to the market being the fact that Tether allegedly owns some of the Evergrande bonds. This has spilled over into the crypto market in a big way. Bitcoin fell to one-month lows with the news and as the altcoins have followed, Cardano has recorded receding prices also. Hitting lows that haven&apos;t been seen since the rally began in August. Current indicators point to the market poised for further decline. But deVere CEO Nigel Green believes that while ADA may be down, it is definitely not out.

The CEO cited the recent technological advancements in the project, namely the recent addition of smart contracts capability to the blockchain.

42411976,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otWa4l,1632348610,"Pussy Riot, Ex-Bloomberg Reporter Join ‘Seed Club’ Crypto Accelerator","Seed Club, an incubator for community-centric crypto projects, has announced a new slate for its six-week accelerator program.  Among the teams in the Seed Club accelerator’s third cohort are the Russian art collective Pussy Riot, Cherie Hu’s crypto-conscious media brand Water and Music, and the music blog Tiny Mix Tapes, which shut down at the beginning of 2020 and is now pursuing a second life on the blockchain.  Also in the cohort is the reporter Matt Leising, who recently left Bloomberg after a 17-year tenure. His project, Tinsel DAO, will hunt for “crypto-based” intellectual property to turn into movies and TV shows. On Twitter, Leising said the venture is part of a new company called Decential Media.  Seed Club models itself after the prominent startup incubator Y Combinator, but specializes in education and development around social tokens – cryptocurrencies dedicated to galvanizing and governing online communities. The idea is that owning a social token makes you a member of a collective and keeps you financially invested in its long-term success. It’s not unlike a co-op model in that each member has a stake.  Seed Club’s accelerator program is essentially a boot camp for building a tokenized community, with biweekly coaching sessions and mentorship opportunities. In the way that Y Combinator gets equity from its startups in exchange for capital, Seed Club gets a 3% cut of its projects’ tokens.  The crucial difference is that Seed Club doesn’t actually make a monetary investment in its accelerator projects – so, for now, these nascent communities are just getting the boot camp.  Social tokens on the rise  Social tokens have grown popular over the past year because decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and crypto social clubs like Friends With Benefits have provided a model for structuring businesses on the blockchain. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles-based record label Leaving Records used a social token called $GENRE to play around with new paradigms for music and ownership.  Keeping tabs on tokenized communities has become a business model in and of itself: Just last week, a group called Forefront raised $21 million for newsletters and other media products that track the wide world of social tokens. Carlos Gomes, Forefront’s founder, is a Seed Club alum.

42411979,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otWaHU,1632346551,Leaked Slides Show How Chainalysis Flags Crypto Suspects for Cops,"In the battle to link real-world criminals to their anonymous bitcoin troves, Chainalysis has found a “meaningful” edge: a block explorer website that scrapes visitors’ internet protocol (IP) addresses.  According to leaked documents reviewed by CoinDesk, Chainalysis, the largest of the blockchain tracing firms, owns and operates walletexplorer.com. Like other block explorers, the service lets anyone view the history of public cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Chainalysis figures that bad actors would use its site to check transactions without fear of “leaving a ‘footprint’” on crypto exchanges, the documents said.  But where the exchanges – and presumably most block explorers – have no eyes, Chainalysis has set its sights. It “‘scrapes’ the IP addresses of suspicious” users that fall into the honeypot of walletexplorer.com according to the documents.  “Using this dataset we were able to provide law enforcement with meaningful leads related to the IP data associated with an address,” the documents, translated from Italian, say. “It is also possible to conduct a reverse lookup on any known IP address to identify other BTC addresses.”  In doing so, Chainalysis has effectively weaponized an unassuming website without disclosing its ties. It has never publicly associated itself with walletexplorer.com, although a note at the bottom of the site’s homepage says its “author” now works at Chainalysis. The website was created in 2014, according to site registration documents that make no mention of Chainalysis.  A spokesperson for Chainalysis declined to comment.  The documents, from an undated Chainalysis presentation to Italian police investigating the dark web, appeared late Monday on DarkLeaks, itself a dark web site only accessible through anonymizing browsers like Tor. CoinDesk has verified the documents’ authenticity.  The slide deck shines new light on the full range of tools that Chainalysis uses to assist law enforcement in nabbing illicit actors. The company is primarily known for parsing publicly available transaction data rather than using subterfuge.  But its honeypot works, according to the leaked slide deck. Chainalysis cited a June 2020 case in which walletexplorer.com nabbed a ransomware suspect’s IP address – hours after they were suspected of depositing funds through the over-the-counter (OTC) desk of crypto exchange Huobi.  ‘Demixing’ monero  The documents also show that Chainalysis thinks it can trace transactions in monero (XMR), which many consider to be the cryptocurrency with the strongest privacy defenses.  “Of the cases that Chainalysis worked on in collaboration with law enforcement, we were able to provide usable leads in approximately 65% of cases involving [m]onero,” the documents say.  Justin Ehrenhofer, a member of the Monero Space work group, cautioned not to read too much into this claim.  “‘Usable leads’ is very nonspecific and can mean a wide variety of things,” he wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “For example in the best of cases for law enforcement, it can lead to real identities behind transactions. However, it can also relate to false information, such as a fake/stolen identity or a Tor address. All metadata is useful in investigations, and the extent to which this information is extremely variable.”  Likewise the word “cases” is used broadly, referring to “all Chainalysis-involved cases including Monero, not specific Monero transactions,” wrote Ehrenhofer. “So if someone used Monero but then also revealed information out of band that was used, that would likely qualify as a ‘success’ case by Chainalysis’s measure.”  Nevertheless, he offered a note of caution: “Monero users who care about their privacy should always use Monero using their own node.While there are some remote Monero nodes available over Tor, it is still best to run your own.”     Node warriors  Another way Chainalysis captures Bitcoin user data is by running nodes that verify transactions, the documents confirm. This allows the company to capture data leaks on the publicly accessible internet, or clearnet, from users’ simplified payment verification (SPV) wallets. Those services were designed to prioritize easy storage over foolproof security (although to be fair they are arguably more secure than wallets that rely on APIs to verify transactions).  “The downside to this design is that when the user wallet connects to the network, a variety of information is revealed - the user’s IP address, the full set of addresses in the wallet (used and unused) and the version of the wallet software,” according to the slide deck. “Chainalysis runs a series of nodes on the Bitcoin network ... and if a user connects to one of our nodes, we receive the above information.”  This data can be a boon to investigators. Chainalysis cites the “Welcome to Video” child pornography ring bust. One of the suspects in that case was identified in part because his Bitcoin node was running on the clearnet.  Indeed, government clients turn to Chainalysis for help tracking down nodes. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is one such partner: it requested permission in early 2021 to utilize Chainalysis’ “Rumker” tech in an effort to sanction crypto actors.  On Tuesday OFAC issued its first-ever sanction against a crypto exchange for facilitating ransomware payments.  That Chainalysis runs its own data-capturing nodes would not come as a surprise to privacy-focused Bitcoiners; the community has long suspected as much.  “We’ve always known that they’re running nodes - it’s just a matter of which services they’re connected to,” said Colin Harper, the head of content at Luxor Tech, a bitcoin mining company.  Still, the story illustrates Chainalysis’ game plan in tracking illicit crypto for law enforcement partners. It’s not enough to trawl public transaction histories. To succeed, the company must amass data troves itself.  UPDATE (Sept. 21, 18:25 UTC): Adds detail about walletexplorer.com in sixth paragraph.

42411969,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otWZb4,1632346511,SEC’s Gensler Calls Stablecoins ‘Poker Chips’ at the Wild West Crypto Casino,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler doubled down on his position that his agency has “robust” authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, stating in a conversation with the Washington Post on Tuesday that “most” cryptocurrencies have attributes of securities.  Gensler also discussed stablecoins, which have become a growing area of concern among federal regulators. Gensler told the Washington Post that the SEC is currently putting together a report about stablecoins under the guidance of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. He also said the SEC is working with banking regulators in order to get expanded authority from Congress to regulate stablecoins.  Gensler has previously compared the crypto industry to the Wild West, an analogy he expanded on during Tuesday’s interview. “We’ve got a lot of casinos here in the Wild West,” Gensler said. “And the poker chip is these stablecoins.”  Gensler’s comments come a week after his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, during which he argued that crypto exchanges such as Coinbase should register with the SEC.  In his conversation with the Washington Post, Gensler expanded on his position, saying that crypto trading and lending platforms offer up to “thousands” of tokens, and it is “highly likely” that some of these tokens fit the definition of a security.  “Those platforms should come in, and they should figure out how to register,” Gensler said. “Not many have, and so I do really fear that we’ll keep bringing these enforcement cases but there’s gonna be a problem ... and, frankly, when that happens I think a lot of people are going to get hurt.”  Gensler also credited bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto – whom Gensler referred to as “Nakamoto-san” – with spurring innovation and being a catalyst for change in how central banks and the private sector handle payment systems.  Despite the benefits to innovation, however, Gensler stressed the importance of proactive crypto regulation.  “I don’t think it’s a good idea to wait until there’s a spill in aisle three,” Gensler joked. “If we don’t do anything and there’s never a spill in aisle three, great ... I think there’s just a lot of warning signs and flashing lights that we might have a spill on aisle three and I’d rather get ahead of it.”  Gensler also said several times during the interview that he doesn’t see private forms of money as viable in the long term, comparing crypto to the Wildcat banking era of the 19th century when banks in remote areas of the U.S. distributed nearly worthless paper currency backed by bonds and other securities.  “History tells us that private forms of money don’t last long,” Gensler told the Washington Post. “I don’t think there’s a long-term viability for 5,000 or 6,000 private forms of money.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/21/secs-gensler-calls-stablecoins-poker-chips-at-the-wild-west-crypto-casino,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dafe8cae8c2557bbda9ecac5351528847415e337-5037x3363.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411907,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgx3f,1632346447,Bitcoin Eyes $3B September Options Expiry After a Drop to $40K,"Major crypto options exchanges, including industry leader Deribit, are due to settle billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin options contracts on Friday. Analysts don’t expect the monthly expiration to have a notable impact on bitcoin, which is under pressure this week due to macro risks and regulatory concerns.  Data provided by Skew shows a total of 73,700 options contracts worth $3.14 billion due for expiry Friday, of which nearly 50,000 are call options and the rest are puts. Deribit alone will be settling more than 85% of the total open interest.  “I’m not expecting much fireworks unless we run through $50,000; there’s some concentrated open interest there,” Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Tang explained that if bitcoin breaks above $50,000, traders who sold calls in anticipation of a bearish move or consolidation may resort to hedging - buying the cryptocurrency in the spot or futures market to mitigate losses arising from the short call position. That could put upward pressure on the cryptocurrency, accelerating gains.  However, that scenario looks unlikely given this week’s 11% drop to $42,000.  Options are derivative instruments that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the holder the right to buy, while the put buyer gets the right to sell. Open interest refers to a number of calls and put option contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish.  The chart shows maximum call option open interest is concentrated at strikes higher than bitcoin’s current market price, also known as out-of-the-money (OTM) calls. Most of the put options are located at lower strikes. So, the majority of options appear set to expire worthless unless bitcoin charts a big move before 08:00 UTC Friday, the designated expiry time on Deribit, where one option contract represents 1 BTC.  Currently, there are 3,500 open call positions and 537 open put positions at the $50,000 strike. The call option at $64,000 is the most popular for the Sept. 24 expiry, with an open interest of 4,400.  Also, there is a notable build-up of call options open interest between $46,000 to $50,000. “The larger expiries were at $46,000, $48,000 and $50,000, creating time decay concerns late last week with spot stagnating in the $47,000 to $49,000,” range, Adam Farthing, chief risk officer at B2C2 Japan, said. “Down here [around BTC’s current price], we only have $44,000 and $40,000 with any size on them (open interest 2,500 and 1,500, respectively), we’ve kind of moved away from the problem down here.”  Time decay refers to the rate of decline in the value of an options contract due to the passage of time. The decay accelerates as the time for expiration nears. Options also lose value when the underlying asset consolidates, leading to a drop in investors’ expectations for big moves.  Had bitcoin remained locked between $47,000 and $49,000, both call and put option buyers in that region would have suffered significant losses and may have resorted to hedging.  Option expiries have gained notoriety this year, with bitcoin witnessing heightened price turbulence in the days leading up to and immediately following the monthly settlement (last Friday of each month). However, some observers say the options market is still small to affect the spot price.  “As far as the BTC options market is concerned, the trading volume is actually not very large compared to the current market value of BTC,” Allen Wang, head of trading at Babel Finance, said. “In a mature market, the average daily trading volume of options is about five to 20 times the trading volume of the underlying asset itself.  “It is still too early to talk about the impact of BTC options on bitcoin itself. The only certainty is that most options will become waste paper on the expiry date,” Wang added.  As of Tuesday, bitcoin’s global options volume was less than $1 billion, amounting to just 2% of the spot market volume of $43 billion, according to data source Skew and CoinGecko.  Options market activity has slowed down in recent months. Exchanges settled a record $6 billion worth of options in March - almost double the size of the September expiry.  Looking beyond expiry  The Sept. 24 expiry risk reversals, which measure the difference between the implied volatility of out-of-the-money (OTM) calls and OTM puts, have come off sharply from -5 to -20 this week. The greater the demand for an options contract, the greater its volatility and its price. Therefore, the decline in risk reversals indicates investors are adding downside protection.  “The options market reflects a tremendous amount of nervousness with risk reversals sinking to -20% due to high demand for puts over calls,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel.  The cryptocurrency fell for the third straight day on Tuesday, penetrating the $40,000 mark for the first time since early August on concerns surrounding Chinese real estate developer Evergrande Group’s debt crisis and fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to wind down its stimulus program soon. The selling aggravated after U.S. Securities Exchange and Commission Chairman Gary Gensler compared stablecoins to poker chips and reiterated the call to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.  B2C2′s Farthing said, “The options market looks to be indicating an underlying view that once the short-term FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) about lend/borrow and regulatory concerns dies down, the market may once again settle into an uptrend into year end.”  While short-term prospects appear to be bleak, the options market continues to exhibit long-term bullish signs, with the June 2022 expiry risk reversals holding above zero. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $42,600, representing a 4.8% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-eyes-3b-september-options-expiry-after-a-drop-to-40k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f18abc406f9d204df875b7ea367ecbd4c6340932-736x496.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411971,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otWZnn,1632346328,Federal Reserve Could Taper ‘Soon’ as Officials See Interest Rate Hike Next Year,"The U.S. Federal Reserve said it will keep interest rates near 0% and continue to purchase bonds at the same $120 billion-a-month pace it has been doing, but the market now has clarity on how the central bank will start to unwind, or taper, its stimulus program.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank’s monetary policy panel, said Wednesday in a statement that tapering the bank’s bond purchases “could be warranted soon,” because the economy has made progress toward its goal of maximum employment. The panel said it will keep the target rate for federal funds in a range of 0% to 0.25%.  The decision is being closely watched by bitcoin traders, many of whom say that the largest cryptocurrency can serve as a hedge against dollar debasement in the face of an ultra-loose monetary policy.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters during a press conference that the tapering process could end by the “middle of next year” if the economy continues to make progress toward maximum employment.  “Vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery indicators of economic activity,” Powell said.  “We are seeing upward pressure on prices,” he added, citing the impact of “supply bottlenecks”  Bitcoin’s price was little changed after the announcement, trading at around $43,200 – possibly a signal that traders remain unconvinced the Fed will turn hawkish anytime soon.  Many cryptocurrency investors speculate that “quantitative easing,” or QE, could weaken the dollar, pushing up the value of bitcoin, which has a capped supply. Bitcoin is also still seen on Wall Street as a speculative asset, and the bet is that more investors will be forced to seek such investments as QE – the practice of printing money to stimulate markets – suppresses returns in traditional bond markets.  Fed officials also raised their inflation expectations and moved the expected timeline for raising interest rates to 2022 from 2023, based on the “Summary of Economic Projections” (SEP), which was also released Wednesday. In the case that bitcoin is treated as a hedge against inflation because of its capped supply, this could be a positive note for crypto investors.  According to the summary of economic projections:  Federal officials’ median expectation for growth this year in gross domestic product dropped to 5.9% from the 7% expected in June, when they last disclosed projections.  The unemployment rate is seen at 4.8% this year, which is higher than what was projected in June.  Prices for personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, could rise 4.2% this year, compared with a June projection of 3.4%.  The median projection is now for two interest rate increases by the end of 2022, and three officials now see two rate hikes next year. At the June meeting, only seven Fed officials were expecting a liftoff that soon. (Not all Fed officials who plot dots are FOMC voting members, which means that the dots are a projection, not a forecast.)",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/22/tapering-could-come-soon-and-fed-officials-see-interest-rate-hike-next-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d6f277ccfa0ce62d80fe279754d618a4e712c88-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411985,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otXPFj,1632345405,Boba Network Launches as Ethereum’s Newest Layer 2,"Enya’s Boba Network announced its public mainnet launch on Monday, adding to a small but growing group of layer 2 technologies working atop the Ethereum blockchain.  The network joins other projects, including Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync and StarkWare, in addressing Ethereum’s ongoing scalability, or expansion, issues.  “Everyone has a smile when they drink boba,” Alan Chiu, founder of Boba Network and CEO of Enya, told CoinDesk during the Mainnet 2021 conference in New York on Wednesday, referring to the tea-based drink with tapioca pearls. “That’s how we want our users to feel when they use [Boba network]. It evokes happiness.”  The Boba Network is part of a subcategory of Ethereum layer 2s called Optimistic Rollups, which are derived from the open-source Optimism codebase. However, Boba would allow users to withdraw funds in minutes, as opposed to days, while using Optimism, said Chiu.  Since its beta launch last month, Boba Network has partnered with several DeFi projects, including DODO, a decentralized exchange (DEX) with approximately $70 million in total collateral locked, and Sake, a protocol that allows users to buy perpetual contracts.  Chiu said the network will increase demand for Ethereum by allowing engineers to build more sophisticated applications using a wider range of programming languages.  “We have a feature called Hybrid Compute, which allows developers to build advanced algorithms that are too expensive to do on-chain,” Chiu said. Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity “is really constraining, he added. “A lot of DeFi developers have had to dumb down their algorithms.”  The project, which was developed by OMG Foundation core contributor Enya, also announced it would be releasing a $BOBA token to support decentralized governance of the network.  “From a community perspective, we’re lucky to have inherited the OMG network,” Chiu said. “We have a DAO and a token, so BOBA token holders can participate in the governance of the network. We are also sharing the profits generated from the network with our token holders.”  Existing $OMG token holders are expected to receive a one-to-one drop of $BOBA tokens “later next month” if they bridge their $OMG tokens to the new Boba network.  The price of $OMG has surged 140% over the past three months, bringing OMG Network’s market capitalization to approximately $1.3 billion.  Chiu also told CoinDesk that Boba Network plans to incentivize developers with the launch of an ecosystem fund “sometime in Q4.”  “Boba is targeting both DeFi and NFT use cases,” Chiu said. “We’re also the only layer 2 solution with a token.”  “Ethereum certainly has product market fit. That’s why there’s so much focus on helping it scale,” Chiu added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ARB,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/22/boba-network-launches-as-ethereums-newest-layer-2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edd2f247d5aa782ddb78fb739b082e801d7a1f40-1500x1007.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Traders expect volatility to remain elevated ahead of bitcoin’s September options expiry on Friday. And technical charts show limited upside for BTC toward the $47,000 resistance level.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled that it could start to scale back, or taper, its monthly asset purchases sooner rather than later. Fed officials are preparing to reverse the central bank’s pandemic stimulus programs in November and expect to raise interest rates by the end of next year.  While overall market sentiment is improving, some analysts are concerned that tighter monetary policy could be a headwind for assets deemed to be risky such as equities and cryptocurrencies.  “With so little room for additional central bank accommodation, given an already depressed interest rate environment, the prospect for sustainable runs to the topside on stimulus, should no longer be as enticing to investors,” Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Group, wrote Wednesday in a report.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $43,400, +3.3%  Ether (ETH), $3,023, +4.8%  S&P 500: +1.0%  Gold: $1,768, -0.4%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.306%  Bitcoin options expiry  Major crypto options exchanges, including industry leader Deribit, are due to settle billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin options contracts on Friday. Analysts don’t expect the monthly expiration to have a notable impact on bitcoin, which has been under pressure this week because of macro and regulatory concerns, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.  Data provided by Skew shows a total of 73,700 options contracts worth $3.14 billion due for expiry Friday, of which nearly 50,000 are call options and the rest are puts. Deribit alone will be settling more than 85% of the total open interest.  While short-term prospects appear to be bleak, the options market continues to exhibit long-term bullishness, with the June 2022 expiry risk reversals holding above zero, according to Godbole.  Risk reversals measure the difference between the implied volatility of out-of-the-money (OTM) calls and OTM puts.  Volatility on watch  “The options market reflects a tremendous amount of nervousness,” crypto hedge fund QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram post on Tuesday. The firm highlighted bitcoin resistance near $47,000, which could stall a short-term bounce.  “We entered Monday long gamma in ETH (particularly long puts) and short spot in BTC and ETH,” QCP wrote.  Options traders who are long gamma essentially make money based on large movements in the underlying asset.  The chart below shows a slight pickup in bitcoin’s implied volatility from low levels last seen in May.  NFT active supply  Elsewhere, the market for non-fungible tokens (NFT) continues to heat up with a growing presence of long-term holders.  The chart below shows the percentage of the CryptoPunks supply that transferred (not necessarily sold) during a given time period. Released in June 2017, CryptoPunks were one of the first set of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.  “The supply of CryptoPunks has been the most active it has ever been in 2021,” CoinMetrics wrote in a Tuesday newsletter. “At the end of May, about 50% of the 10K CryptoPunks had moved within the last 3 months (yellow+red+dark red bands).”  However, the six- to 12-month band has been growing, which could be a sign that buyers from earlier this year view CryptoPunks as assets to hold, according to CoinMetrics.  Flash crash on Pyth network  Bitcoin briefly crashed to $5,402 (not a typo) Monday on Pyth Network oracle’s BTC/USD feed, causing liquidations to occur on a highly uncertain published price.  The Solana-based oracle network acting as a bridge between blockchains and real-world data said the flash crash was caused by two of its data sources publishing a near-zero price and receiving a relatively higher weight from the network’s aggregation logic. As such, the average price crashed to lows near $5,000, reports CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma.  Altcoin roundup  Boba Network launches as Ethereum’s newest layer 2, announces $BOBA token: The new network, which was built by Enya, the developers behind the OMG Foundation, went live Monday morning. Existing $OMG token holders are expected to receive a one-to-one drop of $BOBA tokens later next month if they bridge their $OMG tokens to the new Boba network. The price of $OMG has surged 140% over the past three months, bringing OMG Network’s market capitalization to about $1.3 billion.  Dapper Labs said to reach $7.6B valuation in $250M funding round: Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot and the Flow blockchain, closed a $250 million funding round, reported CoinDesk’s Eli Tan. Coatue led the funding round, which also included Andreessen Horowitz, Google’s GV and Version One Ventures.

Solana-based DEX Orca raises $18M Series A: Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX), has raised $18 million in a Series A funding round that was led by Polychain, Three Arrows Capital and Placeholder, CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley reported. Orca will use the funds to continue developing its automated market maker (AMM).

Coatue led the raise, which also included Andreessen Horowitz, Google’s GV and Version One Ventures. According to a source familiar with the deal, Dapper Labs received a $7.6 billion valuation.  “We’ve proved the concept, which is why our investors are so eager to partner with us,” Roham Gharegozlou, CEO of Dapper Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Gharegozlou believes non-fungible token (NFT) highlights will be “the currency of fandom” and says the raise will help expand NBA Top Shot operations and lead to new sports ventures worldwide, including European soccer with its huge fan base.  The Dapper mega-round comes just a day after soccer NFT giant Sorare raised $680 million in a raise that valued the Paris-based fantasy sports platform at $4.3 billion.

The marketplace will feature digital collectibles from the league’s 20 teams, including world-renowned clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Dapper Labs is planning to launch the soccer marketplace in the summer of 2022.  NBA Top Shot, the crown jewel of Dapper Labs’ suite, has seen exponential growth in the past year, with $780 million worth of collectibles traded on the platform across 1.1 million registered accounts in 2021.

42411989,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otXPfB,1632332452,Neopets Looks to NFTs to Revive Its Early-Aughts Glory,"Can a pivot to the metaverse help a once-loved brand return to prominence?  One-time gaming giant Neopets has announced the launch of a non-funbile token (NFT) collection, “The Neopets Metaverse Collection,” currently set for release in mid-October.  The drop, which will be hosted by Solana-native Raydium exchange, will be a run of 20,500 “equally unique, algorithmically generated lovable Neopets” featuring “variable backgrounds, assets, clothing, and personality,” per the release. The target per-NFT sale price and method was not disclosed.  When it comes to NFT marketplaces, collectors have an embarrassment of riches from which to choose.  With dozens of options across nearly as many chains, securing market share often comes down to the quality of licensing and intellectual property a platform can attract. Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, for instance, has proven to be a success almost entirely on the back of the NBA Top Shot tradable highlights collection.  Read more: The Value of NFTs Is Belonging  Raydium, which launched its DropZone distribution platform just two weeks ago, has scored a major victory on this front by securing such a well-known brand.  Neopets, which was launched by a pair of college students in 1997, led the web in several key “stickiness” metrics at the peak of its popularity. In 2004, users spent three hours a month on the site – the best in any website category, per Nielsen.  Ownership of the company traded hands three times between 2005 and 2017, however, and traffic metrics have long been on the decline. In 2020, the CEO for current owner JumpStart Games, Jim Czulewicz, estimated there are just 1.5 million monthly active players.  Metaverse mania  While the brand and website have lost the luster enjoyed in the early aughts, market trends indicate the NFT sale could be a blowout: recent NFT drops with nostalgic appeal have seen tremendous success.  Treeverse, Ethermore and Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult – all collections that harken back to fantasy games such as “Runescape,” another early 2000s hit – have proven to be popular on the secondary market, and all are likewise exploring in-game functionality.  Additionally, major brands making a pivot to the metaverse is quickly becoming a trend. In June, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced in a video to employees that the company would be transitioning to a five-year metaverse strategy.  As a brand, Neopets may be well-suited for such a shift – the website already includes a digital currency, neopoints (though it is not backed by blockchain technology), and includes dozens of mini-games. By many definitions, the Neopets world is already a metaverse.  The press release did not contain any hints as to whether this would be the first step in a larger shift for Neopets, and JumpStart Games did not respond for a request for comment by the time of publication.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | FLOW | RAY,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/22/neopets-looks-to-nfts-to-revive-its-early-aughts-glory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ae55d4928440bdc6831c8d740105ddaad2f096a-4485x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ripple would integrate its distributed ledger technology into Bhutan&apos;s existing payment system for the trial as the Ripple-powered currency would be used for cross-border remittances as well as settlement services.

The ban was initially supposed to go into effect on July 22 and then was delayed until Sept. 2. There was a second delay to Sept. 30, announced earlier this month. The ban has now been postponed yet again, this time to Dec. 1, following “ongoing discussions” between the two parties, BlockFi said.  BlockFi said it is in “active dialogue with regulators” and “firmly believes that it is lawful and appropriate for crypto market participants.”  The company said the order is not currently in effect and has no impact on its current BIA clients or those of any of its other products.  The N.J. BOS has said the BIAs are equivalent to unregistered securities, while BlockFi has argued they are not.  BlockFi is facing similar scrutiny of its interest-bearing crypto accounts from Kentucky, Vermont, Texas and Alabama. BlockFi has said before that it is in “active dialogue with multiple regulators” regarding the accounts.

42394422,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdE3x,1632324325,Who Watches the Chain Watchers?,"Yesterday we had a major scoop from CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson, who unearthed a set of slides showing the crypto investigations firm Chainalysis has been running a wallet explorer site that scrapes users’ IP addresses as part of the firm’s investigative services for law enforcement agencies.  While the idea of a honeypot website harvesting IP data is definitely creepy, I would argue Chainalysis’ apparent methods here are laudable because the data is gathered as part of targeted investigations rather than as a form of sweeping surveillance. Legislators around the world sometimes seem to forget the distinction, as when they pressure companies like Apple for backdoors into its system that compromise the privacy of all users – or, increasingly, push for crypto legislation with blanket invasive surveillance requirements.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Particularly notable here is that the block explorer in question, walletexplorer.com, is not particularly well-known, at least in the West. That, along with its primitive appearance, suggests that Chainalysis may have actively promoted it in criminal circles, perhaps even as a “safe” alternative to more mainstream block explorers. The IP addresses gathered by the site, as the leaked slides explain, could be correlated with other data, on and off the blockchain, to help establish the real-world identities of investigation targets. That means that if you’re not in Chainalysis’ crosshairs, visiting its block explorer is unlikely to have compromised your identity on its own.  Now, this is not an advice column for criminals, but if it were, this would be my takeaway: Don’t use cryptocurrency to do crime. For whatever reason, early discussion of Bitcoin often described it as “anonymous,” but that’s profoundly inaccurate. In fact, real privacy is extremely hard to implement on public blockchains, which in many cases must keep transaction data transparent to function. That includes, in the case of Bitcoin, a public record of every transaction ever.  So while a Bitcoin wallet provides a useful level of everyday privacy in that it doesn’t have your name attached to it, there’s a whole lot of metadata that can be correlated. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that data often leads back to a real-world name – the IP addresses gathered by Chainalysis are one obvious source of clues, but probably not the only one. Even crypto specifically designed for privacy seems to have major limits – Chainalysis also claims it was able to “provide usable leads” in 65% of investigations on the Monero blockchain.  Read more: Look to Design, Not Laws, to Protect Privacy in the Surveillance Age | Raullen Chai  The good news is that if you’re looking for money laundering services, you have some better options. If you’re a big enough fish, give megabank HSBC a call: The bank has been extremely attentive to the illicit finance needs of Mexican drug cartels. If your requirements are more esoteric, consider a trip to Vatican City: The Holy See, through its affiliated banks, allegedly played a key role in funneling the Central Intelligence Agency’s drug money to terrorist cells throughout Italy and Europe as part of Operation Gladio.  Again, this is not a criminal advice column – but I hope I’m doing some good here. We already know (thanks to Chainalysis, in fact), that the level of criminal activity on blockchain networks is low. It’s simply not an application the technology is built to fit, or maybe ever will be. The more people figure that out, the less pressure authorities can bring to bear to systematically compromise the privacy of law-abiding citizens.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42411999,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otXQ0O,1632322828,"Since ‘Golden Cross,’ Bitcoin Is Down 12%; Blame the Fed?","Macroeconomic fears have gripped the bitcoin market over the past week, despite the appearance in price charts of a “golden cross” pattern that’s typically seen as a bullish indicator.  A golden cross is when the 50-day moving average of an asset’s price climbs above its 200-day average. It happened in the bitcoin market on Sept. 15 for the first time in 15 months.  But bitcoin’s price has receded by 12% to $42,000 since the golden cross appeared.  “I think the market got itself a little too long,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said in an interview on CNBC.  During the 11 months following bitcoin’s previous golden cross in May 2020, the price rose 10-fold to $64,800.  So market sentiment turned quite bullish after the signal’s recent appearance.  Macroeconomic factors might be playing spoilsport.  Risky assets from stocks to bitcoin took a beating earlier this week on fears that a debt default by China’s troubled Evergrande Group could taint broader markets, while uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s next move has kept some traders on the sidelines.  Additional bearish pressure for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies stemmed from renewed regulatory fears. On Tuesday, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler doubled down on his call for crypto regulation and compared stablecoins to poker chips.  “The China news scared people,” Novogratz said in the CNBC interview. ”Worry about [the] Fed coming out and, you know, talking about stablecoins and regulation. There was just a lot of nervousness in the market, and you washed a lot of shorter-term risk out.”  The seven-day price action offers a reminder of the reality that macro factors can often push markets in vastly divergent directions from those inferred from reading price-chart patterns, a practice known as “technical analysis.”  The last time bitcoin saw a golden cross, major central banks had just started printing unprecedented amounts of money to contain the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.  Many traders and analysts say that bitcoin’s rally over the rest of the year was partly a result of the liquidity deluge, with inflation concerns fueling investor demand for bitcoin as “digital gold.”  However, the latest golden cross is accompanied by speculation that the Fed might soon start to taper its $120 billion-a-month of asset purchases via a monetary-stimulus program known as quantitative easing, or QE.  Several Fed officials have recently said they want to start unwinding the crisis-era stimulus before year-end.  The U.S. central bank’s latest monetary-policy meeting is scheduled to conclude today; a statement is due at 2 p.m. ET (18 UTC) followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The announcements will be closely watched for more clues on the Fed’s tapering timetable.  Based on soft recent economic data including a slower-than-expected pace of inflation in August, “we expect the Fed will refrain from providing more details at this meeting, as the Fed has already made it clear that tapering is set to begin before year-end,” Danske Bank said, according to FXStreet. “We believe the tapering pace is more important than the timing. We continue to expect that tapering will be concluded in mid-2022.”  Danske Bank expects the Fed to bring forward the timing of the first interest rate hike to 2022 from 2023. Eurodollar futures are pricing in exactly one quarter-point rate hike from the Fed next year, as Bloomberg’s Brian Chappatta noted on Twitter. Many investors expect the Fed to taper its asset purchases before any rate hikes commence.  Bitcoin may suffer deeper losses if the Fed signals a faster tapering, or if officials project rate hikes sooner than markets are currently pricing.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/22/since-golden-cross-bitcoin-is-down-12-blame-the-fed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e7cdecffd60b3e8264cf1d97e84fee38fa1147b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In April, Kava Labs began offering a protocol upgrade dubbed “Kava 5” that gives users of apps built on Kava access to new features.

On Monday, news broke that Robinhood was testing a wallet to enable cryptocurrency transfers after a hidden image of a wait-list page for users was discovered in the beta version of the app.  Robinhood users can now join that waiting list to get early access to the wallet as it is rolled out. Testing will begin next month, Robinhood announced Wednesday.  “We want to make sure our systems are scaling and that we’re prepared to handle the full load,” Christine Brown, Robinhood’s chief operating officer, told CoinDesk.  “So we’ll be giving people from the wait list access first, and then we’ll have general availability out to 100% by early 2022,” Brown said.  Users can also jump up the wait list by referring other people. A user referring a friend who then joins the waitlist themselves will move up the list “by half”, Brown explained.  Aside from the waiting list, Robinhood is also opening an “alpha” program, whereby a very small group of users will be invited to get hands-on access to the wallet, which is in the final stages of development, to provide feedback on its features and functionality.  Robinhood has seven cryptocurrencies available to trade on its platform, all of which will be supported in its wallet “from the get-go,” according to Brown.  ‘When wallets?’  Robinhood began offering crypto trading in 2018, and growth in use of the service has accelerated over the last 12 months. Some 9.5 million customers traded cryptocurrencies in the first quarter, up from 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year.  Last month, the company reported that crypto trading accounted for 41% of its revenue in the second quarter, with more than 60% of its customers trading cryptocurrencies.  With that surge in demand, the lack of facility to transfer their crypto assets elsewhere has been a source of some consternation from users.  “If you go to any of our Twitter posts, you can see users saying, ‘I want to withdraw my crypto – when are you releasing wallets?’” Brown said.  Robinhood has spent several months reassuring users that an expansion of crypto features including a wallet to enable transfers in and out of the platform was in the works.

In late August, he weighed in on cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC-USD), calling them a bubble.

42411998,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otXQD7,1632310200,Valid Points: Are We Witnessing the Death of DeFi Tokens?,"This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  The term “DeFi Summer” was coined after the birth and success of governance tokens and “yield farming” in the dog days of 2020. Ethereum as a network found success in hosting decentralized exchanges, lending markets and the occasional Ponzi scheme.  New platforms used liquidity mining, or distribution of their token to users, to acquire capital and create larger and more efficient markets. Unsustainable yields and token distribution were met with increased usage and crazy speculation that grew decentralized finance (DeFi) to a $7 billion market by September 2020.  Read more: What Is DeFi?  Aave, Compound, Uniswap and SushiSwap all quickly established themselves as blue chips in the space and, in turn, gained billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL) and market capitalization. Value quickly accrued to the platforms’ governance tokens, and the assets soared against both the dollar and ether.  Sentiment has since changed, however, with most major DeFi tokens losing their allure and finding themselves in a seven-month downtrend relative to ether. Now investors are seemingly questioning whether DeFi can recover and whether the space can outperform the market as it did during DeFi Summer.  The lackluster performance of governance tokens brings me to a series of questions about whether investors are doubting the value accrual of tokenized applications or whether they are betting on a larger value accrual to the network itself. Does the market doubt the sustainability of DeFi revenue? Is it easier to bet on the success of the overall ecosystem than any one specific project? Has Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559′s burn mechanism secured ether’s outperformance of DeFi?  Aave’s market size has grown from $3.6 billion to $27.5 billion since Feb. 1, but its governance token is down 69% relative to ether. Uniswap’s UNI token is also trading down 67% relative to ether from its highs in March.  I am excited to continue to watch this narrative play out. Will we see the return of DeFi, or is this another case of “token not needed”?  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  OpenSea’s head of product stepped down after being accused of profiting on insider information. BACKGROUND: The transparent nature of blockchains allowed users to catch an in-house trading scandal at OpenSea and led to the departure of Nate Chastain. He purchased non-fungible tokens (NFTs) before OpenSea listed them on their front-page and sold them for a profit of 19 ETH.  ‘0xMaki’ stepped down as the project lead of Sushi and moved into an advisory role. BACKGROUND: 0xMaki played a large role in keeping Sushi alive after a humble beginning and a rug-pull from founder, Chef Nomi. The market reacted poorly to 0xMaki’s announcement, highlighting his importance to the DeFi project.  Coinbase moved away from crypto lending products after a dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BACKGROUND: The SEC warned that a crypto-based lending product could be deemed a security. The SEC’s disapproval highlights the need for decentralized lending markets and could drive further adoption of lending applications like Compound and Aave.  OpenSea “soft launched” a mobile app that will allow users to interact with their own collections and the marketplace. BACKGROUND: OpenSea has undoubtedly helped progress NFT adoption and drive new users into crypto. Further improvements in user experience will continue to grow the crypto and NFT markets. The OpenSea team has made no official announcements regarding the launch of the app.  Layer 2 scaling solution Arbitrum One suffered 45 minutes of downtime on Sept. 14. BACKGROUND: The Arbitrum Sequencer went offline and briefly paused the submission of transactions on Arbitrum One. The team announced that the downtime was the result of a “large burst in transactions in a short period of time” and that user funds were never at risk.

Investors who had minted past pieces like CryptoPunks in 2018 had their wallets &apos;fattened&apos; as they fetched a high price due to their rarity. Collectables minted more recently in sites like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Art Blocks Curated were traded for millions of dollars. There were high volumes recorded on different platforms that act as marketplaces for NFTs. However, regardless of the high volume of sales made, research shows that assets of low prices were rarely exchanged. According to Bloomberg, 73.17% of NFTs on OpenSea did not change possession in the past 90 days; and if they did, there was only one transaction made. The number of transactions made on OpenSea by Bloomberg To achieve a sale, investors put in up to $100 to mint to create a hype around it to attract sales. NFTs that are priced low seem to be of low value. The collections become meaningless as nobody buys them. For an investor not to miss a chance on sales, they must be at the right place at the right time to get the correct information. Is the NFT market dead?

42411987,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otXPOD,1632310055,Bitcoin Flash Crashed to $5K on Pyth Network’s Data Feed,"Bitcoin briefly crashed to $5,402 (not a typo) Monday on Pyth Network oracle’s BTC/USD feed, causing liquidations to occur on a highly uncertain published price.  Per the official blog post, the unusually low price was registered between 12:21 and 12:23 UTC on Monday when the cryptocurrency traded around $43,500 on major centralized exchanges.  The Solana-based oracle network acting as a bridge between blockchains and real world data said the flash crash was caused by two of its data sources publishing a near-zero price and receiving a relatively higher weight from the network’s aggregation logic. As such, the average price crashed to lows near $5,000.  “The Pyth aggregation logic combined these prices with nine other publishers resulting in a low aggregate price with a wide confidence interval,” Pyth Network said on Wednesday. The Pyth BTC/UDC aggregate price had several sharp dips below $40,000 on Monday and the confidence levels became extremely wide.  Confidence interval refers to the degree of uncertainty with any statistic and is often used with a margin of error. Pyth Network compares publishers’ confidence intervals in dollar terms. So, lower price implies a smaller confidence interval in dollar terms and higher weight in the aggregate.  Solana programs that rely on Pyth prices were impacted by this plunge. The effect was exacerbated due to some programs relying on the aggregate price feed without using the confidence interval price, according to the statement. “This allowed liquidations to occur even though the published price was highly uncertain,” said Pyth Network.  The flash crash has turned out to be bad optics for Pyth, with the rival Chainlink community criticizing the Solana-based oracle for data inaccuracies.  It also provided an opportunity for devotees of traditional centralized finance to criticize oracle-based decentralized finance as a whole.  “On-chain oracle data often has problems with corrupt feeds or corrupt data,” said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG. “You kind of take that as a risk if you have positions open on a decentralized exchange.”  Decentralized exchanges get their data on-chain from oracles. Data distribution on-chain is slow and sometimes false data gets distributed as there aren’t sufficient quality checks performed, unlike paid data from Bloomberg or Reuters, for example, Heusser explained.  This isn’t the first issue that the Pyth Network has suffered. Connected to the Solana blockchain, which was down for 17 hours last week, Pyth also witnessed the outage.  “Solana’s recent turbulence in the form of a 17-hour outage, which meant that users were unable to process transactions, together with an eye-catching error by Pyth data network which is run by some of Wall Street’s biggest players, is certainly not to be taken lightly by the core dev team,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital.  However, Vinokourov added that this should not be the cause of alarm for its long-term growth prospects. “After all, it is unlikely that these issues would have manifested if not for the overwhelming growth of the network. Even Google suffers an occasional outage,” he said.  In order to avoid this from happening again, the Pyth Network said in its statement that it will be developing a suggested integration testing protocol that publishers can run to validate their software changes, making it easier to run sanity checks and validate the data.  Secondly, it will adjust the aggregation logic to properly weigh prices that span a large range of values, and lastly, it will be focusing on accurately reflecting the market through “enhanced documentation,” according to the statement.

13222665,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=472191,1632303291,How NFTs are Impacting Artists’ Lives: Enter Bullseum,"NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are brought to the world by the blockchain. They are similar to cryptocurrencies, but NFTs are different. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs are unique tokens. They display ownership, source and history on a permanent, transparent, decentralized, secure and open-source database. NFTs are disrupting or on the verge of disrupting numerous fields. To name but a few: Art Collectibles Gaming Real Estate Music Of all these fields, without a double leading the innovation in this space from the beginning are artists themselves. Many of these have had life-changing stories. There is Trevor Jones, the Canadian painter living in Scotland who went from working four jobs to support his art career to selling his Bitcoin Angel for $3.2 million in February, which was at the time a record for the &apos;most expensive open-edition NFT artwork&apos;. There is Ben Mauro, the artist who went from struggling to make ends meet to becoming a millionaire. Another star example is that of Blake Jamieson. He&apos;s a 36-year-old Brooklyn artist whose career exploded when he made over $46,000 in NFTs sales in just over six weeks. He placed his artwork on platforms like SuperRare and OpenSea.

CoinDesk confirmed Spagni was released. The release provides Spagni some freedom, at least temporarily, while he attempts to “address this matter” and put it behind him “once and for all.”  According to court documents filed Tuesday, the U.S. had not received the required documents from the South African government by this week’s deadline and, as such, Spagni has been allowed to take up residence in the Middle District of Tennessee. Spagni must also appear in court as required and must surrender as directed if ordered to be extradited to South Africa, the filing further states.  The former Monero maintainer was arrested in Nashville, Tenn. on July 20, at the request of South African authorities and charged for crimes unrelated to the crypto industry.  A regional court in Cape Town oversaw charges against Spagni that included fraud but did not hear his testimony as he failed to appear in court, despite previously pleading not guilty. It was alleged Spagni had stolen roughly $100,000 from his former employer, Cape Cookies.  Following his arrest in the U.S., Spagni hired Brian Klein, a leading crypto trial attorney, to fight his extradition to South Africa.  Spagni entered the crypto space in 2011 by mining bitcoin before stumbling upon Monero during its early inception and becoming its lead maintainer – a role responsible for executing the release procedures in Github repositories – before stepping down in 2019.

On the previous day&apos;s Cardano price analysis chart, VET was following a good trend. However, when the daily price analysis chart came in, intense selling pressure caused the prices to plummet to their lowest point on the daily price analysis chart.

We anticipate the decline to continue throughout the day, with a first bear target of $210 set. This is in case the buyers don&apos;t consolidate enough power to withstand any future upside rejections. In the overall market, cryptocurrencies are trading bearishly, with BTC losing 4.15 percent in value. Ethereum, on the other hand, has dropped by more than 6% on the 24-hour dial, while Cardano decreased 7.49 percent to take the lead as the worst performer. Monero price analysis in the last 24 hours: XMR/USD struggles to beat $230 resistance The XMR/USD pair was confined to a limited daily range, which crossed an intraday low of $214 and an intraday high of $226. The range implies decreased volatility. The daily trading volume also increased by 37 percent to $221 million, according to our daily Monero price analysis. Meanwhile, the last 24 hours have witnessed a 5.5 percent decrease in Monero&apos;s total market capitalization to a sum of $4.589 billion....",NEGATIVE,BTC | XMR,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XMR,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13AtFc0lj7IqzUGT5aWO9DEx,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png

Armstrong described the agency&apos;s behavior as &apos;sketchy&apos; after the SEC seemingly threatened the exchange that a lawsuit would be impending should Coinbase launch their expected interest-yielding product, Lend. If Armstrong&apos;s tweet thread didn&apos;t give it away, the company&apos;s blog post, spearheaded by Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, was undoubtedly lined with some of the firm&apos;s frustrations. Now, less than a month later, reports have emerged that Coinbase has elected to halt it&apos;s plans to launch Coinbase Lend. A Threat To DeFi? The news comes less than a week after SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC that his commission is under-staffed. Gensler echoed those sentiments in a Senate testimony last week, stating that the SEC &apos;needs a lot more people.&apos; He added in the testimony that he believed previous judiciary decisions established that many cryptocurrency tokens &apos;do come under the securities law.&apos; Gensler took the role with the SEC earlier this year, and came in with high expectations from retail investors.
