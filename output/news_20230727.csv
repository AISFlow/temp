15364056,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544684,1690498829,"Dogecoin Falls While Others Rally, Is It Decoupling From The Market?","Over the last day, the majority of the crypto market has been rallying alongside Bitcoin. But Dogecoin seems to have a mind of its own as it has gone in the opposite direction. The meme coin started out Thursday with a decline, which follows the trend of DOGE deviating from the general crypto market trend over the past week. Dogecoin Fails To Register Similar Gains To Larger Altcoins Dogecoin has struggled to keep up with the gains of top altcoins such as Ethereum and XRP. In this time, the meme coin has maintained a rather constrained trend, falling over 3% in the early hours of Thursday while the likes of Bitcoin saw recoveries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Patterns Suggest Bull Market Is Not Starting In 2023 This is not the first that DOGE has gone in the opposite direction in as many days. Earlier in the week, the price of Bitcoin fell below $30,000, taking the broader market down with it. However, DOGE remained resilient in the face of this bear trend as billionaire Elon Musk reiterated his support for the digital asset once more. With the change of Twitter to X, Musk had changed his location to X but added the infamous DOGE symbol as well. This move sparked speculation of Dogecoin being integrated into the social media platform as a payment method and the price rallied as a result of this. Thus, while digital assets across the space saw their prices falling, Dogecoin was rising as high as double-digit daily gains. So the meme coin’s deviation during the market recovery comes as no surprise given the expected cool-off from its earlier rally. DOGE price struggles to break $0.08 resistance | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com DOGE Becomes 7th-Largest Cryptocurrency Despite Dogecoin not following the market uptrend, the meme coin continues to maintain its standing in the market. DOGE is currently the 7th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $11.1 billion. This puts it ahead of Cardano, which lost its spot to the meme coin following’s DOGE’s multiple rallies this week. However, DOGE is currently seeing a significant slowdown in its momentum with a rapid decline in daily trading volume. According to Coinmarketcap, the daily trading volume of Dogecoin is down more than 45% in the last day to rest at $678 million at this time. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says It’s Time To Buy Dogecoin, Here’s Why This nosedive in trading volume indicates that investors may already be moving away from the asset as they believe the rally might already be over. Given this, the meme coin may have a hard time mounting a recovery at this level.

42392908,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgD8b1,1690495863,"Bitcoin Erases Losses, Holds Near $29.3K as Nasdaq Gains Nearly 2%","As U.S. equity markets closed on Friday, bitcoin (BTC) was up slightly but continued to trade in a slim range.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently changing hands at $29,286, up 0.4% over the past 24 hours. That was also an increase from around $29,100 earlier in the day after the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose a hefty 11 basis points to 0.55%.  Overnight, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) had announced a hawkish adjustment to its yield curve control (YCC) program, as CoinDesk previously reported, raising its cap on the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to 1% from 0.5%. The move came amid calls from the International Monetary Fund to begin normalizing that country's ultra-loose policy and could potentially affect global liquidity and risk assets including bitcoin.  ETH, SHIB, ADA  Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto in market value, followed a similar path on Friday and was changing hands at $1,872, an 0.7% gain over the past 24 hours. Other major altcoins tilted a little more to positive territory with popular memecoin SHIB among the brightest stories, recently climbing 6.6% from Thursday, same time. ADA, the token of smart contracts platform Cardano, was up 1.4%.  Inflation news  This morning's report on the PCE Price Index – the U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge – show prices up 3% year-over-year in June, shy of forecasts for 3.1% and down from 3.8% in May. The core rate fell to 4.1% against estimates for 4.2% and 4.6% previously.  There was little reaction in bitcoin following the backward looking data, but perhaps taking its cue from surging stocks – the Nasdaq closed up 1.9%, helped by a 6% rise in Intel (INTC) following a positive earnings report – the crypto managed an advance to the $29,500 level.  The broader CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) recently moved 0.7% higher for the day.  Gene Hoffman, CEO and president of blockchain and smart-contract platform Chia Network, expects bitcoin to continue trading sideways with a possible slight turn upward in August, a historically slow month in financial markets.

42392918,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgD9fh,1690495826,Grayscale Urges Equal Treatment for All Spot Bitcoin ETF's in Letter to SEC,"Grayscale Investments said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should approve all bitcoin exchange-traded fund application together, as approving only a few would give the winning applications an ""unfair"" advantage.  Grayscale is locked in a months-long legal battle to have its own application to convert its trust product into an ETF.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should approve all spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications simultaneously if it approves any, to grant equal treatment to all applicants, Grayscale Investments said in a statement to the SEC on Thursday.  An approval of only the listed proposals, which include, Ark 21 Shares, Invesco Galaxy, iShares (BlackRock), Valkyrie, VanEck, WisdomTree and Wise Origin (Fidelity), would reflect a positive “but sudden and significant change in the Commission’s application of the relevant statutory standard, and as such would improperly grant an unfairly discriminatory and prejudicial first-mover advantage to these proposals,” said the statement.  However, the statement also suggested that these applicants’ work on a surveillance-sharing agreement with crypto exchange Coinbase may not meet the SEC’s requirements.  “Without disputing the usefulness of information obtainable under a surveillance-sharing agreement with a spot bitcoin trading venue,” Grayscale said, “we believe the Commission’s prior decisions have already determined that such an agreement with a venue lacking compulsory investigative authority and oversight by a comprehensive market regulator does not satisfy Section 6(b)(5) in the absence of a surveillance-sharing agreement with a market of significant size that, like the CME bitcoin futures market, the Commission deems sufficiently ‘regulated.’”  The SEC previously rejected Grayscale’s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF, but has approved a number of futures-based bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC for denying the conversion in June last year. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.  Grayscale manages the world’s largest bitcoin fund, GBTC, which is a popular way for institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without holding the asset directly. GBTC has long traded at a large discount to the underlying value of bitcoin, but it has recently seen this discount narrow following BlackRock’s application for a bitcoin spot ETF.  Last month saw a flurry of bitcoin spot ETF applications from large institutions such as BlackRock and VanEck.  “An approval that promotes investor protection and fairness for issuers should therefore be made simultaneously with approval of all proposed spot bitcoin ETPs, including those such as the Trust whose Rule 19b-4 filings were previously disapproved after lengthy Commission consideration,” said the statement.  If the SEC decides to change course and approve one or more of the above stated spot bitcoin ETF applications, “it must do so in a fair and orderly manner,” the statement said.  In a letter highlighting the statement’s points, Grayscale’s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said Grayscale does not believe an introduction of a surveillance-sharing agreement with a spot bitcoin market is or should be the “silver bullet” to gaining approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/27/grayscale-urges-equal-treatment-for-all-spot-bitcoin-etfs-in-letter-to-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50843761c659085469dffbc690d8fa2b2c9af4b7-2878x1540.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S. House Representative further stated that this bill would have prevented the FTX crisis and provided much-needed clarity in crypto. Hill said: This legislation would not only have prevented FTX from stealing billions of customer funds, but also establishes robust consumer protections and clear rules of the road for market participants. In addition, the FIT21 Act will enhance cooperation between the two financial regulators trying to assume control of the U.S. crypto market. U.S. Representative Dusty Johnson, another sponsor of the bill, emphasized this motion saying: The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table.

The cryptocurrency, which aims to distinguish humans from AI online while preserving privacy, has a fully diluted market capitalization of $23 billion. The article explores the team behind Worldcoin, the tokenomics of WLD, and raises some major concerns about the project. On July 24th, yet another cryptocurrency made its way to the market. The highly polarizing Worldcoin (WLD-USD) officially launched on Optimism ( OP-USD ) as early ecosystem participants were airdropped the new Worldcoin token. With a $23 billion fully diluted market capitalization as of article submission, Worldcoin currently has the 6th largest cryptocurrency valuation in the entire crypto market. In this article, we'll look at who is behind Worldcoin, how the network works, the tokenomics of Worldcoin, and some of the major concerns that have been expressed with this project. Background Worldcoin was developed by a US-based organization called Tools for Humanity and is governed by a ""memberless"" Cayman Islands-based non-profit called the Worldcoin Foundation. The founders of Tools for Humanity are Alex Blania and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Worldcoin's mission is to provide a ""proof-of-personhood"" Digital ID system that is borderless and privacy-preserving. According to Worldcoin's founders : If successful, we believe Worldcoin could drastically increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans from AI online while preserving privacy, enable global democratic processes, and eventually show a potential path to AI-funded UBI. The rationale behind this kind of system is due to the belief that growth in AI will further obfuscate humans from bots. From where I sit, this is actually a fairly valid concern with AI-generated deep fakes potentially causing major problems in the future. Authenticating human activity does actually make some sense in theory. The UBI component of Worldcoin comes from the founders' belief that AI will also displace human workers as technology reduces the need for human labor in the future. How the Network Works Worldcoin has been under development for roughly 3 years. So far, the protocol has a little over 2 million unique users. Most of those users have been amassed over the last 2 years while the project was in beta. The way users create their Digital ID is highly polarizing within the crypto community and with privacy groups due to the use of biometric data. Worldcoin When a user wants to generate an ID, they have to download the World App and find a physical Worldcoin orb that is operated by contractors. Worldcoin's developers are aiming for 1,500 operational orbs globally by the end of the year but so far there are roughly 150 live orbs. Through an iris scan with the orb, the user creates a proof of personhood ID that is linked to a secret key that is stored on the user's device. Following the creation of this Digital ID with Worldcoin, the user is then eligible for Worldcoin tokens that are airdropped directly to the wallet address. Tokenomics While it's already one of the largest coins by fully diluted market cap, the circulating market cap is actually ranked sub-100 at a little over $255 million. Of the 10 billion total supply of Worldcoin tokens, just 112 million are currently in circulation. This means the circulating supply of Worldcoin is slightly above 1%; which would be one of the smallest circulating supply percentages in all of crypto. Given how recent the token launch was, this microscopic circulating supply might not be terribly surprising. However, the vesting schedule shows there is significant anticipation of token unlocking over the next 3 years: WLD Vesting Schedule (Token Unlocks) The rate of emission in this coin is dramatic. According to Token Unlocks , the 12-month emission from the current circulating supply level is over 1,080%. This means that growth in adoption of the coin and the Worldcoin protocol must rise with issuance or the price of Worldcoin is susceptible to declines, possibly large ones. The emissions don't slowdown in twelve months either. By July 2026, 6.5 billion Worldcoins will be vested and all of the founder/investor coins will be unlocked as well. Allocation % Vested Community 75.0% July 2026 Founders/Team 13.5% July 2026 Private Investors 9.5% July 2026 Reserved 2.0% July 2038 Source: Token Unlocks Of the 10 billion Worldcoins, 13.5% have been allocated to the founders, 9.5% are for private investors and 2% will be held in ""reserve."" The investors include some of the big name venture capital firms that we've seen in many crypto projects through the years: Raised Valuation Date Backers $25 million $1 Billion October 2021 a16z, Digital Currency Group, Coinbase Ventures, Three Arrows Capital, Multicoin Capital $100 million $3 Billion March 2022 a16z, Khosla Ventures $115 million May 2023 Blockchain Capital, a16z, Distributed Global, Bain Capital Crypto Source: Crypto Rank a16z is one of the more notable VC firms in the entire crypto industry and participated in all three funding rounds. I should also note the original $25 million funding round had roughly a dozen additional investors beyond just the ones I noted in the table above. But the main takeaway on this point is Worldcoin has significant VC interest even if the allocation from total supply is under 10%. That those tokens are vested within three years from launch is something prospective buyers should consider before diving into this coin. The scalability of Worldcoin seems dubious given each Digital ID requires physical presence at a limited amount of orbs. If the project fails to scale, the investor-held coins are at greater risk of coming to market shortly after vesting which would further depress the coin's price. Major Concerns Given the nature of how the biometric data is collected, there is a fairly clear privacy concern with this project that goes beyond anything I've come across in crypto to this point. To join the network, users allow a Worldcoin representative to scan their eyeball with an orb. From the iris scan, a unique hash is created to make a Digital ID on the Worldcoin network. The iris scan is said to be destroyed following the hash creation though it is possible for Worldcoin to store the scan if the user chooses to allow it. According to the white paper , this system utilizes zero-knowledge proof technology to verify proof-of-personhood without jeopardizing the privacy of the user at the verifier level. Proof of Personhood (Worldcoin Whitepaper) In practice, the way this would theoretically work is by simply proving the user is a human without the verifier getting access to biometric data or any personally identifiable information. However, there are still legitimate privacy concerns with Worldcoin orb iris scans. Users have the option to store an encrypted version of their biometric data with Worldcoin to streamline future upgrades and system improvements. According to Worldcoin : If a user opts-in to image custody, images are stored on an encrypted hard drive in the Orb before being uploaded. When a user does not opt-in, images are only processed in memory, and they never go through the hard drive. Furthermore, images for users who opted-in have a second layer of encryption via a public key of the server to make them irretrievable in the unlikely event of a compromised Orb. The fact that biometrics can ultimately be stored with Worldcoin means the data is potentially at risk of malicious actors trying to access it. Even though the Digital ID isn't linked to names or standard KYC information, this is still a potential long-term security problem. In the privacy deep dive, the developers of Worldcoin acknowledge that additional verifications of Digital IDs that have already been created are likely needed down the line. And this gets us to another major concern with the entire project. The model is already facing viability challenges because verification of humanity so far only happens at enrollment. This means a new user can create a Digital ID with a scan of their iris at the orb and then pass their details off to another entity. For instance, there is allegedly a secondary market for Worldcoin identities already; which means single users can possess multiple Worldcoin IDs through straw buying. It probably goes without saying, but this would defeat the entire purpose of the network. Worldcoin Finally, Worldcoin is marketed as a permissionless network but I view that claim has debatable if not bordering on false. In Section 8 of the terms and conditions, Worldcoin clearly states that it will suspend users if Worldcoin believes the user is engaging with the network for prohibited usage or to comply with government authority binding orders. Furthermore, Worldcoin states in the privacy notice that services can be geo-blocked based on the IP addresses of the users. Reasons For Optimism I believe the token economic model for Worldcoin has quite a bit of price risk due to both the nature of the coin's distribution and the 3-year vesting schedules for the coin's founders and early investors. However, poor token economics don't necessarily mean the protocol itself will fail. In the event that Worldcoin succeeds as an authentication system that can adequately distinguish human actions from bot actions online, the better way to get exposed to that idea may be simply by betting on the native assets of the blockchain networks rather than on a protocol coin with poor token economics. In the terms and conditions, Worldcoin acknowledges that network fees go to the blockchains not to Worldcoin: Interactions with the blockchain also incur a network fee. The network fee is charged by and paid to the blockchain network, not to us, for facilitating any interactions. While Worldcoin started as a Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) protocol, at coin launch the project migrated to Optimism; a competing Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling chain. According to Worldcoin via Dune Analytics , there have already been roughly 930k World App wallets created just on Optimism: Optimism World App Wallets (Dune Analytics/Worldcoin) However, despite the 2 million stated protocol signups by Worldcoin and the 930k World App wallets on Optimism, just 227k wallets are actually holding the Worldcoin token on Optimism so far. Dune Analytics/Worldcoin It's still early, but my read on that is Worldcoin may be more viable as a Digital ID system rather than a monetary system. However, another possibility is that early adopters in beta have already lost interest. Summary I'm entirely unconvinced Worldcoin is going to survive as a Digital ID system. Furthermore, I believe the token's economic structure is poor and the vesting schedule of Worldcoin will prove damaging to whatever value the coin has three years from now. The primary concern for the coin itself is that Worldcoins are distributed without requiring any actual productive output. In my view, that puts the coin a perpetual risk of being sold as ""UBI"" recipients on the Worldcoin network claim their tokens and cash out for something else. As a Digital ID system, I see a variety of concerns there as well. Those range from questions around user privacy, orb scalability, and the purity of the Digital IDs themselves due to secondary markets for login credentials. To be clear, I think this project is dead on arrival. However, if you believe it has a chance, you're probably just better off buying OP.",NEUTRAL,WLD,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | WLD,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4620724-fade-worldcoin-optimism-is-better-bet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15362294.jpeg
42392917,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgD9LB,1690494567,CBDCs Wrongfully Break Down the Separation Between Money and State,"Central banks around the world are accelerating their experiments with issuing digital currency. Whether it’s the New York Fed’s announcement of a successful proof-of-concept, or the Bank of England’s recent completion of the next phase of its digital pound experiment, over 130 countries around the world are toying with issuing central bank digital currency (CBDCs).  And why wouldn’t they? Central banks can announce that they are protecting consumers and introducing cost-saving devices by removing private banking middlemen. And, simultaneously, they gain a whole new tool in their policymaking arsenal.  Yet however tempting it is to remove these middlemen, the key question is who will stand on the other side of the ledger – to which the only answer is a sprawling and inquisitive government that can track every dollar and cent you spend.  Max Raskin is an adjunct professor of law at New York University and a fellow at the school's Institute for Judicial Administration. Richard Epstein is a law professor at New York University, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago.  The basic idea as it stands is that a central bank – say, the Bank of England – would issue a so-called ""digital pound"" that would represent a direct claim on the central bank – the same way cash is today. (The Bank of England, in fact, has begun to create infrastructure that would allow individuals to use digital wallets to store digital pounds and have those wallets interact with merchants and other users.)  CBDCs would also mark a major change from current practices where central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England do not offer accounts to direct depositors. Instead, at a huge cost, a private banking system stands between the central bank and the accounts held by businesses and individuals.  Why think that an influx of thousands of new banker-bureaucrats will perform any better?  So, on the surface, there is some pull to the claims that central bank digital currencies will decrease unnecessary costs. But these supposed efficiency gains are both illusory and dangerous. Middlemen operate in thousands of markets with agents, aggregators and monitors in virtually every major line of business. These actors cannot be dismissed as obsolete with a shrug of a shoulder.  Middlemen often provide value because they are incentivized to offer more than the bare minimum to differentiate themselves – for instance, through new banking products and services. The suite of services that banks can provide are a result of competitive pressures that ultimately benefit the consumer. Curtailing these forces gums up the market economy.  See also: If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom | Opinion  But beyond creating the wrong incentives, such a scheme is also dangerous – CBDCs would give confidential information and vast power to a faceless government enterprise who can turn that information against you in countless ways. By eliminating the private banking middleman, central bank digital currencies eliminate a key buffer that helps insulate individuals and firms from government prying and overreach.  The use of cash and bearer instruments is not traceable by the central government. The use of digital cash is. Indeed, even individuals who chose to remain with private bankers will still be monitored by the state, which retains information and control over all transactions between direct depositors and outsiders, domestic and foreign.  In addition, the accumulation of these funds will allow central banks, with only modest competition, to direct personal loans and mortgages to favored private parties – with all the dangers attendant to state industrial policies. The nightmare scenarios are not hard to fathom, but difficult to prevent.  No one today is confident that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not target its political adversaries. Why think that an influx of thousands of new banker-bureaucrats will perform any better?  Societal progress?  In laying out its case for the digital pound, the Bank of England reinforced the British government’s commitment to combating climate change, and stated that the digital pound would be designed with that goal in mind.  As an initial matter, why should any topic as controversial and complex as climate change be regulated through the financial system? Financial regulators in the U.S. have also taken it upon themselves to step into political matters like climate change.  If these explicit political goals are on the table, it is not so farfetched for a government-run bank to use its powers to benefit certain preferred energy producers and to punish others through their bank accounts. The ability to effect credits and debits must be a feature of the code proposed by these central banks: This introduces a backdoor system of industrial policy.  If CBDCs go live, solar and wind power, officially favored, could see their bank accounts magically subsidized with no need to attract private investors or to pass through the scrutiny of the private banking system. Bank accounts would become subject to the ballot box, or worse, the bureaucrat.  Anyone – especially political targets – could be unbanked overnight with little recourse. And any efforts at internal supervision runs into Roman poet Juvenal’s classic challenge, as we have repeatedly insisted: who guards the guardians?  See also: A Bully Pulpit for Debanked Nigel Farage, Crypto for the Rest  In the United States, the early bills proposing a digital dollar were sponsored in the context of providing pandemic stimulus directly to the economy. But the evidence is overwhelming that the system of rushed government payments was extraordinarily wasteful. The same risks apply now when the pandemic is mostly in the rear window. In addition to creating different classes of individuals all vying for “free” cash – such a plan would create short-term incentives for political leaders that generate long-term inflation pressures.  Further, central banks would be able to countercyclical monetary policy, say by giving all individuals in certain regions, or in certain sectors, cash boosts – but this again becomes a dangerous political football.  There should be, of course, every effort to take advantage of new technologies, but only if done in the right way. In our view, articulated in a recent article in the Brown Journal of World Affairs, “money should be a neutral unit of measurement, like inches or kilograms.”  The purpose of what we call a “separation of money and state” is to make all currencies stable over time, so that private parties have less need to devise complex and costly mechanisms like adjustable-rate mortgages to deal with financial instability.  Bitcoin, for instance, has a predetermined supply of no more than 21 million units, which is not governed by any individual institution, but rather by the network’s consensus mechanism. This offers a powerful protection against the dilution of value that no government-centered system could hope to match.  The benefits of such a fixed system would, moreover, offer an added institutional support structure for countries in the developing world seeking to modernize. Countries with demonstrated mismanagement of their monetary systems could use the discipline that comes along with certain forms of digital currency. By adopting bitcoin or some form of programmatic cryptocurrency, a central bank plagued with mismanagement like Zimbabwe’s or Argentina’s, could dollarize in an innovative way.  See also: DeSantis and the Growing Culture War Around Bitcoin | Opinion  A fixed monetary policy in the developing world offers tangible economic benefits from increased investment and stability that should be more than welcome to the countries that have courted the ruin of a socialized banking system. Such systems have historically catered to the ruling party, and thus these countries would do well to consider the use of this approach.  On the other hand, relatively prosperous countries that have, until now, not sought to control their citizenry through the financial system, should not start down the dangerous path of a nationalized banking system.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Richard Epstein, Max Raskin",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/27/cbdcs-wrongfully-break-down-the-separation-between-money-and-state,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e9379e3e71a70083cfb6222994927923bc9ba81-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But one of his more bizarre schemes, which involved cryptocurrency, seemed to be inspired by the classic Nigerian prince email scheme, according to a New York Times report.  According to a campaign donor who spoke to the Times, Santos and two other men approached him claiming there was a wealthy Polish citizen who wanted to buy cryptocurrency but couldn’t because his assets were frozen. The trio didn’t say why the assets were frozen, nor provide the name of the Polish investor, but wanted the donor to create a limited liability company to help them gain access to the funds.  The donor told the Times he was struck by how much their pitch sounded like the classic Nigerian prince email scam in which a wealthy foreigner asks someone for help gaining access to frozen assets. He asked for more information, and Santos and associates asked the donor to sign a non-disclosure agreement. The donor then asked for changes to the agreement, and the talks ended there.  The scheme involved Santos, former Republican state assemblyman Michael LiPetri and Bryant Park Associates, a company run by Republican donor Dominick Sartorio, according to the report. LiPetri told The Times that he was aware of Santos’ efforts but wasn't involved “in detail” and said no deal ultimately happened.  A request for comment for this story sent to Santos' lawyer was not immediately returned.  Thirty-five year old Santos, who represents New York’s 3rd congressional district, was arrested and charged with thirteen felonies in March and pleaded not guilty.

42392913,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgD8qP,1690491764,Mining Bitcoin Is an Act of Freedom,"Bitcoin mining is more than just a method of passively validating blocks and acquiring bitcoins as a reward. It involves what political philosopher Hannah Arendt would call the ""vita activa,"" or a positive action. It is both an act of freedom, and something that sets people free.  If this sound overly philosophical, Arendt saw things in a practical light. Humans, Arendt said, are at their fullest when they are politically engaged, when they step into the public realm and take part in the community's decisions. Similarly bitcoin miners are not mere participants but active contributors in a network, and the work they do shapes the ecosystem's present and future.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Burak Tamaç is a researcher at CryptoQuant, an adjunct professor at Brookdale Community College and adviser to several crypto projects.  In a way, to work or contribute to something larger than yourself is to become free. Although the Bitcoin network is not bound to existentialist concerns, there is a powerful motivation driving some bitcoin miners to contribute. It's not uncommon to hear something like, ""because Bitcoin is a tool for human liberation, one of the greatest things I can do is to support the network.""  See also: What Is Bitcoin Freedom? | Burak Tamaç  To understand the significance of mining in relation to freedom, we must delve into what freedom means. Specifically by looking at Isaiah Berlin’s dual interpretations of negative and positive liberty.  Negative liberty, which is essentially what political scientists mean by liberalism, emphasizes an individual's freedom from intervention from governments and other people. This kind of freedom allows people to chart their paths without external constraints (physical or otherwise).  On the other hand, positive liberty necessitates action. It's not just about the potential of doing something, but the act of doing it. It's the freedom embodied in actively participating and realizing one's potential (see Berlin's seminal essay titled ""Two Conceptions of Liberty"").  What Berlin missed, however, is a third type of freedom. What is sometimes called republican or neo-Roman liberty in philosophy circles is an understanding of human rights where people should be able to live free from subjection, deference and vulnerability to the arbitrary will of others. It specifically emphasizes the idea of non-domination and learning to co-exist with others, similar to ideas advocated by early feminists like Mary Wollstonecraft and popularized by Cambridge history Quentin Skinner.  What this theory means in practice is that as long as we have a voice in the decisions that affect us, ""intervention"" does not make us less free. In fact, in many cases, interventions that we consent to and authorize could enhance freedom.  In the context of Bitcoin, mining encapsulates this positive freedom in the sense that miners are not bystanders but instead active validators. They keep the decentralized system in check. They ensure that transactions are genuine and, in the process, validate the integrity of the entire network. Like citizens who actively engage in political processes to hold rulers accountable, miners play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of power within the Bitcoin network.  Further, because Bitcoin mining is permissionless – i.e. has a low entry barrier – anyone with the right tools can join the decentralized network. It's not reserved for the elite or those with significant capital; it’s a domain where individual contribution matters, and collective participation strengthens the system. In short, Bitcoin is democratic.  See also: Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy | Opinion  Bitcoin mining is sometimes criticized for being overly concentrated. However, it's important to note that many of the largest miners are public entities. While the ideal situation might be small scale individual miners competing in the free market, and mining bitcoins from their laptops, this is also economically unviable for a decentralized monetary network that has to guard itself against corporate and nation-state attacks. There is much at stake, and if Bitcoin is to survive then serious resources need to be committed to it.  In this case, publicly-traded bitcoin miners or other forms of community-ownership like mining pools are the next-best thing. With such arrangements, single ownership and decision-making get dispersed into boards, distributing power and decision-making. It also helps to emphasize that mining bitcoin is a way a taking responsibility and engaging in a political process.  In essence, bitcoin mining is a profound exercise in positive freedom. It's not just about the ability to participate but the act of participation itself. Every miner is a political actor, actively shaping and preserving the network's ethos of decentralization and bitcoin freedom. In other words, it is a vita activa.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED,Burak Tamac,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/27/mining-bitcoin-is-an-act-of-freedom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4c67bf2c3920ea6a4489748edaa405564e559c3-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The increase in activity was primarily driven by LayerZero, a cross-chain messaging protocol that enables lightweight and efficient communication between different networks. However, BNB’s market cap declined by 25.2% after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that BNB is a security in its regulatory actions against Coinbase and Binance. Despite this, the total cryptocurrency market cap increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), primarily driven by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). BNB Q2 Revenue Declines Per the report, BNB’s revenue in BNB decreased by 6.1% QoQ as average transaction fees declined 25.5% after BSC validators voted to reduce gas fees from 5 to 3 Gwei. Nevertheless, staking on the network remained stable. BNB Chain plans to increase the number of validators from 29 to 100 with a new validator reward model (balanced mining) and a validator reputation system. On the other hand, the Binance Smart Chain saw a decrease in total value locked (TVL) denominated in USD during Q2 2023, decreasing by 26.3%. However, TVL denominated in BNB was relatively flat at -2.8%. While PancakeSwap remained the most prominent protocol by TVL on the BNB Chain, its dominance decreased from 45% to 37% during the quarter, indicating a shift in TVL concentration towards a more robust DeFi ecosystem.

The BUSD market lost some of its users after regulators forced Paxos to cease the issuance of BUSD, resulting in a decline of approximately 54% in the BUSD market cap on the BNB Chain during Q1. Developer engagement also showed positive growth during Q2, with the number of unique contracts verified growing by 51.9% QoQ, and full-time developers on the BNB Chain increasing from 130 to 133 QoQ. Despite the decline in TVL denominated in USD, the BNB Chain’s continued expansion of its DeFi ecosystem and the shift in TVL dominance towards a more diverse range of protocols signal a promising outlook for the ecosystem’s future. Binance Smart Chain Outlines Ambitious Plans For 2023 Despite the regulatory challenges, BNB Chain has laid out robust plans for 2023, including increasing the network’s gas limit to boost throughput and reducing the data footprint through state offload. BNB Chain also plans to further decentralize by introducing a new validator reward model and a validator reputation system to increase the number of validators from 29 to 100. The roadmap highlights other initiatives, including increased scalability through modular architecture, creating a data storage network, and implementing consumer protections provided by blockchain security firms.

While the regulatory challenges faced by Binance and Binance.US directly impact the entire crypto ecosystem, Binance and BNB Chain are separate entities. Binance, Binance Labs, and the Binance Launchpad help grow the BNB Chain ecosystem through asset listings, liquidity provision, investment, and project launches. The outcomes of the ongoing lawsuits are unpredictable, and adverse outcomes could slow the advancement of the BNB Chain ecosystem and bring continued volatility to its native BNB token.

The US Federal Reserve, on Wednesday, increased its fund rates by an additional 25 BPS, its highest interest rate in 22 years. European Central Bank In The Fight Against Inflation The European Central Bank, in its statement, admitted that although inflation continues to decline, it is “still expected to remain too high for too long.” In a bid to fight inflation and return it to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner, the governing council has continued to hike the interest rates for some time now, and this has further raised concerns for investors in the financial market as to whether or not there will be hikes before year ends. Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders For context, the ECB has raised rates by 4.00% since last year July, accounting for the fastest-tightening cycle in its history. It is projected that this rapid increase in rates could negatively affect the expansion of loans in the European region and economic activity also. A quarterly poll released by the ECB on July 25 revealed that the companies’ demand for loans plunged to its lowest in the second quarter of this year. The eurozone has less developed and liquid capital markets than the United States, so there is an overreliance on banks in financing the economy. And now, according to ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane, the tighter monetary policy is massively impacting bank loans. So such policies will undoubtedly cause a liquidity squeeze. Bitcoin’s Role Although inflation continues to decline, it is evident that the ECB and US Federal Reserve aren’t getting the desired results as to the target to which they want to bring inflation down to. As such, these financial bodies may continue increasing the rates to as high as possible despite the dramatic economic slowdown. Investors are aware of this position and are looking toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for succor. For a long time now, Bitcoin has been tagged as a ‘hedge against inflation,’ and it seems that many are realizing that this is more than a tag as Bitcoin has remained stable despite the growing rates, which many would have expected would send Bitcoin and the crypto market spiraling down.

Kennedy Jr.'s remarks matter,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a great future. They haven't reached their full potential yet, but they definitely will. I draw such conclusions not only from the current situation in the markets or from the systematic growth in demand for crypto, which is indeed observed. But also, by observing the positive changes in the attitude of the world's elites towards it. Both financial, which already regularly report new projects like the launch of a national bitcoin exchange in Indonesia in July-2023 (confirmed by the local regulator) or the receipt of a licence to provide cryptocurrency services by a division of the French Societe Generale (SG Forge) from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), which cannot but please. But also, political ones, because it is on them that legislative and regulatory decisions depend, which will allow the development of the crypto industry. The speech of Democratic Party member and US presidential candidate Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. (nephew of the legendary 35th U.S. President John Kennedy) at an event organised by Heal-the-Divide PAC was highly inspiring. The politician openly stated that he was willing to take steps to back the U.S. national currency with Bitcoin, and this would support the dollar's status as an international reserve currency. Kennedy called Bitcoin a hard currency and put it on par with silver, gold, platinum, emphasising that such an approach would help ""restore the strength of the dollar, rein in inflation and usher in a new era of financial stability, peace and prosperity for the country"". This will provide at least some of the U.S. debt obligations (treasuries) with hard assets, increasing confidence in them. Not only has the Democrat recognised the power of bitcoin and publicly reiterated the thesis of many crypto-activists, but he has also made it clear that he is ready to make crypto-assets a tool of public policy. This is a serious acknowledgement, which could translate into a large-scale project centered on the U.S. and the world's key currency, the dollar. The second important thesis of Robert F. Kennedy concerns taxation. He announced that his administration would ""exempt the conversion of Bitcoins to the U.S. dollars from capital gains taxes."" In May, the American authorities had already abandoned the idea of imposing an additional 30% tax on industrial mining of cryptocurrencies, and now they are ready to liberalise the capital gains part. That will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the market, which in the U.S. is now on the brink and is very much hoping for positive changes. It is known that many have even considered the option of migration from the U.S. And so now Kennedy's statement will be received very well. By the way, the presidential candidate does not just throw promises, but justifies them. It can be seen that the politician follows the situation in the industry and sentiments. Since he says that tax breaks will allow the development of jobs in the U.S. and not in Singapore, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal. He is aware about the negative sentiment in cryptocurrency circles. At the moment, there are few options left in the United States that minimise taxation and do not violate current legislation. The most common are transactions through people's retirement accounts and working through the Puerto Rico, where corporations can enjoy a favourable tax rate of 4% and ordinary investors can work as qualified residents and receive a tax exemption. However, these options are not suitable for everyone. Therefore, crypto investors are increasingly looking at the possibility of working in Singapore, Portugal, Malta, and in some cases Hong Kong. There, the issue of taxation is solved more easily. Robert F. Kennedy repeated his old thesis that cryptocurrencies give people freedom, freedom of choice and will. Something he spoke about at the conference in Miami (USA) in May 2023, when he recalled the story of truckers' strikes in Canada. People weren't breaking local laws, but the authorities pressed on by blocking their personal bank accounts to subjugate them - they were deprived of the ability to support their families and pay their mortgages. In fact, these are financial repressions that were applied at the state level.This is essentially financial repression that was applied at the state level. What could not have been realised with the adequate development of cryptocurrencies that can protect citizens and their freedom. Freedom of money is also freedom of speech and expression of will. And these are cryptocurrencies that can provide all this, but not fiat currencies, total financial monitoring and requirements for classical financial institutions. All of this has been talked about many times at crypto conferences and conventions. It is encouraging that this has finally been heard and realised by politicians at the highest level, and, most importantly, that they are not just talking, but are ready to act decisively.

15361695,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544357,1690486586,Don’t Change The Channel! Why Bitcoin Could Target $42K If Uptrend Holds,"Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has traded at or near $30K per coin for the better part of 2023. Throughout the year, an uptrend channel has formed that is currently still holding. If support remains unbroken, it could propel BTCUSD to the top of the parallel channel which is currently located at or around $42K per coin. A Bitcoin Price Channel For Your Viewing Pleasure 2023 might not have featured the same painful drawdowns in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as 2022 did, but the market is still doling out suffering in the form of boring, sideways price action, and crypto winter PTSD. Although BTCUSD has mostly been ranging around the $30,000 level for months now, it has overall remained in an uptrend. Uptrends are defined as a series of higher highs and higher lows. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead Oftentimes, these uptrends are supported by drawing a trend line below intraday troughs. Depending on the price action, occasionally a parallel channel will form, providing both support and resistance on either end, keeping an uptrend from moving upward too quickly despite the general trajectory. Such a parallel uptrend channel has formed in Bitcoin, and if the upward-sloping support trend line continues to stay solid and intact, a move to the top of the channel is likely. Will the channel hold or break down? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Tune In To Find Out What Happens Next In Crypto The channel began to form in late 2022, acting first as an upward-sloping support line that broke down during the FTX collapse. Bitcoin price then meandered sideways until a new, parallel upward-sloping support carried it higher. With the previous support now acting as resistance, it created the upper boundary of the parallel channel that price is now ping-ponging back and forth within. Related Reading: This Technical Signal Says Bitcoin Dominance Has Potentially Peaked If the current uptrend structure holds this latest selloff, a push to the upper resistance boundary is possible. As time ticks by, this upper boundary will reach $42K within the next week or two. If Bitcoin does indeed make a run for the upper boundary, this price is within striking distance by early August. On the other hand, if the channel breaks down, it could be a sign the uptrend is over and short-lived. Failure to produce a meaningful rally could tell the market that the downtrend has resumed, and new lows are ahead. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter. Subscribe for free here.

42392909,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgD8g9,1690485553,"A Bully Pulpit for Debanked Nigel Farage, Crypto for Everyone Else","Nigel Farage, the lizard-skinned British politician who kickstarted Brexit, is a totem for crypto, whether he knows it or not. (Or if you, like some here at CoinDesk, even like it.)  So swallow your pride, and suck up any misgivings because what happened recently to Farage in the U.K. is a warning for us all.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s no secret that banks – whether in the U.S., U.K. or anywhere in the world – have been debanking people for decades. This often comes with little warning or hope to appeal, and it completely disrupts someone’s ability to exist in modern society. In the early days of crypto, for instance, countless people who interacted with exchanges or other crypto service providers found their accounts unceremoniously closed.  (This is to say nothing of the apparent crypto banking choke out in the U.S., which is its own kind of issue.)  So Farage’s story isn’t all that new – although it is different in the sense that, unlike most, the wealthy Tory had a bully pulpit to stand on.  See also: The Reality Behind the Crypto Banking Crackdown | Opinion  In short, Coutts – a private bank owned by NatWest, which itself has an extremely checkered past – closed Farage’s account because he holds the wrong views.  This, of course, is abhorrent and has rightfully caused a few black eyes in the media and at the bank after an apparent cover up was...uncovered. When the news first broke, Farage was basically made out to be a conspiracist who claimed he was being “canceled.” The bank, lying, said it closed his account because his balance had fallen below the minimum £1 million (~$1.3 million).  But after a BBC retraction, an apology from NatWest CEO Alison Rose and now her resignation, it can be said that politics was absolutely determinative in Coutts’ decision to fire Farage as a client.  Rose’s fate was essentially sealed last week when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak unexpectedly stuck his neck out for Farage, saying, “It’s not right for anyone to be denied financial services because they’re exercising their lawful right to free speech.”  And, true enough, you might loath the former member of the European Parliament turned “eurosceptic” Farage. But the guy has a right to a bank account, as much as he does his views.  But does he? Obviously for anyone who thinks there are basic human rights, Rose and Coutts did wrong by Farage (who, incidentally, is also a public supporter of Bitcoin). But, in many ways, Rose’s only real crime was in lying to the public, the government and the bank’s investors, and had that not happened – and she come right out and said Coutts is cutting ties with Farage because he is unscrupulous – how many people would be willing to say she made the right decision?  Let’s remember that there’s another political valence to this story. The 53-year-old banker, reportedly the first woman to lead a major British bank, was apparently a champion of “purpose-led” corporate governance who worked to extricate the once important oil and gas lender from those entanglements. In short, she was woke (at least in the minds of some of Farage’s staunchest supporters).  Insofar as the CEO of any bank could be said to be radical, Rose was a symbol for societal progress on one side of the political divide and all the forces working to stymie Farage’s brand of British nationalism on the other. What seems like a simple issue – should Farage get to speak his mind and get to bank – is only simple now in retrospect, after a bigger crime was revealed.  For example, if the shoe were on the other foot, hypothetically, would Farage’s supporters campaign for someone like the lefty Jeremy Corbyn to keep his bank account? It’s all just speculation, but the right-coded platforms like Parler and “anti-woke” bank GlorFi (now defunct) weren’t exactly bastions of free speech. And how many people were willing to defend Kanye when he was on an anti-semetic kick that cost him his wealth manager and Chase account?  To a degree, some of the only consistent defenders of the right to bank are those in crypto – who know what it’s like being de-banked. My colleague, David Z. Morris called this group the “financial ACLU,” (I think referring to the days when the famed civil rights organization was more consistent in its support of speech rights). It’s ironic, too, because crypto has its own homegrown solutions to banking challenges: take the politics, passions and people out of the equation.  See also: UK Crypto White List Needed to Solve 'Debanking'  We like to tell ourselves that modern life is built on a bedrock of unshakeable liberal values, but in reality, decisions are always subject to contemporary prejudices. For instance, there’s a “classically liberal” argument to make that, actually, Farage does not have the right to bank anywhere. Banks like all businesses should be able to exercise judgment and discretion in choosing who to serve. There are other banks in the world afterall, and clearly Farage was not being silenced.  Things worked out, I guess, in the end for Farage. He’s a martyr to his fans, and those who hate him must begrudgingly accept that he was done wrong. But what of the countless others who are de-banked every year? Not for their political views, but for overdrafting their accounts by $5? Why is there no sustained outrage? Because, deep down, we all know it’s useless to try to hold institutions to account or to our highest ideals.  For all the other times that you can’t count on populist outrage, there’s crypto.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/27/a-bully-pulpit-for-debanked-nigel-farage-crypto-for-everyone-else,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54d425afad71df8d6e1593c490cf930909b6742f-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The foundation alleged that MovEX had released a significant amount of SUI tokens – subject to a contractual lockup – into circulation. Sui Foundation Terminates Relationship With MovEX For Unlocking 2.5 Million Tokens On July 26, 2023, the Sui Foundation released a blog post, explaining the network’s token supply and the essence of its token release schedule. The foundation also announced the termination of its relationship with MovEX after breaching its token lockup contract. Related Reading: Shibarium Bridge Goes Live In Beta But There’s A Catch According to the foundation, early contributors to the network received SUI tokens that were subject to a lockup period – only to be released based on a preset schedule. MovEX was one of the recipients of this token allocation, collecting 2.5 million SUI tokens as payment for its contribution to the exchange product DeepBook. However, the decentralized exchange (DEX) was found to have violated the token lockup by moving its entire allotment of tokens in three (625,000 SUI) transactions to three separate wallets. At the time, these transactions raised questions about the Sui Foundation, with some tweets implying that the foundation “intentionally misrepresented” the token emissions schedule. The foundation denied these claims and has further clarified in its latest post that it didn’t consent to the three transactions by MovEX. As a result of these events, the Sui Foundation has cut off ties with the decentralized exchange. It also confirmed that no additional SUI tokens will be distributed to MovEX, nor will the DEX remain a contributor to DeepBook. “By July 3, upon Sui Foundation’s request, MovEX had moved the entire allotment of 2.5M tokens to a wallet at a qualified custodian who will release them according to the contractual lockup schedule in compliance with the previously released token emissions schedule,” the foundation noted. According to the analytics dashboard Token Unlocks, a total of 646.25 million SUI tokens have been unlocked so far, with the next unlocking event expected to take place on July 31. SUIUSDT valued at $0.6359 | Source: daily SUIUSDT chart from TradingView MovEX Addresses Community On Situation On Thursday, July 27, the team behind MovEX released a statement on Twitter, addressing its community on the situation. In the tweet, the project acknowledged that it received the SUI tokens – as claimed by the Sui Foundation. Related Reading: Short-Lived Hype: Worldcoin (WLD) Signups Dwindle Less Than A Week After Launch MovEX also stated that it transferred its entire allotment of SUI tokens to “custodian and non-custodian wallets”. While confirming that it has moved the tokens back to a qualified custodian, the DeFi protocol claims to understand the decision of the Sui Foundation. MovEX is a decentralized exchange native to the Sui network. According to the protocol’s whitepaper, it combines an automated market maker (AMM) and order book to create a hybrid liquidity DEX.

According to a filing of July 26, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) agreed to drop one of the charges related to illegal campaign finance activity against the disgraced FTX Democrats megadonor and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The Crypto Robinhood Uncovered After months of investigation, it was estimated that Sam Bankman-Fried donated $93 million worth of stolen customer funds to the US politicians. The FTX founder is known as one of the largest Democratic Party donors. Some of Bankman-Fried’s illegal contributions include donations to the 2020 Presidential campaign, as well as campaigns of the U.S. Senators and U.S. House representatives. Prosecutors suggested that the crypto mogul had made these contributions to influence the policies that could potentially benefit the crypto industry. Following the sudden collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX due to its inability to repay the clients, it was also revealed that the company’s former CEO had authorized the diversion of $2 billion from customers' funds to cover loans and expenses for the firm. One of the Eight Charges Dropped Sam Bankman-Fried was originally indicted on eight charges in December. One of these charges is now dropped thanks to the extradition treaty between the United States and the Bahamas. Apparently, the Bahamas submitted a filing to New York federal judge Lewis Kaplan that dropped the charges of campaign finance fraud. The Department of Justice letter said, “The Government has been informed that The Bahamas notified the United States earlier today that The Bahamas did not intend to extradite the defendant on the campaign contributions count. Accordingly, in keeping with its treaty obligations to The Bahamas, the Government does not intend to proceed to trial on the campaign contributions count.” The FTX founder will still be charged with the other seven counts present in the DOJ’s original indictment. Those include charges regarding wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. What’s Next for Sam Bankman-Fried? After being released on $250 million bail back in December, the bail status of Sam Bankman-Fried is now in jeopardy due to his latest interview with the New York TImes. The persecutors accused the former FTX CEO of discrediting their witness, Caroline Ellison. As a result, Bankman-Fried has agreed to an interim gag order that prevents him from publicly discussing the case. The terms of his bail now depend on federal prosecutors and attorneys. “I am certainly very mindful of his First Amendment rights, and I am very mindful of the government’s interest here, which I take very seriously. And I say to the defendant, Mr. Bankman-Fried: You better take it seriously, too.” commented Judge Kaplan. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42392923,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgD9v5,1690482973,Bitcoin’s Shrugs Off Positive Economic Data as Slow-Moving July Continues,"The economy is expanding and inflation is slowing, but bitcoin is staying put  Bitcoin has been outperforming ether, but remains mired in a tight trading range  Bitcoin’s (BTC) quiet July continued as Thursday morning’s report of stronger than expected Q2 GDP growth and softer than expected inflation did little to move crypto prices in either direction. At print time, bitcoin was marginally lower over the past 24 hours at $29,150, slightly underperforming the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which was higher by 0.2%. As July grinds to a close, bitcoin appears poised to post its second losing month of 2023.  The U.S. economy expanded by 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023, the government reported today, soundly beating expectations of 1.8% growth and up from 2% growth the previous quarter. The 2.4% figure is the government’s preliminary estimate and will be revised more than once in coming months.  The PCE price index embedded in the GDP report showed prices rising by 2.6% in Q2 versus expectations of 3.0% and down from 4.1% in Q1. Initial jobless claims were fewer than expected, with 221,000 Americans claiming unemployment against forecasts for 235,000.  The TLDR of it all is that the economy is growing, inflation is slowing but elevated and the labor market remains robust. WIth the exception of the numbers themselves, little has changed in that regard in the last few months.  What does any of this mean for crypto assets?  At the moment, digital assets in general and bitcoin in particular appear to be mired in an exceedingly tight trading range. As discussed on Monday, bitcoin’s reaction to macroeconomic data has been mild. While this doesn’t obviate the need for investors to monitor economic trends, it likely does serve as a sign that a significant surprise is likely needed to move prices substantially.  Since breaching the lower range of its Bollinger Band on July 25, the bitcoin price has advanced just .002%, with its 20 period moving average of $30,000 remaining a likely price target.  Signs of stagnation exist when looking at the trajectory of wallet balances as well. The total circulating supply of bitcoin held by addresses across multiple “size buckets” has been flat, according to analytics firm Glassnode.  In July, the supply held by addresses with a balance between 10-100 BTC, grew by 0.001%. For addresses with a balance between 100-1000 BTC, supply fell 0.004%. And for those smaller investors with a balance between 0.1 and 1 BTC, supply grew 0.005%.  The silver lining in all of this for bullish investors is that while prices seem stuck in a rut, there doesn’t appear to be any bearish catalysts on the horizon either.  One area of opportunity that investors may be eyeing is the discrepancy in performance between bitcoin and ether. While still tightly correlated, BTC has outperformed ETH by 21% thus far in 2023, possibly driven by expectations that a spot bitcoin ETF could soon be available in the U.S.  Ether also currently appears to lack a bearish catalyst. Meanwhile its overall supply continues to decline, falling by 4,800 tokens over the most recent seven days.

15357372,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/why-el-salvador-the-rising-crypto-hub-for-new-investors,1690482600,Why El Salvador: The Rising Crypto Hub for New Investors,"Gofaizen & Sherle has launched the new product for obtaining crypto licenses in El Salvador, expecting it to become one of the key business destinations on the crypto map. In this article, we have discussed all the necessary details that will help you launch an effective business in El Salvador quickly and easily. El Salvador is rapidly emerging as a sought-after destination in the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly due to increased regulatory scrutiny in the EU and US. As these major economies tighten their regulations, businesses are exploring alternative jurisdictions, and El Salvador has become a prime choice. Known for recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender and even launching cryptocurrency mining on a volcano, El Salvador has quickly gained attention in the crypto industry. The country's diverse economy, with a focus on coffee production, construction, and industrial manufacturing, has shown positive GDP growth and relatively low inflation and unemployment rates. El Salvador's government actively supports the crypto industry and aims to attract foreign companies and investors. They have implemented a favorable tax system, exempting digital asset-related income and profits from taxation. Additionally, technology companies engaged in AI, app development, and digital products can enjoy a 15-year tax exemption. The National Commission of Digital Assets of El Salvador (NCDA) issues licenses to virtual asset service providers (VASPs), offering a transparent and secure framework for crypto businesses. This supportive regulatory environment makes El Salvador a promising hub for the crypto community. The Key Advantages of El Salvador Unique Taxation System Benefits VASPs: No payments required for operations with digital assets, and transactions can be conducted using Bitcoin. The nominal value, yields, and income from digital assets are tax-exempt. Capital gains and ordinary income from buying, selling, or transferring digital assets are also tax-exempt. Issuers, certifiers, and service providers of registered digital assets enjoy these tax benefits for their related activities without any obligation for tax withholding; The jurisdiction offers notably low state fees, which is highly beneficial for business activities; El Salvador has crypto-friendly banks, making it one of the most crucial and convenient options. This is almost a unique opportunity for a crypto project; El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and crypto regulation create a favorable environment for cryptocurrency businesses. This attracts cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers, payment processors, and blockchain startups. Obtaining a crypto license allows companies to enter this market, offer services to the local population as well as worldwide; Operating within a regulated framework offers companies clarity and guidelines to navigate the cryptocurrency landscape in El Salvador. With a crypto license, companies ensure compliance with legal requirements, including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. This boosts trust and credibility among customers and partners. Obtaining the Crypto License The overall process is relatively straightforward, but it does require some patience. Starting a business in El Salvador can take 3 to 5 months in total. The crucial steps involve collecting the necessary documents for authorities and obtaining the license. In the final stage, you can choose a bank or EMI (Electronic Money Institution) and commence operations in the country and worldwide. However, there are a couple of essential details you should know before launching a project in El Salvador. Firstly, you must have a minimum of two shareholders, and it is imperative to establish an effective business plan. Additionally, you should be prepared to work closely with local regulators and provide reports when necessary. Overall, these rules provide a simple and clear framework for operating a business. If you're considering launching a crypto exchange operator, El Salvador stands as an excellent choice. Moreover, the country offers various other opportunities for crypto projects in El Salvador. These include setting up companies for: Custody services Payment processing Digital asset and derivatives trading Issuing tokens, stable coins, or other types of tokens Engaging in DeFi activities However, if you possess an innovative solution or a complex idea based on AI or other advanced technologies, El Salvador becomes the jurisdiction of your dreams. It shines as a startup incubator with a strong focus on financial democracy. For comprehensive details, feel free to visit our website.

42410079,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6Z2,1690481949,Tokenization News Roundup: Avalanche Invests $50M in RWA,"As with any fresh new opportunity, there is a lot of news and activity from self-professed experts and media, as well as the players themselves. This week we find broad overviews and explainers from CoinDesk and Binance, balanced with descriptions of individual tokenization projects in Colombia and Spain and an opinion piece about why Asia is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the RWA trend. RWA is a global trend, and this roundup of RWA news for the week ending July 27, 2023 takes you around the world.  Avalanche Foundation Commits $50M to Bring More Tokenized Assets to Blockchain (CoinDesk)  The program follows Avalanche’s initiative to financial institutions to test blockchain services on one of its subnets.  Takeaway: Blockchains such as Avalanche are competing to grab a slice of the tokenized real-world assets pie, which is projected to become a $16 trillion market by 2030 by Boston Consulting Group.  Ethereum, the largest smart contract platform, is the most popular network for tokenized assets, but smaller blockchains such as Stellar, Solana and Polygon also grab sizable market shares, according to real-world asset data platform rwa.xyz.  Avalanche is an Ethereum challenger smart contract platform offering faster transactions and scaling capabilities. It consists of smaller sovereign networks called subnets.  The tokenization fund follows the blockchain’s initiative for financial institutions to test and deploy blockchain-based services on one of its subnets. Asset management companies WisdomTree and T. Rowe Price were among the firms who joined the testing, CoinDesk reported in April.  Crypto Lender Credix Brings Additional Private Credit Pool on Solana With 11% Yield (CoinDesk)  Decentralized finance platform Credix opens a trade receivables lending pool with the Solana Foundation among the investors.  Takeaway: This is a single example of the creative ways crypto and TradFi are capitalizing on rising yields that are partly fueling the growth in the tokenization of real-world assets.  Lenders can capture near 11% annual yield investing in insurance-protected private credit to Colombian farmers backed by receivables, said Credix, which believes the pool could swell to $150 million over the next months based on capital demand in the country.  “This groundbreaking initiative not only brings a unique offering to the market but also holds power to make a significant social and economic impact by providing crucial financial support to farmers in Colombia,"" Thomas Bohner, chief executive of Credix, said in a statement.  Accredited investors can deposit USDC stablecoin in the pool and expect a 11% annualized yield (APY). This is significantly higher than the 2.6% APY available for lenders on DeFi protocol Aave, according to DefiLlama.  Asset Tokenization in Europe Gets a Boost With Securitize's Landmark Tokenized Equity Issuance (CoinDesk)  The firm started issuing tokens representing equity in a Spanish real estate investment trust under Spain’s new digital asset supervision.  Takeaway: This is another example of a specific tokenization issuance, distinguished by being the first-ever under Spain’s new digital asset supervision laws.  The tokens issued via the smart contract network Avalanche (AVAX) represent equity in Spanish real estate investment trust Mancipi Partners, supervised under the test environment of Spain’s securities regulator (CNMV).  “European businesses will be a major beneficiary of this innovation, giving businesses a new way to raise capital through primary capital raises, and obtain potential tax benefits and liquidity through secondary trading,” Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said in a statement.  Tokenization is driving new value, and Asia is leading the way: Opinion (Forkast News)  Across Asia, projects dedicated to asset tokenization have become a cornerstone of the new digital economy, showing the world the technology’s possibilities.  Takeaway: Asia, particularly Hong Kong, is preparing how to get a piece of the RWA market. This opinion piece describes efforts in Cambodia and Hong Kong to tokenize assets, including fiat currency.  ""Another example on the retail side is a new pilot initiative being led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to explore and showcase real estate asset tokenization solutions. The pilot will examine and stress-test different mechanisms for enabling a faster and more efficient release of equity relative to real estate for individuals. With real-world asset tokenization predicted to be a multi-trillion-dollar industry by 2030, the pilot represents a significant step forward in the race to maximize readiness for the retail application of such a tokenized product.""  Can we expect an NFT renaissance? (Digital Bytes)  Takeaway: Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are associated with pixelated profile pictures that crypto enthusiasts use on their social media accounts. But as an instrument, some tokenized real-world assets are NFTs. That makes recent developments from the U.K. particularly relevant. The Law Commissioner’s report on digital assets (released in June 2023), may lead to the country becoming an NFT hub.  One of the key implications of the Law Commission's report is the creation of a robust legal infrastructure that bolsters the NFT ecosystem. By providing clarity on ownership rights, intellectual property protection and contractual agreements, the UK stands to attract those artists, creators and businesses from around the world wishing to gain exposure to this nascent technology.  The new-found legal certainty will significantly reduce the risks associated with NFT transactions, whereby fostering trust and encouraging greater participation within the market. In addition, the report also recommends the establishment of a dedicated regulatory body tasked with overseeing NFT-related activities. This move not only ensures compliance with existing legislation but also demonstrates the UK's commitment to fostering a vibrant and secure NFT landscape. Such regulatory oversight will provide a competitive advantage over other jurisdictions, positioning the UK as a reliable and trustworthy hub for digital asset transactions.  Société Générale Issued First DASP License by French Regulator AMF (Securities.io)  Takeaway: The headline says it all; this is the first digital-asset service provider license issued by France, and it went to the blockchain arm of 150-year-old investment bank Société Générale.  ""The DASP license, beyond giving Société Générale Forge the authority to act as a custodian for digital assets, provides the bank's blockchain unit with broad permissions. This includes,  the ability to facilitate transactions involving the buying and selling of digital assets using legal tender;  trading of digital assets for other such assets;  and the ability to receive and transmit third-party orders for digital assets  The French DASP system presents a more intricate setup compared to the registration procedure for cryptocurrency companies, which typically only mandates compliance with the nation's anti-money laundering regulations.""  Real-World Assets: State of the Market, July 2023 (Binance Research)  Takeaway: Notable mostly because it is produced by the research department of Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume. It is a great introduction to the tokenization of real-world assets generally and an overview of the market, with profiles of three popular protocols. While everyone (including yours truly) and their grandmother keeps citing BCG’s $16 trillion RWA market projection, Binance research takes it further to put that astounding figure in context of global asset value overall, indicating huge potential for further growth.  ""Even at US$16T, tokenized assets will still be a small fraction of the current total global asset value, estimated to be worth US$900T (less than 1.8%, to be exact, and not factoring in future global asset value growth). One may even argue that the true addressable market is the entire global asset market, given that anything tokenizable could be represented as RWAs on-chain.""  RWA Tokenization: What Does it Mean to Tokenize Real-World Assets? (CoinDesk)  Traditional finance giants are excited about the idea of putting ownership of assets like precious metals, art, homes and more on the blockchain.  Takeaway: Toby Bochan, CoinDesk’s managing editor of Learn, introduces the concept of tokenization of real-world assets for beginners. What it is, how it works, and what the future holds. An excellent explainer to share with novice investors.  Imagine you want to buy an Andy Warhol artwork. Most of us can’t afford to fork over record-breaking sums like $195 million for a Marilyn painting or even $850,000 for a mere print of Queen Elizabeth. Many people want to buy art either for pleasure or as an investment but are priced out. But what if you could buy “shares” of an artwork like you can buy fractions of a publicly traded company? That’s the idea behind tokenization of real-world assets.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jeanhee Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/27/tokenization-news-roundup-avalanche-invests-50m-in-rwa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5ef2e26b65dc89d2ee7b3f9531a4ab0fe61eca6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410086,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6pZ,1690481504,Crypto Bill Advances Out of House Agriculture Committee,"The House Agriculture Committee advanced the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act, a day after the House Financial Services Committee did.  A few hours after beginning debate and voting on amendments to the bill, which would create a federal regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S., the House Agriculture Committee referred the bill to the full House of Representatives by a voice vote.  Lawmakers debated a number of amendments to the bill, including provisions on customer disclosures and asset management protections.  In opening comments, committee Chair Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) noted that Congress has been working on crypto legislation for years.  ""We learned that current federal laws and regulations provide few rules of the road for those who want to engage with these emerging technologies, leading to complicated enforcement actions by regulators and creating further confusion in the industry and market,"" he said.  The House Agriculture Committee vote followed a daylong markup session in the House Financial Services Committee, which voted to advance the bill Wednesday night alongside a number of other crypto-focused pieces of legislation.  The House Financial Services Committee also met again Thursday to debate stablecoin legislation.  However, the House Agriculture Committee markup sharply contrasted with the verbal scrum down the hall in the Financial Services Committee Thursday. While the Financial Services Committee saw Democrats argue for more time to work on the bill and shouting on the floor, the Agriculture Committee worked through various amendments, adopting proposals from both Democrats and Republicans.  The hearing also ended well before that of the Financial Services Committee.  ""Did we do better than Financial Services?""

15356549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544677,1690480825,"Solana (SOL) Records Positive Moves As Bears Took Control, What’s Pushing It?","The crypto market witnessed heightened volatility last week, with most coins observing steep declines. However, today, June 27, the market has registered a slight recovery as most coins posted a few gains, but SOL’s gain is the most notable among all. Solana’s native token, SOL, recorded over 3% price growth over the past 24 hours, while others, like Bitcoin, barely crossed 1%, given the significant increase. The Ethereum killer is now number 9 among the top-gaining coins today. However, considering the steep volatility index, whether SOL bulls can sustain today’s rally remains uncertain. SOL Price Outlook Solana saw bearish days in June after the SEC listed it among tokens labeled as securities in its lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. SOL’s price nosedived, dropping over 41% between June 3 and June 16. The asset’s price consolidated between $15 and $19 until July. Related Reading: Shibarium Bridge Goes Live In Beta But There’s A Catch However, SOL reached a monthly high of $29.31 on July 13 after news of Ripple’s win against the US SEC in the multi-year lawsuit circulated throughout the industry. Although the bearish momentum observed in the last seven days snatched some gains from the asset, its 30-day price movement remains bullish, with over 52% price growth. Solana has lost 2.33% of its market valuation over the past seven days before rebounding with notable gains today. On Thurdsay morning, SOL traded at $25.25, with a 3.71% 24-hour price increase. SOL-Based Investment Funds Skyrockets Following Heightened Regulatory Optimism SOL’s trading volume has increased in the last 24 hours. On July 26, SOL recorded a 57.07% increase in trading volume. This growth in trading activity suggests increased interest in SOL and SOL-related products. Following Ripple’s partial victory in the SEC’s securities lawsuit, Solana-based investment products have received massive attention from investors. According to CCData’s digital asset management review, Solana-based investment funds’ assets under management (AUM) increased in July. The report showed that most of the boost happened on July 14, a day after Judge Torres ruled that XRP token sales on the secondary market are not investment contracts. Judge Torres’ ruling acted as a point of reference to other assets, including SOL, marked as securities by the SEC. CCData’s report stated that the AUM for SOL-based investment products increased by 55.7% to $87.8 million in July. This observation could be attributed to SOL’s impressive performance over the past month. Solana DeFi Activity On Bullish Recovery Regulatory uncertainty and the FTX fiasco affected the sentiment around Solana-based dApps, dipping further into the Solana DeFi ecosystem. DeFi Llama data shows that Solana’s total value Locked (TVL) crumbled from a peak of $9.66 billion in November 2021 to less than $300 million in 2023. But with the partial resolution and the heightened optimism for a clearer regulatory atmosphere, Solana DeFi’s activities have improved. Related Reading: Is Arbitrum Promise Fading? Downtime, Metrics Decline Raise ARB Price Alarms As of July 14, SOL TVL hit a yearly peak of approximately $1.1 billion before retracing to $313.9 million. A close look at the chart shows SOL TVL has witnessed a slight increase and now stands at $316 million. Chances that SOL will see a more bullish rebound following a total resolution of ongoing regulatory issues are high.

Worldcoin could onboard ""billions of users"" to crypto markets, said Austin Barack, a partner at CoinFund, in a blog post this week.

Altman claimed on Twitter Wednesday that one person signs up every eight seconds around the world.

Yusko made the prediction while comparing bitcoin to gold. Gold is not portable or divisible, whereas bitcoin is, CEO of the $1.6 billion asset management firm explained. ""Bitcoin fixes both of these issues, and is equally scarce,"" Yusko added, making the case that the digital asset could eventually catch up to the precious metal’s valuation.  “The monetary value of gold is about 6 trillion, I think bitcoin can replace all of that, the monetary equivalent of $6 trillion is about a 10X from here, which gives us a price of about $300K,” said Yusko.  He estimates that the $300,000 price could be reached by 2028, when bitcoin will go through another halving event.  Roughly every four years, the bitcoin rewards, the miners receive for successfully mining a block, are cut in half to control the blockchain's supply economics. This event is known as the halving and is often seen as a positive catalyst for the price of the digital currency as it reduces inflationary pressure on bitcoin. The next halving will be around April of 2024, followed by one in 2028.  Yusko’s bullish prediction hinges on using previous historical examples of how the price of bitcoin behaved after each halving event. ""Every [Bitcoin] halving we’ve added a zero, and by next April I think we could go to $100,000,” he said.  Yusko joins other bitcoin bulls who have recently predicted a higher price for the digital currency. Most recently, British multinational bank, Standard Chartered, predicted that bitcoin could reach $120,000 by the year-end. Meanwhile, Crypto services provider Matrixport, said it sees bitcoin rallying to as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024.

The asset extended this decline in the days that followed, but the downtrend this time was much more gradual. And yesterday, the coin may have found its bottom, as it has observed a sharp surge since then. The asset seems to have enjoyed some sharp recovery during the past day | Source: PEPEUSD on TradingView While the rise in the meme coin’s price has been rapid, the asset has still not fully recovered to the levels it had been at before the earlier plummet. But nonetheless, if PEPE can keep this momentum up, it’s possible that it might retest those levels soon enough. This latest rally has come as whales have been participating in some buying activity. According to Lookonchain on Twitter, an account that keeps track of moves being made by smart-money holders, two whales have bought sizeable portions of the meme coin using Ethereum during the past day.

In a governance vote concluded on Thursday, the protocol’s community favored introducing the so-called Enhanced DAI Savings Rate (EDSR), which may temporarily increase the interest rate DAI holders can earn to as high as 8%.  The action comes as the circulation of Maker’s dollar-pegged stablecoin has shrunk by a third from $6.9 billion in a year, according to Dai Stats. The broader stablecoin market, a key infrastructure and source of liquidity in the crypto ecosystem for trading and transactions, is in a downtrend, sinking to $127 billion from nearly $160 billion a year ago.  Maker increasingly backs DAI with yield-generating assets such as government bonds, and pays a part of the revenue to the users. The protocol hiked the DSR to 3.49% last month to make DAI more attractive compared to rival stablecoins that don’t pass on the revenues to holders. Still, investors deposited only $306 million in the DSR, less than 7% of the total supply.  “We have not yet managed to generate sustainable growth in new demand and capital inflows,” Maker founder Rune Christensen said in a governance forum post. “The EDSR helps fix this by ensuring that Dai holders that are pioneering the adoption of DSR get a more fair amount of value from the increased returns generated by the protocol.”  The EDSR rate will be determined based on the amount of deposits in the DSR facility and the base reward rate, and will decrease over time as usage increases.",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | MKR | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/27/makerdao-looks-to-ignite-growth-for-46b-dai-stablecoin-with-up-to-8-reward,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba50ee381949695713b092da9b6310f95c3672c7-1191x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410082,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6fe,1690473657,Suku May Beat Musk to Crypto Twitter Payment Adoption,"Twitter’s recent rebrand to “X” is a part of CTO Elon Musk’s plan to make the social media platform a payments application. However, another crypto company might just beat him to it.  Web3 wallet Suku, a crypto payments application that facilitates transactions over social media platforms, is starting with Twitter to allow users to directly send digital currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to each other.  Last week, Suku teamed up with sidechain Polygon to host an open-edition NFT mint in celebration of Polygon 2.0’s launch. Within the 48-hour mint period, users minted over 50,000 NFTs simply by posting a tweet tagging Suku and Polygon.  After posting, users were prompted to download the Suku Wallet chrome extension or access the wallet’s website by logging in with their Twitter handle to access the NFT. During the mint period, over 48,000 users opened up Suku accounts.  Yonathan Lapchik, CEO of Suku told CoinDesk that the wallet provider aims to make the crypto onboarding process as simple as possible – and that doesn’t involve “connecting a wallet” in the first place.  “We start with the assumption that we are going to be concentrating a lot of our efforts to bring in non-crypto users,” said Lapchik. “The majority of people will not have a wallet…for us, the first phase is really to give someone a wallet immediately.”  As part of Suku’s plan to usher in adoption, they cover any gas fees users would normally incur when sending or receiving payments.  Suku is starting with Twitter for their first foray into crypto payments and plans to add other social media platforms. While Twitter itself aims to evolve into a payments application, Lapchik said it’s difficult to create a decentralized payments system with one centralized application, therefore Suku needs to expand to other platforms for users to maintain a holistic social graph.  “If you use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and LinkedIn all day, you don't want to have a payment system for each one of those – you only want to have one that connects to all of the social media platforms,” said Lapchik. “That's exactly what we do, and when you top that off with being noncustodial and easy to use and easy to onboard, I think that’s a great formula.”  While crypto payments applications have long existed outside social media applications (and there was once a company called ChangeTip, a tool for sending bitcoin tips via social media which shuttered in 2016), several companies are now taking their products to social platforms. Earlier in July, messaging application Telegram said it will now support users in transferring crypto between chats.

15353774,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544646,1690473614,"Fed’s No Recession Claim Boosts Bitcoin And Crypto, Historical Data Contradicts","Arguably the most important takeaway from yesterday’s FOMC meeting was that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is no longer forecasting a recession, which led to a cautious rally in Bitcoin and crypto markets today. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s statement during the FOMC press conference seems to have eased investor concerns, leading to a swift recovery in both tradfi and crypto. However, historical data suggests that caution may be warranted as the potential for recession remains a looming concern (although Powell said otherwise). Signals For A Recession Remain Strong Prominent financial experts have raised their voices about the current economic situation. Steven Anastasiou, a noted economist, warns about the significance of the recent decline in the annual average M2 growth, which stands at -2.7% YoY. He draws parallels with some of the most challenging economic periods in history, stating, “With M2 falling, history suggests that continuing with aggressive tightening is a dangerous proposition… a falling M2 money supply has generally been correlated with economic depressions & panics.” Anastasiou also highlights the deflationary pressures in the economy, as reflected by the 12 consecutive monthly declines in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) growth rate. Drawing parallels to a deflationary bust seen in 1920-21, he emphasizes that “now is not the time to be delivering any additional tightening.” As we know, Powell did the opposite yesterday, raising the federal funds rate to a level not seen in 22 years. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And The Crypto Market Up Today? Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at financial giant Fidelity, shared insights from historical data on recessions. He notes that the lead times between changes in monetary policy and the subsequent economic consequences can vary significantly. Looking at past cycles, he observes, “The monetary policy cycle tends to lead the economic consequences to varying degrees.” The lead time ranged from 2 months to as much as 19 months, depending on the economic circumstances. During the 1970 cycle (when structural inflation was getting underway and the Nifty Fifty was born), “peak policy” led the recession by 19 months. In 1973-74, it was only 2 months. In 1990, (the S&L crisis), it was 16 months. In 2001, (tech bubble) it was 3 months, and in 2008 (GFC) it was 14 months. Another warning signal is the inverted yield curve, known for reliably foreshadowing economic recessions. The inverted yield curve is currently hitting levels unseen in over 40 years (since 1981), screaming recession. Gold bug Peter Schiff therefore remarked: The talking heads on CNBC all agree that if the U.S. enters recession, it will be a baby recession. Not only is recession a certainty, but it won’t be a baby. It will be the grand daddy of recessions. It will be so large that a more appropriate term to use will be a depression! Impact On Bitcoin And Crypto Amidst these economic concerns, the crypto is writing green numbers across the board. However, a recession is meaning uncertainty for Bitcoin. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin has not experienced a recession, leaving investors uncertain about its resilience in times of economic turbulence. While some tout Bitcoin’s “safe haven” potential, others argue that it might behave more like a risk asset, making it less attractive during a recession. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Drop By 20% In Coming Weeks Macro analyst Henrik Zeberg and the founders of Glassnode, Yann Alleman and Jan Happel, believe that “we are going to have the largest Crisis since 1929. First Deflation – later Stagflation. But first – #BlowOffTop”. In this scenario stocks, Bitcoin and crypto could rally hard before a recession “suddenly” hits the market. However, no one knows how the economy will react this time. Therefore, the coming two months and their macro data (CPI, PCE, jobs, unemployment rate, earning, etc.) will be indicators for Bitcoin and crypto investors to follow (just as J-Pow tirelessly repeated yesterday – “data dependency”). At press time, the Bitcoin price continued its slow grind up, trading at $29,523.

42410089,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT72n,1690473600,Enhancing Profitability of Wind and Solar Through Bitcoin Mining,"The “duck curve” – a challenge specific to the renewable energy landscape – has found an unexpected solution in Bitcoin mining. This curve reflects the conflict between peak demand periods and peak renewable energy production times, a discrepancy that grows as we increasingly embrace renewable energy sources, complicating grid management.  Bitcoin fixes this.  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry. Adolfo Contreras is a Senior Business Development Advisor at Blockstream. He has 20 years experience in satellite communications, weather intelligence for energy and transportation markets and Bitcoin.  Bitcoin mining revenue promotes profitable renewable infrastructure, aiding project financing and scaling the energy grid for a sustainable future. This is crucial for electrifying transportation and phasing out fossil fuels. Given the massive power storage and load balancing required, Bitcoin is a useful tool, especially considering the current economic and geopolitical climate.  Bitcoin miners, with their flexible operations, are uniquely well-equipped to navigate these energy supply fluctuations. By strategically aligning their activities with periods of high renewable energy production and low demand, they can optimize their energy usage and potentially alleviate the pressure on the grid.  This article will explore how Bitcoin miners are helping to manage the duck curve, and the strategies they are employing to balance demand and optimize energy consumption.  Renewable energy's uphill battle  In many countries, the amount of renewable capacity (though typically heavily under-utilized with the majority of power generation capacity unused or “wasted”) has increased dramatically over the last decade, exemplified by Europe.  But this is hardly making a dent in the world's fossil fuel consumption. Despite the many trillions of investment in the last couple of decades, fossil fuel consumption is still more than 82% of the world’s energy consumption.  In 2022 alone, there was an increase in renewable capacity of 266GW, which, assuming a (very low) average cost of $500k per MW, represents an investment of more than $130 billion in 2022 alone. For reference, a country like Spain with nearly 50 million people has never peaked in electricity consumption above 45GW.  The crux of the argument is this:  1. The electrification of supply is outpacing demand, with retail electricity demand not significantly growing due to economic stagnation and increased device efficiency.  2. Electric vehicle adoption isn't meeting expectations and EV charging habits, often at night, do not align with peak solar supply during daylight hours.  3. Significant displacement of fossil power use moving to electrical demand would require industries to adapt their manufacturing processes to electricity, a costly endeavor many are unwilling to undertake due to competitiveness issues.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - How Texas Became a Global Mecca for Bitcoin Mining  Therefore, we need an economically viable, electricity-intensive activity that is predictable, flexible, and doesn't require extensive transportation – and that's where Bitcoin mining comes in.  Below is a glimpse of the gigantic amounts of unused or wasted electricity due to insufficient demand vs generation capacity in California alone:  Additionally, we can’t ignore an additional bottleneck, which is the fact that wind and solar farms have significantly lower power density. That is, they need way more land surface to generate the same amount of electricity.  For these reasons, the distribution network for power will need a significant upgrade to scale and transmission expanded to connect generation plant locations to population areas where industrial and retail demand is.  Until these investments are made, we may encounter situations where additional installed capacity does not translate to additional renewable used generation in the electricity mix – unused capacity, definitionally not being in the mix.  Balancing energy supply and demand  The consequence of all these problems is that at particular times of the day (when the sun shines the most) the price in electricity wholesale markets crashes due to what’s called the duck curve:  The duck curve represents the demand remaining after subtracting variable renewable generation in the middle of the day when solar generation tends to be highest.  The problem of the duck curve is that photovoltaic installations planned to make money on the wholesale electricity market will not be making it in this scenario. Many installations will have to seek PPAs – power purchase agreements – which are bilateral agreements between electricity producers and offtakers, i.e. large electricity consumers.  Those who manage to sign them may save their projects at the expense of significantly lower profitability while those that do not, may be facing bankruptcy and outright abandonment of the installations.  Of course electricity storage in batteries or PSH – Pumped Storage Hydro - pumping water backup into hydro-elecric dams could help reduce the problem, but the cost of installing the amount needed would be astronomical and it is still to be seen if these systems can work at scale.  Enter Bitcoin mining  Mining hardware can be directly connected to wind and solar generation plants, consuming the excess energy produced during peak sunlight hours when solar installations generate an excess of electricity and absorb the wasted energy from the wholesale market.  By doing so, these plants help to balance the supply and demand in the electricity market, preventing the drastic price drops that occur when there is an oversupply of energy.  This is particularly beneficial for solar installations that struggle to sell their energy during these peak hours due to the low market prices.  Read more: Anna Baydakova - Want to Mine Bitcoin at Home? DIY Bitcoiners Have Stories to Share  Let's consider an example.  Suppose there's a solar farm in California that's producing a surplus of energy during the day.  Instead of selling this energy on the wholesale market at a low price, the farm could direct this excess energy to a Bitcoin mining operation, which would consume this surplus energy.  This would effectively remove the excess energy from the wholesale market, helping to stabilize electricity prices and making the solar farm's operation more profitable.  This means they can be located directly at or near the site of renewable energy installations, reducing the need for extensive energy transmission networks. They can also adjust their energy consumption based on the availability of renewable energy, consuming more when there is a surplus and less when there is a shortage.  For instance, a Bitcoin mining operation in Texas, where wind power is abundant, can ramp up its energy consumption during the night when wind power generation is at its peak and the demand from other consumers is low.  This helps to balance the energy supply and demand, preventing potential waste of the excess wind power.  Conclusion  In conclusion, the “Duck Curve” phenomenon presents a unique challenge in the renewable energy sector, but it also opens up an opportunity for innovative solutions. By absorbing the excess energy during periods of high renewable generation and low demand, Bitcoin mining can help balance the energy market, stabilize electricity prices, and enhance the profitability of renewable energy installations.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Adolfo Contreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/27/enhancing-profitability-of-wind-and-solar-through-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28ebb8a3281dcab10938c1c4c1fa2e40884b2616-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The US Government Blamed for Covering up Alien Activity On July 26, the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security held a highly-anticipated hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), commonly known as unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Three former military officials accused the US government of concealing important extraterrestrial findings. According to the whistleblower David Grusch, who is a former Air Force intelligence officer, the Pentagon is covering up a “multidecade” UAP program which aims at collecting and restoring crashed extraterrestrial crafts. Grusch testified under oath that he is aware of an alien spacecraft in possession of the US government and the “non-human” biological remains that were found on it. Ryan Graves and David Fravor, retired US Navy commanders, also claimed to have seen UAP findings while serving in the military. While speakers said they couldn’t share too much information due to it being classified, they raised concerns over the US government hiding too much regarding the matter. “If UAP are foreign drones, it is an urgent national security problem. If it is something else, it is an issue for science. In either case, unidentified objects are a concern for flight safety,” said Ryan Graves. The Crypto Market Reacts to the Buzz The “exciting” hearing quickly went viral and became trending on Twitter and Google searches. Crypto traders couldn’t miss the chance to capitalize on the new trend and launched over 50 alien-themed coins just over the span of 24 hours. Tickers like “ALIENX,” “UFO”, and “ALIEN” have invaded the crypto market. However, most of these tokens haven’t seen much trading activity so far. Only the larger and more established alien-themed coins have managed to improve their performance. For example, the native token of the popular blockchain game Alien Worlds, known as TLM, grew by 3.5% within 24 hours after the news broke. Among other UFO memecoins that have slightly climbed during the last day are the UFO Gaming Token (UFO) which gained 2.4% and the AlienFi token (ALIEN) which surged by 5.9%. Memecoins are known to quickly emerge in the midst of a growing trend. However, many of them could potentially be scams that try to take advantage of the hype.

42410093,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT7Ci,1690472700,Unblocking Crypto: How to Access The Asset Class,"According to stash.com's 100+ Cryptocurrency Statistics Investors Should Know in 2023, Americans currently represent about 13% of the over 320 million crypto owners worldwide, almost the population of the United States.  Alex Botte and Max Williams from Runa Digital Assets break down where your client could invest today and how. Since many options are available and we see more digital asset investment vehicles, now is a great time to start. Understanding the choices available for your customer will help you plan how to support them.  As you consider various digital asset investment vehicles, ask yourself the following:  How are your clients investing in digital assets today?  What assets are they buying now, and where are they planning to invest next? and  What is their motivation for digital asset investment?  Recall that many investors are seeking the support of an advisor, and studies show investors would give their advisors more money if they would manage crypto and digital asset investing.  Whether you are planning to manage your client's digital asset investments actively or playing a supporting role in offering guidance and tax planning, it's critical that you understand the expanding landscape and the menu of options your client has today.  – S.M.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Unblocking Crypto: How to Access The Asset Class  So your client wants exposure to crypto. Of course they could open their own retail account with a cryptocurrency exchange, such as Coinbase or Gemini, but they may want professional help with token selection, trading, custody, and asset allocation. So they come to you, their advisor. What are the options in the market today for your client? Even though crypto is a nascent asset class, it’s increasingly easy to access digital asset markets.  First, let’s go over the passive investment options in the market today. Investors may seek to obtain exposure to crypto and blockchain by investing in stocks of companies that are exposed to advancements in this space. A few examples:  ● Publicly traded companies whose businesses have digital asset exposure, such as Coinbase (crypto exchange) or bitcoin mining firms  ● Publicly traded companies like Microstrategy or Tesla with digital assets on their balance sheet  ● Blockchain themed ETFs like BLOK or BITQ, which offer diversified exposure to stocks in the crypto space  Another passive option is to invest in liquid tokens. Like we mentioned earlier, the client can do that themselves through an exchange like Coinbase or Gemini directly. They could also obtain indirect exposure through liquid token funds, separately managed accounts (SMAs), or exchange-traded investment products. Many of these products hold a single liquid token, usually the most mature tokens like BTC and ETH. Examples include:  ● The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is a closed-end investment fund that invests in BTC only. Closed-end means you can’t create/redeem shares, so the trust’s market price can deviate wildly from the market value of the underlying bitcoin held by the trust.  ● Bitcoin futures ETFs like BITO. Because these products invest in a derivative of bitcoin (futures) rather than spot, investors should beware of the layers of costs that make it less efficient than holding the digital asset itself. Note that in the US there is no available spot bitcoin ETF on the market. There have been many filings, but historically they have been rejected by the SEC. In June traditional finance giant BlackRock filed for a bitcoin spot ETF. Other asset managers, including Invesco and WisdomTree, quickly followed. The SEC is currently reviewing these applications.  ● SMAs can provide passive access to a single token (or actively managed exposure to a portfolio of tokens). The SMA structure enables end-client ownership, tax-loss harvesting, and customization.  The benefits of these options are that the digital assets are offered in familiar investment wrappers and can be held in brokerage accounts alongside other non-crypto investments.  As we mentioned in our previous CoinDesk article “Crypto Isn’t Ready for Jack Bogle,” if you’re going to invest in digital asset markets, we believe it’s best to either passively buy and “HODL” BTC or use active management to outperform. Leadership and valuation can change quickly and dramatically in crypto. Professional active managers may be able to identify the tokens that have the fundamental momentum and potential for long term appreciation. Actively managed options include (1) liquid token funds and (2) venture capital on the early stage investing side. (Note that these options typically command higher investment minimums and require meeting certain investor qualifications and therefore may not be suitable for everyone.)  The former includes multi-asset liquid token products that offer diversified exposure, can be long only or go long and short, can participate in on-chain activities like yield farming, and can be structured as familiar investment vehicles like SMAs or commingled hedge funds.  Venture (or VC) funds, on the other hand, will make both equity and token investments into companies and protocols at their earliest stages. Liquidity for these types of investments is low, as investors in these strategies are expected to hold for years to realize any return on their investment. While liquidity is low, the potential returns can be eye-opening when the early bets go on to succeed.  While crypto as an asset class is still very early, there is an expanding menu of investment options that advisors can present to their clients. On the passive, low fee side, there are more and more products coming to market - many in investment wrappers that clients are well familiar with. On the active side, traditional strategies like venture, trend following, market neutral, and fundamental investing are being applied to digital asset markets.  - Alex Botte and Max Williams, Runa Digital Assets  Ask an Advisor  I educate financial advisors about digital assets. Here are answers to common questions they ask about digital asset investing.  – Adam Blumberg CFP, co-founder of Interaxis  Q: My clients have crypto on an exchange or in a wallet. How can I see what they have?  A: One of the hallmarks of crypto and blockchain is transparency, which means we have visibility into all public chain trades and wallet holdings.  We already have tools and services that allow you, the advisor, to view clients’ crypto assets, even when you aren’t managing them. Most major crypto exchanges have APIs that allow for integration with reporting tools. And many reporting tools and platforms exist.  Q: If my clients own a crypto fund, do they own crypto assets?  A: They don’t. Most funds do not give the ability to redeem shares for the underlying crypto assets. Your clients have exposure to the assets, the asset class, or the infrastructure surrounding crypto.  The positive is that those are regulated funds, which can usually be held in retirement accounts. The negative is that they include more fees, and are not the same as holding actual crypto.  Keep Reading  France believes crypto is the future, and since EU has passed MICA and provided regulatory clarity, more people are participating, especially the next generation. This change is going to be global, can we expect the same trends here?  So your clients (or some of them) hold crypto. How are you going to help them manage these assets as part of their inheritance planning?  Woah, over 500 cryptocurrency exchanges in existence? How are retail investors to navigate this complex landscape?",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,"Sarah Morton, Alex Botte, CFA, CAIA, Max Williams",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/27/unblocking-crypto-how-to-access-the-asset-class,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f511a9e74551f31aeb224701a8263881e960076-4000x2672.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410071,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6Bt,1690472229,RFK Jr: Bitcoin ‘Currency of Freedom’; Canadian Government Morphed Into ‘Monster’ During Trucker Protests,"Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Canada’s government suddenly morphed into a monster during the trucker protests in that country’s capital of Ottawa last year.  The 69-year-old longtime environmental lawyer and Kennedy family scion made the comments during a 90-minute Twitter Spaces event on Wednesday. During the conversation, he also hailed bitcoin as a “currency of freedom” and revealed that he recently bought two bitcoins (BTC) for each of his seven children.  Read more: RFK Jr. Confirms Recent Bitcoin Purchases  Kennedy, who provided financial support to the protesting Canadian truckers in early 2022, said his bitcoin moment came during the final days of the protests when the Emergencies Act was invoked for the first time in Canada’s history. The Act gave Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government additional powers to help quash the demonstrations – including the authority to freeze the bank accounts of protest leaders and supporters.  “They did something that was, to me, unimaginable,” Kennedy explained. “They used facial recognition, license plate identification and a number of other technologies to determine the identities of the truckers, and then they froze their bank accounts and their credit cards.”  It was during that period that the soon-to-be presidential candidate experienced what he referred to as his “Damascus moment.”  “This government of Canada, which I think most people like me had considered a role model for Western liberal democracy,” Kennedy said, “suddenly morphed into this monster.”  “It occurred to me at that point that freedom of transaction was at least as important as freedom of expression,” Kennedy said in response to a question from the event’s organizer Scott Melker, a bitcoin investor and podcaster.  Read more: The Organizer of the Freedom Convoy Who Got Its Crypto Assets Seized  Kennedy appears to be the de facto political darling of the Bitcoin community and even delivered a keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami this past May. His comments yesterday, together with the confirmation of his recent bitcoin purchase, may also endear him to fellow bitcoiner, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, and one of Trudeau’s harshest critics, Pierre Poilievre.  Poilievre, a vocal proponent of bitcoin who once posted a video of himself buying a shawarma with the digital currency, had a reaction similar to Kennedy’s and accused Trudeau of “attacking his own population” at a news conference that followed the release of a report on the Trudeau government's use of Canada’s Emergencies Act.  RFK Jr. on Bitcoin T-Bills, capital gains, ETFs and censorship  Political chatter about bitcoin among U.S. presidential candidates has ramped up in recent months with GOP candidates like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy both publicly praising the digital currency.  Bitcoin treasury bills: Kennedy has gone as far as to propose ideas such as bitcoin Treasury bills (T-bills), i.e., government debt which would be backed by bitcoin and other commodities.  “My proposal is to make a small number of T-bills backed by a basket of hard assets, including gold, silver, platinum and bitcoin,” Kennedy explained yesterday. “We are looking at how that kind of commodity-based asset might put a little bit of discipline into the Fed and the practice of just printing money arbitrarily with no control and no backstop at all.”  Read more: RFK Jr. Vows to Back Dollar With Bitcoin, Exempt BTC From Taxes  Capital gains: The presidential hopeful also proposed scrapping the capital gains tax on bitcoin sales, but with a million-dollar cap to prevent large investment managers from exploiting the exemption.  “I've talked about some kind of suspension of the capital gains taxes for conversion of bitcoin,” Kennedy said. “One of the dangers we want to avoid is creating huge windfalls for BlackRock and for Goldman. But there may be evidence that we may be able to do that with a million-dollar cap, so small investors who are into bitcoin would not have to pay the capital gains taxes, but super large holding companies like BlackRock and Goldman would.”  Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs): Kennedy didn’t hide his apparent disdain for the large investment managers interested in bitcoin, many of whom have submitted bitcoin ETF applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Read more: Deadlines for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals Come Into Sight  “They're funneling people into these ETFs,” he said. “As soon as they create a central bank digital currency (CBDC), BlackRock will transform those ETFs from bitcoin into CBDCs and trap us all in that kind of slavery.”  Censorship: A recent controversial video posted by the New York Post shows Kennedy saying “COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.” He has also been a vehement critic of vaccines and has demanded better vaccine safety. He’s been called a bigot and an anti-vaxxer, but during the Twitter Spaces, claimed that all these labels are simply underhanded attempts to censor him.  “I'm getting slandered, silenced and censored,” he said. “When people hear me talk, they realize that I'm not a crazy person, not an anti-Semite, not an anti-vaxxer.”  Kennedy is currently polling somewhere in the mid-teens among Democratic voters according to polling website FiveThirtyEight. Incumbent Joe Biden, despite concerns about his age, is still the first choice for most Democrats, the site shows.  Among bitcoiners however, RFK Jr. is a top pick.  “Bitcoiners are a different breed,” Kennedy said. “They are ideologically based. They are people who love freedom.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/27/rfk-jr-bitcoin-currency-of-freedom-canadian-government-morphed-into-monster-during-trucker-protests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb84f0972b6a89a2efb45ef55da17547bd74b4ae-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The virtual store, created by retail technology developer Emperia, will integrate the traditional retail experience with digital innovations exclusive to users holding Lacoste’s UNDW3 NFT passes. An Insight Into UNDW3 & Lacoste’s Virtual Store Lacoste’s UNDW3 NFT holders will have exclusive access to the virtual store. UNDW3 is an NFT-based loyalty program the French brand released in June (similar to that of Starbucks). Holders will access the virtual store through Lacoste’s e-commerce platform. The digital store gives an immersive experience right from the beginning; Shoppers enter through Lacoste’s iconic crocodile, which will lead them to a tiled boutique. These shoppers also get to enjoy the beach view in the digital store from its outdoor pool area.

42410087,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6mG,1690467708,White House Derailed Negotiation on U.S. House Stablecoin Bill: McHenry,"House lawmakers have failed to reach a bipartisan deal on stablecoins legislation, with Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) blaming White House intransigence for the stalemate while the panel’s top Democrat said it was McHenry who shut down the talks.  The news comes a day after the finance-focused lawmakers advanced three bills on crypto issues to a vote in the full House of Representatives, the first time they advanced laws fully dedicated to the topic.  “Today I had hoped to announce an agreement with the ranking member on stablecoins legislation,” McHenry said, referring to the committee’s senior Democrat, Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). “This will not be the case… It was the White House’s unwillingness to compromise that has once again brought that negotiation to a halt.”  McHenry said he was “disappointed” but did not explain the details of the disagreement with the executive branch.  Any U.S. stablecoin bill would also have to win support in the Democrat-led Senate, so a bill coming solely from House Republicans rather than a bipartisan effort may be less likely to influence that other chamber. McHenry's choice to push the bill forward over the loud objections of committee Democrats may please fellow Republicans but could also harm its chances of becoming law.  Waters said the bill was “deeply problematic and bad for America,” and that it “promotes a race to the bottom by creating 58 different licenses,” allowing issuers to potentially include a wide range of assets in their reserve and allowing large corporations such as Meta or Walmart to issue money.  According to Waters, Democrats were concerned about the reserve provisions in the bill, as well as the parties' different views on the role federal regulators should have over stablecoin issuers.  “I urge Republicans to pull this extremist piece of legislation from the markup and your culture wars,” Waters added, citing the lack of oversight from the Federal Reserve and lack of provisions on diversity and inclusion.  The Thursday markup of the Republicans' stablecoin bill was highly contentious, with Republicans pushing forward and Democrats dragging their feet on every procedural point. The effort in the committee to openly negotiate the bill's details underlines the ongoing stalemate for U.S. stablecoin oversight.  A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Waters said neither the Fed nor the U.S. Treasury Department support the bill as it stands.  During the debate, Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) suggested voting be postponed to September, saying Democrats hadn’t had sufficient chance to pitch their ideas.  “We have had no meaningful opportunity to amend this bill ... that's an embarrassment,” Lynch said. “We want to be heard, and we want to have input on this.""  The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act was introduced by McHenry (R-N.C.) last week, and it seeks to offer a regulatory framework for crypto tied to the value of fiat currency. Stablecoins are a key element on the crypto markets, providing steady tokens with which investors can trade in and out of more volatile assets.  Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) argued that Republicans have been defending the ability to make anonymous payments, saying that promoting self-hosted wallets would aid rogue regimes.  “I am sure that future victims of North Korean nuclear terror truly appreciate the consideration of my Republican colleagues,” Foster said, also referring to fentanyl producers accepting crypto payments.  McHenry has previously warned that rival jurisdictions are “ahead of the game” on regulating crypto, with the European Union’s markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) set to take effect in 2024.  Last week CoinDesk reported that a bipartisan grouping of Senators is pondering a rival bill that would put stringent anti-money laundering (AML) requirements on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, in effect treating them like banks.

42410075,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6Lo,1690467005,Want to Mine Bitcoin at Home? DIY Bitcoiners Have Stories to Share,"Crypto has become institutionalized, from mainstream finance firms placing bets on this once-underground industry to big mining companies building industrial-scale coin-churning facilities.  But what if you’re an old-school cypherpunk who believes that you’re not really in crypto unless you mine your own coins? Can you still survive in the world of mega-farms and even make a buck or two?  This story is part of CoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.  The bear market has made mining less profitable but also dragged down the cost of the most expensive and power-hungry mining equipment: bitcoin mining ASICs. According to data from mining company Luxor, ASIC prices are back to where they were in early 2021, before the latest bull run.  At the same time, electricity prices have been rising for the past two years in the U.S. and worldwide, making mining economics challenging for small-time enthusiasts.  CoinDesk explored the possibilities for home miners available today. We found little in the way of encouraging news for anyone looking for more than a hobby. It’s clear after speaking to some home miners that it’s hard to make money in this market – and is likely to remain a niche even in another bull run.  Sucking it up  Garrett Casada, who runs a home building company in Texas, is also a proud owner of Suck It Up Mining – a two-men operation with a garage full of mining equipment. The name invokes the ambition to “suck up” as much mining capacity as possible – and the resilience necessary to be a miner.  “Sometimes, you have great days in mining, and then, they come up with a new law or something – suck it up, move on!”  Casada and his one employee, a programmer, have been mining a broad variety of cryptocurrencies on a ranch in rural Texas. It all started in 2020 with two graphics processing units (GPUs), he said.  Now, his farm has 80 ASIC miners hashing new blocks for the Bitcoin, Zcash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin blockchains, and multiple racks of GPUs and central processing units (CPUs), most of which are dedicated to Chia. Altogether, they consume one megawatt of power and $20,000 a month in power electricity bills.  The profits? No great shakes. Casada is holding on to the coins he’s mined for now.  Read also: Can You Still Mine Bitcoin and Other Crypto From Home?  “I haven’t sold none of my coins for the past year because the price is so low. If I was to sell it right now I would barely cover the electricity,” he admits. “Bitcoin is great, but you got to hold it.”  It was better during the bull market though: “In 2021, our utility bill was $80,000 and we were profiting $120,000,” Casada said.  He experimented with generating power independently with solar panels, but that has not worked out well so far: according to Casada, he spent $150,000 on 300 solar panels, which are now producing about $1,000 worth of solar power a month on the mining garage’s roof.  For those eager to repeat his experiment anyway, Casada provides a rough calculation: for two S19 ASICs manufactured by Antminer, which cost about $3,000 each, you need 20 solar panels – plus $30,000. That setup would bring you $2 to $5 worth of bitcoin a day. Probably better to take the same amount of money and just buy some bitcoin on an exchange and hold it, Casada said.  Hot stuff  Gerald Glickman, a bank employee from Virginia, decided to go further than just mine bitcoin: he built a water-heating system for the pool in his backyard to utilize the excess heat from his bitcoin miner.  Glickman admits he’s not the handiest person he knows. “It was quite a bit of learning and research,” he said. “I’m not the Mister Fix-It around the house.”  However, with a strong enough motivation, an abundance of online content and some help from his electric engineer friend, Glickman managed to build his mining-powered water heating system.  The miner is immersed in dielectric oil inside a water-proof container. The oil is heated by the miner and pumped out of the container via thin pipes into a heat exchanger, where the pipes touch the water circulating through the pool’s water recycling system. As a result, the water heats up and goes back into the pool, and the oil cools down and flows back into the mining container.  The entire contraption cost about $6,000, including the Antminer S19j Pro ASIC, Glickman said, and a few days of work.  “I probably spent more time doing research and safety preparations. My wife was very skeptical,” he added. The system has been running for two months now and, according to Glickman’s calculation, the amount of bitcoin and useful heat are just enough to cover the cost of electricity.  He’s not selling his coins yet, though. Because Glickman believes that bitcoin is the future, he sees his mining project as a proxy way to buy a little bit of bitcoin every day.  DIY challenge  “I’m mining in the red,” said Will Foxley, former director of content at Compass Mining – and a home miner himself.  Foxley set up a single Whatsminer ASIC in a self-made wood and plaster container outside his parents’ house. He started this journey a year ago, but after the first month he unplugged the three machines he purchased after they kept overheating inside the container and automatically turning off, said Foxley (who is also a former CoinDesk reporter).  “You think you have a setup and you think it’s gonna work, then something stops working,” he said. “You have to iterate a lot.”  This spring, Foxley started anew, with just one ASIC, and now he’s been mining bitcoin for three months. He chose the Whatsminer device because it’s more tolerant of higher temperatures than Bitmain’s Antminer ASICs, famously popular with the large-scale miners, he said. Plus, unlike some other miners, Whatsminer does not require a three-phase electric system to plug it into, so you don’t need to make additional modifications, Foxley explained.  Read also: Don’t Call It a Comeback: The Unlikely Rise of Home Bitcoin Mining  Running the ASIC caused the monthly power bill to grow by $200, with the electricity price around 12-13 cents per kilowatt-hour in Colorado where Foxley lives, he said. The hand-made, sound-proof box cost somewhere between $300 and $500, plus about $300 worth of electrical products, he said.  Mining within a mining pool, during the three months the ASIC has been running, Foxley was able to mine about 2% of a bitcoin, Foxley said. At current prices, that’s worth about $580, hardly enough to cover his costs.  Even if bitcoin’s price keeps rising and makes home mining profitable for a time, it won’t be sustainable as a business, Foxley said:  “You have to either have another use case in mind (heating your home) or time the market really really well.” In other words, catch the cheap ASICs, cheap power and expensive bitcoin at the same time.  That doesn’t mean it’s over for retail mining, Foxley said, as small miners can work together and maximize the output of their operations. “Home mining will always be tiny though.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/27/want-to-mine-bitcoin-at-home-diy-bitcoiners-have-stories-to-share,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/874bbc65741b633edbae7c3b8b5d1db54d48b5d0-1909x1022.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Which way will the market tip in the coming days? Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Suggests Market Is Neutral A few days back, Bitcoin had observed a sharp plunge that had taken the cryptocurrency’s value towards the $29,000 level. In the days that followed, the asset had only consolidated around these relatively low levels, but during the last 24 hours, things appear to have changed a bit. The impetus for this latest volatility appears to have been the US Federal Reserve (Fed) hiking interest rates by an expected 25 bps. Shortly after the FOMC meeting had announced this increase, Bitcoin started to surge, giving investors hope that the coin may be traveling back toward the $30,000 level. This new rise, however, seems to have already run out of steam, as BTC has fallen back to lower levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,400, down 2% in the past week. BTC's recovery hasn't been much yet | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView While Bitcoin has retraced from its peak during the past day, the cryptocurrency is still up a net amount in this period, meaning that the asset has managed to hold onto some recovery nonetheless. Related Reading: This AMD Ryzen Bug Can Compromise Your Crypto Wallet Keys The fact remains, though, that the coin has been unable to keep up its upward trend, a sign that the market is still perhaps indecisive about its direction.

This index has a value of 51 right now, which means that the Bitcoin investor sentiment is almost exactly in the balance. This lack of direction in the market isn’t a new development; the investors have been leaning towards neutrality for a week or so now. The trend in the Fear & Greed Index over the past year | Source: Alternative The current neutral sentiment must not be confused with a lack of interest in Bitcoin, however, as data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment shows that the share of social media discussions related to the 100 largest assets in the cryptocurrency sector occupied by BTC alone (the “social dominance“) is now at a two-week high.

This is just a small part of the billions of donations Ukraine has raised in fiat. But the crypto part contributed to purchases of weapons, ammunition, medical equipment and other crucial war supplies.  One year ago, last June, the total amount of crypto donations was about $135 million, showing that crypto users around the world kept supporting Ukraine throughout the past year. However, the monthly donation amounts stagnated in late 2022 and 2023, never raising more than $10 million a month since last May.  March 2022 was the most fruitful month for donations, as the war has just started and the global support for helping Ukraine fend off Russia’s invasion was the strongest.  Read more: Where the Coins Go: Inside Ukraine’s $135M Wartime Fundraise  Humanitarian initiatives attract more donations than the army’s fundraisers, Crystal’s data show. Ukrainian funds raised around $134 million in crypto for humanitarian needs, while military-oriented campaigns gathered $91 million.  Most donations ($83 million) came in the form of USDT, Crystal calculated, slightly less was in ether ($79 million). Bitcoin donations contributed $41 million and smaller cryptocurrencies like Binance USD (BUSD), Polkadot’s DOT and others made up the rest.  In the meantime, Russia’s military and paramilitary units have also been using crypto to get some material support from Russians and sympathizers abroad. Those fundraising efforts have been much been more clandestine, as CoinDesk reported earlier.  This low-profile character of fundraising, together with the broad global condemnation of Russia’s actions, might be the reason for much smaller amounts raised: Crystal says that crypto donations for the Russian military only brought about $2 million in crypto, though other estimates show higher amounts.

Meta’s Metaverse Investment Takes a Toll The tech giant posted its latest earnings report, which revealed that it had faced significant losses in the second quarter of 2023, with metaverse-related expenses amounting to a staggering $3.74 billion. As part of its ongoing investment in the virtual reality (VR) business, Meta has already spent a total of $7.7 billion in 2023. Despite the substantial losses in its metaverse ventures, Meta managed to report an 11% increase in revenue for Q2 2023 compared to the same period last year, reaching a total revenue of $31.9 billion. This revenue growth, however, was overshadowed by the concerning performance of its metaverse-focused Reality Labs. Reality Labs Revenue Hits a Low The revenue from Reality Labs, which is responsible for Meta's metaverse initiatives, plummeted by nearly 40% compared to Q2 2022, hitting its lowest point in two years with just $276 million in revenue. Meta's financial chief, Susan Li, attributed this sharp decline to reduced sales of its VR headset, Quest 2. Additionally, the department's expenses rose by 23% to $4.0 billion, primarily due to increased staffing costs. Meta anticipates further challenges for Reality Labs, with projected operating losses expected to persist throughout 2023. The losses were attributed to the ongoing development of VR-related products and continued investments in the metaverse. Stock Price Surge Despite Metaverse Woes Following the earnings announcement, Meta's stock price experienced a significant surge, rising over 7% in after-hours trading, reaching around $320, as reported by Google Finance data. Despite this recent increase, $META shares remain below their all-time high of over $378, set in September 2021. Nevertheless, the stock has gained nearly 140% year-to-date. Threads Platform Faces Challenges Zuckerberg acknowledged that while the platform had seen unexpected daily engagement, the company's primary focus was on user retention, followed by growth and eventual monetization. This statement came on the same day as a report from Similarweb, claiming that Threads had experienced a 60% decline in users since its launch. Threads initially reached 49 million daily active users on its Android app on July 7, but the numbers fell drastically to 12.6 million by July 23. However, the CEO has remained hopeful about the platform’s performance, claiming that the company strategy was “fully committed to the metaverse vision.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 is available now, bringing immediate benefits to dApp developers including robust encryption and enterprise-grade transaction security through its utilization of Intel SGX technology. The project is aiming to foster real-life adoption of blockchain through a robust, user-friendly and secure network that relies on hardware and software solutions to address challenges around legal compliance, data privacy, and interoperability. Swisstronik aims to become the preferred blockchain solution for dApp developers, individuals, enterprises and anyone else who cares about compliant and safe solutions while staying true to crypto’s ethos of privacy and decentralization. The launch of Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 comes at a time when interest in networks that can support secure, private transactions in a highly regulated environment is growing. Existing privacy solutions are too focused on anonymity, which is anathema to regulations. Amid the tightening regulations around crypto globally, increased regulatory action against cryptocurrency exchanges and early adoption of central bank digital coins (CBDCs), it’s clear that the crypto industry urgently requires a compliant yet privacy-preserving, decentralized alternative. Once CBDCs launch, the industry will require a compliant and compatible bridge between them and the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This is the gap Swisstronik is aiming to fill with its identity-based blockchain platform powered by the first of its kind Web3 Compliance Suite - a self-regulating network of local personal data verifiers and compliance partners that allows seamless yet compliant cross-border operations.. Swisstronik’s Compliance Suite is created to reduce any company's regulatory burden by doing compliance management in a more cost-effective and user-centered manner to ensure privacy and safety for every user. Moreover, because all interactions are executed inside fully encrypted Intel SGX enclaves, Swisstronik nodes cannot access the details of any transaction. The SGX enclaves can be likened to creating a protective wrapper around the EVM, ensuring all transaction information is hidden from the rest of the network. It means every transaction on Swisstronik’s blockchain is fully isolated and safeguarded from prying eyes. In a future update, Swisstronik will bolster its privacy and security features with the addition of zk-SNARKs – cryptographic proofs that allow one party to provably verify information without having to reveal it. Based on zero-knowledge proofs, zk-SNARKs will be especially useful for verifying KYC data and other personal information of users. Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) standard, meaning developers can seamlessly migrate Ethereum-based dApps and smart contracts to its ecosystem. Future versions of the Swisstronik Testnet will implement the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, further enhancing the interoperability among Cosmos based-blockchains. Swisstronik anticipates a great deal of interest among dApp developers looking to build compliant offerings and explore data security concepts such as Intel SGX and zk-SNARKs, having received more than 750+ applications for early access to its testnet, despite not making any active efforts to promote the network. To ensure the integrity of its testnet and increase confidence within the community, Swisstronik is delighted to announce the launch of its first Bug Bounty campaign, with a $70,000 reward fund. The campaign will end on September 15, 2023, after which any bugs found will be fixed before the launch of Swisstronik Testnet 2.0 in the autumn. About Swisstronik Swisstronik is building a scalable layer-1 network to address challenges around legal compliance, data privacy, and interoperability in order to boost real-life adoption of the blockchain. Its goal is to become the go-to solution for developers building compliant, privacy-preserving dApps and cryptocurrency users who value data protection and transaction secrecy. Swisstronik is the first platform that lets anyone build compliant yet private dApps with zero legal expertise. It does so with an unprecedented combination of two functionalities – a first of its kind Web3 Compliance Suite that gathers international regulators, KYC issuers and other legal service providers in a self-regulating network, and combination of programmable, hardware-based protection technology based on Intel SGX, and cryptographic techniques based on zero-knowledge proofs. As a result, Web3 companies can become KYC, AML and DPR compliant with minimum costs by launching on Swisstronik or integrating one of its utilities in their dApps on other chains. And users can be sure their data stays private & secure even during identity checks.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Derivatives giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) regulated bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures saw record participation from large traders in the second quarter. The number of large open interest holders, or entities holding at least 25 bitcoin futures contracts, averaged a record 107 in the second quarter, the CME said in an email to CoinDesk. Ether's so-called large open interest holders averaged 62 through the second quarter. ""Bitcoin futures institutional interest continued to increase throughout the quarter as investors sought regulated venues/products to hedge rising market volatility and manage risk and exposure,"" the exchange said.  The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) wants FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to spend the remainder of his time before his criminal trial in jail, alleging he has tried multiple times to tamper with witnesses. Bankman-Fried, flanked by two attorneys, appeared in federal court Wednesday after the DOJ alleged he shared documents with the New York Times to try and discredit former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, with whom he'd previously been in a relationship. Assistant U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon opened the hearing by saying the DOJ was seeking Bankman-Fried's detention. ""It is the government's view that no set of release conditions can secure the safety of the community,"" she said. ""... it appears to be undisputed the defendant provided the documents quoted [in the New York Times] ... to discredit [Ellison].""  Meta (META) hasn’t given up on the metaverse despite a very public pivot to artificial intelligence. “Our investments in AI continue,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the company earnings call Wednesday evening. “We remain fully committed to the Metaverse vision as well,” he continued. “We've been working on both of these two major priorities for many years in parallel now, and in many ways the two areas are overlapping and complementary.”. The focus on the metaverse hasn’t been profitable for the social media giant – Meta’s Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) unit, which is responsible for metaverse, lost $13.7 billion on revenue of $2.2 billion in 2022, up from a loss of $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion the previous year.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price on Bitfinex and the exchange's stablecoin ratio since mid-2020. The exchange stablecoin ratio is the ratio of the market value of bitcoin held in the exchange wallets to the market cap of stablecoins stored in the exchange wallets.  The ratio has surged since January 14.  Per market analyst Cole Garner, blow ups in the ratio have historically portended bullish price action.

42410083,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6ix,1690462800,Palm Foundation to Scale Its Native Network to Support NFT Minting and Trading,"Non-fungible token (NFT) infrastructure firm Palm Foundation has laid plans to scale its support for minting and trading tokens on its native Palm Network.  In doing so, it’s tapping Ethereum sidechain developer Polygon Labs and Web3 tooling company Consensys to build out Palm’s network as a Polygon Zero Knowledge (ZK) Supernet.  Polygon’s ZK Supernet is a customizable layer 2 network that aims to provide easy onboarding for users and developers. The network is tailored toward projects that want to scale their Web3 enterprise endeavors.  By leveraging the Polygon Supernet, Palm Foundation hopes to grow its native network infrastructure across its existing 1.7 million wallet addresses. The Palm Network already supports NFT collections from sports franchises like Major League Baseball, NASCAR and WWE, as well as entertainment companies Netflix and Warner Brothers, sold through NFT platform Candy Digital.  Palm Network will soon be able to help the companies within its ecosystem create decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), or subdaos, to help govern their communities within the greater Palm DAO.  Andrea Lerdo, Executive Director of the Palm Foundation, told CoinDesk that in order to support the current sales volume on the Palm Network, it’s necessary to scale the network while keeping gas fees low and transaction speed high.  “The layer 2 just gives us the ability to process more transactions faster and also still use layer 1 security,” said Lerdo. “This is a trend that we're seeing everyone scale to, and I think we're preparing to onboard the next billion people into Web3.”  Additionally, the Palm Network will be compatible with Ethereum and Polygon 2.0, helping projects expand into additional ecosystems with a focus beyond NFTs. Jordi Baylina, co-founder of Polygon, said in a press release that the Polygon Supernet’s high speed, low cost and customizable nature makes it an ideal network for the Palm Foundation’s expansion of access to NFTs.  “By leveraging Polygon Supernets technology, developers of Palm Network can preserve the user experience amid even the highest network activity while minimizing the gas costs for its community – resulting in a significantly more accessible and democratic ecosystem,” said Baylina.  The Palm Network will begin its integration to a Proof-of-Stake (POS) blockchain on August 1 and will complete its migration to a ZK Supernet in 2024.  In addition to its network, the Palm Foundation governs Palm NFT Studio, which recently merged with NFT platform Candy Digital, rebranding under the Candy name.

42410077,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6SQ,1690462800,Crypto Broker Hidden Road Collaborates With Confidential Exchange Enclave Markets,"Hidden Road, a cryptocurrency brokerage and credit network for institutions, has entered into a partnership with Enclave Markets, a fully encrypted exchange that allows participants to confidentially trade blocks of digital assets.  Front-running of trades is an acute problem in crypto, which features unique issues like maximal extracted value (MEV), where blockchain miners and verifiers can profit from pending transactions. Traders at competing firms may also avoid trading with one another to prevent potential information leakage, hence the need for an anonymous trading environment.  Enclave, an idea originally proposed and incubated by the Ava Labs team, has coded up a exchange matching engine and account management system inside an Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) secure enclave, a type of hardware used to minimize cyber security threats.  Enclave’s Fully Encrypted Exchange, or FEX, offers a confidential trading environment rather like a dark pool in traditional markets. The model essentially creates a crossing network using a pricing oracle to establish a midpoint price for an asset, averaged across various trading venues.  When a user logs on, funds an account and submits an order, they only need the size and direction of the proposed trade; they don’t need to put in the price, because all the trades are matched at that midpoint price whenever there’s liquidity on the other side, explained Enclave Markets CEO David Wells.  The partnership with Hidden Road further assures institutions since trading and settlement of assets is done directly from custody, with the added buying power of a credit line that’s typically offered by prime brokers.  “Traditional institutions don’t want to integrate directly with exchanges, send their funds and have that counterparty risk,” said Wells in an interview with CoinDesk. “An API call allows you to submit your order to the Enclave marketplace liquidity pool. We then match that order and report that trade back to Hidden Road, who do all the settlement and clearing on their side, netting those trades out against other trades done that day in different venues.”  As well as integrating with Hidden Road’s network of custodians, Enclave is also partnering directly with custody platforms, including BitGo, Wells pointed out.  Hidden Road, which raised $50 million last year from big players like Citadel Securities and Coinbase, has been busy adding partners in bid to build more grown-up crypto trading infrastructure.  “Enclave’s novel, albeit familiar, approach offers Hidden Road counterparties a secure, anonymous and streamlined option for trading digital assets,” said Michael Higgins, Global Head of Business Development at Hidden Road in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/27/crypto-broker-hidden-road-collaborates-with-confidential-exchange-enclave-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c25917810e232f247c09c1e431f02d99aae3f0b-1200x593.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410076,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6P7,1690462800,"Coinbase, a16z-Backed 'Cash-Like' Crypto Wallet Beam Goes Live","Crypto wallet Beam, which is backed by notable digital asset investors, such as venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the investment arm of Coinbase (COIN), went live on Thursday.  Beam was developed by fintech firm Eco, the developer of a protocol of the same name. The wallet will support the protocol's native token ECO and stablecoin USDC, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday.  Where most wallets require signing up, performing a degree of know-your-customer (KYC) checks, Beam users can send payments simply by using a link to a QR code. Thus it is aiming to create the closest possible equivalent to using crypto like cash.  The wallet is built on Ethereum layer-2 blockchains Optimism and Coinbase's Base, the latter of which is set for a public launch next month.  Eco said Beam was made possible by Ethereum's ERC-4337 implementation, which is seen as a key enhancement that could make it easier for users to recover crypto if they lose private keys to an online wallet, and Optimism's ""Superchain"" initiative, which is meant to greatly increase transaction speeds and reduce fees.  Simplifying the process of sending and receiving crypto is one of several problems which could pave the way an acceleration in mainstream adoption, which many developers are exploring solving. In March, the Wallet bot on messaging app Telegram enabled cryptocurrency to be sent in chats, with the facility for merchants to accept payments added earlier this month.  Eco raised around $95 million across five funding rounds between September 2019 and July 2021, with Founders Fund, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Pantera Capital among the investors, as well as a16z and Coinbase Ventures.

42410080,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcT6cL,1690462800,Amazon Expands Web3 Reach With Cloud Tools That Help Blockchain Developers,"Amazon (AMZN) added new tools to Amazon Web Services, the world's largest cloud platform, designed to make it easier for developers to build blockchain-based Web3 software.  Tools called ""Access"" and ""Query"" were added to Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB), a fully managed service that lets users build applications faster using provision blockchain infrastructure, according to a Thursday press release. The announcement came during the two-day AWS Web3/Blockchain Summit in New York City.  Amazon Managed Blockchain has gradually moved further into the Web3 space. Earlier this year, Amazon (AMZN) posted new job listings for Web3 staffers. Recent reports have also suggested that Amazon is working on a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace slated for release sometime this year, though the company has not yet confirmed the rumors.  AMB Access expands node offerings with serverless, scalable access to blockchains. Developers can use standard remote procedure calls, a method of asking an external computing source to perform a function, to interact with digital assets and distributed applications across multiple blockchains without specialized infrastructure. The service will initially support the Bitcoin network.  AMB Query provides developers access to blockchain data across multiple chains, beginning with Bitcoin and Ethereum, through application programming interfaces (API). Pricing is done through a pay-as-you-go model.  Amazon lists the potential use cases as custodial and wallet crypto applications and Web3 consumer engagement campaigns that use NFTs.  “Amazon Managed Blockchain Access and Query provide friction-free access to blockchain networks and their data so developers can easily create their Web3 applications,” Saman Michael Far, vice president of financial services technology at AWS, said in a statement.

However, amidst this uncertainty, a new memecoin called Pomerdoge has emerged, generating excitement and gaining traction as the potential frontrunner for the best investment of 2023. Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Analysts Tags Pomerdoge (POMD) Best 2023 Investment As meme coins continue to rise, new projects are springing up with new uses and access to untapped industries. One such project is Pomerdoge. Pomerdoge will be a P2E game that will connect players from all corners of the globe. The Pomerdoge ecosystem will have three key components; NFT collections, Pomergame (an immersive game center with rewards and compensation), and Pomerplace (a marketplace for the buying, selling, and trading of valuable in-game items). One of the notable highlights of Pomerdoge lies in its unwavering commitment to security and user protection. Currently, Pomerdoge is in the initial phase of its token presale and is available at only $0.0000264 per token. Those who jump in now will benefit from the upcoming 40x price surge and receive profits based on their holdings. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Dips Despite New Development As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to make its mark in the crypto-sphere, Shiba Inu's (SHIB) ecosystem lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has announced that Shibarium will launch in August. Despite the news, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still trading between $0.0000072 and $0.0000078, following recent price advancements last week. However, to experience an upward surge, Shiba Inu (SHIB) needs to overcome a supply barrier near the $0.000008 level, where 91,460 addresses hold a considerable amount of SHIB. At present, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 5.24% drop in the last 24 hours, resting at $0.0000072. Notably, IntoTheBlock's Global In/Out of the Money indicates a significant supply barrier in the $0.000008 to $0.000014 range. Many Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors have purchased SHIB at an average price of $0.000010, with 400,380 addresses holding 286.42 trillion SHIB. A successful breakthrough of this barrier could potentially propel Shiba Inu (SHIB) toward the $0.000014 to $0.000019 range. Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Losing Relevance? In 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) emerged as a remarkable meme cryptocurrency, capturing widespread attention and reaching its peak of $0.7376 in May. The excitement surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) was amplified by endorsements from prominent figures like Elon Musk, whose acquisition of Twitter in 2022 triggered multiple price surges for the memecoin. Over time, Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed the crypto ladder, thanks to support from the Dogecoin (DOGE) community, and is now the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, the fortunes of Dogecoin (DOGE) took a turn after its all-time high. The bankruptcy of several cryptocurrency firms in 2022 further impacted Dogecoin's (DOGE) price. Presently, Dogecoin (DOGE) is being traded at $0.065436, exhibiting a modest increase of 0.25% within the last 24 hours. Conclusion Amid the price declines for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), the emergence of Pomerdoge has reignited investors' interest in meme coins. The prospect of Pomerdoge surpassing these top guns in the market has generated interest from investors. Pomerdoge's utility and connection to the gaming sector which houses millions of users can help propel POMD's price in the ongoing run, making it an enticing investment opportunity.

Meanwhile, Tradecurve (TCRV), currently in its presale phase, is eyeing an astounding 50x pump. This article will delve into the factors driving the surges in Solana and Ripple, and explore why Tradecurve is predicted to make such a significant splash. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Solana (SOL): Empowering DeFi and NFTs with Blazing Fast Transactions Solana (SOL)'s price suffered a significant downturn in 2022 due to a mishap involving FTX and multiple network security vulnerabilities. The speculation was rife that FTX was the driving force behind Solana's bull run, and when FTX went bust, the Solana ecosystem took a hit. Following this, Solana showed signs of resilience, inching close to the $25 mark in early 2023. However, the recovery was short-lived due to an SEC investigation into alleged unregistered security offerings, leading to another price retreat of over 27%. Fast forward to the present, and Solana has finally managed to pierce through the $25 resistance. The asset moved from $21 to $32 in just two days — gains of 50% for Solana investors who had held the asset through thick and thin. Analysts note the breakout above the $22-25 level is significant. They also expect a further rally to $40 in the coming weeks for Solana. However, Solana still relies on Bitcoin (BTC) movements. As such, any pullback in the leading cryptocurrency’s price could dampen the bullish sentiment. Ripple (XRP) Surge Over 50%: Resurgence of the Digital Payment Giant The SEC's ruling has finally laid to rest the debate surrounding Ripple (XRP). The verdict: it is NOT a security, and as such Ripple can be traded freely across US markets without fear of regulatory repercussions. In response to the announcement on July 13, Ripple's price soared by almost 100% within a single day. However, the initial euphoria among Ripple investors has since settled down, with the price of Ripple correcting to a current price of $0.76 after peaking at $0.94 At present, Ripple traders are closely monitoring the $0.73 level, which is considered a significant support point for Ripple. If the price were to fall below this level, we could see a further correction for Ripple, possibly down to the $0.55 range. Tradecurve (TCRV) Eyes 50x Presale Pump: Unraveling the Potential Tradecurve (TCRV) represents a cutting-edge evolution in trading platforms. It marries the advantages of both centralized and decentralized exchanges through its unique hybrid model. Its broad trading portfolio spans commodities, stocks, forex, and beyond. They encapsulate a robust variety of financial instruments. A standout feature of Tradecurve is its departure from the standard, often cumbersome, KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. This allows traders to seamlessly navigate global financial markets without navigating identity verification steps that are typical on many platforms. But the innovative elements of Tradecurve don't stop there. The platform comes with AI-enhanced algorithmic trading, trading leverage up to 500:1, and access to social trading services. Furthermore, it hosts a metaverse-based trading academy, offering an immersive educational experience for traders Demand for TCRV during the Tradecurve presale is skyrocketing. This is with more than 100 million TCRV tokens sold and a price increase of 150% from $0.010 to $0.025 in just a few months. Market analysts suggest this might be the tip of the iceberg for Tradecurve's upward trajectory. In fact, they are projecting the potential for TCRV to soar to $1.00 following its listing on major exchanges later this year.

What Is Wrong With Worldcoin? Controversies surrounding the project and reservations like privacy concerns have brought about skepticism and reluctance to sign up on the platform. As part of the sign-up process, users must scan their iris using “The Orb,” available at designated locations worldwide. Once the user is verified as human, they receive the “World ID” alongside 25 WLD, the project’s native token, worth roughly $60. Related Reading: Singaporean Judge Declares Crypto Is Personal Property In ByBit Case Many have questioned how safe it is to use “The Orb” and how the project will handle such sensitive data, with prominent figures like Twitter’s former CEO Jack and Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressing their concerns. Stark Difference Between Pre-Launch And Post-Launch Figures Worldcoin saw an impressive 2 million sign-ups before the project’s launch. However, there seems to be a stark difference between the pre-launch and post-launch numbers. Hong Kong was one of the cities with the most number of sign-ups. The South China Morning Post reported that the three designated locations in Hong Kong saw a combined total of about 600 sign-ups on the first day. According to the report, Heather Huang, an operator of one of the Orbs in the city, asserted that the 600 sign-ups accounted for almost half of the total Worldcoin sign-ups on launch day. If 600 sign-ups represent half of the total sign-ups on the first day, that will invariably mean only about 1,200 people signed up on launch day – a not-so-impressive figure compared to how many Worldcoin claims signed up pre-launch. WLD trails $2.2 as skepticism mounts | Source: WLDUSD on TradingView.com Worldcoin’s Co-Founder Reacts In what may be a direct response to the alleged dwindling signups, Worldcoin’s co-founder and Open AI CEO Sam Altman tweeted a video of many users queuing to sign up at what looks like one of the designated locations of “The Orb.” He posted the video with the caption: Day 3 of @worldcoin launch, crazy lines around the world. one person getting verified every 8 seconds now Many Twitter users were quick to react to the video, with some going as far as to suggest that users who were signing up were simply doing it for the money (the 25 WLD tokens users receive upon sign-up) without being aware of the repercussions.

The tokens issued via the smart contract network Avalanche (AVAX) represent equity in Spanish real estate investment trust Mancipi Partners, supervised under the test environment of Spain’s securities regulator (CNMV). Trading with equity tokens on secondary markets will start in September, the firm said.  The issuance comes as traditional capital markets and crypto are becoming increasingly intertwined by placing old-school investment products like private equity and debt on blockchain applications in the form of tokens. Tokenization could disrupt the current financial infrastructure and create a more efficient system, Bank of America (BAC) said. The market for tokenized assets could mushroom to $16 trillion by 2030, according to a Boston Consulting Group report.

Last year, Securitize tokenized investment funds of asset managers Hamilton Lane and KKR in the U.S. The firm also expanded to Europe entering Spain’s regulatory test environment for digital assets last summer.

Recent downtime incidents and declining metrics have raised concerns among investors and users, challenging the network’s resilience. This kind of downtime raises concerns about the network’s stability and the potential impact on users and DeFi protocols running on the platform.

The information surfaced through the Arbitrum scanner, but the exact cause of the disruption remained unclear. It was uncertain whether the issue originated from the scanner itself or if the network had indeed stopped producing blocks during that time. looks like Arbitrum was down for ~15min a little bit ago? or arbiscan rugging again idk pic.twitter.com/h1evcO6wIP — Spreek (@spreekaway) July 25, 2023 This occurrence was not an isolated event for Arbitrum, as it had previously faced outages, including one in January that prompted a public statement from Offchain Labs, the team behind the development of Arbitrum. Challenges In Metrics And TVL In addition to the downtime concerns, Arbitrum has been experiencing declining metrics and a recent slump in its token price. As per CoinGecko, the cost of ARB stood at $1.20, with a 24-hour rally of 2.8%. However, over the last seven days, the token declined 8.1%, reflecting the uncertainty and hesitancy among investors following the downtime incidents. Source: Coingecko Another crucial metric, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on Arbitrum, experienced a slight decline over the past few weeks. While it managed to stay above the significant threshold of $2 billion, the overall value has decreased. At the time of writing, the TVL was approximately $2.10 billion, which indicates that some users may have withdrawn their assets from the platform or opted for other alternatives amidst the recent concerns. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.1 trillion.

15348159,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/rfk-jr-confirms-btc-purchase,1690458900,RFK Jr. Confirms $BTC Purchase,"Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed his recent purchase of a significant amount of Bitcoin earlier this year. Putting His Money Where His Mouth Is Kennedy had been previously criticized for publicly endorsing BTC at the Bitcoin Miami Conference in May. During a Twitter Space session on July 26, he revealed that he is not promoting an idea he does not believe in, as he has purchased 2 BTCs for each of his seven children. This disclosure marks the first time Kennedy has acknowledged owning cryptocurrency and aligns with his stance on promoting Bitcoin's potential benefits. In the interview, Kennedy reiterated his support for backing the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin and exempting the asset from capital gains taxes if he becomes President. He believes that Bitcoin can drive innovation in America. However, he emphasized that capital gains exemptions on Bitcoin conversions should be limited to smaller investors and businesses, avoiding windfalls for large corporations like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. Buying BTC In Response To Criticism The decision to invest in Bitcoin came as a response to critics who accused him of promoting a ""volatile commodity"" without having any personal stake in it. Kennedy explained his reasoning, saying, ""Right after that Bitcoin conference I got a big check and I said, okay, you know, I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and so I bought two Bitcoin for every one of my seven children…Now I’m a Bitcoin owner, and I’m sure they’ll now find a different way to come at me, but no one can say I didn’t put my money where my mouth is."" Kennedy has six biological children, four sons and two daughters, aged 22 to 38. His seventh child is likely from his marriage to actress Cheryl Hines, who had one daughter prior to their marriage in 2014. Previously Denied Holding BTC During his speech at the conference in May, Kennedy denied any personal investment in cryptocurrency, stating that he was not an investor and not offering investment advice. However, a leaked financial disclosure later revealed that he held ""between $100,001 and $250,000"" worth of Bitcoin at the end of June. Based on available information, if Kennedy bought a total of 14 Bitcoin at an approximate price of $26,800 shortly after the conference, his holdings by the end of June would have exceeded $380,000. As of the time of publication, Bitcoin's price stands at $29,327, indicating that Kennedy's investment is currently worth around $410,000.

Instead of requiring a 32 ether deposit to become a validator, Rocket Pool allows traders to stake in fractions.  According to Dune Analytics, a total of 6,720 rETH was redeemed on July 24 and the wallet then transferred the ETH to Binance, per on-chain analyst Tom Wan.  Rocket Pool currently has $1.88 billion in total value locked (TVL), making it the second largest liquid staking protocol after Lido, according to DefiLlama.  Traders stake ether on Rocket Pool to receive a yield, which is currently at 3.64% APR for regular staking and 8.62% for staking 8 ether. Redemptions occur when a trader is looking to either free up liquidity or secure a better yield elsewhere. Binance's ether staking portal currently offers around 4.07% APR.

The Law Commission for England and Wales, the independent statutory body that drafted the bill, estimates that billions of papers are passed around annually with global shipments, because that’s the only way they can be transported.  The act’s significance “is that it allows electronic documents to be treated as legally analogous to paper if they meet certain criteria,” Law Commissioner Sarah Green told CoinDesk in an emailed statement, adding that blockchain technology happens to be one of the means by which such documents can meet those criteria.  “Electronic trade documents also increase security and compliance by making it easier to trace records – for instance, through the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology,” a government press release on the act said.

Bitcoin Miners,"Summary This article details our view on investors' implications when investing in Bitcoin mining companies. We discuss why the Bitcoin halving cycle is bullish for Bitcoin but it may have devastating implications for Bitcoin mining companies. We conduct scenario analysis to suggest our ideal investment strategy for the best risk-adjusted return. Introduction We're getting increasingly excited about the crypto sector as it edges closer to the 2024 Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) halving event. We published our initial thesis back in May 2021 that the Bitcoin price typically follows a 3-stage 4-year cycle. We observed that the Bitcoin halving event typically marks the beginning of a 1-year bull market where Bitcoin surpasses previous all-time highs to reach a new all-time high, followed by a 1-year bear market, then a 2-year slow recovery period back to the all-time high. There are also distinctive sequences of events during each stage. For instance, during the past bear markets, the Bitcoin price bottomed out after completing 5 sequences of events , namely: Reversal pattern 50% decline from peak Rebound back to 20% from peak Another decline to 70% from peak Bottom out at 85% from peak Figure 1. The Bitcoin Halving Cycle (Author) We've supported these observations with fundamental analysis and economic analysis. Overall, our thesis has helped us navigate Bitcoin's uncertainty, volatility, and price swings. Based on our thesis and predictions, the Bitcoin price has completed 4.5 out of the 5 predicted bear market sequence of events. But most importantly, we perceive Bitcoin to be in the recovery phase now and is on track for the next Bitcoin bull market to reach our predicted $100,000 price target before April 2025. All these observations are bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins. However, this bullishness may not translate to bullishness for the broader crypto sector, especially the Bitcoin mining sector. In our past articles, we constantly reiterate that we prefer Bitcoin over Bitcoin miners due to additional business risks even though Bitcoin miners can outperform Bitcoin. While many Bitcoin mining company investors can rejoice now, those who have exposure to the likes of Core Scientific, Celsius Mining, or Compute North won't be. Therefore, in this article, we're going further echo our preference for Bitcoin over Bitcoin mining companies by discussing the potential of de-anchoring between the share price of Bitcoin mining companies and the Bitcoin price in the coming halving cycle. Implications of Investing In Bitcoin Miners The upcoming Bitcoin halving event is expected to take place around April 2024 . After this event, the reward for Bitcoin mining will be halved. Theoretically, this would increase the price of Bitcoin as supply decrease and demand remain unchanged. Overall, this event is bullish for Bitcoin investors. However, this is very dangerous for Bitcoin mining companies because Bitcoin mining revenue will be halved if the Bitcoin price does not change. Even if the Bitcoin price doubles, profitability will remain the same. On the other hand, Bitcoin mining companies can try to increase mining capacity to maintain Bitcoin production and revenue. But this strategy may not maintain profitability due to additional operating costs from the increased mining capacity (electricity, depreciation, administrative personnel, etc) as well. Therefore, the halving event may not be bullish for Bitcoin mining companies. Therefore, we think that investing in Bitcoin mining companies implies that if the investor believes that the Bitcoin price will more than double after the halving event, the mining company can increase sufficient capacity to compensate for the reduced Bitcoin production or anything in between. To us, it is a risky bet even if the investment is diversified across multiple Bitcoin mining companies. Here's why. What Will Happen If Mining Reward Is Halved Right Now? If the mining reward is halved now, not many Bitcoin mining companies will survive. At $30,000 per Bitcoin, most Bitcoin mining companies are already operating at a loss. Table 1 shows the all-in business cost per Bitcoin of several Bitcoin mining companies in 2023Q1. We can observe that other than Bitfarms ( BITF ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ), other Bitcoin mining companies are operating at a loss when Bitcoin is below $40,000. Table 1. Historical All-in Business Cost per BTC 2022Q2 2022Q3 2022Q4 2023Q1 Trailing Average RIOT 35,300 55,000 53,150 46,200 47,413 MARA 81,683 91,200 44,400 32,100 62,346 CLSK 37,600 35,627 30,500 33,276 34,251 IREN 51,605 34,871 58,171 - 48,216 BITF 27,155 25,900 34,200 26,600 28,464 HUT 49,472 44,800 59,900 70,900 56,268 Source: Author So why are Bitcoin mining companies still mining Bitcoin at a loss? That is because gross profits are still positive. Gross profit is the revenue from Bitcoin mining net of electricity and hosting costs, which usually averages at the low $10,000 (Table 2). Therefore, it still makes sense to continue operation. Table 2. Historical Cost of Revue (excl. Depreciation) per BTC 2022Q2 2022Q3 2022Q4 2023Q1 Trailing Average RIOT 10,355 13,201 14,107 12,903 12,642 MARA 15,206 22,061 22,403 23,479 20,787 CLSK 11,812 13,338 8,143 10,685 10,994 IREN 10,388 8,462 8,716 9,188 BITF 13,107 12,144 10,231 11,051 11,633 HUT 22,737 15,645 15,479 20,190 18,513 Source: Author That being said, many Bitcoin mining companies have been funded by their loss-making Bitcoin mining businesses and expansion through debt and equity offerings. For instance, Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ), BITF, and CLSK diluted shareholders by 100%, 68%, 66%, and 187% respectively (Table 3). CLSK in particular, has also increased its authorized shares 2 times from 50mil shares to 300mil shares over the past 2 years. Constant dilution is a sign that the Bitcoin mining business is exactly sustainable, regardless of whether the capital is used to cover operation costs or to expand. Remember that Bitcoin mining companies must constantly expand just to maintain their share in the Bitcoin network to maintain Bitcoin production. Table 3. Shareholder Dilution of Bitcoin Mining Companies Since 2021 RIOT MARA BITF CLSK 2023Q1 167 167.26 240,262,000 96,950,555 2022Q4 167.75 145.567 224,200,000 71,743,930 2022Q3 167.3 116.8 215,711,000 55,661,337 2022Q2 148 113.865 206,339,320 41,300,241 2022Q1 117.3 103.12 201,626,602 41,290,587 2021Q4 116.75 102.7 194,805,893 41,474,062 2021Q3 97.2 102.5 174,445,684 37,395,945 2021Q2 95.95 99.6 162,083,352 34,697,943 2021Q1 84.12 99.4 145,016,864 33,874,152 Source: Author Therefore, if Bitcoin mining rewards were to halve now, not only investors of Bitcoin mining companies risk more severe dilution, Bitcoin mining itself may become unfeasible for corporate Bitcoin mining companies. Remember there was a time when 90% of MARA's expenses were derived from compensation to its management. Scenario Analysis Back to reality. When the Bitcoin halving event takes place in 2024, mining rewards will be halved. Scenario A: Invest in Bitcoin The supply of Bitcoin decreased while demand remain constant. Reduced supply is a positive driver of the Bitcoin price. Potential approval for Bitcoin ETF is another driver of the Bitcoin price. According to our thesis, Bitcoin is expected to reach $100,000, which will provide a 230% return at today's price. Scenario B: Invest in Bitcoin mining companies Outcome 1: If Bitcoin reaches $100,000 Bitcoin mining companies could outperform Bitcoin solely based on their sensitivity to the Bitcoin prince. But fundamentally, revenue would only increase by 60%. Based on our models, most Bitcoin mining companies would be overvalued (Table 4). Outcome 2: If Bitcoin 2x today's price Revenue and profitability would remain unchanged hence does not justify any share price appreciation from today's price. Hence, we should see no positive upside. On the other hand, Bitcoin would've been 2x from today's price. Outcome 3: If the Bitcoin price remained unchanged Based on the cost structure presented in Table 1, none of the Bitcoin mining companies listed will be profitable. Mining operations of MARA and HUT would be unfeasible as Bitcoin revenue will be less than the cost of revenue (excluding depreciation). Other miners would barely survive. Does this mean that all Bitcoin mining companies are uninvestable? No. Let's look at what will our strategy be if we were to invest in Bitcoin mining companies. Evaluating Trading Strategies We perceive the safer option is to directly invest in Bitcoin. We identified multiple drivers for price appreciation (potential ETF approval, and the halving cycle), which can be hedged via ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) put options, and can be staked for additional passive income. From a risk-adjusted perspective, we think that this is an ideal strategy, which is also our current strategy. If one intends to invest in Bitcoin mining companies, there's still a silver lining. Pick the one that is the fittest: lowest mining/business cost, has the highest adjusted net asset value for liquidity, and which clear path and guidance for future expansion plans. This is what we think will play out if Bitcoin does not double fast enough after its halving event. The profitability of Bitcoin mining will reduce drastically, many Bitcoin mining companies will become insolvent like CoreScientific, efficient mining companies with larger balance sheets will survive and acquire competitors pennies on dollar, new equilibrium (mining difficulty) will be established, the ones that survive will enjoy massive upside potential. The new equilibrium in mining difficulty refers to the potential reduction of mining difficulty which reflects a reduction in mining rigs online after the ""bloodbath"" (insolvency of many Bitcoin mining companies). The reduced mining difficulty will increase Bitcoin production. Bitcoin mining companies that survived will enjoy both increased mining capacity and decreased mining difficulty which will result in an exponential increase in profitability. Therefore, if one intends to invest in Bitcoin mining companies, it'll be a game of stock picking. Based on the 3 criteria we stated, CLSK would be our prime, with BITF in a distant second. Firstly, CLSK and BITF showed stability and efficiency in their mining cost and business costs. Secondly, CLSK and BITF are trading closer to their adjusted NAV than comps. At this point, we would be late to the party because when we issued our buy rating for CLSK, both CLSK, and BITF were trading below their adjusted NAV. Thirdly, CLSK is expected to have about 3x BITF's mining capacity. At 16 EH/s by the end of 2023, CLSK would beat RIOT ( 12.5 EH/s ), the largest Bitcoin mining company (at $3.2bn market cap), and trail only MARA ( 23 EH/s ), the second largest Bitcoin mining company, in terms of mining capacity. Here's our pre-halving full thesis on CLSK. Final Remarks In this article, we take the opportunity to present a thesis to reflect our long-time stance to invest directly in Bitcoin. We also showed that if we were to speculate on Bitcoin mining companies, CLSK would be our best bet. As a closing remark, we would like to say that the Bitcoin halving cycle depicted in Figure 1 is meant to be broken as the set of support resistance is only sufficient to guide Bitcoin up to $100,000. Once the $100,000 price level is broken, the resistance will turn to support which will mark a new era for Bitcoin and the entire crypto sector. We think that this is the golden opportunity to invest in Bitcoin because we're presented with a decade-old cycle to help navigate this highly uncertain asset class. We hope we contributed to your investing journey. We look forward to engaging with you in the comment section and future works as well.

SUI tokens are used to transact and maintain the recently-launched Sui Network, a low-cost blockchain founded by ex-Meta Platforms (META) employees.  MovEx received some 2.5 million SUI, worth $1.6 million at current prices, from the Sui Foundation as payment for its work on exchange product DeepBook, subject to a contractual lockup that allowed the tokens to be unlocked at certain periods in the future.  However, MovEx violated the lockup by initiating three transactions of 625,000 SUI to three unique wallets, Sui Foundation said, sparking immediate concerns across the crypto community on Twitter.  “MovEx did not make Sui Foundation aware of the three transactions in violation of the contractual lockup, and the Sui Foundation did not consent to them,” the Foundation said.  “By July 3, upon Sui Foundation’s request, MovEx had moved the entire allotment of 2.5M tokens to a wallet custodied at a qualified custodian who will release them according to the contractual lockup schedule in compliance with the previously released token emissions schedule,” it added.  No additional SUI tokens will be distributed to MovEx nor will MovEx remain one of the main contributors to DeepBook, Sui Foundation further stated.  Meanwhile, MovEx did not push back or deny Sui Foundation’s actions on Thursday, stating it would continue to operate.  “By the time we received the SUI tokens transferred to our wallet, we distributed the tokens to custodian and non-custodian wallets,” MovEx said.",NEGATIVE,SUI,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | SUI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/27/sui-foundation-bins-movex-after-violation-of-sui-token-lockup-schedule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8f5e8465bd39759e450b0f14449186a8e414bf7-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While this might be an interesting projection, it is worth stating that there were no specific reasons backing this bearish outlook. In fact, there has been a positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin in the last few weeks. Besides its recent positive performance in the face of the Fed rate hike, the market leader appears to be poised for an increase in institutional demand. Currently, prominent asset managers have filed applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) seeking approval to launch the first Spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States On July 20, Bitcoin research firm NYDIG reported that the approval of these ETF applications could result in $30 billion in new demand for Bitcoin. The report stated this prediction is based on several factors, including the brand recognition that asset managers such as BlackRock offer, alongside the popular understanding of the regular trading methods of securities brokers.

In addition, hi has forged a partnership with Animoca Brands to help bring utility to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across its portfolio companies and throughout the Web3 ecosystem.  According to a press release, the partnership will create “deep integration” between Animoca Brands' expansive network and hi’s services, anchored by hi’s Web3 financial “super app” and its layer 2 Ethereum sidechain hi Protocol.  Co-founder Sean Rach told CoinDesk that hi operates as a neobank, or a digital-only application that provides banking services, allowing users to transact in crypto or fiat. In 2022, hi teamed up Mastercard to issue debit cards that can be customized with NFT imagery.  Rach told CoinDesk that hi plans to use the funding to scale its app, as well as gear up for the mainnet launch of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible hi Protocol. He added that as cryptocurrency utility expands, leveraging Animoca Brand’s network will help the company integrate its payments infrastructure into its portfolio companies and across the greater ecosystem.  “All of Animoca Brands’ partner companies and ecosystem companies have access to millions of people, so that's an opportunity for us to provide our services there,” he said. “For [Animoca Brands], they get utility for their tokens and the ability for them to be spendable.”  Rach added that the majority of hi’s user base exists in Europe, though they’re planning to expand into Asia, Latin America and eventually the U.S. – on the condition of regulatory clarity.  While some protocols allow bots to register addresses and conduct trades, hi is working on implementing a Proof of Human Identity (POHI) into its know your customer (KYC) process – which doesn’t involve scanning eyeballs.  “Everybody sort of looks at a blockchain’s success by the number of active accounts, but as we all know, you can write a script and whip up 1,000 Ethereum addresses and use bots to trade,” said Rach. “Unlike Ethereum, where there are two types of addresses – it's either generic user addresses for a smart contract or smart contract addresses – we're going to have the third tier where these addresses prove to be unique.”  Hi says it currently has 3.5 million total users and 1 million KYC’d users – and aims to grow this number through its POHI implementation.

According to the SEC, its proposed regulatory measures signal its intent to ensure that AI applications are used in a manner that safeguards the interest of investors and maintains market integrity. However, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce was scathing once again of what she sees as the Commission’s “distorted thinking”, referring to her belief that Chair Gensler’s approach is that investors can’t think for themselves. She goes a step further when she makes the accusation that the proposal “reflects a hostility toward technology”, highlighting that this antagonism is directed at predictive data analytics (PDA) such as AI, machine learning, or deep learning algorithms, neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), as well as other technologies. She disregards the SEC view that it is “neutral” on technology by saying: “Requiring firms to subject certain types of technologies to a uniquely onerous review and conflict remediation process is not technology neutral. Let us be honest about what we are doing here: banning technologies we do not like.” Peirce also rejected the SEC dismissive approach to disclosure within the proposal, when it makes the assumption that “disclosure is of no use to investors”, remarking that “the whole premise of our disclosure regime is that investors can think for themselves.” She makes the case that the proposal just doesn’t take into account “operational feasibility”, saying that broker dealers and investment advisors would have to carry out a “conflict identification process” with “Eye-wateringly detailed written policies and procedures” for evaluating potential conflicts and how they would be dealt with. Once again, Hester Peirce has taken her own agency to task for what she sees as an over-complicated proposal that is likely to put smaller businesses off of using the technologies in question, and in her view is generally not needed.

But this one is different from previous hacks like the Nomad bridge. No code was really compromised, as reportedly the assets were taken by the CEO’s sister. Multichain’s CEO, known only as Zhaojun, was apparently apprehended by Chinese authorities a few weeks prior. The CEO’s disappearance wreaked havoc on the team’s operations, according to their own report. Zhaojun held several important keys that were important for the operation and maintenance of the protocol. According to the explanation published by the Multichain team, they had asked his sister for access to these keys via cloud backups. Allegedly, she then took the money “for safekeeping” only to be arrested herself shortly after. The incident highlighted what some industry experts and insiders knew all along: Multichain was an extremely centralized bridge, which literally ceased to function as soon as its CEO became unavailable. For a crypto project, this is a damning story — even traditional corporations are more decentralized than that. Why this wasn’t spotted Given these revelations, it seems surprising that people trusted Multichain enough to have hundreds of millions of dollars deposited on the platform. Venket Naga, CEO at blockchain privacy-preserving platform, Serenity Shield, gave a few ideas how this might have happened. “First, the code's complexity may have made it challenging for non-experts to identify potential loopholes. Second, there might have been limited transparency and auditing, allowing crucial issues to go unnoticed,” he explained. Because of their cross-chain nature, bridges are often a black box. Even though Multichain’s core architecture is open-source, the complexity of these systems means that it’s difficult to have a good understanding of how it’s all implemented. “Trust in the code's integrity might have been assumed, neglecting the need for robust security assessments,” added Naga. “Moving forward, conducting comprehensive audits, fostering transparency, and engaging the community are crucial to prevent similar situations.” Bridge Choice 101 Bridge vulnerabilities are a common theme in Web3, and many teams deemed competent and reputable suffered enormous losses. So how can an average user try to avoid these incidents and spot unsafe bridges from further away? There is no perfect standard, but ideally it should be a mix of robust decentralization, simple architecture and good history of operation. For example, for bridges running on some form of trusted validators (which applies to most of them), you would expect that these entities should be well-known, and at least somewhat separate from the bridge’s creators. Architecture-wise, most bridges today are quite simple contracts based on multi-signature cryptography. More decentralized options have emerged from time to time, most notably Nomad. Unfortunately, these solutions are more complex, so this bridge got hacked because of one poorly implemented line of code. A good indicator is time. Poor bridges fail and only the sturdy options remain after some time — though Multichain is a significant exception to this rule. Many existing bridges have already gone through hacks, notably Wormhole. At the time, the project got “bailed out” by Jump Crypto, which allowed it to resume operations and re-establish some level of trust. But this apparent “insurance” shouldn’t be taken for granted. According to Brandon Brown, CEO and Co-Founder of personal wallet theft protection FairSide, “bridges present complex challenges for cover providers due to centralization and the risks associated with smart contracts. Bridges are a crucial aspect of blockchain usage, but their implementation leaves much to be desired. “To rebuild trust in blockchain bridges, a comprehensive approach is crucial,” according to Naga. “Implementing enhanced security measures, transparent bridge design and operations, rigorous audits, and involving the community in governance are essential. For Broen, “innovative solutions are emerging, such as Axelar's Interchain, which offer promising potential in mitigating the inherent risks of interoperability.” Hopefully, these solutions come sooner rather than later.

15346260,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/early-eos-investors-face-big-decision-ahead-of-us-class-action,1690453800,Early EOS Investors Face Big Decision Ahead Of U.S. Class Action,"The EOS Network Foundation is forging ahead with a milestone legal challenge against former EOS developer Block.one, which it accuses of failing to uphold a promise to invest $1 billion in the project. In a legal update published July 26, ENF CEO Yves La Rose said the failure of Block.one to live up to its promises is one of the biggest issues facing the EOS Network community. Later that day, La Rose tweeted that the community has a choice of three legal avenues they can pursue in order to seek compensation from the developer. Decision Time For EOS Investors The first option is to join the ENF’s existing U.S. class action lawsuit, which was filed against Block.one several years prior. According to La Rose, the ENF is on the verge of settling with Block.one for the sum of $22 million. EOS community members have until August 23, 2023 to decide whether they’d like to join this class action suit, or opt out and pursue other legal options. By joining the class action, investors would forfeit their right to make any other future claims against Block.one. This is legally binding as the class action includes a clause that shields Block.one from any further action against it by those who participate. Those interested in either joining the suit or opting out should contact James Koutoulas at james@koutoulaslaw.com. Anyone who purchased EOS tokens or ERC-20 tokens directly from Block.one or certain cryptocurrency exchanges between June 26, 2017 and May 18, 2020 could be eligible to participate in the U.S. class action, La Rose said. More information on the lawsuit and its eligibility requirements can be found here. As an alternative, La Rose said Nemesis Venture Capital is pursuing a separate agreement with Block.one on behalf of EOS community members that choose to opt out of the ENF’s class action. La Rose said it’s likely that anyone interested in seeking compensation through this avenue would need to opt out of the U.S. lawsuit. The third option for investors is not guaranteed at this time. Apparently, the ENF is exploring the possibility of filing a separate claim against Block.one in the Cayman Islands, and once again, investors would need to opt out of the U.S. class action to pursue this alternative. Early EOS investors therefore face a tough decision. The ENF’s U.S. class action is expected to settle on September 30, 2023 and is likely to result in participants receiving compensation soon. However, investors who decide to pursue one of the other legal alternatives could potentially receive much more, though there is a risk that the action may fail and they end up with nothing. Why Is This Happening? The ENF has been engaged in a long and bitter struggle against Block.one to receive compensation for those who invested in EOS during its initial coin offering back in 2018. At the time, EOS raised a record $4.1 billion through the ICO. Many felt the network was uniquely positioned to rival Ethereum as the number one smart contract network. Unfortunately for EOS’s backers, the project struggled to live up to its billing. A lack of development and a failure to meet the milestones on its original roadmap meant EOS fell behind not only Ethereum, but also many other emerging blockchains. By 2020, the EOS token’s value had fallen to a fraction of its ICO price. The EOS community placed the blame on Block.one, the project’s lead developer, saying it had failed to invest the promised $1 billion in the network. After waiting several years for Block.one to get its act together, the EOS community ultimately took matters into its own hands. This led to the birth of the EOS Network Foundation, led by La Rose, who was previously the CEO of an EOS block producer called EOS Nation. Soon after it was founded in August 2021, the ENF began plotting to displace Block.one and take control of the EOS network. La Rose collaborated with other EOS block producers on a plan to create a hard fork of the EOS network, which was done in September 2022, a day now known as “EOS Independence Day”. Since then, the ENF has focused its energy on revamping EOS so it can genuinely compete with Ethereum and other chains, and it has made great progress over the last two years. Even so, the ENF refused to let Block.one to escape punishment, pursuing legal action to force it to account for its lack of investment. Possible Implications For Crypto? The outcome of the ENF – Block.one dispute could have some serious consequences for the wider blockchain community, due to its focus on a developer not honoring its commitments to investors. Many times, crypto investors have had little to no recourse when they invest in projects that fail due to the lack of effort by its developers, or in some cases, outright scams. This case could therefore set a legal precedent that enables other investors to seek damages in similar situations. Ultimately, the outcome of the ENF’s legal proceedings against Block.one could lead to major changes in the way crypto fundraising activities are conducted, hence the industry is watching very closely to see how it develops.

As the price of DOGE surged around mid-July, on-chain data indicates that investors began to abandon their holdings in PEPE, leading to a sharp decline in the network’s activity. Daily Active Addresses, a crucial metric used to gauge the level of network activity, took a hit during this period. On July 14, PEPE recorded 5,086 active users. However, by the close of July 25, that number had plummeted to a mere 1,999 daily dynamic addresses, representing a staggering 61% decline. This abrupt drop in network usage suggests that many investors shifted their attention and funds towards DOGE, leaving PEPE behind. Related Reading: Polygon Warning Signs Point To Slide In MATIC Price On Support Breakdown PEPE daily active addresses. Source: Santiment Dogecoin Hype Leaves PEPE In The Dust The reason for this shift in investor behavior can be attributed to DOGE’s recent impressive performance in the market. Over the past seven days, DOGE saw a surge of 11.6%, reaching a price of $0.079, according to CoinGecko. DOGE also experienced a slight 0.7% climb in the past 24 hours. Doge price in green in all timeframes. Source: Coingecko The impact of the DOGE rally on PEPE also extended to its price. Within the same seven-day period, PEPE’s price declined 13%. The sell-off intensified as more investors shifted their focus to the meme-inspired DOGE, which enjoyed the spotlight as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies. ‘Meme Coin Magic’ While DOGE experienced a boost in its market cap, it wasn’t the only meme coin project to do so. Other projects like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and ApeCoin (APE) also saw minor market cap increases. The surge in social volume for these meme coins typically signals an approaching peak, as enthusiasm and speculation surrounding these assets tend to drive their prices to unsustainable levels. Dogecoin market cap currently at $11.15 billion.

42392926,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgDSmV,1690451558,Bitcoin Volatility Expected on Friday's Bank of Japan Rate Decision. Here's Why,"Traders love volatility, but of late, bitcoin (BTC) has offered none. Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate hike has also failed to wake the cryptocurrency from its slumber.  Perhaps the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the world's third-largest central bank and the only heavyweight maintaining a very loose pro-liquidity policy, might do the trick.  According to several investment banks, the BOJ on Friday will likely soften its grip on the country's bond markets, potentially influencing global bond markets, exchanges rates and liquidity conditions. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, are sensitive to changes in global liquidity conditions.  Since September 2016, the BOJ has been running a yield curve control (YCC) program, committing to purchase as many government bonds as required to keep the 10-year government bond yield near 0%. The perpetual bond buying has added to global liquidity and has been a major source of downward pressure on bond yields across the advanced world, as RBC Wealth Management noted.  In December, the BOJ retained the target while allowing the yield to fluctuate in the +/-50 basis points (bps) band. On Friday, the bank might widen the band to 100bps, indirectly tapering the liquidity-boosting bond purchases.  ""Broadly speaking, initial steps could include either widening the 10-year JGB yield band or focusing on the shorter maturity zone. Our base scenario is the latter, though it could be a close call. The former option may be viewed as desirable, particularly given that the effects of band widening is likely easier to anticipate for the market,"" Goldman Sachs' economics research team said in a note to clients on July 21.  ""However, assuming that the BOJ maintains its 10-year target at 0%, then widening the band to ±100 bp from ±50 bp at present, for example, would be akin to the BOJ effectively scrapping YCC or admitting it has lost the ability to control yields,"" the research team added.  BNP Paribas also expects the BOJ to widen the YCC band to 100 basis points. On Wednesday, the IMF urged Japan to move away from YCC to prepare for eventual lift-off in interest rates from the current -0.1%.  These potential developments might appear inconsequential to the bitcoin market, but that's not necessarily true. In the past, cryptocurrency has seen negative correlations with bond yields, bond market volatility, the dollar index, and global liquidity conditions. In other words, potential changes to BOJ's YCC and the resulting volatility in traditional markets could bring volatility to the crypto market.  The YCC could affect financial markets through exchange rates, term premiums on sovereign bonds and global risk premiums, the IMF warned early this year.  For instance, Japanese yields might rise sharply on potential YCC tweak, eventually leading Japanese investors to sell their foreign bond holdings in favor of domestic bonds. That, in turn, would lift foreign bond yields and dent money flow into risk assets. (bond yields and bond prices move in opposite directions). Japan is the world's largest creditor nation, with record net external assets of 418.63 trillion yen ($3 trillion) in 2022. Japanese investors have been on a foreign bond buying spree, given the low yields at home and relatively higher yields elsewhere.  ""As this [BOJ] policy starts to reverse, it could contribute to causing global yields to rise, particularly as the move is happening at a time bond markets have been shaken by ongoing hiking cycles. This vulnerability was on display during the quasi run on U.K. sovereign bonds last fall,"" RBC Wealth Management wrote early this year, explaining YCC's global relevance.

The platform has restarted operations after halting them in the wake of the hack and has proposed a roundtable with other victims of the Lazarus Group. Lazarus Group Behind Hack CoinsPaid had halted all operations following the hack that hit the platform on the 22nd of July, with hackers stealing over $37 million. In a post published on the 26th of July, the company pointed at the dreaded Lazarus Group, accusing it of orchestrating the hack while announcing the resumption of processing services. The company stated in the post, “On the 22nd of July, CoinsPaid experienced a hacker attack, resulting in the theft of USD 37.3M. We suspect Lazarus Group, one of the most powerful hacker organizations, is responsible. In response to the attack, the company’s dedicated team of experts has worked tirelessly to fortify our systems and minimize the impact, leaving Lazarus with a record-low reward. Indeed, our security measures and procedures allowed CoinsPaid to prevent higher loss of funds.” The Lazarus Group has become one of the most feared hacker organizations and has targeted some of the biggest companies in the world, including Sony, Alphapo, Atomic Wallet, Horizon Bridge, and Axie Infinity. The Axie Infinity hack alone saw the group steal a staggering $625 million. Customer Funds Secure The post also confirmed that the platform had resumed operations in a new, secure, and limited environment. “After the partial downtime, our services are getting up and running one by one in the new secured environment. We expect it to take a few more days to sort out minor details and ensure the system works smoothly.” The firm assured users that their funds were safe. However, it acknowledged that the company’s balance sheet had taken a considerable hit. Despite the loss, the company believes that Lazarus was hoping to extract a much larger sum from the platform, but the company’s team of experts was able to thwart their attempts. “We believe Lazarus expected the attack on CoinsPaid to be much more successful. In response to the attack, the company’s dedicated team of experts has worked tirelessly to fortify our systems and minimize the impact, leaving Lazarus with a record-low reward.” CoinsPaid’s preliminary investigation was assisted by blockchain security firms, including Match Systems, Chainalysis, and Crystal. CoinsPaid CEO Max Krupyshev stated, “CoinsPaid will recover and continue delivering first-class innovative payment solutions despite the incident. We have no doubt the hackers won’t escape justice.” Roundtable With Other Victims According to the online coding platform GitHub, the Lazarus Group is actively targeting entities and users in the crypto and cybersecurity space. Cybersecurity platform Socket.Dev outlined how the hacker group targets users by compromising their accounts through Malware. According to Socket.Dev, the first point of contact are social media platforms such as WhatsApp. Just last month, Elliptic, a blockchain forensics firm, revealed that the group had managed to hack Atomic Wallet, with the platform losing around $100 million. Meanwhile, online crypto sleuth ZachXBT revealed that the Alphapo hack resulted in a loss of $60 million. The Alphapo hack also impacted CoinsPaid, as the two organizations are closely associated with one another. CoinsPaid revealed that it would be organizing a roundtable with other victims of the Lazarus Group and launching an initiative to minimize such attacks in the future. “Within a few weeks, CoinsPaid will organize a round table with all the Lazarus victims to announce a new initiative aimed at minimizing and preventing such attacks in the future. We urge Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitfinex, OKX, and others to participate in this vital process.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

No surprises in FOMC meeting There was probably never going to be any surprises yesterday for the interest rate or indeed for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s performance afterwards. The 25 basis point rate rise was announced, and Powell didn’t say anything to make markets jittery. Powell commented on what he saw as “robust” job gains over recent months leading to low unemployment. However, he did remark that the Fed “remains highly attentive to inflation risks”, no doubt taking into account the rise in energy prices once again. Therefore, from a crypto point of view, things were quite stable and prices moved up as a result, albeit not in a particularly strong fashion. After a bit of a dump on Monday, the trend has remained to the upside. Bitcoin is continuing to follow an up channel on the short time frame, although having fallen out of the range it has been in for the last month, the current move may just be to confirm the bottom of this range as new resistance. Altcoin breakouts Given that they have been trending lower for quite a few days now, certain altcoins look to have taken a lot more advantage than Bitcoin of the fairly meek and mild FOMC meeting. Solana ($SOL) broke out of its downtrend and recorded a strong 8% surge on the day. The move has broken through the resistance at $25 and so it now remains to be seen if this can be held, giving $SOL a firm base on which to move higher. Chainlink ($LINK) was another vigorous mover. The oracle play shifted 4.8% to the upside yesterday, and has continued the positive price action so far today with a further 2.4%. Traversing in a range since early May, $LINK looks to be regaining the mid-point of this range before perhaps attempting the range top at $9.50. Dogecoin ($DOGE) was one of the only cryptocurrencies to sink on Wednesday, down 4.75% on the day. However, this was on the back of a very strong surge from Elon Musk’s favoured coin which had taken it as far as 19% up at one point on Tuesday. Thursday’s price action is positive once more.

One of the bills cleared includes the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, introduced by Majority Whip Tom Emmer back in March. The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Majority Whip Tom Emmer introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. The bill states that blockchain developers and service providers that do not hold custody of user assets cannot be classified as money transmitters. The bipartisan bill is co-led by Representative Darren Soto. Emmer and Soto also serve as the co-Chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. Talking about the bill, Emmer had stated, “Crypto and blockchain technology, by nature, does not easily fit into the frameworks policymakers have considered when crafting regulations in the past. For too long, federal regulators and lawmakers have jammed the blockchain ecosystem into statutory definitions that just do not make sense. It should be simple: If you don’t custody consumer funds, you aren’t a money transmitter. My bill provides that necessary confirmation for the blockchain community.” Emmer also talked about how the delay in providing clarity for the crypto ecosystem in the United States risks driving the technology overseas at the cost of domestic users and investors. Emmer stated that the bill would go a long way in helping America become a leader in the crypto space. “The longer we delay providing this commonsense clarification, the greater risk that this transformative technology is driven overseas, depriving domestic users and investors. This bill will help America remain a technological leader in the crypto space.” As co-Chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, Soto had also extended his support to the bill. A Way Towards Regulatory Clarity? Most US lawmakers voted in favor of Emmer’s Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act and the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. The House Financial Services Committee had approved the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act in a 35-15 vote. The bill aims to establish clear rules for crypto firms on registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the passage of the bill announced via Twitter. “In a historic first, the House Financial Services Committee just advanced the BIPARTISAN FIT for the 21st Century Act to protect consumers and provide clear rules of the road for the digital asset ecosystem.” The bill also provides a clear process for crypto firms to certify that their projects are adequately decentralized with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This would allow them to register their digital assets as a digital commodity with the CFTC. French Hill, a Republican Congressman who also served as the Vice Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, stated that he was happy the bill passed with bipartisan support. “We have crafted landmark legislation that establishes robust consumer protections and clear rules of the road for market participants while keeping innovation in the United States.” A Big Win For The US The bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act sets guidelines that remove excessive requirements for blockchain developers and service providers. Tom Emmer called the bill’s passing a “huge win” for the US, explaining that the bill clarifies what entities in the blockchain space come under the definition of “money transmitters.” Emmer added that if passed in the House of Representatives, the bill will help establish that if companies do not custody customer funds, they will not be classified as a money transmitter. “BREAKING: My nonpartisan bill – the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act – just passed out of the @FinancialCmte. This is a huge win for the United States as we are one step closer to putting Americans in the driver’s seat in crafting the future peer-to-peer digital economy.” A Divided House Despite the passage of these crucial bills, there are considerable divisions among Republicans and Democrats when it comes to crypto. A third piece of legislation called the Digital Assets Market Structure Bill failed to pass, with several Republicans and Democrats refusing to support the bill. Maxine Waters, a Democratic Representative, was extremely critical of the bill, accusing it of ignoring regulatory guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission and furthering the interests of the crypto space while failing to adhere to clear guidelines. “As I have said before, we don’t need to invent new regulatory structures simply because crypto companies refuse to follow rules of the road. Our securities laws have protected investors and retirees for 90 years while supporting capital formation and facilitating innovation.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

15342057,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=544552,1690443326,Why Is Bitcoin And The Crypto Market Up Today?,"The Bitcoin and crypto markets are experiencing a slight upswing today, with BTC and other major altcoins making gains. The main catalyst behind this uptrend appears to be yesterday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is up by 0.8% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $29,486. Despite facing resistance around the critical resistance area of $29,750, BTC has shown resilience and is attempting to reclaim its upward trajectory. Moreover, other major cryptocurrencies are also in the green, with Ethereum (+1.0%), XRP (+1.4%), Cardano (+3%), and Solana (+7%) all enjoying gains. Bitcoin Follows TradFi’s Reaction The FOMC meeting has been a focal point for the crypto market’s movements. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank remains data-dependent, indicating that further interest rate hikes are not ruled out. However, no decision on the matter has been reached yet. Related Reading: FOMC Delivers Expected 0.25% Rate Hike, Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $29,000 Powell emphasized that core inflation (both PCE, CPI) remains the primary focus. He also stated that FED will stop raising rates way before the inflation target of 2% is reached. However, the big bummer was his statement that he does not expect inflation to fall below 2% before 2025! Bitcoin experienced a quick dip in response to this Powell statement, but quickly rebounded, seemingly following the trajectory of traditional financial markets. Notably, the Dow Jones rose for a 13th consecutive day after the FOMC meeting yesterday, signaling investors’ confidence in a bullish market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Patterns Suggest Bull Market Is Not Starting In 2023 Experts and analysts in the cryptocurrency space have offered diverse opinions on the implications of the FOMC meeting and Powell’s remarks. Jim Bianco, an influential figure in the financial industry and founder of Bianco Research LLC, highlighted the lack of clarity in the Fed’s communication, stating: It is provided the LEAST amount of information of any meeting since they started hiking in March 2022. Powell is going out of his way to say nothing and not commit to anything. So, this meeting has become a Rorschach test. Everyone sees into it what they want. And this is seemingly what the traditional finance as well as crypto markets are doing. The big question is: how long will the Fed hold rates up, how long before it pivots. As this is data dependent, no one knows, but market expectations and the Fed’s projections still seem far apart. While the CME’s FedWatch tool currently predicts a slight majority in favor of a first rate cut already in March 2024, Powell made it clear yesterday in a hawkish tone that the key rate must remain high for a long time because the effects need time to have an impact on the economy. Market expectations and the Fed’s projections still seem far apart. #Bitcoin #SPX After the #FOMC meeting, the market expects the first rate cut in March 2024 (54.6%). Powell could keep the key rate higher for longer due to the strong economy. Who will cave in first? pic.twitter.com/4C9KPAuTmv — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) July 27, 2023 Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments noted the unprecedented tightness in current economic conditions due to the combination of money supply growth and negative interest rates. He suggested that historical trends indicate a strong possibility of a one-way bull market emerging under these conditions: Powell has overtaken Volcker as the tightest Fed chair ever. Economic conditions have never been tighter than today, . In all prior instances, inflation was well under control, the stock market was higher 12 months later and a major one way bull market trend emerged. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe, expressed concern about the Fed’s projection that a recession is not on the horizon. He speculated, “Most likely no more rate hikes. […] Have a terrible GDP today and sweep the lows on Bitcoin before we continue the party up. Buy the dip season.” At press time, the Bitcoin price still slowly grinds towards the red resistance area below $29,800.

In a 35-15 vote, the Financial Services Committee of the U.S. Congress approved, with bipartisan support, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act which would “establish clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate.” Introduced sometime in July 2020, the bill crucially sets definitions on whether a digital asset is a security or a commodity and whether a cryptocurrency firm would have to register under the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The bill also crucially sets a process for assets previously labeled as securities to be re-labeled as commodities. Another bill that was passed by the committee was the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, a bipartisan bill authored by Rep. Tom Emmer and Rep. Darren Soto. The bill aims to remove unnecessary regulation for blockchain developers and service providers. In a tweet thread celebrating the bill’s passage, Emmer said that “the BRCA provides the digital asset ecosystem regulatory certainty to keep innovating in the United States so the future digital economy reflects American values.” Together, the two bills could pave the way for regulatory clarity in terms of distinguishing between commodities and securities. They will also define strict jurisdictions for regulatory agencies. As one might recall, the Gary Gensler-led SEC has been particularly zealous and high-strung with regards to digital assets, claiming that all digital assets are securities and therefore fall under the agency’s control. Its regulation-by-enforcement approach has been detrimental for investors and the growth of the cryptocurrency industry. However, the passage of the two bills is but the first step in this apparently uphill battle. The cryptocurrency community should still keep a watchful eye on how the subsequent proceedings will unfold. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, the coin has suffered a 4.4% slump over the past seven days, indicating underlying bearish sentiments in the market. Despite the short-term surge, the weekly time frame presents a negative outlook, primarily due to the failure to break through a long-term horizontal resistance. Adding to the bearish pressure, an ascending trendline has been broken, signaling a potential further decline in MATIC’s price.

Related Reading: Litecoin Bulls Barrel Back Toward $92 Level – Will They Succeed? This area had been acting as a strong support level for the altcoin, providing stability during various price fluctuations. However, this support became a formidable resistance over the past two weeks, thwarting MATIC’s attempts to climb higher. Polygon (MATIC) Ascending Trendline Breakdown An ascending trendline is a sloping line that connects a series of ascending lows in an uptrend. It represents a rising level of support and is often used to gauge the strength of a bullish trend. The breakdown of this trendline indicates a shift in sentiment, suggesting that buyers are losing control and sellers are gaining momentum. MATIC market cap currently at $6.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The breakdown of the ascending trendline sets the stage for a potential 22% drop in MATIC’s price. If the coin fails to find strong support at lower levels, this decline could be the next crucial movement for the cryptocurrency. Traders and investors must closely monitor price action to determine if MATIC can stabilize or if further losses are on the horizon. Bear Trap Scenario And Bullish Recovery However, there is a glimmer of hope for MATIC’s price trajectory. If buyers can push the current price above $0.729221, it could invalidate the recent bearish breakdown. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Price Poised For A Major Breakout – Which Way Will It Go?

We remain fully committed to the Metaverse vision as well. We've been working on both of these two major priorities for many years in parallel now, and in many ways the two areas are overlapping and complementary,” Mark Zuckerberg said in an earnings call.  The focus on the metaverse hasn’t been profitable for the social media giant as it continues to lose billions of dollars due to the initiative. During 2022, Meta’s Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which is responsible for metaverse, lost $13.7 billion on revenue of $2.2 billion, up from a loss of $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion in 2021.  ""This is an ambitious long-term horizon, multi-faceted roadmap. There are lots of components to the Reality Labs portfolio across VR, AR, Metaverse, social platforms, neural interfaces, and we really have a long-term time horizon for evaluating the return on our investments here,"" Zuckerberg continued. “I can't guarantee you that I'm going to be right about this bet. I do think that this is the direction that the world is going in.”  In its most recent earnings, Meta reported a fiscal second-quarter net income of $7.79 billion, up from $6.7 billion in the previous year, with revenue climbing 11% to $32 billion.  Daily active users for Facebook and Meta's family of apps, including Instagram, also saw an increase of 5% and 7%, respectively. Meta’s Threads app – designed as a Twitter replacement – has experienced a 60% drop in active users from its launch week, according to a report from Similarweb.

The firm has agreed to return the $28 million raised during this ICO in response to the charges. Quantstamp's ICO Under Fire In an announcement on July 21, the SEC formally charged Quantstamp, a California-based company, over the unregistered ICO of its ""crypto asset securities."" The ICO, which took place in October and November 2017, raised over $28 million through the sale of its native QSP tokens to apporximately 5,000 investors. Quantstamp planned to use the ICO proceeds to develop and market its automated smart contract security auditing platform. According to the SEC's order, the firm emphasized the ""large market potential"" of its service, causing QSP buyers to expect an appreciation in the value of their tokens. According to the SEC, Quantstamp failed to register its offering and sale of QSP tokens, leading the SEC to deem these as securities. As part of the order, the SEC revealed that Quantstamp has consented to a cease-and-desist order and will pay disgorgement of $1,979,201, prejudgment interest of $494,314, and a civil penalty of $1 million. The SEC’s order finds that Quantstamp violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Quantstamp agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay disgorgement of $1,979,201, prejudgment interest of $494,314, and a civil penalty of $1 million. Quantstamp to Return ICO Proceeds As part of the settlement, the SEC has provisioned the establishment of a ""Fair Fund"" to return funds to affected investors. Quantstamp has agreed to transfer its QSP token holdings to the Fair Fund administrator, with the tokens set to be ""permanently disabled or destroyed."" Interestingly, the SEC's order notes that Quantstamp no longer operates or actively supports the automated smart contract security auditing following its deployment in June 2019. This case underscores the SEC's commitment to regulating ICOs and ensuring they comply with federal securities laws. With a spotlight on Quantstamp, it serves as a reminder to all blockchain firms of the regulatory requirements and potential penalties associated with ICOs.

The number of large open interest holders, or entities holding at least 25 bitcoin futures contracts, averaged a record 107 in the second quarter, the CME said in an email to CoinDesk. Ether's so-called large open interest holders averaged 62 through the second quarter.  ""Bitcoin futures institutional interest continued to increase throughout the quarter as investors sought regulated venues/products to hedge rising market volatility and manage risk and exposure,"" the exchange said, explaining the robust participation from large traders.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates the CME futures. The standard bitcoin futures contract is equivalent to 5 BTC, while the micro contract is sized at one-tenth of 1 BTC. The standard ether futures have a contract size of 50 ETH, while micro futures are equivalent to one-tenth of 1 ETH.  The CME's regulated and cash-settled futures have long been a preferred choice for institutions looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.  The record participation from large holders came as top cryptocurrencies extended the first quarter rally. Bitcoin rose 7% in three months to June, confirming an 84% rise for the year's first half. Ether gained 61% in the first six months.  The demand for hedging tools also lifted trading volumes and open interest in BTC and ETH futures and options to all-time highs in the first half, CME said.  Trading volume refers to the number of contracts transacted on a given day. Open interest refers to the number of contracts active at any given time. An increase in open interest represents an influx of new money into the market.  Open interest in standard bitcoin futures contracts averaged a record 14,800 contracts through the first half, a 15% rise compared to 2022. Meanwhile, open interest in bitcoin options averaged a record 9,400 contracts, confirming an impressive 175% rise versus 2022.

Building an Institutional DeFi Ecosystem The endeavor, selected during the Milano Hub’s second call for proposals, will expand the scope of analysis of security tokens on secondaary markets. As explained by Cetif Advisory's general manager, Imanuel Baharier, these security tokens are digitized representations of the ownership of real-world assets. Baharier emphasises the importance of establishing conditions for DeFi to become a safe and open operating environment for supervised entities. The project doesn't seek commercialisation, rather it aims to allow institutional market participants to operate in a DeFi environment while complying with regulatory guidelines. It will further develop Cetif Advisory’s Lionity platform, touted as an “institutional-grade automated market maker."" Cetif Advisory, a spinoff from the Cetif Research Centre at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, will receive six months of support from the Milano Hub. This backing includes expert advice and in-depth regulatory research, and it began earlier this month.

The DOJ's decision came after it consulted with The Bahamas on the campaign finance charges in Bankman-Fried's extradition document last year.  The DOJ originally indicted Bankman-Fried on eight different counts near the end of 2022. Prosecutors later added another five charges, but Bankman-Fried's defense team argued that The Bahamas, which originally arrested the former FTX CEO, had to agree to those charges under the terms of the U.S.'s extradition treaty with the nation. Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, allowed the DOJ to sever those charges, scheduling a March trial date.  According to a court filing late Wednesday, The Bahamas did not include the eighth charge from the original indictment, a campaign finance violation, in its extradition treaty.  ""The Government has been informed that The Bahamas notified the United States earlier today that The Bahamas did not intend to extradite the defendant on the campaign contributions count,"" the DOJ letter said. ""Accordingly, in keeping with its treaty obligations to The Bahamas, the Government does not intend to proceed to trial on the campaign contributions count.""  The notice comes hours after a hearing over Bankman-Fried's alleged attempt to discredit former Alameda Research executive Caroline Ellison by sharing private documents with the New York Times. Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon opened the hearing by announcing the DOJ wanted to remand Bankman-Fried into custody.  Judge Kaplan declined to rule on that motion during Wednesday's hearing, instead setting up a schedule for both the prosecution and the defense to file written submissions on that matter. In the meantime, he imposed an interim gag order preventing Bankman-Fried from communicating publicly.  Bankman-Fried's trial is scheduled for Oct. 2. The DOJ's letter did not say if prosecutors intend to fold the campaign finance charge into the second trial in March.",NEUTRAL,없음,RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/27/sam-bankman-fried-wont-face-campaign-finance-charge-us-doj-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/383da317f1d8e17681f2725c9f522afb3b15d726-2935x1651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392933,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgDTbn,1690418133,"House Financial Services Committee Votes in Favor of Crypto, Blockchain Bills","The House Financial Services Committee advanced a set of crypto bills after a landmark markup on Wednesday.  Though the fallout from crypto exchange FTX loomed large over lawmakers as they worked toward ironing out the details of bills designed to provide a unified legal framework for crypto and address blockchain-related issues, a majority of lawmakers ultimately voted in favor of H.R. 4763, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and H.R. 1747, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act after a day-long markup session, referring both bills to the full House of Representatives for a vote.  During Wednesday’s markup, a large swath of committee members – both Republicans and Democrats – refused to support the proposed market structure bill, criticizing a clause in the bill that would allocate more power to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). They also expressed concerns about whether the bill would weaken consumer protections enshrined by the U.S.' decades-old securities laws and ultimately leave U.S. investors with fewer protections against fraud.  Nevertheless, the committee’s chair, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), praised the legislation during his opening comments, noting it was the first time a committee was marking up crypto-specific legislation and affirming that legislation is necessary to prevent the U.S. from “falling behind” other countries in regulating crypto.  “Our comprehensive digital asset market structure legislation recognizes a key issue: digital assets that are not inherently securities may be offered as part of an investment contract but that does not make them securities,” he said during his comments.  The legislation’s critics said they were more concerned with the bill’s actual provisions.  ""I’ve been on this committee for 20 years and I can say unequivocally that this is the worst piece of legislation that has been presented for markup in that 20 years,"" Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) told the committee.  Democrats took umbrage at the fact that the proposed law would grant the CFTC more authority to regulate the digital assets space without increasing the agency's funding.  The CFTC has earned a reputation for being softer on crypto companies than the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), something Democrats have said could enable future fraud. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other crypto industry bigwigs previously petitioned for the regulator to be granted more power to regulate the space.  However, Republicans supporting the bill argued that an additional $120 million in funding that was recently approved by the Agriculture Committee will vest the CFTC with the resources to do its job more thoroughly.  Republicans also urged their fellow lawmakers not to hold up the bill and praised the potential clarity it could bring to the crypto industry.  The crypto framework, they said, will temper what they described as the SEC's brutal crackdown on the digital assets industry, incentivizing companies to remain in the U.S. rather than migrate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions.  ""If Congress does nothing, the United States will miss a huge opportunity and Americans will suffer for it,"" Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who is also the majority whip, said.  The House Agriculture Committee will start its own markup of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act on Thursday, while the Financial Services Committee marks up stablecoin legislation.  Senate concerns  The House committee votes came as the Senate added anti-money laundering provisions for the crypto industry to a must-pass defense bill.  The National Defense Authorization Act now includes an amendment from Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) that would require the Treasury Department, Conference of State Bank Supervisors and other regulators to create ""a risk-focused examination and review process for financial institutions"" to assess certain crypto-related risks.  They include whether reporting obligations under current anti-money laundering programs are adequate and whether these institutions are complying with the law.  The amendment will also require the Treasury Department to create a report analyzing the role of mixers and ""privacy-enhancing technologies or services used in connection with crypto assets,"" as well as provide any recommendations for legislation that is needed to address any concerns.  Brett Quick, the head of government affairs at the Crypto Council for Innovation, told CoinDesk that the industry organization ""appreciates the efforts of policymakers to tackle the important questions surrounding crypto and [Bank Secrecy Act]/AML compliance.""  ""The amendment offered to NDAA by Senators Lummis, Gillibrand, Warren, and Marshall is a thoughtful approach, however, we continue to seek needed regulatory clarity on which projects, tokens, and activity are overseen by which agencies,"" she said through a spokesperson.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Nikhilesh De, Elizabeth Napolitano",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/27/house-financial-services-committee-votes-in-favor-of-crypto-blockchain-bills,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00126eb64f32a3dcbaea010d35e2b070fff855ce-4959x3307.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The FOMC indicated that achieving its 2% inflation target still has a long way to go and that it will take a data-dependent approach to future rate hikes. While some investors had been hoping for a more hawkish tone from the Fed, the central bank’s cautious approach was seen as a sign that it is still concerned about the potential impact of its monetary policy on the broader economy. Related Reading: Singaporean Judge Declares Crypto Is Personal Property In ByBit Case According to Ted, the full effect of tightening is yet to be felt, and getting back to the inflation target may require below-trend growth and labor market softening. Despite the Fed’s decision to raise rates, they may raise them again in September, depending on the data. The Fed’s decision to keep Quantitative Tightening (QT) unchanged was also a sign that the central bank is taking a measured approach to monetary policy. The markets reacted positively to the Fed’s decision, with Bitcoin and US equities both higher. Many investors interpreted the event as a signal that the Fed is getting closer to hitting the pause button on rate hikes, which could be positive for risk assets in the near term. Bitcoin Bulls Charge Forward As Sell Wall Disappears After the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a 0.25% increase in interest rates, crypto market and data analysis firm Material Indicators has suggested that a sell wall at the $29,400 level has vanished. This level is just above Bitcoin’s current price, which currently stands at $29,300 as of writing. According to Material Indicators Firechart, a significant level has cleared for Bitcoin, allowing the cryptocurrency to breach this zone and reclaim higher price levels. However, in the short term, Bitcoin’s 50-day Moving Average (MA) may present an obstacle, as it currently sits above the cryptocurrency’s current price.

As seen in the 1-day chart below, this drop in ADX is often followed by a strong uptrend, potentially propelling Bitcoin back above the $30,000 mark.
