42379261,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82Xn7,1488581976,Ether Prices Surge Past $20 to Approach All-Time Highs,"The price of ether, the cryptocurrency powering the ethereum blockchain, has surged over the last week, approaching all-time highs set in 2016 as it hit its highest value in nearly eight months.  All told, ether prices have risen as much as 59% during the week, reaching $20.67 at roughly 10:44 UTC today after opening slightly above $13 on 25th February, CoinMarketCap figures show.  At the time of reporting, ether had pulled back somewhat, but was still trading roughly 50% higher for the week at $19.54.  Alliance impact  Driving the increased demand was perhaps the formal launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a new consortium focused on the technology that has drawn members from major financial services, software companies and firms in the oil and gas industries.  The group aims to apply ethereum's fundamentals to enterprise-grade blockchain implementations.  The project's launch helped give ether a boost, market observers told CoinDesk.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, said of the development:  ""The launch of the Alliance definitely fueled most of the price increase. Anything that increases the legitimacy and stability of an altcoin will cause its price to increase, sometimes dramatically.""  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged digital currency trading platform Whaleclub, adopted a similar stance.  Zivkovski said that the group and its proposed solutions have ""re-ignited hope and legitimacy in ethereum, which was, until recently, mired in controversies and uncertainty.""  Overshadowed rise  Still, ether's recent price gains – at least in the public eye – have been arguably overshadowed by those of bitcoin and dash, which have both recently hit all-time highs and seen major media coverage.  Of the two, bitcoin has undoubtedly stolen the show in the last few weeks with string of fresh, all-time highs amid robust trading volume and bullish market sentiment.  The digital currency has risen to several new highs in recent sessions, after failing to set a new record level for more than three years. It even hit parity with the per-ounce spot price of gold this week.  Dash, by comparison, has surged more than 75% in the last week and upwards of 200% over the last month, CoinMarketCap data shows. The token hit an all-time high of $58.90 on 2nd March, after opening slightly north of $26 on 25th February.  Market observers have offered numerous explanations for this rally, though no consensus on what is driving the push has emerged.

42427441,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXDh,1488575257,Roger Ver Bets Against SegWit Bitcoin Upgrade at Anarchapulco,"Bitcoin's long-simmering scaling debate flared this week at Anarchopulco, an annual libertarian-leaning bitcoin event held in Acapulco, Mexico.  Among the highlights was an unscripted, onstage confrontation between investor Roger Ver and researcher-pundit Tone Vays that came to a head in a bet relating to the future of Segregated Witness – a bitcoin upgrade put forward by the Bitcoin Core developer community late last year. The change has since faced heavy resistance from critics, including Ver and former bitcoin lead maintainer Gavin Andresen.  Ver's comments came during a roundtable consisting of Vays, the founder of Sweden's Pirate Party Rick Falkvinge, former Bitcoin Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton and entrepreneur Joby Weeks. Ver, while notably absent when the onstage conversation began, later grabbed a microphone to address the audience.  Ver told the crowd:  ""I’m willing to bet any amount that SegWit will not activate. Would you like to take me up on that? $1,000…$10,000, a gentleman’s bet that SegWit will not activate. I’m not saying the technology is wrong, just that it won’t activate.""  Elsewhere in the conversation, Vays took aim at Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative bitcoin implementation that seeks to increase the size of the network's transaction blocks, and that is favored by Ver.  ""I have said this, if Bitcoin Unlimited becomes the dominant fork of bitcoin then I will remove myself from the public eye,"" said Vays. ""I may not sell my bitcoin, but will remove myself as a public speaker.""  Later, Fenton, a board member at the Bitcoin Foundation, contended that 95% node consensus – the threshold required for network adoption of SegWit – will be extremely difficult, if not impossible.  ""If I promised to give everyone in this conference hall one free bitcoin if they meet me outside after this panel,"" he said. ""I’m certain that less than 95% of you would show up. Ninety-five percent in anything, even among like-minded people, is very difficult.""  The statements come amid continued in-fighting in the bitcoin community over how best to increase the network's capacity, a debate that now dates as far back as 2015.

The addition is actually the second time the exchange has listed the currency, formerly known as darkcoin. It was added in June 2014, only to be removed in August 2015 due to ""persistently low trading demand"". That original listing, too, came during darkcoin's 2014 market ramp, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Bitfinex said today that it is launching new trading pairs for the currency, denominated in USD and bitcoin.  This week's price rise around dash – which originally focused on financial privacy as darkcoin before a rebranding and shift toward broader consumer use – has raised questions among some market observers as to what exactly is underpinning the market moves.  While advocates say that the digital currency is drawing in serious investors, others contend that a mixture of illiquid order books and action by traders with big holdings – known more commonly as ""whales"" – are driving the price ramp.  “The partnership is recognition of the way the market has been responding to Dash’s vision and roadmap,"" Daniel Diaz, VP of business development for the project, said in a statement.

42427444,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXFh,1488562353,Fed Governor Voices Caution on Central Bank Digital Currencies,"Central bank-issued digital currencies could stifle private-sector payments innovation, a senior Federal Reserve official said today.  Federal Reserve board governor Jerome Powell took critical aim at the concept of a central bank-issued digital currency during a roundtable event focused on blockchain and the future of financial markets and hosted at Yale Law School, at which he gave an afternoon keynote address.  After discussing blockchain technology more broadly – echoing past remarks and research publications from the US central bank – Powell honed in on the subject of the so-called CBDC. Several institutions of its kind, especially the Bank of England, have pursued possible applications in the area in the past year and a half. Central banks in China, Sweden and Singapore, among others, have also investigated this use case.  In remarks, Powell raised questions about the technical and privacy issues he argued could impede such an effort, positing that such a system ""would be a global target for cyber attacks, cyber counterfeiting, and cyber theft"".  What’s more, he went on to argue, these efforts could crowd out private-sector approaches to new payments tools.  Powell told event attendees:  ""Indeed, I would expect private-sector systems to be more forward leaning than central banks in providing new features to the public through faster payments systems as they compete to attract retail customers. A central bank issued digital currency would compete with these and other innovative private-sector products and may stifle innovation over the long run.""  Ultimately, he said, central banks may want to consider private approaches.  ""Any central bank actively considering issuing its own digital currency would need to carefully consider the full range of the payments system and other policy issues, which do seem substantial, as well as the potential societal benefits,"" he said. ""To my mind, they should also consider whether the private sector can substantially meet the same needs.""  The speech comes months after Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard discussed the central bank’s research into blockchain. Fed chair Janet Yellen, too, has remarked on the tech twice since last fall, calling it an ""important technology"" during an appearance in January.  Powell’s full speech can be found here.

42427445,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXHh,1488558966,Russian Payments Firm Qiwi Launches Blockchain Subsidiary,"Russian payments firm Qiwi has created a new subsidiary that will focus on blockchain development and consulting.  The group, called Qiwi Blockchain Technology, will focus on developing in-house blockchain solutions and also providing external consultation services to clients, according to a report by Kommersant. The new entity will reportedly receive 100 million rubles for its 2017 operating expenses.  The firm has already developed a payment system that utilizes the tech, the publication said, and it intends to pursue additional projects in collaboration with prospective clients.  According to a rough translation, Alexey Arkhipov, who leads Qiwi's crypto-technology development, told Kommersant:  ""We are ready to make joint projects with external customers.""  Further, the company is said to be looking at whether to develop products around the Bank of Russia’s blockchain project, dubbed Masterchain, which was originally unveiled last October.  According to Arkhipov, Qiwi Blockchain Technology is already working with three companies to implement blockchain solutions, though the names of those companies were not disclosed. However, he mentioned that potential use cases were shareholder registration and data storage.  Qiwi has been an early adopter of blockchain and vocal proponent of its widespread use. Sergey Solonin, its CEO, is head of the Russian FinTech Association, an initiative backed by the Russian central bank. Qiwi, a member of distributed ledger consortium R3, has previously signaled its intention to deploy the tech internally.

42427446,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXJh,1488555228,Texas Lawmaker Proposes Constitutional Right to Own Bitcoin,"A Texas lawmaker has put forward a proposed constitutional amendment that would protect the right to own and use digital currencies like bitcoin in the state.  Texas House Joint Resolution 89  , sponsored by Representative Matt Schaefer, would alter Article I of the Texas state constitution to enshrine the right to use any ""mutually agreed upon medium of exchange"". The bill was introduced on 2nd March.  What’s more, the amendment would impede any government effort to interfere with that use or ownership.  As the resolution states:  ""Article I, Texas Constitution, is amended by adding...the right of the people to own, hold, and use a mutually agreed upon medium of exchange, including cash, coin, bullion, digital currency, or scrip, when trading and contracting for goods and services shall not be infringed. No government shall prohibit or encumber the ownership or holding of any form or amount of money or other currency.""  If passed by the legislature, the proposed amendment would then be included on the ballot for approval by Texas voters this November.  The proposal is perhaps unsurprising, given the state’s libertarian bent and cultural leanings toward the tech. The bill doesn’t put digital currencies on the same level as legal tender, and state regulators don’t recognize bitcoin as such in light of guidelines published in mid-2014.

42427443,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXBh,1488552307,Australian Government Commits $350k to Blockchain Standards Effort,"Australia’s government has committed funding to develop blockchain standards in the country, while a new roadmap for the initiative has also been released.  Standards Australia, which signaled last autumn that it would play a significant role in the development of international standards around blockchain tech, said in its new report that ""there is a broad community expectation that an appropriate legal and standards framework will be developed in order to establish market confidence"".  To get the process started, international standards drafters are expected to meet in Sydney next month to begin deliberations, the body said in a statement.  Australian Treasurer, Scott Morrison, has formally backed the initiative, revealing that the government has committed $350,000 in public funds over a four-year period to support the development of blockchain standards.  Morrison said of the effort:  “Australia’s leadership in developing blockchain standards promotes our position as a global centre for distributed ledger technologies. That is why the Turnbull Government announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Financial Outlook 2016-17 that it would provide $350,000 to Standards Australia over four years to support the blockchain standards initiative.”  According to the roadmap, Standards Australia intends to prioritize standards related to terminology, governance, security and identity, among others. Standards should center around use cases including digital currency, trade finance and the exchange of commodities, it adds.  Craig Dunn, chair of the country's International Organization for Standardization committee, elaborated on the scope of the work in a statement.  “We’re going to take a close look at relevant industry sectors like financial services, technology, logistics, and government services to assess what international blockchain standards are required to generate growth and to build efficiencies in these sectors,” he said.

42427448,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXLh,1488549616,A Framework for Valuing Crypto Tokens,"Sid Kalla is CTO at fintech firm Acupay, and a freelance journalist specializing in financial technology, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. He has invested in blockchain projects including bitcoin, MaidSafeCoin, Counterparty and BitShares (see our Editorial Policy).  In this guest feature, Kalla provides an in-depth guide for those considering investing in an initial coin offering or ICO.  Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency released to the public in January 2009. Since then, there have been thousands of others modeled after it, with varying degrees of similarity to the original concept.  Even early on, the types of ‘altcoins’ (alternate cryptocurrencies) varied significantly from one another. Broadly, the following categories emerged:  Cryptocurrencies that changed a few technical or economic parameters from bitcoin. Examples include litecoin, which changed the mining algorithm used, total supply, and block times.  Cryptocurrencies that were built from a different codebase altogether, with some specialized purpose. Examples include NXT, a proof-of-stake coin with functionality that differed from the bitcoin blockchain.  Meta-protocols on top of bitcoin. Examples include Mastercoin and Counterparty, which extend the use cases of bitcoin by building a layer on top of it, yet still using bitcoin as the underlying protocol.  Alongside the initial developments, a fourth type of crypto token also emerged. This differed from the previous cryptocurrency tokens in that the primary application is not for use as a currency. Instead, these tokens were specific to an application, and required to the use of that application.  The value of these crypto tokens came, not so much for their use in the exchange of goods and services, but rather the use of the underlying service that required these tokens to operate. These have been called everything from 'appcoins' to 'protocol tokens'. It is important to note that the economic and financial principles underlying these crypto tokens can be vastly different.  Several examples of these application-specific crypto tokens emerged early on:  MaidSafeCoin, which is convertible to SafeCoin, is needed to use the SAFE network.  BitShares has its own token that is needed to create market-backed collateralized assets and trade those on the blockchain.  Storj has its own native crypto token for the application of decentralized storage.  Ethereum, the second largest crypto token after bitcoin, was founded on the same principle, allowing anyone to create arbitrarily complex smart contracts enforced and executed by the blockchain. The native crypto token, ether, is used to reward those who run the network's computations.  The flexibility with which contracts could be programmed on ethereum gave rise to many projects listing their own application-specific crypto tokens on the platform. Just in the last year, we have seen all sorts of applications, from digital management rights to in-game currencies, being listed as crypto tokens on ethereum. Some alternative blockchains, like Waves, were built specifically to help new projects issue and manage these crypto tokens.  What is an ICO?  'Initial coin offerings', or ICOs, are a form of crowdfunding and bootstrapping for crypto projects, where the founding team receives funding to develop the project from backers, in exchange rewarding those backers with crypto tokens.  ICOs are possible for all the types of crypto tokens mentioned above. However, they have become most prominent for application-specific crypto tokens.  One of the first documented cases of an ICO was mastercoin, which raised over 5,000 bicoins in 2013. In a few short years, ICOs have become the dominant form of funding new crypto projects – helping teams raise money for the development and completion of projects that they might not be able to raise via more traditional means like VC or angel investors.  In 2016 alone, ICOs raised over $100 million for their instigating projects.  Challenges in valuing bitcoin  Bitcoin doesn’t lend itself to easily valuation models. It is part currency, part commodity and part technology. Its price history is too new to reliably backtest models, and, unlike a corporation, bitcoin doesn’t have cash flow or earnings that can be predicted in the future.  Several attempts have been made to provide valuation models for bitcoin, from macro-financial indicators to cost-of-production models. However, no one economic or financial model has been shown to be a reliable indicator of bitcoin’s value in the economy, or has been reliable in predicting its value to the market. No one valuation model is accepted by the market participants, either.  Given these challenges in valuing the digital currency, it is doubly hard to try to value other similar cryptocurrencies (say, for example, litecoin). However, there are other types of crypto tokens that have different economic, financial and cryptocurrency-like characteristics from bitcoin that are much easier to model for valuation purposes.  Crypto token ecosystems as economic entities  There are many challenges in valuing bitcoin and bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies as outlined above. However, there are certain tokens, especially the application-specific crypto tokens, that can be modeled, not as currencies, but as economic entities. This allows us to use some of the same valuation methods for these tokens as we do for stocks.  The biggest advantage of treating crypto tokens as stock for valuation purposes is that it allows us to use existing well-established economic and cash-flow models used in equity research today. By building upon these models, we can come up with fair value assumptions of crypto tokens based on assumed input parameters.  In fact, many of these crypto tokens work in a crypto ecosystem that is powered by the token. Projects differ in structure significantly from one another, however.  For example, a project with an external source of income that gets distributed to existing token-holders will be valued very differently from a project that needs to use the token to drive a specific application, which in turn supports the price of the token. In either case though, we can start from existing valuation tools rather than try and build models from scratch.  Investors and researchers should bear in mind that the market price of crypto tokens can differ significantly from the underlying valuation models, since a large component of price is speculative in nature. This will likely decrease going forwards, as the ecosystem matures.  Economic structure of crypto tokens  When we view crypto tokens akin to stock in a corporation for valuation purposes, we can begin to apply some of the economic characteristics of the latter to the former. For a crypto token holder, the value of the token comes from three primary sources, just like a regular stock:  Dividends  Buybacks  Price appreciation.  Let’s discuss the price appreciation component first. This is present in many crypto tokens, and is driven by adoption (note that this is different from speculative price appreciation). In this case, the entire economic value of the ecosystem is modeled based on economic assumptions, and then divided among the token holders. Many application-specific crypto tokens belong to this category.  Take the example of decentralized storage startup Storj Labs. Its tokens don’t pay any dividends, and there isn’t a concept of buyback. However, if the protocol is widely adopted, the value of Storj tokens is expected to increase.  A simple valuation in this case would be to model the size of the market that Storj can represent and divide it by the total number of tokens in existence.  Some of the more recent projects have a cash-flow component (earned income) in addition to the adoption-based price appreciation. This is similar to corporations making a profit, and using that profit to grow the business via retained earnings. The ‘excess’ profit is then distributed to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks (increase the percentage ownership of each share of the company) and dividends (provide a cash distribution to beneficial owners of each share).  The more recent trend has been towards using earned income to pay all token-holders, similar to a dividend (due to regulatory uncertainty, it is possible that projects in the future will tilt more towards buybacks). Traditionally, large corporations have used both dividends and buybacks as a way to return capital to investors. However, crypto tokens usually opt for just one of these routes.  Let’s look at the different models adopted by crypto tokens over the years.  The original BitShares (before an inflationary fork) was the first example of a crypto token with buyback-like characteristics. The number of BitShares tokens was capped. Every transaction needed a fee, paid in BitShares. A part of this went to the delegates in its proof-of-stake model, and the rest was 'burned'.  Burning is similar to buybacks in that the total supply of tokens decreases, making everyone hold a slightly higher percentage of the total supply than previously. As adoption grows, the fees (which are always paid in BitShares tokens) increase, so the number of tokens burned increases, thus sending the capital to the token holders.  Augur adopted clean dividend-like characteristics for its tokens, called 'reputations' (REP). All the fees generated by a market get distributed to the REP holders (in ether) that correctly voted for an event (ie they voted with the consensus). As the number of markets rise, the income generated by the REP holders should also rise.  In contrast with some other projects, this capital allocation decision is done via smart contracts, without any one group’s involvement, which makes it easier to value.  Iconomi, a decentralized fund management platform, has adopted dividend-like characteristics, but with separation into retained earnings and distributable earnings. This most closely resembles capital allocation decisions by corporations today.  The project will generate earned income (in ether) in the form of revenues generated from asset management and fees. A portion of these fees are retained by the company itself for ongoing operations and expenses. The rest is sent to the token holders. How much of the total earnings goes into distributions versus retained earnings is left to the discretion of the team.  We are yet to see crypto tokens with a capital structure consisting of both debt and equity. Such a crypto ecosystem would need strong earnings potential and the ability to scale with an increase in capital.  At this stage, we do not see such characteristics but it is possible and even likely that future crypto ecosystems will use debt intelligently to enhance returns. Such a system would also enable the setting of market-based interest rates for crypto tokens, and perhaps also provide clues to a risk-free rate.  Valuation methodologies for crypto tokens  Different crypto tokens lend themselves to the use of different valuation models, but we can use many of the tools that equity research already provides us with.  There are usually two steps involved with valuing a crypto token: modeling the market size and the extent that the project can reach, plus how the market reach translates to returns on individual crypto tokens. Economically, dividends and buybacks are similar. However, investor assumptions about the market adoption can vary widely.  The estimation of the size of the market can be top-down or bottom-up.  As an example of the former, consider Storj from our previous example. In the top-down approach, one would start with the total size of the addressable market, which in this case is file storage. Then estimate what percentage of that market can be captured by Storj in a given time frame.  In the latter approach, bottom-up, one would start with the existing market size of Storj and make assumptions on the rate of growth of that market. Sometimes a combination of these approaches will need to be used.  Addressing the size of the market itself can be challenging. Investors should look at information from existing companies. In the example of file storage, one can look at data from Dropbox and Box, two existing multi-billion-dollar companies in the space, and estimate the size of the market. From there, we can make an assumption about what percentage of the total market can be captured by a solution like Storj.  As an example of a bottom-up approach, consider SingularDTV, which raised $7.5m in its ICO last year. The project's investor communication (since removed, but archived) broke down revenue projection numbers per project. For example, they assumed a documentary would generate 200,000 paid views, with each view paying $2.60.  This is a typical bottom-up approach where individual components are valued, and then the value of the whole enterprise is estimated based on the sum of the parts. Investors should generally not agree with the numbers provided by the teams themselves, but can still use the framework for their valuation purposes.  Once the market size and earnings estimates are obtained, investors can use basic valuation frameworks like a dividend discount model, which gives a present value based on projected earnings and dividends, or a relative valuation model that compares a crypto ecosystem to existing companies that have well-defined pricing, for example due to the company being traded on the public markets (for example, comparing Storj to Box).  A sum of the parts valuation is also quite common. As an example, Iconomi has three distinct products that generate revenue: a crypto index-like fund with management fees, a crypto hedge fund-like product with both management and performance fees, and a fund management platform with usage fees. Each part needs to be modeled separately to arrive at the final valuation of the tokens.  An important factor to realize when valuing crypto tokens is that they naturally present higher risk than even regular startups. The data doesn’t support very long-lived crypto tokens. The markets are new, and demand can be flaky. The going-concern assumption may need to be revised to instead value these tokens based on a finite lifespan.  Investors should therefore demand a higher risk premium for investing in these tokens, and demand a higher margin of safety.  Valuation challenges  Due to the very short history of such crypto tokens and crypto-economic systems, there are several challenges that investors face when trying to value these projects.  First, the short history of crypto tokens has generally shown an even shorter lifespan of many of the projects. This is especially true because projects present a big principal-agent problem due to most of the tokens being given away through ICOs.  This is different than a startup that usually raises money in a series of different rounds over several years. In due time, crypto tokens will likely be sold to the public in several stages, depending on different milestones being hit by the project.  Second, the success rate so far for most crypto projects is not very encouraging. This makes projecting cash flows and earnings into the future very difficult, because the going concern assumption may not be valid. Models like the dividend-discount model assume dividends into perpetuity. If the project has a lifespan of five years instead, the valuation can be very different.  Third, there is no set risk-free rate for the crypto markets. This makes it harder to discount future cash flows to the present. There are some market-based interest rates on exchanges that lend to short-sellers, but that data is hard to come by, and it is hard to infer a risk-free rate from the data.  Fourth, there is usually some level of systemic risk associated with the crypto markets that cannot really be diversified away. The industry is too nascent for that. Therefore investors take on both project-specific risk and market risk when they invest in this sector.  The systemic risk is very hard to predict, due to the short timespan, and is unique to the industry. Everything from hard forks to new crypto attacks are a source of systemic risk that traditional investments don’t suffer from.  Fifth, many projects are interdependent, which causes dependency risk to projects. For example, a crypto project built on ethereum will be affected by things happening in ethereum, like a bug found in a compiler, or an attack on the ethereum network.  And, further, as layers of the ecosystem build up, this dependency risk deepens.  For more details about the developing 'ICO' market, read CoinDesk Research's latest report.

Perhaps the most obvious shift is the name itself, which for Wednesday’s gathering, had become the 'Fintech Symposium'.  And, instead of a day of panels dedicated to blockchain, the corporation – which conducts on average about $1.5qn worth of transactions a year – only dedicated a single panel exclusively to blockchain.  But the change was perhaps nowhere more palpable than during an audience poll in which multiple questions on blockchain were repeated from last year’s event.  The audience was asked during both events, when a 'production ready' distributed ledger solution would be adopted by the industry. Notably, the attendees – consisting of several hundred financial leaders from a range of startups and corporations – dramatically changed their votes on the question.  At the 2016 symposium, the lion's share of votes (32%) indicated that the audience thought mainstream adoption would happen within six months to a year. At yesterday’s event, however, only 3.9% of the audience cast a vote for the same time frame.  By comparison, the most frequently selected time frame at yesterday’s event showed 44% of the audience saying mainstream adoption would occur within 3–4 years, followed closely by a 1–2 year interval, which took 39.5% of the vote.  Further, in 2016, the slice of the DTCC audience that believed mainstream adoption would occur during a particular time frame decreased the further out the prediction went, with the least number of respondents (just 10%) predicting it would take more than six years.  At this years event, a full 84.2% of the audience believed mainstream adoption of distributed ledger technology would occur between 1–4 years, and then a similar pattern going forwards: with 3.9% voting for between six months and a year, 5.3% voting for 5–6 years, and 6.6% voting for more than six years.  New blockchain obstacle  In a related blockchain poll over which aspects of implementing blockchain technology presented the 'greatest challenges', the 2016 winning category came top again with a very similar percentage, though a new category was added, which took second place.  In 2016, 'business case and cost of integration' was the most selected obstacle with 32% of the votes, and it came top again this year, with 33.8% of the votes.  But a new answer choice, 'interoperability', added this year, was considered the second most common obstacle, with 20.3%. This was followed by 'scalability', which was last year selected by 21% of the voters, compared to 18.9% this year.  As featured by CoinDesk, a key theme of both DTCC president and CEO Michael Bodson’s keynote and the blockchain panels was the difficulty experienced by much of the industry in hiring blockchain talent and the need to invest in educating future professionals.  Added to yesterday’s event, in addition to the blockchain focus, were panels on the impact of cloud computing on finance, as well as the influence of robotics, machine learning and automation.  The DTCC is currently in the process of moving records for $11tn worth of transactions to a blockchain built using Axoni’s technology, under the management of IBM and advised by the R3 distributed ledger consortium.  Earlier this week the DTCC also announced it had had begun the next stage of its work with Digitial Asset Holdings to possibly implement a blockchain-based repo solution.

42427435,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKWxh,1488538819,Beyond Immutability: Ethereum Classic Maps a Way Forward,"""We think we're the real ethereum.""  In a recent talk at CoinDesk's developer-only conference Construct, developer Elaine Ou outlined how ethereum classic differs from ethereum, the blockchain that split from its original developers over an ideological disagreement last year.  While ridiculed as a 'protest chain' for its original commitment to 'immutability' (or the idea that one entity or group shouldn't have the power to change the blockchain's transaction history), one of the more interesting elements of Ou's talk was her claim that ethereum classic has been forging ahead by differentiating itself from ethereum in other key technical ways.  Now, the group is moving forward with one pillar of differentiation: monetary policy.  In a statement released on Wednesday, various interest groups supporting ethereum classic announced their support for a proposed monetary policy, or set of rules governing how the protocol's digital tokens (ETC) are dispersed.  Included are provisions that the total supply of the blockchain's token will not exceed 230m ETC and a plan to scale down the rewards paid to parties that secure the blockchain.    Notable signatories include IOHK CEO and former ethereum CEO Charles Hoskinson and Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG).  The statement reads:  ""Our common goal is to make Ethereum Classic a success. We believe that the community can unite and work together to achieve a sustainable global platform.""  As such, the news might mark a significant step in the project's ideation.  To date, ethereum classic's defining feature has been its focus on immutability. In fact, this is the ideological difference that led to the blockchain split between ethereum classic and ethereum, which reverted transactions after a major hack of The DAO project last year.  But the two protocols are still very much the same. The code issued on ethereum classic after the split has remained in step with the ethereum project, as the classic team has been copying over many of ethereum's code changes.  With the news on monetary policy, ethereum classic is taking a nibble at legitimacy. Up until the split, many developers anticipated that in the case of a hard fork – merely a hypothetical up until The DAO event – a minority chain like ethereum classic would die out.  In this way, ethereum classic places itself as an aspiring project in the context of a long chain of cryptocurrencies that have failed to fulfill promises made by their founders, yet simultaneously impassioned their supporters.  Hard limits  To those observing the space, though, the announcement is hardly surprising.  ""Ethereum’s current monetary policy – well, it doesn’t have a monetary policy,"" Ou acknowledged in her overview presentation at Construct in January.  The community's plan to 'fix' this problem has been outlined in an official proposal, known as ECIP 1017, the proposal that the protocol's various stakeholders officially announced their support for on Wednesday.  ""We wanted to modify the monetary policy so it looks more like bitcoin's hard limit of about 200m ether. Every two-and-a-half years or so, the block reward will be reduced by about 20%,"" Ou explained.  But, what’s the big deal about monetary policy?  To ethereum classic's anonymous project coordinator, Arvicco, it's an attribute that will facilitate further development and growth.  ""The undefined monetary policy of ethereum, its unlimited token inflation, is an impediment to all positive developments,"" he said. ""Moving to a bitcoin-like fixed cap emission schedule was considered a priority by many ETC stakeholders.""  One of the best examples of ethereum classic's upward progress, and continued controversy, is that investment company DCG proposed an investment fund that would support ethereum classic projects.  Yet, the monetary policy is so important, DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert has said, that it doesn't intend to launch the fund until the plan is finalized.  ""When something is clearly known and defined, it makes it much easier for investors, miners, developers and other community members to plan around,"" said IOHK project lead Carlo Vicari.  Ethereum classic arguably took its first step on this path when it carried out a hard fork to postpone the so-called difficulty bomb that’s built into the ethereum codebase (meant to encourage migration to another consensus mechanism).  But, isn’t changing the monetary policy a fundamental change to the protocol? Some would argue so, as it requires another hard fork.  Ethereum classic has become the poster child for what can happen when a protocol forks – and its actions now could go a long way to establishin precedent for other contentious chains.  It might show what could happen if ethereum classic itself executes a contentious fork. Although, so far, the cryptocurrency has carried out two others without spawning something like 'ethereum classic classic'.  One company’s influence  Monetary policy is perhaps the highest priority change according to the community, but there are others in the works as well.  IOHK, a company that’s been particularly active in the space, has been one of the biggest players so far.  Perhaps most notably given the major resource commitment, IOHK is funding seven full-time developers to work on a Scala implementation of the ethereum classic protocol, expected for beta release this summer.  The cryptocurrency now has two teams working on ethereum classic clients – implementations of the protocol users can run.  Beyond that, IOHK is treating the relatively new cryptocurrency like a research laboratory.  ""We want to see if we can create a divergent roadmap and see where we can go with it, to see how successful a different model would be from what [ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin] has planned with the Ethereum Foundation,” Hoskinson said.  He pointed out plans to use a different consensus algorithm (a hybrid of 'proof of work' and 'proof of stake') and decentralized governance as options.  Hoskinson told CoinDesk:  ""One of the biggest contentions in the debate between ethereum and ethereum classic is basically who gets to control the system. With ethereum, that’s the Ethereum Foundation. They control the money, they have the developers and they have the crowdsale mandate.""  Notably, Hoskinson was the former CEO of Ethereum (back before it was a non-profit even), but left over a difference in opinion about how ethereum should be structured.  But, though no one has control of ethereum classic, according to Hoskinson, he thinks there needs to be some better governance mechanism for coordinating future forks and distributing funds to developers.  One proposal that the company is working on is for a 'treasury' that funds developers, but isn’t managed by any one institution.  The proposal isn’t yet complete, but the idea is for a development 'tax' that’s built into the protocol. Essentially, while miners get a block reward for discovering new blocks, a percentage of each block reward will be sent to the so-called treasury to dole out to developers or projects the community chooses to vote for.  Hoskinson compared the structure to a traditional government that taxes participants for the common good. Although some participants might be wary of a tax, he argued that mining rewards are a kind of tax and that it's possible that development could be funded in the same way.  Forward-looking questions  Despite these developments, ethereum classic is a small community. One criticism often leveled at the classic blockchain is that, unlike ethereum, not many decentralized apps (or dapps) are built on top of it yet.  In Hoskinson’s opinion, this is a good thing. Before smart contracts are deployed, he said, researchers and developers need to further vet their security and lay the groundwork at the protocol level.  Others, though, think that work on ethereum classic dapps could pick up sooner rather than later.  ""I expect that after monetary policy is set and other foundational pieces come into place, the focus for some in the community will shift to dapp development,"" Vicari said.  Ou mentioned that there are still many other major open questions around big technical upgrades, such as 'sharding'. Arguably, the Ethereum Foundation hasn’t delivered on its promises here, and Ou claims that ethereum classic might go a different route.  Still, even with all this recent discussion, ethereum classic was originally born out of a commitment to immutability, and that simple goal may continue to be what motivates the community.  Ou concluded:  ""Right now, ETC’s main feature is that we favor immutability. I know that some people don’t care about that – maybe they don’t need a blockchain at all.""

42427432,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKWth,1488535215,Bitcoin Lending Concept Debuted At Bank of Japan Event,"HAW Technologies has developed a bitcoin-based lending market concept, recently presented at an event hosted by Japan’s central bank.  On 28th February, the Bank of Japan published the presentation outlining the project, developed by HAW and The Tokyo Tanshi, a major inter-dealer broker based in Japan. The goal, the startup said, was to create a kind of loan market that does away with trusted third parties.  According to HAW, the market utilizes the Open Assets Protocol – known more commonly as 'colored coins' – in order to signify commodified rights of redemption to a particular loan. As for the market’s structural make up, each participant is a bitcoin node, acting as lenders or creditors in the ecosystem.  Go Takahashi, HAW International's director, told CoinDesk:  ""By using assets like this, the loan is completed within the bitcoin blockchain, so you can configure DVP (Delivery Versus Payment) where rights transfer and payment of funds are done at the same time.""  HAW went on to argue that the concept shows how the bitcoin blockchain can be used to create a “borderless” loan market. Yet as currently it exists, the set-up relies on the use of intermediaries and off-chain communication, namely mediators who sit between the creditor and lender.  The mediator creates an unsigned transaction that would exchange the aforementioned assets and funds. The other parties provide signatures for the transaction, after which the mediator then broadcasts that transaction to the bitcoin blockchain for confirmation.  That said, HAW sees this changing in the long-term – particularly in light of the development of so-called 'layer 2' technologies around bitcoin such as Lightning, which is being built to enable the creation of bitcoin payment channels.  ""There is an opinion that distributed ledger is not suitable for pre-trade in terms of processing performance,"" Takahashi said. ""However, it is based on the existence of intermediaries, we believe that the distributed ledger may be compatible in decentralized market. We would like to advance the research with the view of layer 2 technology as well.""

42427451,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXTh,1488499843,"Bitcoin Traders Still Bullish As Price Nears $1,300 Highs","Bitcoin traders remain optimistic that the digital currency's price will increase, even as it continues to reach new all-time highs.  A perfect sign of this bullish sentiment is the recent increase in trading volume, a development that helps illustrate the strength of bitcoin's current, upward trend.  Bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume surpassed $365m today, more than 150% higher than the session low of close to $140m attained 1st March and more than 200% above the figure of roughly $110m reached 27th February, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  Bitcoin's price has repeatedly set new record highs over the last several sessions, rising to a fresh record of $1,284.33 today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The digital currency's price has been following this trend since 23rd February, when they broke through the previous record of $1,156.89 set in November 2013.  At the time of report, bitcoin prices had retreated slightly, falling to $1,259.59, BPI figures show.  Long data  Another strong indicator of the market's bullish nature is long-short data. Bitfinex's market for BTC/USD trading has been heavily long today, BFX Data reveals.  When measured in terms of long and short exposure, this currency pair has fluctuated between roughly 66% and 75% long during the session, pointing to the optimism that traders have about bitcoin's future price gains.  These bullish indicators could point to a continued rally in which bitcoin keeps reaching new all-time highs, which contrasts starkly with the period of more than three years when bitcoin prices failed to set a new all-time high.
