42378908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMLJ,1476738828,Bitcoin Scaling Solution SegWit Gets Possible Release Date,"The code for a long-in-development bitcoin scaling solution could be ready for activation as soon as 15th November.  The new software – version 0.13.1 – will include more code for Segregated Witness (SegWit), enabling users (and, perhaps most notably, miners) to begin the upgrade process. The launch will kick off a process by which the extended stakeholders in the distributed network will be asked to signal whether they support SegWit.  The news comes from an update on a mailing list for developers working on bitcoin's primary software, Bitcoin Core. There, developer Pieter Wuille posted new details this weekend about the planned rollout of SegWit. A release candidate for 0.13.1 has since been published.  The pending launch follows months of testing by developers. SegWit's code, for example, was first released for testing over the summer, but the new version would bring that code into production.  The November release date doesn't mean bitcoin's capacity issues will be instantly resolved, however.  For example, SegWit won't become the law of the land, so to speak, until 95% of the world's bitcoin miners signal their support by running the upgraded version. Furthermore, 2,016 transaction blocks need to pass after that threshold is reached before the network begins enforcing the change.  While promising, the release could spark further debate within the bitcoin community about the ways in which the bitcoin network can be scaled to support more usage given that tensions have recently been heightened over a perceived lack of progress on the issue.  Other software implementations, including Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic, have been put forward as alternatives to the Core approach, advocating for on-chain scaling that would expand the size of transaction blocks on the bitcoin network.

42378911,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMNp,1476730484,Bank Trials Show India's Blockchain Interest on Rise,"Two banks in India have reportedly partnered on a series of blockchain trials aimed at testing the waters for potential new services.  Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are working on early concepts related to cross-border payments and transaction settlement, according to Indian news portal LiveMint.  The news closely follows that of ICICI, another Indian banking institution, is working with Dubai-based Emirates NBD on similar initiatives. Combined, the two partnerships signal strong interest among India’s banking sector in applications that focus on the movement and settlement of funds. Further, it’s the kind of experimentation that the Indian central bank has pushed for in recent months.  According to LiveMint, representatives from both Axis and Kotak Mahindra struck cautious yet optimistic tones in describing the trajectory of their trials.  Deepak Sharma, chief digital officer for Kotak Mahindra, was quoted as saying:  “We are theoretically convinced that blockchain is the way ahead. But we have to establish a practical use of the technology. As of now, the focus is on whether the technology is scalable in the near future.”  Though unnamed, the two banks are said to be working with internationally as well as a “technology provider”.  Amit Sethi, president and chief information officer for Axis, told the publication that he believed the bank’s retail and corporate business lines might see the first commercial-scale applications. Further, he indicated that the bank would look to begin offering related products to its clients, but demurred on when any rollouts might take place.  “We will come out with solutions for our customers soon, but we don’t want to commit to any time frame,” he said.  A representative for Axis was not immediately available for comment. Kotak Mahindra did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42378894,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mM3h,1476722249,Blockchain Trade Group Adds First Credit Union,"Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU) has joined the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the Washington, DC-based blockchain trade organization.  DCU claims to be the largest credit union in the New England region by total assets. Founded in the late 1970s, it boasts more than 500k members throughout the US. The Massachusetts-based credit union is the first of its kind to join the organization, which was established in 2014 and aims to shape policy around blockchain in the US capital.  In statements, DCU president and CEO Jim Regan echoed others in the credit union space, saying:  ""We believe distributed ledger technology has the potential to make a positive impact for credit unions and their members.""  The credit union’s entry into the trade organization isn’t its first foray into the technology. DCU operates a fintech innovation center out of Boston, and in the past has said it wants to attract blockchain developers to take part in the initiative.  The industry as a whole has been exploring potential applications of the technology. More than 50 credit unions have been working together on the CU Ledger project, which aims to develop new products and services in areas such as digital identity.  Beyond blockchain, DCU has sought to position itself as an early technology adopter in the past. The credit union was one of the earliest institutions of its kind to launch a Web-based portal for banking services.

42378891,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mM6D,1476715194,Korean Credit Card Giant to Integrate Blockchain Identity Service,"South Korea’s largest credit card company is set to use a blockchain identity solution developed by local bitcoin startup Coinplug.  The service will be based on what Coinplug calls FidoLedger, a “private blockchain technology” aimed at providing a distributed means of verifying and maintaining digital identities. KB Koomkin Card, a subsidiary of KB Koomkin Bank, plans to complete its integration by the end of this year.  The startup has been working in the area of digital identity for some time, netting a $45,000 prize last year after submitting a prototype system based on the concept to a competition held by JB Financial Group.  It’s a use case that has been pursued by established enterprises as well as new companies working in the blockchain space. Now, following additional development, Coinplug is pushing ahead with what it calls the “Coinplug Identification System”, or CIS.  According to Richard Yun, director and chief operation officer from Coinplug, KB Koomkin wants to integrate the tool into its credit card onboarding services.  He told CoinDesk:  “KB will use this for commercial purposes and the availability of this service will be [for] all customers of the KB Card around mid-December.”  In addition to its enterprise blockchain projects, Coinplug operates a bitcoin exchange service. The tech, launched last month, comes just under a year after Coinplug raised $5m in a Series B funding round. The startup has raised more than $8m to date.  Targeting identity pain point  Using FidoChain, the identity solution allows users – in this case, KB Koomkin Card – the ability to add, verify or revoke identities tied to a credit card product.  Yun said the startup wanted to potentially resolve security and user experience problems associated with existing identity solutions in South Korea.  “We thought it is very important to provide secure and easy to use identification and authentication service to banking service users, and we believed that private blockchain technology can be very effective to implement secure and scalable identification/authentication service.”  It’s a prospect that, according to Yun, has attracted significant interest from KB Koomkin. The company, which reported $2.6b in operating profit for 2015, is said to be looking at applying the tech to both services it offers now as well as new ones in the future.  “They [are considering whether to] expand the coverage of CIS to other existing and new services,” Yun explained.  KB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42378898,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mM9z,1476708733,Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange Launches Blockchain Voting Service,"A major securities exchange in Abu Dhabi has announced the launch of a blockchain-enabled voting service.  According to The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), the service enables stakeholders to both participate in and observe votes held during annual general meetings (AGMs). The offering focuses on a use case that has spurred both private and public sector interest in the past.  The exchange, founded in 2000, said last weekhttps://www.adx.ae/English/News/Pages/20161015140637422.aspx that it would showcase the project during the GITEX Tech Week, an Abu Dhabi-based technology conference that began yesterday.  When announcing the service, ADX invoked the Abu Dhabi Plan, an initiative undertaken by the government to modernize the emirate’s economy. In some ways, it mirrors work taking place in neighboring Dubai, where blockchain is being tested for applications in the areas of governance and the Internet of Things.  Rashed Al Blooshi, ADX’s chief executive officer, said in a statement:  “ADX is committed to creating a business environment that is both competitive and flexible. Accordingly, adopting blockchain technology in our projects comes in alignment with the digital transformation of Abu Dhabi’s government services as we constantly strive to introduce new ways that ease the process of doing business in the Emirate.”  The launch comes months after word emerged that regulators in Abu Dhabi were positioning themselves to encourage more fintech startups, including those focused on blockchain, to set up shop in the emirate. At the time, observers noted that the push came amid a broader effort to attract financial services to Abu Dhabi.

42378913,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMP5,1476705860,Russia's Largest Bank is Worried About Blockchain's Dark Side,"After a flight through the air, my driver's license bounces a few feet from our table, coming to a stop on the plush carpet of a Shanghai hotel.  Pavel Khodalev, the chief technology officer at Sberbank, smiles. Despite the language gap, the point seems to register. As consumers, we're free to lose our personal items in the physical world – or in my case, throw them across a hotel lobby – if we choose.  The two of us are in China for International Blockchain Week, and Khodalev has just finished highlighting how his employer, the largest bank in Russia, is exploring applications of the technology. But after six days of non-stop blockchain, our conversation becomes more philosophical, settling on the idea that while the tech is increasingly ""open for business"", some still see it as a cipher for societal concerns.  If Khodalev looks at blockchain as ""inevitable"", then he argues that so too are the complications its design could have for our societal contract. In this light, the ability to carelessly lose hold of a digital document, he argues, is a development that needs to be managed – and is one that raises questions as blockchain challenges deeply held concepts of financial custodianship.  Khodalev told CoinDesk:  ""Our physical world has all these services that must appear in the virtual world. Peer-to-peer relationships are still relationships. I can take your wallet and I can run quickly, but police can stop me. This should appear in the digital world.""  Concerned by my ID, which is still resting on the carpet near the passing feet of hotel guests, Khodalev seems to worry about the sort of change this virtual shift will bring. Perhaps more specifically, his concerns rest on how financial custodians will respond, or be expected to respond, to new kinds of behaviors.  He points to the responsibility that tying a digital asset to identity could bring for consumers, asserting that new safeguards will be needed should the use case proliferate.  ""In the physical world, we’re managing these situations, but in the digital world no one knows how to manage this. The scary thing is you would not even know that your identity is stolen,"" he continues.  But while he uses the word “scary” often in our conversation, he seems excited by the promise as well, his statements highlighting how, while banks are increasingly keen to try to redesign bitcoin's technology, they are also having to come to terms with what it enables.  ""Blockchain for me is not a revolution that will kill the world, it will break new ground for the world,"" he said.  The dark side  In many ways, the appearance of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have caused a similar discomfort in Russia.  There, government officials have pushed for years to ban the technology, though these efforts now appear to be faltering as domestic banks and institutions become more vocal about blockchain.  Khodalev notes that, until recently, Sberbank had been rather silent about its work, despite the fact that it has played home to an internal lab of specialists focused on blockchain for two years.  ""We do this internally at the bank, we have the corporate university, standard courses and we're describing this to everyone. There's a lot of buzz about this word, but people don’t really understand,"" he said.  Khodalev noted that Sberbank is also participating in efforts to launch a domestic blockchain consortium, spurred by the country’s central bank, and it’s here that the bank is trying to change and challenge misperceptions about the technology.  Yet, he said that to understand why Russian officials have been resistant, one has to consider how the country has seen (and overcome) periods of turbulent change, namely the transition to capitalism in the 1990s.  ""It was a scary thing for the country. We got a huge pyramid scheme, MMM, as a result of what we called money surrogates. So, they made this phantom fear [bitcoin] could be the MMM. The government wants to defend against unpredictable stuff, and the first reaction for bitcoin was it should be legal impossibly to own,"" he said.  Now, he said, the conversation isn't so black and white. At the same time, concerns still linger about encouraging or condoning a non-governmental currency despite the benefits it could provide to consumers as well as those suffering from domestic economic issues.  ""The switch to bitcoin is still under consideration, because it’s not only investment hype,"" he said. ""There’s a dark side of that.""  'Coopetition'  But, that's not to say that Khodalev doesn’t believe the switch to blockchain will be without complication.  For example, he noted that blockchain is in some ways forcing industry collaboration, despite the fact that economic actors generally resist disclosing information to their peers. (He noted that the idea that a master blockchain could serve as ""one common data center"" has emerged as a point of fear or discomfort from incumbents).  “Blockchain creates a requirement that everyone needs to be in one relation, not only banks, all other participants, the companies that give a car for rent. Why should this company share the information about its cars with other similar companies?” he asked.  In this way, Khodalev sees Sberbank's work with the government as something that could ultimately prove to be a driver of change that might not occur so organically if the industry was plotting its course independently.  Given concerns about the scalability and privacy of blockchain systems, Khodalev suggested that banks are unlikely to be forthcoming on standards due to competitive interests. Further, while startups have raised awareness of the technology, he struck an uncertain tone about the idea that any of these companies would be able to bring about serious incumbent change.  ""The only way from my point of view to expedite this is to push it from the government level. Tell industry participants, this is the way it should be working,"" he said.  Work continues  Until then, Khodalev said Sberbank will continue to refine its strategy around blockchain through tests and special projects.  Notably, Khodalev said Sberbank is already experimenting with how banks could offer value-added services in a blockchain-enabled future that would see more transactions carried out via peer-to-peer interactions.  For example, Khodalev said that Sberbank has created a prototype based on the ethereum blockchain that explores how the power of attorney could be allocated to customer bank accounts.  ""We prototyped a system that could bring a common backbone and allow a notary to use it, which is now restricted,"" he said.  Khodalev said that, while promising, regulatory work will likely impede the offering because digital power of attorney, he said, ""does not exist"" under domestic law. Elsewhere, he said the bank is working with the central bank to explore messaging via distributed ledger.  However, Khodalev is forward with that fact that he believes the technology will pose challenges for intermediaries, but that in this change, stakeholders should think broadly about why such systems exist in the first place.  In his eyes, the question that needs to be asked is not whether it's technologically possible to eliminate third-parties, it's whether we as a society will come to agree they can – and should – continue to provide a service as a safeguard for consumers.  He concluded:  ""Blockchain, from my point of view, you don’t need intermediaries. We need to recreate these intermediaries or we need to ruin the world and see if it will realize [we do].""
