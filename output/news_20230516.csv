USDC market cap now quoted under $30 billion. Street revenue estimates may be too high. One of the biggest winners during this earnings season has been Coinbase ( COIN ). Shares of the cryptocurrency platform have surged after the company smashed Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. While the first quarter of this year definitely was much stronger than expected, there have been a few troubling signs in the crypto space during the first half of Q2. Coinbase reported net revenues of more than $736 million for Q1. While this was down almost $430 million from the year ago period, analysts were calling for the top line figure to be around $650 million. This was the strongest quarter of the past three, as both transaction revenue and subscription/services revenue both rose nicely on a sequential basis. The graphic below shows the overall revenue breakdown. Quarterly Revenue Breakdown (Company Shareholder Letter) Coinbase has also done a tremendous job of reducing its expense base. In the year ago period, transaction, sales, and marketing expenses were more than 40% of net revenues. In Q1 2023, the number was nearly sliced in half to about 22%. Other operating expenses like technology and general expenses have also come down significantly, with the number of employees down more than 28.5% year over year. Even with over $144 million in restructuring expenses booked for the period, the Q2 net loss improved to less than $79 million from almost $430 million a year earlier. For Q2, however, things are not looking as rosy. Subscription and services revenue guidance is for about $300 million, which would be down more than $60 million on a sequential basis. Coinbase management noted in the shareholder letter that the average USDC market cap in April was $31.7 billion, which was 23% lower than the Q1 average of $41.3 billion. USDC is a key driver of interest income, and the latest data now has that market cap under $30 billion and declining almost daily. Management also stated that it generated approximately $110 million of transaction revenue in April, as crypto asset volatility has declined. In Q1, this segment of the business averaged about $125 million per month in revenue. There are reasons to be worried here, for instance, as Bitcoin trading volumes are not looking good right now. As the chart below shows, average daily volume for the flagship cryptocurrency actually started up for the first 11 days of the quarter, but has since worsened. The quarter over quarter decline was at 24.54% through Day 33 (which would represent the day before Coinbase reported Q1), but that number is now over 27%. Bitcoin Daily Volume (Yahoo) I bring up these recent trends because it looks like analyst estimates might be a bit high at the moment. Given what management guided to, and the continued declines in both the USDC market cap and Bitcoin volume since, it would appear that Coinbase is on track for a Q2 revenue print in the low to mid $600 million range. Going into Tuesday, May 16, the average analyst estimate for the quarter was $686 million, which would certainly favor the bear camp. Even though Coinbase stock have come about $5 above last week's high, they still remain up about 20% from where they were going into the Q1 report. The 50-day moving average is just about $3 above current levels, and that key technical line could be one of major resistance moving forward. In the end, the Q2 trends so far for crypto have not looked good, so investors in Coinbase should have some caution unless we see some of these key items improve in the back half of the quarter.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4605234-coinbase-crypto-q2-not-looking-good?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12700512.jpeg
12700347,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4605233-bitfarms-time-to-play-catch-up?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1684280382,Bitfarms: Time To Play Catch Up,"Summary Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens are creating a dramatic shift in Bitcoin's transaction fee market. If this continues, the biggest beneficiaries are arguably the miners. Over the last 3 months, Bitfarms has grown operating exahash and the BTC in treasury. The company is well positioned to benefit from the May fee spike. When I last covered Bitfarms ( BITF ) for Seeking Alpha, I was impressed by how aggressively the company has been reducing its debt burden. Three months later, we have less debt, more production data, an earnings call, and a potentially different setup for the entire mining industry. While I think most of the public miners will benefit from that setup to some degree, in this article I'll lay out why I've personally decided to go long BITF shares. The Setup For Miners Before we get to the information that specifically pertains to Bitfarms, we have to acknowledge how the emergence of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens has the potential to dramatically change the fee market for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) users going forward. In the last several months, we've seen Ordinals go from what was viewed as a silly side attraction for ""degens"" to a legitimate NFT protocol that is responsible for $36 million in fees paid to Bitcoin miners. Ordinals Fees (Dune Analytics/dgtl_assets) I detailed why I felt Ordinals had the potential to lead to conflict within the Bitcoin community back in early February, and that assessment is closer to coming to fruition. Regardless of whether everyone likes Ordinals or not, this is a significant fundamental development for the miners. Despite short-lived spikes to fees over the years, the industry has been almost entirely reliant on fresh BTC supply emissions from the block reward. Fee rewards (IntoTheBlock) Earlier this month, we had the biggest spike in transaction fees paid to miners since the 2017 bull run. This fee spike is attributable to Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. A robust fee market changes the game for miners because it reduces the negative impact of the halving next year if network fees can continue to be a growing portion of total miner revenue. We don't know to what degree these transaction fees will be sticky. It'd be easy to dismiss this bounce in fees as just another short-lived spike like we've seen in the past, but I'm less certain of that. Ordinals Mints (Dune Analytics/dgtl_assets) Ordinals mints haven't shown any sign of slowing down, and there is now over $500 million in paper wealth underpinning the recently emerged BRC-20 token market on Bitcoin. Again, there is no guarantee this trend in activity continues. But if it does, it benefits the miners. Even without a larger share of revenue from fees, the setup for Bitfarms has also improved. Bitfarms Update For Bitfarms specifically, we have a continuation of the debt reduction story from the prior quarter, growth in exahash, and a small bump in BTC on the balance sheet. In the company's earnings presentation for Q1-23, Bitfarms noted debt on the balance sheet of just $19 million as of the end of April. This is down from 24% from the $25 million in obligations that the company disclosed in February. Bitfarms BTC Treasury EH/S January 2023 405 4.7 February 2023 405 4.7 March 2023 435 4.8 April 2023 465 5.0 Source: Bitfarms Importantly, Bitfarms has been able to accomplish this continued debt reduction over the last 3 months without sacrificing the BTC on the balance sheet or significantly drawing down cash. In the meantime, the company has also continued to slowly bring on more operating exahash; moving from 4.5 EH/s at the end of December to 5.0 as of May 15th. Bitfarms is guiding for 6 EH/s in Q3 of this year. Year to date, Bitfarms has produced 1,676 Bitcoin at an average BTC per EH/s of 87.5: Miner YTD Production Avg BTC per EH/s Iris Energy ( IREN ) 820 94.3 CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 2,395 90.1 HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) 1,065 90.0 Bitfarms 1,676 87.5 Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 447 87.4 Source: Company Filings through April 2023, author's calculations This makes Bitfarms the 5th most productive miner by cumulative BTC mined in 2023 and the 4th most efficient by average Bitcoin mined per exahash. Only CleanSpark can claim better efficiency with larger production. But CleanSpark has much less BTC and less cash on the balance sheet than Bitfarms. Data by YCharts Something else to consider is the trend in short shares as a percentage of shares outstanding. For Bitfarms, that trend has been lower since Q4 of last year, but that has not been the case for all the miners with strong efficiency scores. Bit Digital and CleanSpark have seen their short numbers start to move back higher from early 2023 lows. Iris Energy and Bitfarms are the ones that are at fresh lows for 2023 as of the article submission. Risks Many of the same risks from my last Bitfarms article still apply. BITF is still very close to $1 per share and could be at significant risk of being non-compliant with Nasdaq listing requirements if the price of Bitcoin moves lower from current levels. And there is certainly no guarantee that Bitcoin's price will remain in the $27-29k range. Beyond that, if Bitcoin's price increases, it creates a scenario where more competition can viably start mining for block rewards. Cost to produce (Bitfarms) To keep up with global exahash expansion, miners have to keep growing their own operating EH/s in line with the global growth rate, or they risk losing mining share to peers. Of course, this comes with a cost, and we can see that the cost to produce a Bitcoin has been increasing for Bitfarms in the graph above. Another risk to consider is the company's participation in market derivatives. CFO Jeff Lucas from the Q1 call : We're stepping in here very carefully and very thoughtful here. We're not being overly aggressive by any means. And the goal here, quite frankly, is the means of insulating and protecting our downside here. And right now, we're doing that primarily either by writing or by buying options in place here, though we're looking for some other more sophisticated instruments as we get more advanced here. And also to a degree on the upside, we do offset some of that premium cost by actually writing some dramatically out-of-the-money calls here. There is nothing wrong with hedging production in an attempt to diminish revenue volatility due to BTC price swings. But it is still something that investors should consider. These types of internal programs can work great when those running them guess right. But incorrect guesses can ultimately lead to unnecessary losses. It would be a shame if Bitfarms had BTC called away right before the halving. Summary In February, I liked the improving fundamental story in Bitfarms and rated the stock a buy, even though I didn't yet have a position at the time. Since then, the stock hasn't really gone anywhere, but the macro setup for the industry is arguably much better. Bitfarms has decreased debt by $140 million in 10 months. It has shown an ability to decrease that debt while growing both exahash and BTC on the balance sheet, and without significantly diluting shareholders in the process. Data by YCharts Despite the increasingly favorable setup for the industry and for Bitfarms specifically, it's lagging several of its larger peers and even similarly capitalized peers that have diluted to a larger degree. In my view, Bitfarms is going to play catch up, and I think this is a good time to take a shot on BITF shares.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4605233-bitfarms-time-to-play-catch-up?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12700347.jpeg
12700096,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533350,1684279857,Jump Trading’s Covert Operations: How They Made $1.28 Billion From Terra Labs’ Downfall,"According to recent court filings by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Chicago-based firm Jump Trading LLC secretly propped up Terra (UST), the algorithmic stablecoin created by Do Kwon, a year before its eventual collapse. The Wall Street Journal reported on the findings, revealing that Jump Trading made a staggering $1.28 billion from the scheme. Jump Trading is a Chicago-based global trading firm specializing in various financial products, including equities, futures, options, currencies, and cryptocurrencies. The company was founded in 1999 by a group of former pit traders and has since grown to become one of the largest trading firms in the world, with offices in Chicago, New York, London, Singapore, and Shanghai. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Is The Most Undervalued Asset in Crypto The Dark Side Of Terra’s Collapse The court filings shed light on the covert operations of Jump Trading, which allegedly used its trading power to prop up the UST project without any public disclosure. The stablecoin’s peg was artificially maintained, leading to a prolonged “Ponzi scheme” that eventually led to its downfall. The filings also reveal the role of Do Kwon, the founder of Terra and UST, in the scheme. Kwon is accused of falsely claiming the project’s stability and performance, leading investors to pour money into the project. According to the Wall Street Journal, Kwon allegedly used the funds to prop up the UST peg, prolonging the Ponzi scheme and allowing Jump Trading to profit massively. Furthermore, the Chicago-based firm allegedly purchased over 62 million stablecoin tokens, pushing its price back to $1 and propping up the Ponzi scheme. The revelations raise questions about the transparency and integrity of the UST project. Terra Labs And Jump Trading Under Scrutiny Per the report, after the stablecoin’s recovery, Do Kwon touted the algorithm’s “self-healing” abilities and its ability to maintain a dollar peg through a code-enabled balancing act with sister cryptocurrency Luna. However, the court filings suggest that the recovery was due to Jump Trading’s covert operations rather than the algorithm’s inherent stability. The report reveals that Jump Trading had a three-year loan agreement with Terraform Labs for 30 million Luna tokens with a 2% annualized interest payable in Luna tokens. The loan agreement was part of a larger deal that saw Terraform Labs receive a multimillion-dollar cash injection from Jump Trading in exchange for allowing the firm to buy Luna tokens for 30, 40, and 50 cents over three years. The court filings also include an email from Kwon to investors, in which he states that Terraform Labs had made an “important arrangement” with Jump Trading and asked investors to keep quiet about it. The revelations raise serious questions about the transparency and integrity of the UST project and the crypto industry. Furthermore, Jump Trading has not been accused of wrongdoing about the UST project, although the firm is facing a class action lawsuit from an investor over its alleged role in propping up the stablecoin. The company has not commented on the allegations.

42393539,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz5x3,1684278060,"DLT-Powered Financial Markets Could Save $100B Per Year, TradFi Study Says","Using distributed ledger technology (DLT) in securities markets could create savings north of $100 billion per year, a report produced by a major traditional-finance lobby group has said.  In a report published Tuesday evening, the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) called for regulators to allow the technology that underpins crypto to aid collateral management, asset tokenization and sovereign bond markets.  “Distributed ledger technology holds promise for driving growth and innovation,” said Adam Farkas, Chief Executive of GFMA, whose affiliates in the U.S., Europe and Asia count major players such as JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and Nomura among their members.  “This potential should not be ignored or prohibited where regulatory oversight and resiliency measures already exist,” Farkas added, calling for a harmonized international framework to let DLT-based markets link up.  Freeing up collateral outstanding in areas like derivatives and securities lending could save over $100 billion per year in financial resources from a market worth some $19 trillion, and using smart contracts to automate settlement and corporate action processes for stock splits and mergers could mean $15-20 billion lower operational costs, the report said.  The study reflects growing enthusiasm for using DLT from traditional finance players.  Euroclear, a Brussels-based firm specialized in clearing and settlement, is set to release a new platform for DLT bond trading shortly, and the European Central Bank is looking at how to make its financial settlement systems better interact with the decentralized technology.

42393522,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz4i7,1684278060,UK Lawmaker Group Clashes With Treasury Over Treating Unbacked Crypto as Gambling,"Investing in unbacked digital assets like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) resembles gambling and should be regulated as such, a cross-party lawmaker group in the U.K. has said. But the government is sticking by its plans to regulate them as financial services.  The Treasury Committee is worried the government’s proposal “will create a 'halo' effect, leading consumers to believe this activity is safe and protected, when it is not,” it said in a Wednesday announcement marking the publication of its report on crypto. The committee kicked off an inquiry into the industry in July to gather views from stakeholders and regulators.  The U.K. government recently asked industry members to share feedback on its proposed rules for the local crypto industry. In its consultation, the government said it wanted to regulate crypto by extending existing financial markets rules to create an authorization regime for digital asset service providers. A new bill going through Parliament also seeks to supervise crypto as regulated financial activities.  The Treasury Committee said it was ""concerned"" about the plan.  “With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such,” Harriett Baldwin, member of Parliament and chair of the Treasury Committee said in the statement. “By betting on these unbacked 'tokens,' consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.”  The global crypto market was worth around $3 trillion dollars in 2021 before billions were wiped out in a subsequent market crash propelled by the collapse of stablecoin issuer Terra and later by the fall of crypto exchange FTX.  The country's finance ministry, however, stands by its proposal to regulate crypto as financial services.  “Risks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it’s financial services regulation – rather than gambling regulation – that has the track record in mitigating them,“ a spokesperson for the ministry said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk. ""Crypto offer opportunities but we are taking an agile approach to robustly regulating the market, addressing the most pressing risks first in a way that promotes innovation.”  Crypto advocates too are already disagreeing with the committee's call to regulating certain crypto as gambling.  “Modern regulated economies must confront and engage with the evolution of finance, and develop a sophisticated regulatory regime which is not achieved by dismissing crypto investment as gambling,” Richard Cannon, partner at U.K.-based Stokoe Partnership Solicitors told CoinDesk in a statement.  The committee, in its statement, called for the government to keep pace with developments of potentially productive innovations that could come from the technologies underlying crypto assets.

12699333,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533309,1684278012,Bitcoin Whales Break A Pattern Held Throughout Halving Cycles: Glassnode,"On-chain data from Glassnode shows the Bitcoin whales have recently broken a pattern that was previously held through the halving cycles. Bitcoin Whale Growth Had Previously Been Diminishing With Each Cycle According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the current cycle is displaying an interesting deviation from the rule followed during the last few cycles. Here, the cycles or the “epochs” for the cryptocurrency have been defined using the halving events. “Halvings” are periodic blockchain events that permanently cut in half the block rewards that the miners receive for solving blocks. These events occur every time 210,000 blocks have been mined on the network, or approximately every four years. The reason they are generally selected as the start and end points for BTC cycles is that they carry profound impact on the economics of the market as the production rate of the asset is cut in half following them. This increase in the scarcity of the asset is a narrative so strong that bull runs have always followed the halving events. The next halving is supposed to take place sometime in the first half of next year. Currently, miners receive 6.25 BTC for every block that they mine, so following this next event, they will only receive 3.125 BTC in their rewards. Now, there have been many patterns that have held throughout the Bitcoin cycles, but one such trend looks to be breaking down with the latest epoch, as the below chart highlights. The total number of whales seems to have gone up by 98% in the current cycle | Source: Glassnode on Twitter The metric of interest here is the percentage growth that the number of whales have registered during each of the epochs. The analytics firm has defined “whales” as entities that are holding at least 1,000 BTC in their wallets. Note that entities here don’t just refer to individual wallets, but also “a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity,” which are “estimated through advanced heuristics and Glassnode’s proprietary clustering algorithms.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Active Addresses Sharply Decline Despite Transaction Demand, Why? From the chart, it’s apparent that the number of whales went up by 436% in the first cycle, while they only went up by 139% in the second one. The third one saw even less growth at about 91%. This would indicate that with each of these Bitcoin cycles, while the BTC whales had continued to increase in number, their percentage growth had been diminishing. The current cycle, however, seems to have turned out different from these past cycles so far, as the growth in the number of whales has actually been stronger than the previous epoch this time. Related Reading: PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment Whales have grown by 98% since the start of the cycle, but it’s worth noting that there are still around 344 days to go before the next halving event. It now remains to be seen whether the indicator resumes the trend from the last epochs before the end of the current one, or if the cycle will truly end with the pattern being broken.

In the last 24 hours, SHIB has lost 2% of its value, and there has been limited movement on the weekly chart. This indicates a decrease in buying interest and an increase in selling pressure. The market for SHIB appears oversold, but there is still a possibility of a price recovery if buyers step in. A small increase in buying activity could result in a significant appreciation of SHIB over the next trading sessions. Related Reading: PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment Moreover, there are bullish signals suggesting a potential breakout. The price movements of altcoins, including SHIB, have been similar to Bitcoin, which is currently experiencing uncertainty. For SHIB to see positive momentum, a shift towards a more optimistic buying sentiment is necessary. However, it is worth noting that the market capitalization of SHIB has decreased, indicating that sellers currently have control over the asset’s price. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, SHIB was priced at $0.000008, trading near its resistance level of $0.000009. Prior to reaching $0.000009, the coin may face a minor resistance at $0.0000088. A symmetrical triangle pattern has formed for SHIB, indicating a bullish signal. If SHIB successfully surpasses the $0.0000088 level, it could experience an upward breakout from the triangle, potentially reaching $0.0000096. This would result in a significant rally of over 10% for the coin. Conversely, a decline from the current price would push SHIB down to $0.0000084, leading to a considerable loss. The recent session showed a decrease in trading volume for SHIB, indicating low buying strength. Technical Analysis Throughout most of this month, SHIB has experienced increased selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped below the 20-mark, indicating an oversold condition due to a significant decrease in demand. If SHIB manages to surpass immediate resistance levels, buyers may reenter the market. Similarly, the coin’s price fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, suggesting that sellers were driving the market’s momentum. Furthermore, a bearish signal was observed as the 200-SMA (green) crossed over the 50-SMA (yellow), forming a death cross pattern. A death cross typically signifies a downward price movement. Confirming the bearish indications, the meme-coin showed sell signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) which indicates price momentum and trend reversals exhibited red histograms which are associated with the sell signals.

42393527,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz52d,1684275907,"SEC Can't Seal Docs Tied to Hinman's Ether Speech, Judge in Ripple Suit Rules","A federal judge ruled that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cannot seal documents tied to former official William Hinman's 2018 speech on crypto and securities to Ripple in the regulator's ongoing lawsuit against the company closely associated with the XRP cryptocurrency.  District Judge Analisa Torres, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled that the documents tied to that speech, in which the former SEC Director of Corporation Finance stated that in his view, ether was not a security, cannot be sealed in a court order. A magistrate judge in the same court, Sarah Netburn, first ruled in January 2022 that those documents needed to be turned over to Ripple as part of the ongoing discovery process.  While Judge Torres will allow the SEC to redact the names and personal information of people mentioned in the documents, she wrote that the SEC cannot seal the so-called ""Hinman Speech Documents,"" saying they were relevant to the judicial process.""  ""As Judge Netburn found in her order dated January 13, 2022, the Hinman Speech Documents are not protected by the deliberative process privilege because they do not relate to an agency position, decision, or policy,"" Torres wrote. ""Therefore, sealing these documents would not be related to preserving 'openness and candor' within the agency, nor would such an interest be substantial enough to outweigh the strong presumption of public access.""  Meanwhile, Ripple tried to redact a number of documents of its own, including contractual agreements, financial information and other types of information. The judge is allowing many of these proposed redactions, including redactions tied to the company's financial statements and certain business information, to go through, saying she agreed with Ripple's assertion that they're targeted and specific.  However, the judge did rule that other proposed redactions are ""overbroad,"" including several proposals tied to XRP.""  For instance, Defendants seek to redact references linking Ripple’s revenues with XRP sales,"" the judge wrote. ""Defendants also seek to redact the compensation that Ripple offered to trading platforms to list XRP ...

12697813,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533260,1684274403,"This Bitcoin Metric Is At A Crucial Junction, Will Bulls Find Victory?","On-chain data shows a Bitcoin indicator is currently retesting a crucial level that could decide the direction the market takes from here. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Plunged To A Value Of 1 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the short-term holders are currently selling at their break-even mark. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR), which tells us whether Bitcoin investors are moving their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder in the market is currently selling their coins at a profit. On the other hand, the indicator having values below this threshold suggests the market as a whole is realizing a net amount of loss. The level at which SOPR becomes exactly equal to one implies that the loss realization is exactly equal to the profit realization right now, and hence, the average investor is just breaking even on their investment. In the context of the current topic, the entire market isn’t of interest; only a segment of it: the “short-term holders” (STHs). The STHs include all BTC investors that bought their coins within the last 155 days. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 14-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin SOPR specifically for these STHs over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant Historically, the Bitcoin STH SOPR has followed a curious pattern. During bullish periods, the indicator has generally stayed above the line where the metric’s value becomes 1. This makes sense, as rallies allow the STHs many profit-taking opportunities, so the majority should be selling at some gains. Related Reading: PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment What’s actually interesting, though, is that whenever the metric has dropped to the 1 line, it has provided support to the price (and has also made the indicator rebound back above it). Examples of this have been marked with the green arrows in the graph. As already mentioned before, the 1 line signifies the level where the average STH is just breaking even, meaning that they are selling at the price at which they acquired their coins, that is, their cost basis. The reason why this level acts as support during bullish trends is that the investors see their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity (since they believe the price would go up in the near future). So, a large amount of buying takes place here. Related Reading: Aura Around PEPE Isn’t Good For The Market, Especially Bitcoin – Here’s Why In bear markets, the opposite behavior is seen; the level acts as resistance to the price since selling tends to happen at it. Because of this pattern, the indicator’s behavior about the 1 level can provide hints about whether a bullish or a bearish regime is active currently. Recently, the indicator has once again dipped to this crucial level. If the Bitcoin rally is still on right now, then the Bitcoin STH SOPR should observe a rebound here. This has already happened once during this rally, as the price felt support at this level back in March. If, however, the retest ends up failing, then it may mean that a transition back to a bearish period may have occurred for the cryptocurrency.

42393526,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz4xV,1684273815,Lightning Labs Releases 'Better' Version of Token Minting on Bitcoin After BRC-20s Clog System,"Lightning Network infrastructure firm Lightning Labs has rebranded its Taro project to Taproot Assets and released a software update after a contentious trademark infringement suit was filed by blockchain software development firm Tari Labs Last December.  The suit resulted in an injunction that prevented further development of the project. But with the rebranding, Lightning Labs has resumed work on the primary software for implementing the newly renamed Taproot Assets protocol, which will allow users to issue assets such as stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Tari Labs has not responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Read more: Lightning Labs’ Taro Project Faces Halt as Judge Issues Temporary Injunction for Trademark Infringement  Today’s update closes the chapter on a lawsuit resulting from a brand name – Taro, that Tari Labs claims was too similar to their own – and opens up the ability for developers to experiment with software that has a new set of core features designed to “bitcoinize the dollar,” according to Lightning Labs.  Taproot Assets is currently available on a test network, with main network support ""coming soon,"" according to the team.  “We are committed to building an assets protocol for Bitcoin and Lightning,” Elizabeth Stark, CEO and co-founder of Lightning Labs told CoinDesk. “That scales to many people around the world and doesn't make the Bitcoin blockchain effectively unusable,” a reference to last week’s record-high congestion and transaction fees on the Bitcoin network due to a surge in minting of BRC-20s – fungible tokens generated via the controversial Ordinals protocol.  Interestingly, Domo, the pseudonymous creator of BRC-20, recommended Taproot Assets as “unequivocally a better solution.” This is because Taproot Assets creates multiple assets off-chain before settling them as a single on-chain transaction. Also, witness data – the type used by Ordinals – is transacted and stored off-chain.  Lightning Labs says the next step for the company will be to propose finalized specifications of the protocol to the Bitcoin community via bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) and Bitcoin Lightning improvement proposals (bLIPs) with the ultimate goal of enabling Bitcoin-based asset transfers over the Lightning Network – a secondary system for cheaper and faster Bitcoin transactions.  “Super excited to have so much developer support and enthusiasm,” said Stark. “Taproot Assets mainnet is just around the corner.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/lightning-labs-releases-better-version-of-token-minting-on-bitcoin-after-brc-20s-clog-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b60c58a79935c85ff7a038aabf7430a87ce827e-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $26,950, down roughly 1.3% for the day, according to CoinDesk data. Over the past 24 hours, BTC’s price has been range-bound between $26,800-$27,400.  While Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the U.S. is projected to breach the debt limit as early as June 1 and said a default “could lead to a recession,” several analysts believe a resolution to the debt ceiling issue could potentially buoy bitcoin.  “The current macroeconomic situation is, in our view, conducive for increased crypto adoption,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. “The debt ceiling getting raised also bodes well for risk assets as market participants seek to secure wealth,” he added.  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, told CoinDesk that there “could certainly be a bid for BTC” whether or not there’s a deal on the debt ceiling.  Outumuro sees the impact of these negotiations and the ongoing bank crisis as similar: “They both highlight the weaknesses of the system and create doubts about their long-term sustainability, thus creating demand for potential alternatives like crypto.”  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, slid 0.2% on Tuesday to change hands around $1,820.

12696382,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533321,1684270837,"Bitcoin Bullish Structure Holds Firm: $31,000 Breakthrough Imminent?","In the world of cryptocurrency, the market can be a confusing and volatile place. This is especially true for Bitcoin (BTC), which has seen its fair share of ups and downs in recent days. Jackis, a well-known analyst in the crypto community, has recently commented on the current state of the market, and his words may be of interest to investors. Related Reading: Japan Loses 30% Of Total Crypto Hacks In North Korea, Elliptic Reports Bitcoin’s Potential For A $31,000 Breakthrough According to Jackis, Bitcoin’s weekly structure remains bullish, which means that despite any potential dips, the overall trend is upward. He suggests that even if there is a deeper pullback, it can be seen as a potential higher low in a bullish trend, which should eventually lead to a break of the $31,000 level. However, Jackis also warns that this bullish trend must be proven, and until then, investors should be cautious. On the daily chart, Jackis notes that the market has just swept the range low of $26,500, which could be seen as a potential deviation. However, despite this, the overall structure on the daily chart remains bearish, and investors should treat it as such until further highs are reclaimed. He suggests that while there may be a decent buyback from the higher time frame (HTF) range lows, the market is still in a bearish structure. Until there is evidence to the contrary or a convincing low time frame (LTF) structure too long, Jackis expects a new lower low to be seen. Furthermore, according to Jackis, the current structure of the Bitcoin market is bullish, but this could change quickly. He notes that the market is currently trading at a premium, which is known as the Golden Zone, compared to the H4 Swing. To continue pushing higher, the market needs to show real strength at this level. However, the current market conditions are challenging to read, and there are arguments for both bullish and bearish positions. Bitcoin And Ethereum Part Ways, Correlation Hits Lowest Point In Two Years A recent report by Kaiko, a leading provider of market data and insights, has shed light on an interesting trend in the Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) markets. According to the report, the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum has hit its lowest level since November 2021. The rolling correlation between the two cryptocurrencies has weakened from 96% to 77% since mid-March, indicating that they are increasingly being driven by divergent idiosyncratic factors. The report highlights that Ethereum has lost momentum since the Shapella upgrade, dropping by nearly 14%, while Bitcoin is down by around 11% over the same period. This divergence suggests that the two cryptocurrencies are being influenced by different factors, rather than moving in tandem as they have in the past. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market, Bitcoin, is trading at $27,000, which is slightly below its 50-day Moving Average (MA). While BTC has managed to reclaim the $27,000 level, it has seen a minor decline of 1.4% over the last 24 hours.

12695619,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533252,1684269025,"Lido DAO (LDO) Surges Nearly 20% In The Past 7 Days, Here’s Why","In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, Lido DAO (LDO) has made significant waves in the past week, experiencing an impressive surge of nearly 20%. Though the surge comes at a time the global crypto market is not deep in a downtrend, Lido’s current rally can be attributed to two notable factors. Over the past seven days, LDO has recorded a significant spike, up by 16%. The asset has picked up from trading at a low of below $2 as of May 9 to trading at a high of $2.25, at the time of writing. Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, the rally continues as the asset is currently up 6.3% with an increasing trading volume. Whale Accumulation Fuels Lido’s Surge One possible catalyst for Lido’s remarkable performance over the past 7 days is the increased buying activity by cryptocurrency whales. According to a recent report by Onchain analyst Lookonchain, three whale accounts have been observed accumulating LDO tokens. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Surges 16% In Single Day, Maintains Dominance In Liquid Staking Market Notably, these whales have been seen transferring their LDO assets from centralized cryptocurrency exchange Binance to personal wallets, indicating a deliberate accumulation strategy. The magnitude of these whale transactions is noteworthy. For instance, one address withdrew a substantial amount of 724,822 LDO tokens, valued at approximately $1.52 million, from Binance for $2.01 per token. Another whale withdrew 655,641 LDO tokens, equivalent to $1.38 million, from Binance at $1.83 per token. Additionally, a third whale purchased 570,883 LDO tokens using 974,000 USDC for $1.71 on May 12. This influx of capital from these significant players in the market has undoubtedly contributed to the surge in Lido’s value. Lido V2 Launch Amplifies Momentum Another driving force behind Lido’s recent upward trend is the launch of Lido V2. This highly anticipated upgrade brings several notable features to the Lido DAO ecosystem, enhancing its appeal to investors and participants. A key highlight of the V2 release is the ability for users to withdraw their staked Ethereum (ETH). With the new Withdrawals page, Lido users can easily deposit their staked Ethereum tokens, such as stETH or wstETH, and receive ETH in return. Lido has streamlined the withdrawal process, reducing the withdrawal period to as short as 1-5 days. This improvement not only enhances the liquidity and accessibility of staked Ethereum but also provides users with greater flexibility and control over their assets. Additionally, the V2 upgrade introduces a modular staking router, which promotes staking diversity among several cohorts. Related Reading: Lido DAO (LDO) Holds 10% Gains On Weekly Chart While Majority Of Coins Shrink Solo stakers, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) clusters can now participate in staking activities through Lido, further expanding the network’s staking capabilities. LDO’s price has already risen nearly 20% since the upgrade, with a market currently above $2 at the time of writing. Alongside the price surge, Lido DAO’s market capitalization has also experienced a notable rise. The market cap moved from $1.4 billion last Friday to $1.9 billion today. Moreover, the trading volume of LDO has also witnessed a significant uptick over the same period indicating the increasing accumulation of the asset. Lido’s trading volume has surged from $47.4 million last Friday to more than $104 million in the past 24 hours.

42393535,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz5SH,1684266049,Balancer Might Arbitrage Itself to Rescue Inverse Finance’s Frozen Crypto,"A cadre of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are coordinating to rescue about $300,000 in crypto that got frozen during the biggest hack of 2023.  The owner of the crypto, Inverse Finance, fears arbitrageurs are gearing up to grab the hoard once it unfreezes on June 8.  A plan outlined Tuesday would see the automated market maker Balancer execute a “permissioned arbitrage” of its “bb-e-USD” pool “before anyone else can get to it,” according to a forum post from Balancer’s governance lead. Balancer had frozen the pool on an emergency basis in Mid-March when the borrow and lend platform Euler Finance lost $200 million to a hacker (who later returned the funds).  Currently in discussion, the plan needs approval from Balancer’s community members, since the DeFi protocol would have to modify its mechanics. Organizers plan to hold a second vote on distributing the recovered tokens once the arbitrage is complete.  DeFi’s lego bricks lock together in complicated ways, and the Balancer situation offers another example. It has already gotten the green-light from three other protocols: TempleDAO, which will loan Balancer specialty stablecoins that it needs to conduct the arbitrage; Euler, who patched the smart contract; and Inverse, which wants its money back.  “Inverse is clearly very concerned about recovering their coins,” the pseudonymous Balancer contributor Tritium wrote in a forum post.

42393537,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz5mn,1684265681,"Serial Phishing Scammer Uses a Mix of Laundering Techniques, Including Coin Swaps and a Mysterious OTC","Scammers have stolen millions in crypto pretending to be HitBTC, a little known crypto exchange founded in 2013, the team of MistTrack crypto compliance platform said in a tweet Monday morning. MistTrack belongs to the SlowMist company, which is focused on cybersecurity in crypto.  According to the researchers, someone has set up the website hitbt2c.lol, mimicking the authentic website of HitBTC, hitbtc.com, and enticed crypto traders to connect their wallets or deposit crypto as onto a real exchange. If the users follow instructions, instead of a legitimate exchange, they would deposit money to scammers’ addresses, and the funds would be gone.  MistTrack located four blockchain addresses that the scammers used to receive funds from unassuming users. These wallets accumulated over $15 million worth of crypto over the time of their existence, the researchers estimated. According to SlowMist, there are many similar phishing websites active at the moment, including fake clones of the Coinone exchange and Ledger hardware wallet maker.  “One of the victims from this scam reached out to us asking for help,” MistTrack team member told CoinDesk via Twitter direct messages. “The earliest activity we saw from these address was in June of 2022, but it could have been earlier. There’s only one address that’s still active, we believe that’s main address the scammer uses,” they added.  CoinDesk looked into where the money went.  DeFi, CEX and mysterious OTC  MistTrack flagged four addresses, one for Bitcoin blockchain, two for Ethereum, and one for Tron:  3BvQyAZwBXxk7rEStd6burfQgQ5AD2FFsq (BTC), TCV1cN2iRG1F1NHwr3GnujhNkEbBoXdZs8 (USDT on Tron),  0xB59299A0F15a282Bfc671BC0c2231184292C01b1 (ETH) and 0xdc961cF2F71dd0ab4f83eA294dBfEF1970ae15c6 (ETH).  The Bitcoin address has been active since July 2022 and received over 52 BTC over time. Most of these funds have been later sent to an address that might be an over-the-counter (OTC) trading service allowing users to buy and sell crypto outside of big exchanges.  The address of the supposed OTC has been flagged multiple times by victims of various scams before, suggesting that either the fake HitBTC phishing scam is just another one in a row of shenanigans by a serial fraudster, or that multiple scammers are using the same service to cash out their ill-gotten crypto.  According to the Bitcoin Abuse Database, the wallet received money from phishing scams resembling the one against HitBTC, as well as the so-called “pig butchering scams,” in which scammers start an online romance with a victim and then entice them to “invest” in a lucrative crypto project (which does not exist). Some users suggested that this might be an OTC broker chosen by cybercriminals.  This supposed OTC has an interesting way of processing bitcoin: whoever operates the wallet in most cases swaps bitcoin for wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) on Ethereum, using a service launched in 2018 by BitGo, Kyber Network and Ren. The wallet sends large batches on bitcoin to an address on the official proof-of-reserves list for wBTC, meaning it belongs to one of authorized wBTC custodians.  The Ethereum address from MistTrack’s tweet, active since June 2022, received SHIB tokens worth $247 in September, and then sent them to the centralized exchange OKX, according to the Etherscan data.  The same wallet received over 11.5 million in various stablecoins over the past year and a half, including 8.3 million USDT, 2.4 million USDC and 833,000 DAI. The address also received over 47.87 wrapped BTC.  The address often interacts with Tokenlon DEX to swap wrapped ether (WETH) for USDT. It also sent USDT to addresses belonging to the OKX centralized exchange several times. One of the OKX addresses in question regularly received money from another wallet previously labeled as a phishing scam on Etherscan. That wallet hasn’t been active since December 2022.  Other two wallets attributed to the scam by MistTrack offer little insight: A Tron-based Tether address only received 242 USDT last September, and one more Ethereum address listed by MistTrack is empty and has never received any funds.  The data suggests that the owner of the wallets flagged by MistTrack might have been running multiple scams, including phishing, and using decentralized finance (DeFi) tools to cover their tracks, swapping cryptocurrencies one for another. But they also actively use centralized ways to cash out crypto, like a centralized exchange and an OTC broker.  OKX has not responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.  HitBTC has reported around $400 million of daily trading volume recently, according to CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. The exchange has not reacted to MistTrack’s tweet so far. There has been no mentions of the phishing threat on the exchange’s official website, Twitter page or Telegram channel at the time of writing. The exchange has not responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | USDT,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | USDT | ZRX,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/16/serial-phishing-scammer-uses-a-mix-of-laundering-techniques-including-coin-swaps-and-a-mysterious-otc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2386c125bdefdc49215df786348567a77cbd9bef-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12694108,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533264,1684265435,"Algorand (ALGO) Price Turns Positive, Bulls Eyeing Further Gains?","Algorand (ALGO) has recovered from the bearish trend seen at the end of February 2023. From February 21 till May 8, ALGO recorded a loss of 45.13%, dropping to a low of $1.592. Despite the crash, buyers still pushed up the price of ALGO by more than 6% in the past few days. Traders are optimistic and are eyeing the next move in the current trend, while the bears are slowing building momentum by holding their strong short position. Will The Bulls Maintain This Current Bullish Momentum? The sustainability of ALGO’s current price trend relies on several factors. Market conditions, such as supply and demand dynamics, overall economic factors, and external events, can generally influence the price. However, the current market sentiment is bullish, while the Fear & Greed Index is 45, indicating neutral. This means the market’s state is stable, and the volatility is not high. Within the last 24 hours, Algo’s general market cap gained 1.57%, rising to over $1 billion. The 24-hour trading volume surged by 15% overnight, rising to about $33 million. Related Reading: US Banking Crisis Worsens With Half Of America’s Banks On the Verge Of Failure Notably, at the time of writing, the ALGO token is trading at $0.1683 as bulls continue to have a good day with gains of 2.50%. However, the recent increase in ALGO’s general market suggests increased demand for the asset. As more investors and traders buy the asset, the increased buying pressure can lead to a rise in its price. The increase in trading volume suggests improved liquidity for the asset, which tend to attract more investor to the market. ALGO Technical Analysis The price is below the 200-Day and 50-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This suggests that ALGO market sentiment is still bearish; the selling momentum is stronger than the bull’s buying momentum. However, the asset might rebound if the bulls increase their momentum, as green candles are showing today in the chart. The Relative Strength Index oscillator is showing 40.18. This means the asset is currently at neutral levels; the pressure from bulls and bears is normal. Related Reading: Crypto Firms Should Ditch Banks To De-risk From Volatile Systems, Says Cardano Founder Also, MACD is currently above the signal indicating a potential uptrend. The histogram confirms the bullish sentiment as its showing green candles and also above zero. ALGO trades between its primary support and resistance levels of $0.1587 and $0.1853, respectively. The next key zones are the support level – $0.0992 and the resistance level – $0.2427. Recent Development In The Algorand Ecosystem Alogrand recently introduced a new plugin-based tool for enhancing Blockchain Data Access named Conduit. Conduit aims at providing improved access to blockchain data. It is an upgrade to the conventional one-size-fits-all Indexer, designed as a modular plugin-based tool. This plugin empowers decentralized applications (DApps) by offering precise and tailored data retrieval capabilities, all while maintaining cost-effective deployment options. Such developments on the network could increase adoption and utility and, in time, boost ALGO’s price.

Before you start to play Bitcoin games online, it’s important to check what their withdrawal times are like in order to ensure that you receive your winnings quickly and without any delays. Lucrative Bonuses and VIP Programs The bitcoin casinos offer various bonuses or VIP programs as incentives for new players or for loyal members. However, It’s important to know all of the details in order to understand which bonuses suit the Bitcoin slots players best so that you can maximize your winnings during gameplay. Excluded Countries While many gambling sites do not restrict users by country, some do. It’s important to read through each online casino’s terms and conditions before signing up so that you can make sure your country is not restricted. Our recommended casinos are accessible worldwide including the US. Transparency and Provably Fair Games Provably fair games ensure that the casino games are fair and random by enabling players to verify the fairness of their results through proofing techniques. Make sure that the online gambling site has provably fair games so that you know that all outcomes are generated randomly without any manipulation or interference from third parties. With that in mind, all of the Bitcoin slots casino sites we recommend are certified for provable fair games and tested for fairness. Step-By-Step Guide To Playing Bitcoin Slots Even though playing crypto and bitcoin slots is very easy and straightforward, we have created an in-depth guide with all you need to know about the process. Simply follow these steps and you will be playing exciting bitcoin slot machines in no time. Prerequisites Before you can start playing Bitcoin slot games, there are some prerequisites that must be met. First, check which types of cryptocurrencies are accepted by the casino; most crypto casinos accept popular currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), and many more. Finally, it is important to choose an online casino that is safe and secure; look at our top list for recommended, trusted, and reviewed sites. Signing Up Once you have chosen a Bitcoin gambling site, signing up is easy. All you need to do is fill out a short form with your personal information such as name, address, email address, etc., then submit it for review. Make sure to read through the terms of service before submitting your information; this will ensure that your data remains secure and protected from any third-party access. Once your account has been approved, you can move on to depositing funds using Bitcoin. Depositing Funds Using Bitcoin Depositing funds using Bitcoin is easy; all you need is a wallet where you can store your cryptocurrency. Once you have chosen a wallet, simply transfer the desired amount of BTC into it from another wallet or exchange platform Then go back to the online casino’s website and select “deposit” from the menu bar; enter the amount of cryptocurrency you want to deposit along with your wallet address, then click “submit”. Your funds should appear in your account within minutes. Gameplay Now that you have deposited funds into your account using Bitcoin, it’s time to start playing. Before placing any bets on Bitcoin slot machines or other games available at the casino, make sure to read through their paytable first; this will give you an idea of how much each bet pays out when certain combinations are hit. It’s also good to understand any strategies associated with slot machines; these can help increase your chances of winning big jackpots. Finally, remember that all winnings are paid out in crypto; this means they must be converted into fiat currency before they can be spent outside of the casino’s platform. Withdrawing Winnings in Bitcoin When it comes time to withdraw winnings earned while playing Bitcoin slots at an online casino, simply select “withdraw” from the menu bar on their website and enter the amount of crypto you wish to withdraw along with your wallet address. The withdrawal process usually takes between 24-48 hours depending on how busy their system is; once completed though, all winnings should appear in your wallet. To convert them into fiat currency for spending outside of the casino’s platform, simply transfer them into an exchange platform such as Coinbase or Kraken where they can be exchanged for USD instantly. Play Free Bitcoin Slots (demo mode) One of the best ways to get started playing crypto slot games is by playing in demo mode. This allows you to test out different titles without risking any of your own money. Most gambling sites offer a demo mode for their online slot games, so be sure to take advantage of this before committing any real money. Play Slots With High RTP When playing online slots, it’s important to look for games with high Return To Player (RTP) percentages. The higher the RTP, the more likely you are to win when playing that particular game. Be sure to do some research and find out which games have the highest RTP before you play online slots. Claim Casino Bonuses And Free Spins Another great way to get started bitcoin casino slots is by taking advantage of casino bonuses and free spins offers. Many sites offer these types of promotions, so make sure you’re taking advantage of them when signing up for an account. This can help give you an edge over other players and increase your chances of winning big. Online Slots – Budget And Responsible Gambling Finally, it’s important to set a gambling budget before getting started with bitcoin casino slots. Make sure you only gamble what you can afford to lose and never chase losses or try to win back what you’ve already lost. Setting a budget will help ensure that your gambling experience remains enjoyable and safe.

12692753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533246,1684261842,DeFi’s Rising Star: Why Rook DAO Is The Best-Performing Token Of 2023,"Rook DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) operating in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, made headlines recently as it executed a “rage quit” that resulted in a significant price surge for its native token, ROOK. The move saw the token’s value skyrocket by a staggering 475%, making it one of the best-performing DeFi tokens this year. But the concept of a “rage quit” is not new in the world of DAOs. It refers to a situation where a member or group of members decide to leave the organization and withdraw their funds suddenly and dramatically. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including disagreements over governance decisions, conflicts of interest, or even outright fraud. Exploring The Rook DAO Phenomenon In the case of Rook DAO, the split was sparked by a dispute over the distribution of rewards. Some members felt that the rewards were being unfairly distributed to certain individuals, while others believed that the system was working as intended. After a heated debate, a group of members decided to execute a rage quit, withdrawing their funds and splitting the DAO into two separate entities. Related Reading: The Aura Around PEPE Isn’t Good For The Market, Especially Bitcoin – Here’s Why According to the researcher under the pseudonym “DeFi Ignas”, as part of the split, IncubatorDAO received 60% of the treasury, which was valued at $25 million. However, instead of holding onto the assets, IncubatorDAO decided to sell them for USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This move was aimed at providing liquidity to the token holders of both Rook and IncubatorDAO, as well as allowing for greater flexibility in terms of future investment opportunities. But there is a catch. The USDC received from the sale of treasury assets can only be redeemed by Rook token holders until July 12th. This means that if you hold ROOK tokens, you can exchange them for pROOK, a redeemable ERC-20 token that is equivalent to USDC. After the deadline, the USDC will be locked and inaccessible, effectively becoming worthless. The aftermath of the split has been nothing short of fascinating. On one hand, the price of ROOK has soared, making it one of the best-performing DeFi tokens of the year. On the other hand, the split has created a new DAO, known as the Fair Launch Initiative, which aims to promote fair and equitable distribution of rewards in the DeFi space. Deadline Dilemma As DeFi Ignas highlights, RooK DAO’s recent split and subsequent distribution of USDC has raised a speculative question in the DeFi community; what percentage of ROOK token holders will redeem their tokens for USDC before the July 12th deadline? While the fair value of ROOK is estimated to be $40, the current trading price of $59 suggests that speculators are putting a 50%+ premium on the price, likely betting that some holders will forget to redeem their tokens. Related Reading: BNY Mellon Embraces Long-Term Digital Asset Initiatives Across All Lines of Business However, there is still $17 million worth of USDC that remains unclaimed from the contract. This has led to further speculation about the potential actions of major players in the DeFi space, such as Polychain Capital. Polychain invested a “seven-figure sum” in ROOK tokens back in 2020 and recently moved 100,000 tokens, worth $5.8 million to a new address, possibly to sell, according to DeFi Ignas. Furthermore, Ignas believes that the decision of whether to sell or redeem the tokens is a strategic waiting game for Polychain, as redeeming the tokens by July 12th could result in a base payout of 4 million USDC and an additional $4.7 million for their pROOK, assuming no other redemptions. However, if they choose to sell on the open market, they could potentially drive down ROOK’s price.

42393536,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz5cX,1684261805,Ledger Bats Back Criticism of New Wallet Recovery Service,"Crypto wallet maker Ledger came under fire this week for its new “Ledger Recover” feature, with some posters on Twitter arguing that the service – which stores encrypted user seed phrases with third-party custodians – undermines Ledger’s stated commitment to privacy and security.  During a Twitter Space session, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier defended the offering.  “You’re saying this is not what customers want. Actually, this is what future customers want,” he said. “This is the way that the next hundreds of millions of people will actually onboard to crypto.”  The incident underscores the long-simmering tension between blockchain-focused companies looking to attract new users and ideologically minded segments of the crypto community: It can be difficult to square user experience with core ideals.  Ledger Recover  Ledger is a Paris-based provider of crypto hardware wallets – “cold storage” devices that link a person’s crypto to a USB thumb drive. Compared to browser-based “hot wallets” like MetaMask, which stay connected to the internet at all times, or exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, which hold crypto on customers’ behalf, hardware wallets are considered the most secure way to hold crypto.  When a person sets up a wallet, they are given a random string of words, called a seed phrase, that serves as a secret wallet recovery key. Users are instructed to write the phrase down and hide it away somewhere safe.  But the seed phrase system has some obvious user experience issues: If a person loses the phrase, they have no options for recovering their funds. And just as the phrase can be used to recover a wallet, it can be used to crack a wallet if it falls into the wrong hands.  On Tuesday, Ledger confirmed speculation that it was introducing an optional, $9.99-per-month seed phrase recovery service for owners of its Nano X wallet. The service, Ledger Recover, offers a way for people to secure their speed phrases without worrying about losing a slip of paper.  “When you subscribe to Ledger Recover, a pre-BIP39 version of your private key is encrypted, duplicated and divided into three fragments, with each fragment secured by a separate company – Coincover, Ledger and an independent backup service provider,” Ledger explains on its website. “Each of these encrypted fragments is useless on its own. When you want to get access to your wallet, 2 of the 3 parties will send fragments back to your Ledger device, reassembling them to build your private key.”  Community backlash  A segment of Crypto Twitter responded to news of the feature with outrage – alleging that splitting the (encrypted) key to third parties could leave it vulnerable – thus undermining the entire purpose of a hardware wallet versus alternative storage options.  Users took particular issue with the requirement that Ledger Recover customers provide a government-issued ID to the company should they wish to use the service. For some in the crypto community, this step violates core crypto tenets around privacy.  “Sure, you *could* use Ledger's new 'Recover' service and give them your private keys controlling your assets as well as a copy of your ID and other personal information,” tweeted Alistair Milne, a bitcoin (BTC) investor with a large following on Twitter, “but why then bother with a hardware wallet in the first place?”  Some critics used the update as an opportunity to bash Ledger’s security record. In 2020, the company suffered from a data breach that exposed the emails of nearly 10,000 customers. Although no wallets were compromised as a result of the attack, the incident left a bad impression of the firm’s security practices with its tech-minded user base.  “Ledger, the company that has experienced multiple security breaches that exposed the personal information of hundreds of thousands of its customers, now wants you to export your private keys from your hardware wallet and give fragments to them, Coincover, and an unnamed third party, where any two can siphon funds,” tweeted ChainLinkGod.eth, a community ambassador for the crypto infrastructure firm, Chainlink. “To facilitate recovery, they need you to dox yourself and give even more of your personal information, allowing anyone with your identity documents (e.g. from other data breaches) to take your funds. This seems … poorly thought out.”  Ledger responds  On a Twitter Space responding to concerns around the service, Ledger’s leadership defended its security practices, emphasized that the new recovery service was completely optional, and denied allegations that its new service amounted to any sort of a “backdoor.”  “It’s not a backdoor at all. You stay in control. Nothing will happen without your consent on-device,” said Ledger Co-founder Nicolas Bacca, adding that the team plans to open source its code in the future so that users can see how Ledger’s recovery service safely encrypts user data and operates securely under the hood.  “People have had a lot of fear, which is perhaps unjustified,” said Ian Rogers, Ledger’s chief experience officer. Rogers emphasized that Ledger was making its recovery service fully optional and was transparent about partnerships with third-party custodians. “As a consumer, you have a choice. And you should know who it is that you’re trusting.”  Gauthier reiterated that its recovery feature was a necessary step for attracting new crypto users. “I’m sorry, but the piece of paper is a thing of the past and Ledger Recover is a thing of the future,” he said. “There is no compromise to security.”  Gauthier also responded to critiques of Ledger’s track record.  “I've seen a lot of people on Twitter saying like, ‘Oh, I'm sure this will be hacked in the next 12 months.’ OK, let's see.” Gauthier said. He added that the company has “6 million devices on the market,” and it “hasn't been hacked, hasn't been compromised” and has “no backdoors installed.”  If Ledger ever gets hacked, “any sort of credibility or reputation in the company will be at stake,” Gauthier said. “So of course we're not gonna make those kinds of mistakes.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | WALLET | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/ledger-bats-back-criticism-of-new-wallet-recovery-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7c5f63d48790cb033a774d49935168c436d8866-5992x3370.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MICA covers stablecoins and other digital tokens, trading platforms, bitcoin-related services but not bitcoin itself, and digital wallets.

This record burn occurred in two separate transactions. The burning mechanism aims to remove excess tokens from circulation, causing scarcity and boosting SHIB’s value. Mysterious Wallet Burns SHIB An anonymous wallet, inactive for over a year, suddenly became active and burnt its entire holding of SHIB tokens. These tokens were 18.23 million, with the burn occurring in a single transaction. The recent spike in burn activities boosted the overall Shiba Inu burn rate by over 26,450.21% in the last 24 hours. 🔥 18,236,152 $SHIB -> transferred to dead wallet. https://t.co/rCe5Ws75vl — Shibburn (@shibburn) May 15, 2023 Also, a new project in the crypto space, Blaze token, transferred over 3 billion SHIB to the dead wallet in one transaction.

The small candles on the daily chart indicate limited trading activity, as its trading volume is down by 10.88% today. SHIB has dropped below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bearish signal in the short and long term. The 50-day SMA dropped below the 200-day SMA on May 11, 2023, forming a death cross on the chart reflecting bearish pressure. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 30.04, firmly in the oversold region. However, the indicator is moving sideways, reflecting the current trend on the price chart. SHIB’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and showing negative values, which is a bearish signal. However, the histogram bars are fading, suggesting the possibility of a trend reversal ahead for the asset. SHIB has bounced off the $0.00000868 support level seeking to recover and return to the $0.00000989 resistance level. The bulls and bears are evenly matched in the market, forcing the sideways trend observed. However, a break above the $0.00000989 resistance will see SHIB text the next resistance level of $0.00001019.

42393543,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz6CR,1684258614,Bitcoin Volatility and Trading Volume Continue to Decline,"Trading ranges within bitcoin (BTC) markets continue to narrow, a sign that uncertainty remains the order of the day for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Simultaneously BTC’s share of overall crypto markets continues to rise, an indication that it remains the safe haven digital asset for investors.  The average true range (ATR) for BTC has fallen 12% over the most recent 4 days and 31% since March 23rd. The ATR of an asset is a measurement of volatility over a prescribed period of time. ATR takes the greater of the differences between current and prior highs and lows, with declines indicating a contraction in volatility and increases indicating an expansion.  When the trading range of an asset compresses, it can signal that markets feel the asset is appropriately priced. During times of lower volume however, it can also imply uncertainty among market participants. BTC volume remains below its 30 day average by approximately 30% across exchanges.  The reduction in volatility coincides with a recent decrease in the aggregate amount of stablecoins being added to exchanges. This decline in available risk capital, in conjunction with uncertainty, has led to relatively flat trading, illustrated by the ATR compression.  BTC’s current $27,000 price level sits approximately 4.5% below a high volume node, representing an area of potential short term upside.  High volume nodes are displayed using the Volume Profile Visible Range indicator, and represent areas of significant agreement between buyers and sellers.  Prices can often move slowly near high volume nodes, as the greater degrees of agreement lends itself to orderly price action. This stands in contrast to low volume nodes, where the lower levels of liquidity can lead to more dramatic price swings.  Investors would be keen to watch the decline in active addresses on the Bitcoin network as well. The number of unique addresses actively transacting in BTC has declined 33% since April, leading in part to the contraction in volatility.  While volatility has waned, BTC’s market share has increased, with the crypto’s dominance up 5% year to date. At a market capitalization of $523 billion, BTC represents 45% of the $1.6 trillion market cap across all cryptos.  Despite the 63% increase in BTC prices year to date, investors appear reluctant to look for additional alpha in smaller altcoins, using bitcoin instead as the safe haven asset within crypto markets.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/16/volatility-and-volume-continue-to-decline-in-bitcoin-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7c9a1e96f7ac83150ed8b9a6d2e3cb0d94eb7b7-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
12691364,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533328,1684258382,Why Litecoin Is The Most Undervalued Asset in Crypto,"Litecoin momentum is potentially changing, network usage is skyrocketing, and the cryptocurrency’s halving is ahead. Yet the asset remains drastically undervalued relative to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other factors. Here is a closer look at why Litecoin could be the most undervalued asset in crypto. LTC Vs BTC Vs ETH Compared Litecoin was once a top ten or higher cryptocurrency that has since fallen from that lofty pedestal. A nine-month-long up-only bull run and more than 10,000% ROI left the coin ranging for going on its fifth full year. Unlike other top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, LTC never made dramatic new all-time highs in 2021. On some exchanges, the record high is still set for 2017. After the 2017 bull market peak, Litecoin has lagged behind the two largest coins by market cap. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Could Be Gearing Up For Its Greatest Rally Since 2017 But this is common in the final stages of a bull market, after which Litecoin wildly outperforms both BTC and ETH in a flash. That sort of situation could return, according to the charts below, starting with the below comparison of LTC versus Bitcoin and Ether. LTC is drastically underperforming BTC and ETH | LTCUSD on TradingView.com Crypto Market Moment Ready To Change Another sign that LTC is due to outperform the market can be found in the one-month LMACD crossing bullish. The signal is at least a two months ahead of Bitcoin and Ether and suggests a larger move in Litecoin first. According to Investopedia, momentum “refers to the inertia of a price trend to continue either rising or falling for a particular length of time.” The LMACD is a momentum measuring tool, and it could be indicating that Litecoin’s inertia just made a major swing in the positive direction. The LMACD has crossed bullish on only one of these charts | LTCUSD on TradingView.com Litecoin Elliott Wave And The Final Advance Litecoin technicals, according to Elliott Wave Principle, could also point to much higher prices. The current wave count and Fibonacci retracement levels are characteristic of an expanding diagonal pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally These patterns appear at the beginning or the end of a motive wave. Considering the larger wave count, this would suggest an ending expanding diagonal and perhaps the last major rally in Litecoin in some time. Is this an ending diagonal pattern? | LTCUSD on TradingView.com LTC Fundamentals Support Soaring Higher Finally, LTC transactions are currently skyrocketing. From a fundamental perspective, this is as bullish as it gets for any cryptocurrency. Litecoin is benefiting from an explosion of ordinals on the LTC-20 standard, congestion on Bitcoin and Ethereum, and more. Network transactions are off the charts | LTCUSD on TradingView.com Essentially, the Litecoin ecosystem is booming again. When network usage skyrockets, LTCUSD spikes in price. We also have yet to mention Litecoin’s halving, which is less than 80 days away.

12691235,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533324,1684258077,Ledger Under Fire After Questions Arise Over Security Measures,"Crypto’s flagship cold storage tool, Ledger, is taking heat from the crypto community this week following a Reddit post from a Ledger co-founder that suggested that external companies could have exposure to user seed phrases on an opt-in basis. The situation is far from ‘cut and dry’ and has led to substantial dialogue throughout crypto communities around the degree of security that Ledger owes it’s users. Let’s take a look at both angles of the argument. Ledger Lunacy: Where It All Started The genesis of this started with a new firmware update over the past day, leading to quick question marks about the implications from the udpate. A Reddit post on subreddit r/ledgerwallet late on Monday / early on Tuesday this week is what set it all off, courtesy of a thread titled “Is there a backdoor? Yes or No.” The Reddit poster asked in the body of the post: An official answet from ledger would be very much appreciated. Also because the alternative (typing the three parts of the seed for the three custodians) goes against the number one rule of never typing your seed in a connected device. This silence on how this “recovery” works is the worst response. Customers appreciate transparency. The post opened the floodgates to speculation, and responses from Ledger co-founder Nicolas Bacca (u/BTChip) didn’t field encouragement for Ledger users. Bacca provided several responses to user concerns throughout the thread, including this reply on the thread itself: There’s no backdoor and I obviously can’t prove it (because it’s not possible to prove a negative) – let’s just say that you’re already using the device agreeing with the fact that Ledger cannot update the firmware without your consent – it’s the same mechanism for Recover, which is locked behind ownership of your device, knowledge of your pin, and finally your consent on device. There’ll be more information published shortly describing how the service works – the tldr is that no single company knows your seed if you decide to use it. If you don’t want to use it there’s no consequence whatsoever in your previous experience of the device. In all, users are seemingly left still trying to answer one dying question: Can a Ledger device expose a seed phrase? Bitcoin (BTC) has been tracking stable price action, as users ponder the security of their cold storage. | Source: BTC:USD on TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Analysis: Here’s What’s Holding Back A Rally To $30,000 The Big Picture: Back & Forth Dialogue While the meltdown continued on Reddit, parlayed with new subreddit threads on the ‘hot’ page like “consider moving to a different cold wallet,” “How to kill your business,” and many more, Crypto Twitter also took hold of the situation. Resident Crypto Twitter dev Foobar amplified the situation further: Stop using Ledger hardware wallets. Migrate away from them immediately. They’ve shown nothing but gross incompetence and wild misunderstanding of their own purpose. And now they’ve publicly admitted to intentionally backdooring their own proprietary hardware. Stop using Ledger pic.twitter.com/LLFFUsOW4y — foobar (@0xfoobar) May 16, 2023 Not all were in agreement though, as another noteworthy dev, Udi Wertheimer, posted his disagreement. Wertheimer replied that the post was “irresponsible hyperbole” and that “Ledger remains as safe to use today as it was yesterday. For MOST people it is the easiest hardware solution to recommend.” In all, it is right and to-be-expected in the crypto community that firms like Ledger face immense scrutiny: the integrity of the industry has a meaningful degree at stake over the security and integrity of the largest cold storage provide in the business. While it is likely that some community members are losing their head too quickly, Ledger will likely continue to face pressures to increase transparency around the degrees of access to wallet keys.

The upgrade is expected to take two to four hours, starting at 16:00 coordinated universal time (UTC), according to the Optimism team. Deposits and withdrawals will be unavailable during the period.  The Optimism Foundation proposed the protocol upgrade in February, and it’s been described as “the largest upgrade ever released on OP mainnet,” and a “complete re-write.”  According to that original proposal, the new upgrade would offer “a new level of modularity, simplicity and Ethereum equivalence for layer 2 solutions, providing unprecedented performance and functionality.”  There’s an intense competition underway to win market share as a top Ethereum scaling solution, with Arbitrum as the industry leader, followed by Optimism and several rollups using zero-knowledge cryptography, according to the website L2Beat. In the past few months, Optimism has scored big wins with both the crypto exchange Coinbase and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (known as a16z) revealing efforts to build on the network.  Optimism’s OP token has rallied, gaining 77% so far in 2023 versus a 52% rise for ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.  According to the crypto analysis firm Messari, the Optimism community approved the upgrade in April with 99.87% of votes in favor.  The upgrade “implements a modular architecture that separates the OP stack into consensus, execution and settlement components, which will allow Ethereum execution clients to be converted into Optimism execution clients,” Messari wrote.

12690560,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533183,1684256441,Historical Crossover Suggests Ethereum (ETH) Top Is In,"On-chain data shows the Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio has formed a crossover recently that has historically signaled tops in the asset’s price. Ethereum Taker Buy/Sell Ratio 280-Day and 476-Day MAs Have Crossed Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the last time this crossover formed was back in May 2021, when ETH observed the bull rally top formation. The relevant indicator here is the “Ethereum taker buy sell ratio,” which measures the ratio between the taker buy volume and the taker sell volume. When the value of this metric is lower than 1, it means the short or the taker sell volume is currently higher than the long or the taker buy volume in the market. This kind of trend is a sign that there are more sellers willing to sell at a lower price in the market right now, implying that the selling pressure is dominant. On the other hand, when the indicator has a value higher than 1, it suggests a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority as the long volume is greater than the sell volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Active Addresses Sharply Decline Despite Transaction Demand, Why? In the context of the current discussion, the actual metrics of interest are the 280-day and 476-day moving averages (MA) of the Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio. Here is a chart that shows the trend in these MAs of the indicator over the last few years: The values of the two metrics recently came together | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the 280-day MA of the Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio declined below the 476-day MA last month. Interestingly, right as this crossover took place, the asset’s price formed a local top around the $2,100 level. When the 280-day MA drops below the 476-day MA of this metric, it means that the market sentiment is changing towards a more bearish one, as it suggests a rise in the taker sell volume dominance. Due to this reason, such a cross has been bearish for the cryptocurrency’s value in the past. From the chart, it’s visible that this type of crossover last formed back in May 2021, when ETH was at the height of the bull run in the first half of 2021. Coinciding with the crossover, the cryptocurrency’s price registered its then-all-time high value. Based on this, it’s possible that the latest crossover in the Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio MAs could also prove to be bearish for the price. So far, ETH has only declined since the top formed along with this indicator, so it seems that the crossover effect may already be in action. However, the two MAs are still quite close in value, so it’s possible a reverse cross could also possibly form in the near future. Related Reading: Has Bitcoin Rally Already Hit Top? Here’s What Puell Multiple Says In 2020, both types of crossovers formed several times in quick succession, until eventually the bullish type of cross won out and lead to the 2021 bull run, which could be the case here. It now remains to be seen whether the two MAs will continue to diverge in the coming weeks, or if they will converge again and form the reverse type of crossover.

In the past 24 hours, there has not been much progress in the price movement. Similarly, the weekly chart shows that Ethereum has not made significant price advancements during this timeframe. The technical outlook for ETH is bearish, with indications of falling demand and accumulation. This suggests a lack of enthusiasm from buyers since Ethereum started trading sideways. The altcoin has been consolidating below an important resistance level, which, if successfully surpassed, could pave the way for a potential recovery. Related Reading: Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Break Free From Limbo? Market Awaits Bullish Catalyst Furthermore, ETH has formed a pattern that suggests the possibility of a bullish breakout in the near future. However, it’s important to note that for Ethereum to reverse its declining price trend, it will require broader market support. The market capitalization of Ethereum has declined, indicating an increasing dominance of sellers. This suggests that selling pressure has been mounting. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) was priced at $1,819. After surpassing the resistance level at $1,800, Ethereum has struggled to maintain a clear price direction. The next significant resistance for the coin is at $1,822, and if this level is surpassed, there is a possibility of Ethereum attempting to breach $1,840. Currently, ETH is displaying a downward wedge pattern, which is considered a bullish formation and suggests a potential price reversal in the future. However, if ETH falls from its current level, it could reach $1,800 and potentially even dip below $1,790. The trading volume of Ethereum in the last session has also declined, indicating a decrease in buying strength. But this could also point toward fatigue among sellers. Technical Analysis The recent price decline has placed ETH buyers in a negative zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that sellers currently outnumber buyers, as it is below the half-line. Furthermore, ETH has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, suggesting a lack of demand and indicating that sellers are driving the market’s price momentum. However, if there is a slight increase in demand, it could enable ETH to surpass the next resistance level, which would strengthen the position of buyers in the market. ETH price movement remains negative, consistent with other technical indicators. The Directional Movement Index shows a negative trend, with the -DI line (orange) positioned above the +DI line (blue).

Origin said that its OETH can be stacked on top of native staking rewards to boost rewards for holders. The token is the latest in a long list of staked ether derivative tokens in what is quickly becoming a crowded and competitive market.  OETH holders can earn trading fees and token rewards through DeFi protocols Curve and Convex. Origin holds a significant amount of curve (CRV) and convex (CVX) tokens, allowing the protocol to boost yields through rewards tokens that are emitted to liquidity providers.  Users can mint OETH by depositing ether (ETH) or liquid staking derivative (LSD) collaterals including staked ether (stETH) and frax ether (rxETH) – tokens issued by Lido and Frax Finance which offer yields to their holders if they stake their ether tokens. OETH will earn rewards immediately directly in the user’s wallet.  Through OETH’s positive rebasing mechanism, yield is generated at least once per day directly in holders’ wallets in the form of additional units of OETH with no gas fees required.  “OETH is designed for people who want access to the highest yields available in DeFi without any of the hassles typically associated with yield-farming,” explained Josh Fraser, co-founder of Origin Protocol, in an emailed statement.  “With OETH, you can earn an additional yield on top of the native staking yield that is available from trusted liquid staking derivatives without wasting hundreds of dollars maintaining your position,” Fraser added.  Beyond traditional DeFi lending strategies, a core strategy of OETH is to gain exposure to a diversified set of staking derivatives, which are used to earn ether validator rewards. The underlying collateral will be paired with ether and provided as liquidity to various Curve pools to further boost yields for users.

12688726,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533222,1684251610,"Japan Loses 30% Of Total Crypto Hacks In North Korea, Elliptic Reports","Japan has emerged with the highest losses worldwide from North Korean cyberattacks targeting crypto exchanges, as recent reports indicate that Japan’s financial institutions and individuals incurred approximately 30% of the total losses attributed to North Korean crypto hacking. The Japanese government has been particularly vocal about the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures to combat these malicious activities. But despite ongoing efforts to bolster their defenses, Japanese exchanges have been a primary target, suffering substantial financial losses and tarnishing the country’s reputation as a secure hub for digital assets. Japan’s 30% Crypto Losses The Elliptic report from a leading blockchain analytics firm, Nikkei, reveals that Japan suffered a staggering $721 million in losses, accounting for about 30% of the total amount hacked globally. The numbers were culled from hacks that occurred between 2017 and 2022, reaching a total amount of $2.3 billion. Notably, in 2022 alone, the digital asset ecosystem lost an estimated $640 million worth of cryptocurrency. A Reuters report from the United Nations revealed that digital currency theft exploits in North Korea hit a new high in 2022. The report also showed that the second most-attacked nation was Vietnam, losing approximately $540 million within the same period. Related Reading: Ledger Scam: Scammers Mail Hacked Ledger Devices To Steal Crypto The United States was the third nation on the list, and Hong Kong came out in fourth place, with $497 million and $281 million losses, respectively. Meanwhile, the Elliptic findings shed light on the vulnerability of the Japanese cryptocurrency market, including that of the Vietnamese. It noted that both markets have lax security measures, making it an attractive target for hackers seeking to exploit weaknesses and gain illicit access to digital assets. The significant losses incurred by Japan reflect the growing threat posed by North Korean hacking groups, which have increasingly targeted cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms worldwide. Notable Exploits From North Korea’s Lazarus Group The Lazarus Group is believed to act on behalf of the North Korean regime to bypass international sanctions and fund illicit activities. This group has orchestrated some of the most significant exploits in the cryptocurrency world, with the Ronin Bridge exploit and the Harmony Bridge hack among their audacious heists. Related Reading: DOJ Crypto Task Force Goes After DeFi Hackers As Illicit Activity Soars Meanwhile, North Korean hackers have also been engaging in the theft of Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But their criminal activities didn’t stop there. They demonstrated a remarkably sophisticated strategy for laundering their ill-gotten gains. They employed decentralized crypto mixers and finance services to launder the origins of the stolen funds, making it incredibly challenging to trace their illicit activities. This method allowed them to convert the stolen cryptocurrency into untraceable forms, further complicating any attempts to recover the stolen assets.

12687843,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533164,1684249209,"PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment","Here’s how the growth in PEPE has so far compared with that of its predecessor meme coins: Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). PEPE’s Peak Trading Volume Hasn’t Been Near DOGE Or SHIB’s Yet Pepe Coin, a token based on the popular internet frog meme avatar, suddenly burst into the scene last month. The coin has enjoyed a rapid rise in popularity, with its best period coming in the first week of this month, where it registered a price increase of more than 1,000%. Since this amazing rally earlier in the month, however, the cryptocurrency has seemed to have run out of steam. Nonetheless, market participants have still been wondering about the long-term prospects of the coin, as the meme coin has been looked at as the next big thing after DOGE and SHIB. But cab PEPE really compare with these top two meme coins by market cap? In its latest insight, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has compared a couple of metrics between these three assets, to see where PEPE stands against them. The first indicator of interest here is the “trading volume,” which is a measure of the daily total amount of a given cryptocurrency that’s being transacted on the blockchain. Here is a chart that highlights how the trading volume for PEPE has looked recently, as well as the behavior the indicator showed during the respective peaks of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have been quite small for PEPE in comparison to the others | Source: Santiment As displayed in the above graph, PEPE has observed a peak trading volume of $2 billion so far, which is quite sizeable in isolation, but when compared to what Dogecoin and Shiba Inu saw during their best periods, the spike appears very small. Naturally, these humongous spikes in DOGE’s and SHIB’s trading volumes occurred only later in the lifetimes of the assets, while the frog is still very much in its infancy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Active Addresses Sharply Decline Despite Transaction Demand, Why? “Although PEPE’s trading volume is significantly lower, it leaves room for growth and untapped potential,” explains Santiment. “However, it also means that the liquidity and retail participation in the market for PEPE is far less than what DOGE and SHIB experienced in previous years. In fact, it seems the retail landscape has changed dramatically, with retail participation appearing nearly nonexistent,” the on-chain data aggregator added. The other metric of relevance here is the “social volume,” which tells us about the degree of discussions that a certain cryptocurrency is receiving on social media platforms. The below chart shows the trend in this indicator for the three meme coins: DOGE's volumes seem to have been the largest out of the three | Source: Santiment In terms of discussions happening on Twitter, PEPE has actually been on par with DOGE and SHIB during their peak periods. “However, when it comes to mainstream media coverage, PEPE falls short,” notes the analytics firm. “While DOGE was discussed on national television, PEPE remains primarily confined to the realm of crypto Twitter.” Related Reading: Has Bitcoin Rally Already Hit Top? Here’s What Puell Multiple Says Based on the fact that retail engagement and mainstream attention have been low for the coin, Santiment has concluded that while the frog-based meme coin could have the potential for further growth, it’s unlikely that it touches the same height as its predecessors. PEPE Price At the time of writing, PEPE is trading around $0.00000167, down 16% in the last week.

12686930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533197,1684246809,Ripple CTO Reveals Facts About Present XRP Burn Debate,"The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple, David Schwartz, has provided valuable information about the ongoing debate surrounding the burning of XRP tokens. The debate about burning XRP tokens has been hot within the XRP community, and Schwartz’s insights shed light on the XRPL’s governance structure and the decentralized nature of the network. The discussion primarily revolved around the authority and decision-making process concerning the XRP held in escrow and the role of validators on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Burn Debate Insight From Schwartz Schwartz highlighted the importance of understanding the fundamental principles and mechanisms behind the XRPL. He explained that the XRPL operates on a consensus protocol where validators, distributed across the network, play a crucial role in maintaining the ledger’s integrity. And validators are responsible for verifying transactions and reaching a consensus on the XRPL. Related Reading: Ledger Scam: Scammers Mail Hacked Ledger Devices To Steal Crypto Regarding the burning of XRP tokens, Schwartz emphasized that the XRPL’s design does not include a built-in mechanism for burning XRP. The CTO also stated that changes to the XRPL’s code are governed by a decentralized process, ensuring that all participants have a voice in determining the network’s future. So altering the XRPL’s code to incorporate such a feature would require extensive consensus and agreement from the majority of validators, around 80%. One of the key points raised during the conversation was the claim made by an XRP community member, suggesting that the XRPL would become a permissioned network if validators had the power to determine the fate of the XRP in escrow. This statement sparked a significant amount of discussion within the XRP community, as the decentralized nature of the XRPL has always been a critical aspect of its design. Regarding that, Schwartz clarified that while validators play a crucial role in the XRPL’s consensus process, the network’s nodes can accept or decline amendments voted into effect by validators. This system ensures that the power to influence the fate of the XRP held in escrow is not concentrated solely within the validators’ hands. Instead, it allows for a decentralized decision-making process that considers the perspectives and interests of various participants. XRP Price Dips In Recent Days Amid the discussion in the community, the token’s price has experienced a minor decline in recent trading sessions. Over the past seven days, XRP’s price has seen a marginal decrease of 0.56%, indicating a relatively stable trend. Within the past 24 hours, the coin has witnessed a slight downward movement, with a decline of 1.36%. This modest dip reflects the current volatility in the token market.

The fundraise amount is notable during an extended bear market that has seen a slow down of investments, in even crypto-adjacent companies.  Founded in 2022, Auradine is developing a broad range of infrastructure across hardware and software, including energy-efficient silicon, zero-knowledge proofs (a blockchain-based privacy tool) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for decentralized applications. The funding round was led by venture capital firms Celesta Capital and Mayfield. As part of the investment, Celesta’s Sriram Viswanathan and Mayfield’s Navin Chaddha will join the Auradine board.  ""The Auradine team of bold entrepreneurs are building a web infrastructure platform that will enable a new era of decentralized and distributed applications,"" said Chaddha, managing director at Mayfield, in the press release. ""We are excited to serve as an inception investor on their journey to leverage AI, blockchain, and privacy technologies to help create an industry leader.""  Publicly traded Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) was also among the backers. Marathon revealed in its third quarter financial report that it owned $35.5 million of Auradine preferred stock as of September. An Auradine spokesperson confirmed that figure was included in the $81 million total. Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel is also on the startup’s board of directors, according to the company website.  Other investors in the round included Cota Capital, DCVC, and Stanford University.  Auradine has deep ties to traditional technology companies. CEO and co-founder Rajiv Khemani previously served as chief operating officer at semiconductor firm Cavium, COO and co-founder Barun Kar was a senior vice president of engineering at cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks.

Roman Regelman, the CEO of securities services and digital, revealed in a recent interview that the bank has been prioritizing digital assets for the past two years in response to increasing client demand. This latest disclosure comes amid the US banking crisis and United States regulators’ continuous crackdown on the crypto industry, a sector of the global digital asset market. Notably, yesterday, the US Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) responded to Coinbase’s complaint saying crypto rulemaking may take years and that it is “in no rush.” BNY Mellon Embraces Digital Asset Including Crypto? While BNY Mellon did not explicitly mention cryptocurrencies as part of its digital asset focus, the American Banker reported on the bank’s prudent motion into the crypto-verse. CEO Robin Vince, during the bank’s first-quarter earnings call, highlighted the bank’s meticulous and methodical approach, characterizing their progress as being “exceptionally slow.” Related Reading: US Banking Crisis Worsens With Half Of America’s Banks On the Verge Of Failure To demonstrate its commitment to digital assets, BNY Mellon is actively pursuing three key initiatives. This includes actively expanding its services to include custody and clearing solutions for digital assets, with the aim of diversifying its offerings and accommodating a wider range of asset classes. Regelman revealed the bank’s vision for digital assets going forward, saying that “Everything that we do, we want to do for digital assets.” BNY Mellon is also placing significant emphasis on the adoption of blockchain technology and other innovative advancements to modernize its infrastructure. This decision is aimed at improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and enabling real-time capabilities across the bank’s systems. Another initiative the 240-year-old bank is planning to pursue is actively exploring the concept of tokenization as a strategy to democratize investment opportunities. By embracing tokenization, the bank seeks to unlock new avenues for investors and enable broader access to alternative asset classes, fostering a more inclusive investment ecosystem. Leading the Digital Transformation in Financial Services By embracing long-term digital asset initiatives across all lines of business, BNY Mellon appears to be positioning itself as a leader in the financial industry’s digital transformation. As the demand for digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and innovative technologies continues to rise, the bank’s strategic focus on distributed ledger technology, tokenization, and digital cash highlights its commitment to meeting the evolving needs of its clients and staying at the forefront of financial innovation. Related Reading: Crypto Firms Should Ditch Banks To De-risk From Volatile Systems, Says Cardano Founder It is worth noting that BNY Mellon’s gradual approach to the crypto realm reflects the cautious stance adopted by other traditional financial institutions. Recently, Investment bank JPMorgan announced that it will launch trial applications on blockchain technology to offer dollar-based settlement services. Meanwhile, following the news, BNY Mellon’s stock price hasn’t made any significant movement, however, it has recorded a few gains in the past day up by 1.3%. BNY Mellon currently trades at $40.70 at the time of writing.

However, contrary to what many may assume, this could be a red flag for Bitcoin (BTC) and the entire cryptocurrency market. According to a Bloomberg report, when an asset experiences an extended period of calm, it can be a sign of market euphoria and an overheated market. This raises concerns about the sustainability of the current market trend, especially in the context of the cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive deeper into what an overheated market means and how it could impact the king of cryptocurrencies and the market as a whole. Related Reading: Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Break Free From Limbo? Market Awaits Bullish Catalyst PEPE And The Implications Of An Overheated Market As reported by Bloomberg, the current market behavior of PEPE is causing concerns for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, particularly for Bitcoin. This is due to the fact that the rise of PEPE was accompanied by a surge in speculative trading and a frenzy of buying activity, which could indicate market euphoria. Coinciding with this, the alpha coin has experienced a drop in value and a period of consolidation. When the market becomes overheated, it means that the prices of assets have risen to an unsustainable level, fueled by excessive optimism and speculation. In such a scenario, investors tend to overlook the fundamental value of the assets and focus more on the potential for quick profits. Pepecoin (PEPE) has recently demonstrated an unexpected degree of stability in its price fluctuations. Image: Earth.com This results in a significant increase in demand, which drives up the prices further, creating a bubble that is bound to burst at some point. In an overheated market, the prices of assets are often overinflated and do not reflect their true value. This creates a risk of a sharp correction, which could result in significant losses for investors who have overvalued their investments. Moreover, such a correction could lead to a chain reaction that could affect the entire market, causing panic selling and further price drops. PEPE’s Correction, BTC’s Struggles Emphasize Asset Valuations In Volatile Markets The report noted that the current drawdown in the cryptocurrency market has impacted investors’ ability to chase opportunities with other assets. This means that investors are becoming more cautious and less willing to take risks, as they recognize the potential risks of an overheated market. Despite PEPE’s impressive 2,8931% hike in the last 30 days, it has since corrected, indicating that investors are starting to be more mindful of market fundamentals. PEPE’s price on CoinGecko currently sits at a measly $0.00000169, having undergone a 24-hour slump of 2.7% and a seven-day decline of 11.5%. Meanwhile, BTC is currently priced at $27,207.23, experiencing a 24-hour slump of 0.8% and a seven-day decline of 1.9%, highlighting its recent struggles in maintaining its upward momentum. BTCUSD may - or may not - drop below $27K, as shown here. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: PEPE Outperforms Bitcoin In Social Media Buzz, Triggers Bullish Run For Frog Coin The current behavior of PEPE and the decline of BTC serve as a reminder of the potential risks that come with overvaluing assets and ignoring fundamental values. As the crypto market continues to evolve and attract more investors, it is essential to maintain a realistic perspective on asset valuations and not be swayed by market euphoria. By doing so, investors can protect themselves from potential losses and contribute to a more sustainable and stable market in the long run.

That's the message from bitcoin's realized price, which appears on track to exceed the realized price of long-term holders.

The company will “use the resources to further develop its liquid staking protocol, add top talent to the team and onboard decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts to its platform,” according to a press release. The project is led by co-founders Justin Garland and Hannah Hamilton.  The market for liquid staking derivatives is dominated by Lido, which has about $12.4 billion of “total value” or collateral locked in, according to DeFiLlama.

42410749,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgoyk,1684242000,Endaoment Expands Web3 Charitable Fundraising Efforts With GlobalGiving Partnership,"On-chain charitable funding platform Endaoment has teamed up with international non-profit network GlobalGiving to grow its directory of nonprofits that will accept cryptocurrency and NFT-derived donations.  According to a press release, this partnership has tripled the number of verified charitable organizations willing to accept digital assets, broadening the reach of digitally-native donors who want to contribute to social causes. In addition, donors can now make tax-deductible gifts using more than 1,000 digital currencies and assets to nonprofit organizations in Afghanistan, Japan, Australia and more.  GlobalGiving is 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in the U.S. that vets and connects other nonprofits with donors. Since 2002, they have raised $826 million from 1.7 million donors across 175 countries. With this partnership, Endaoment can expand its mission beyond U.S. borders for the first time since it launched in 2020 and adds GlobalGiving's approved organizations to its public Ethereum (ETH) address book of nonprofit endpoints.  Robbie Heeger, president and CEO of Endaoment, told CoinDesk that the partnership helps Endaoment bring trusted non-profits into its ecosystem while providing an easy onramp for crypto payments.  ""What's beautiful about partnering with GlobalGiving is not only are they another 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and not only do they have two decades of experience of doing international nonprofit grant making and due diligence, but they also have the existing connections to 80 different local currencies to pay out to these organizations,"" he said. ""It's really an opportunity for us to take the crypto toolset and bridge it to a broader global audience.""  For GlobalGiving, the partnership allows its community to gain exposure to blockchain technology and reach new donors.  ""It will allow organizations to receive resources from new donors that they haven't met before in a way that they can feel comfortable with because it's so immediately turned into cash,"" explained Victoria Vrana, CEO of GlobalGiving. ""It's tiptoeing into crypto without actually jumping in.""  Raising money for social causes using cryptocurrencies and NFTs has become more common in recent years. Other popular crypto donation platforms include The Giving Block, which uses U.S.-based centralized exchange Gemini to provide crypto funds to non-profits, and Givepact, which is considering new ways to allow donors to see and display their philanthropic history on-chain.  Read more: How Artists Can Raise Money for Social Causes With NFTs  Heeger said that Endaoment and GlobalGiving's partnership represents a ""meeting of the minds"" between a traditional fundraising platform and a Web3 non-profit built on trust.

""We're taking the industry-leading trust that people have come to rely on from GlobalGiving and marrying it with a first-of-its-kind trustless philanthropic platform that still gives you the technological benefits of trustlessness without putting into question the efficacy of your philanthropy,"" Heeger added.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/16/endaoment-expands-web3-charitable-fundraising-efforts-with-globalgiving-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78e569c0e412dcdd93bc9e2076eefeec109462f1-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fresh funding round is aimed at accelerating the adoption of Web3 technologies and supports the launch of a tokenomics accelerator program called Denarii Labs, a joint initiative with Horizen Labs Ventures. This program will focus on advisory services, weekly educational sessions, mentorship, launch support and more for those launching token projects.  The accelerator is currently accepting applications for its inaugural cohort, slated to begin the third quarter of this year, and each company will receive $100,000 to build its brand.  Red Beard Ventures launched as a syndicate of startup accelerator AngelList in 2019 by founder and managing partner Drew Austin. It has invested in 192 companies, including NBA Top Shot parent Dapper Labs, metaverse platform The Sandbox and data aggregator CryptoSlam, deploying more than $40 million in capital. The company has found success in Web3, though it also invests in projects related to space exploration, climate science, robotics, AI, fintech and biotech.  ""I've been on the other side of this,"" Austin told CoinDesk. ""I've been a founder since I was 19. So I'm used to raising money.""  The goal of the new fund is to interact with early-stage projects in the areas of decentralized protocols, novel blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 gaming infrastructure, which Austin believes will be the ""accelerant"" for mass adoption.  ""I think it's going to bring an exponentially greater audience than we've seen from NFTs and DeFi,"" he said. ""Those people are going to have expectations of better infrastructure, more scalable infrastructure, better user experiences, better on-ramping, interoperability across chains – there's just a lot of stuff that still needs to be done.""  Austin said his success as an investor is tied to his early interest in projects across NFTs, DeFi and blockchain technology and from his personal journey as a digital art collector.  ""I'm a collector, I'm a builder, and the fun thing is that I get to like see this space from so many different angles,"" he said.  ""It's been a really unique competitive advantage,"" he added.

12684280,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533172,1684240252,Is This Latest Ledger Firmware Update A Disaster In The Making?,"Ledger, the hardware wallet provider, recently upgraded its firmware to version 2.2.1. They introduced an additional safety net called the “Ledger Recover” that the crypto community is vehemently rejecting. While upgrades are critical considering the fast-paced nature of cryptocurrencies, Ledger is now being criticized after offering an option for users to store their seed phrases online. The hardware wallet manufacturer said this feature makes it easier for users to quickly recover their seed phrases in case they misplace them. The “Ledger Recover” Feature Rejected The subscription-based service called “Ledger Recover” effectively grants the manufacturer access to clients’ seed phrases; defeating the purpose of using a cold wallet in the first place. Related Reading: DOJ Crypto Task Force Goes After DeFi Hackers As Illicit Activity Soars The platform says Recover is an “ID-based key recovery service that provides backup” for seed phrases for coins like Bitcoin. Earlier, Ledger’s co-founder said Recover will split a seed phrase into three shards. A section is distributed to Ledger, Coincover — a crypto custody firm, and EscrowTech, a company that escrows codes. Therefore, if a user loses access to their cold wallet by misplacing their private key, two of the three custodians can combine their code to recover the wallet’s contents. While this could help, as it is designed, a cold or hardware wallet is non-custodial. Technically, it should be delinked from the internet. By default, Ledger wallet holders should always be responsible for their seed phrases. Seed phrases allow users to sign transactions confirming that they are the true owners. Whenever they are misplaced, the token owner losses access to all their coins. Although the “Ledger Recover” feature is a precaution, some even claim this move makes Ledger a “hot” wallet. A hot wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet connected to the internet and is often the target of nefarious agents. Whenever hackers strike, they aim to wipe clean assets stored in hot wallets like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet. KYC Requirements And Learning From The Past Besides Ledger requiring access to private keys, the “Recover” feature demands that users verify their identity as part of the know-your-customer (KYC) rules. As part of this verification and compliance with KYC, users must submit their government-issued cards. Critics say this is against the principles of crypto that work toward preserving privacy and diffusing power from one entity. Related Reading: Ledger Scam: Scammers Mail Hacked Ledger Devices To Steal Crypto Trusting private identity documents to a centralized entity can be disastrous. In 2020, Ledger’s database was compromised, and hackers dumped hundreds of thousands of wallet buyers’ confidential information, including physical addresses.

Optimism Upgrading Via Bedrock In Early June The layer-2 provider on Ethereum says the release is “highly anticipated” by the community and will introduce some changes that make the protocol even more scalable, reducing transaction fees. Related Reading: Arbitrum, Optimism, And Polygon: Which Is The Ultimate Ethereum L2? As it is, Optimism offers an off-chain, general-purpose platform where users can deploy smart contracts and launch decentralized applications (DApps) in a low-cost, highly scalable, and secure environment. Optimism uses roll-ups and bundles transactions before confirming them on the Ethereum mainnet. This move relieves the mainnet, helping reduce fees by re-routing demand to an off-chain solution. According to Optimism, Bedrock will be a hard fork. It means validators will have to update to the latest version. Optimism’s documentation reads that “the network will retain the same chain ID, transaction history, and state. The first block of the new network will be the last block of the old network +1.” These changes that come with the Bedrock hard fork will improve scalability, usability, and security. For instance, the developer of the layer-2 protocol says there will be better Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence since, even after the upgrade, Optimism will remain compatible with the base layer, that is, Ethereum. Accordingly, users will continue deploying smart contracts as before the upgrade. The Bedrock upgrade will introduce a new two-step withdrawal process to the Optimism Mainnet bridge that will improve its security & make exploits much more difficult🫡 One of the architects of two-step withdrawals, @vex_0x, explains how⬇️https://t.co/qs6Dtsz2nO — OP Labs (@OPLabsPBC) March 22, 2023 Moreover, Bedrock introduces a new fee structure that makes fees more predictable and efficient. Overly, developers expect transfer or smart contracts deployment fees to drop. Presently, L2fees data shows that simple transfers on Optimism cost $0.30. Meanwhile, swapping tokens will cost $0.45. On the security angle, Bedrock introduces a 2-step withdrawal process and a more robust sequencer. With a better sequencer, developers hope user funds will be better protected. At the same time, there will be better usability with the introduction of the Optimism Portal, allowing for easy cross-domain messaging. OP Prices Down 50% From Q1 2023 Highs, Will Bulls Flow Back? Despite all these changes, it remains to be seen whether OP, the native token of Optimism, will rise. As of writing on May 16, the token is down nearly 50% from February 2023 high. However, considering gains in Q1 2023 formation, the OP uptrend remains. Still, traders need more signals before committing. In recent days, OP has been trending lower, breaking below the critical support level in early May. Whether OP bears will press on will be seen in the sessions ahead. Even so, what’s clear is that OP prices have been stagnating, finding support at 1.64.

12683031,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4604964-iris-energy-reasonable-renewable-play-on-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1684237118,Iris Energy: The Reasonable And Renewable Play On Bitcoin,"Summary Largest Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner using 100% renewable energy. Efficient facilities and professional management team. Significant cash generation & margins, strong balance sheet & no debt. IREN stock is materially undervalued versus peers. Value creation catalyst in upcoming capacity expansion and potential alternate uses for data centers if cryptocurrencies collapse again. The Basic Thesis Anyone who has followed my writing knows that I am not a fan of most Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency plays. To the extent one wants exposure to cryptocurrencies, I believe companies like Coinbase ( COIN ) and MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) are horrendous and inefficient pathways with bad business models, sketchy balance sheets, and worse management teams. I also have had a generally healthy skepticism of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), no surprise for a value and credit guy. That said, if the first rule of investing is ""Don't lose money"" and the second is ""Don't forget rule #1"", the third is ""stay humble and open-minded."" Bitcoin has had an awful lot thrown at it and is still around. Since I do not intend to abandon my short views on COIN and MSTR, a long on the other side is almost necessary. Fortunately, Iris Energy is a play on Bitcoin with good core economics, a solid balance sheet, top-notch management, and downside protection from asset flexibility. Iris Energy ( IREN ) is the largest Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner using 100% renewable energy. It provides an attractive “data center” exposure to the Bitcoin theme by combining: leading high-efficiency data centers designed and built in-house operations powered by low-cost, excess renewable energy. These virtues lead to ~$200m high margin illustrative annualized mining profit in the current market (revenue minus assumed mining pool fees) and low assumed electricity costs ($0.045/kWh is based on existing BC operations). Together these advantages mean significant expected cash generation on top of a strong balance sheet ($55m cash, no debt) and a low-risk growth opportunity. Iris Bitcoin Mining Assets Iris Energy currently has three operating sites in British Columbia, Canada (Canal Flats, Mackenzie and Prince George) and one site recently completed in Childress, Texas, which currently supports 5.5 Exa Hash/second (or 180MW) of computing power. For the uninitiated, you can find an explanation of exa hash and hashrate here . Iris Energy builds and operates its own proprietary data centers, providing long-term security and operational control over its assets. The Company’s facilities are regularly ranked amongst the most efficient in the industry in terms of uptime. The company recently announced an additional plan for 1.0 EH/s near-term expansion at its Childress site without raising any additional capital. This will put Iris as the 4 th largest self-miner in the world. Site Capacity (MW) Capacity (EH/s) Status Canal Flats (BC, Canada) 30 0.8 Operating Mackenzie (BC, Canada) 80 2.5 Operating Prince George (BC, Canada) 50 1.6 Operating Total (BC, Canada) 160 4.9 Childress (Texas, USA) 20 0.6 Operating Total (Canada & USA) 180 5.5 Childress (Texas, USA) 600 ~18 Additional expansion capacity Iris Energy Advantage Iris Energy has used 100% renewable energy since its inception. The Company targets markets with low-cost, excess renewable energy where its operations can help solve energy market challenges (e.g. contributing to lower power prices in regulated energy markets such as British Columbia or shedding load to support deregulated energy markets with high penetration of intermittent renewables such as Texas). Not only does this strategy give Iris cheap energy, it also helps mitigate potential regulatory and/or political risks associated with its operations. Iris Energy’s cost of power for its BC operations as of March 2023 was ~$0.045/kWh (or ~$11.5k per Bitcoin vs. current spot price at the time of this writing of ~$26k/coin). Importantly, the Company’s cost of power in BC is reviewed and fixed on a 12-month basis, providing certainty across its projects. The Company recently disclosed that as part of BC Hydro’s annual rate review, its all-in unit cost of power was expected to increase by ~2% for the fiscal year commencing April 1, 2023 (i.e. an increase of ~$0.001/kWh). The company also has low-risk and near-term growth opportunities at its Childress site (600MW of potential expansion capacity). It has made significant upfront investments in key infrastructure (such as the 600MW bulk power substation and the first 100MW primary substation) which provides the ability to rapidly and efficiently scale beyond the Company’s initial 20MW data center. The Childress site bulk power station is connected to the ERCOT grid, allowing real-time access to spot prices in the energy market. To fully utilize that connection, the Company has an integrated proprietary data center design with engineering and technology that rapidly change power demand, cooling system, and miner load – effectively maximizing cost per kWH. Childress Power Optimization (Iris Energy Q1 Presentation) Significant cash generation and margins The Company’s 5.5 EH/s of capacity can generate strong cash flows in the current market with upside leverage to increases in Bitcoin's price. I'll also note here that Iris Energy has a non-HODL strategy (it liquidates all Bitcoin mined daily). This strategy provides a lower risk, “cash flow” exposure to Bitcoin. Bitcoin price (US$) $20,000 $30,000 $40,000 $50,000 Revenue $107mm $160mm $213mm $266mm Mining profit $40mm $93mm $146mm $199mm Site & corporate costs $24mm $24mm $24mm $24mm Iris plans to add an incremental capacity of 1.0 EH/s of miners at its Childress site in Texas, which would obviously increase the numbers above. Childress currently has 20MW of operating capacity with near-term plans to add an additional 20MW. The company estimates the 1.0EH expansion will require ~$35mm of CapEx spending. Given that the company has $55mm of cash plus strong operating cash flow, it can fund its near-term expansion without additional capital. Most other miners, such as Marathon ( MARA ), do not have this ability. Moreover, management speaks repeatedly that any future growth capex would have to be accretive nearly day one. Therefore, I will assume that should any growth opportunities arose that could not be funded internally, the same accretive hurdle would apply to any debt and/or equity funding. Valuation and Comps Iris Energy is positioned favourably when compared to its listed peers across key metrics, including: power source (100% renewable energy) geographic diversification efficiency (BTC mined per EH/s installed). Despite these advantages, the Company continues to trade at a material discount compared to its peers on both an EV/EH and EV/EBITDA basis, which vary widely between comps. IREN Marathon Digital ( MARA ) Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) CleanSpark ( CLSK ) Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 100% renewables Yes No No No No No Geographies Canada, USA USA USA USA Canada, USA USA Efficiency (BTC per EH/s) 113 83 77 108 89 81 Hashrate (EH/s) 5.5 11.5 10.5 6.7 2.6 5.7 NTM Est'd EBITDA ($mm) 26 169 84 69 n/a n/a EV ($mm) 162 2,102 1,693 505 539 516 Multiple (EV/EH) 29 182 161 75 206 90.5 Multiple (EV/EBITDA) 6.3 12.5 20.1 7.3 n/a n/a Management Unlike COIN, whose management is in a tiff with the SEC, and MSTR whose management is running away from a garbage software business by throwing a crazy leveraged hail Mary on Bitcoin, Iris Energy is led by a seasoned management team with an impressive track record of success across renewables, infrastructure, and digital assets, having delivered tens of billions of energy and infrastructure projects globally. The Company’s founders, board, and management own approximately 23% of the Company's shares, promoting long-term alignment of interest. Risks The main risk with any cryptocurrency-tied company is the decline in values of coins. I believe that Iris mines Bitcoin profitably down to ~$18,000/coin. However, because Iris has such modern and energy-efficient operations, it could convert those facilities to other uses, such as data centers, if Bitcoin prices plummeted significantly below $20,000 and stayed there. Management has never given a concrete number of what that transition would cost, but the balance sheet should give them the flexibility to execute an alternate use. Another alternative could be selling their facilities to another company for use as a data center. One more risk is that the company goes against what they have indicated about accretive versus dilutive equity. Any equity (or debt for that matter) that was seen as dilutive (short or long term) could knock the stock down. Ultimately, I think management is highly unlikely to a dilutive offering of any kind, but miners often need capital and a potential offering that is or could be perceived as dilutive is a risk everyone should be aware of. Conclusion As I said at the beginning of this piece, my main issue with cryptocurrencies is finding a reasonable way to invest in them. In my opinion, Iris Energy provides an attractive approach. It has a liquid, net-cash balance sheet and a significant real asset base that generates cash flow mining Bitcoin down to ~$18,000/coin, in my estimates. The Company’s leading high-efficiency data centers and renewable energy strategy are key differentiators from its listed peers, as is its ability to convert to data centers if Bitcoin mining disappears. The imminent installation of the Company’s 6.5 EH/s of capacity and low-risk, near-term growth opportunity at Childress (600MW of potential expansion capacity) are also positive catalysts. I think Iren can easily double from here and perhaps much more when one looks at the valuations of comps. It is an excellent long against Coinbase and MicroStrategy or other miners. That said, all positions in cryptocurrencies are inherently extremely volatile and speculative. Consider the stock's volatility plus that of Bitcoin and the lack of testing of long-term value of cryptocurrencies before making any investment, long or short.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4604964-iris-energy-reasonable-renewable-play-on-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12683031.jpeg

With this, Yakovenko addresses the problem that a large portion of all meme coins are scams and rug pulls that have a pre-mine in favor of the “inventors.” Meme-Coins Should Be Treated Like A Lottery: Solana Co-Founder The Solana co-founder compares meme coins to a lottery ticket, implying that they bring no value, but are only for making a quick buck. “In the best light possible, maybe meme coins are like zero loss lotteries,” Yakovenko said. To make distribution fairer for all participants so that not only insiders and whales benefit, the Solana developer suggests that marketplaces listing meme coins should coordinate completely fair launches with no fees. This could prevent scam versions from popping up and constantly draining user liquidity. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Drops But It’s Too Early to Say Bulls Have Given Up In response to a Twitter user’s comment that 99.999% of meme coins are scams that are difficult to distinguish, Yakovenko suggested the creation of a “fair list.” The latter could use certain heuristics to identify active users and distribute the coin without premise. The Solana co-founder explained: Come up with a “fair” list that uses some heuristics to identify active users and distribute the coin without any premise. One group of researchers could do the analysis and publish the list, and anyone can use it to launch. Nevertheless, there were some criticisms of the Solana founder’s proposal. For example, users pointed out that there is a risk that the list would be fairly easy to manipulate, as the integrity of the list would be compromised after initial deployment through airdrop farming and the like. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Retests Multi-Month Trend Line, Bulls Prevailing Again? However, the Solana co-founder argued that it doesn’t see a problem with this until there is a chain identity. In addition, users expressed concern about the vesting of contributors. However, the Solana founder argued that despite the possible lack of direct incentives for coin creators, the marketplaces themselves would benefit from the integration of these fair launch coins. Still, the Solana founder’s final word was a warning: Fair launch auction to start and everyone should expect it to go to zero eventually. That’s the point, treat it as a zero loss lottery. SOL Price Trapped Below Trendline At press time, the SOL price traded at $20.91 and was trapped below the trendline (black) that was breached to the downside on May 6. For now, SOL needs to hold the support at the 23,6% Fibonacci retracement level. If successful, it can attack the trendline and the 200-day EMA which are about to cross (at roughly $24.5).

12680428,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533121,1684230008,Buy Arbitrum Now? ARB Price Displays Relative Strength,"The token of the layer-2 solution Arbitrum, ARB, is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies within the top 100 by market cap over the past seven days. With a gain of 8.5% despite the heavy drawdown in the broader crypto market, the Arbitrum token records the fifth highest price gain over the last week. Arbitrum Token Shows Relative Strength Looking at the ARB / BTC chart (2-hour) shows that the Arbitrum token is one of the few altcoins that has recently shown strength against Bitcoin. If BTC sees a rise towards $30,000, it is generally advisable to look for the altcoins that show relative strength at the moment and ARB is definitely one of them. In the 2-hour chart, ARB/BTC is writing higher highs and higher lows since Monday, May 8. Currently, ARB/BTC needs to break above the 0.00004477 level to continue the trend. If this is successful, stronger resistance at 0.00004620 can be expected. But, a successful breach would be an extremely bullish signal. The 4-hour chart of ARB/USD shows that the price was once again rejected at the 23.8% Fibonacci level at $1.22. This resistance is crucial for ARB at the moment. In order to maintain the uptrend, the price level must be cleared, otherwise a renewed fall towards $1.05 could be on the cards. Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB) Surges Nearly 10% In The Past 24 Hours, Here’s Why If a breakout succeeds, the zone between $1.30 and the 38.2% Fibonacci at $1.33 would come into focus. Strong resistance can also be expected at $1.42, where the 50% Fibonacci retracement level is located. Renowned Crypto Traders Are Bullish On ARB One of the analysts who is bullish on ARB is popular crypto trader @DaanCrypto. The analyst points to the high on-chain transaction volume on Arbitrum, where the layer-2 ranks only behind Ethereum and BSC. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the fully diluted market caps of ARB, MATIC, SOL, OP and AVAX are relatively close to each other, according to the analyst, while the circulating supply is quite different. According to Daan, ARB is still undervalued or less overvalued compared to the other protocols, such as Optimism (OP). Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB): Is A Major Price Rally Coming Now? One reason, in addition to ARB’s strong fundamentals, are the scheduled token unlocks: “This is important to note when you’re investing for the longer term. OP for example will be getting some bigger unlocks throughout the year while ARB won’t get any until March 2024”, says Daan, who concluded, “the unlocking schedule & adoption was a reason for me to open this pair trade between ARB & OP.” $ARB / $OP Pair Trade going strong. Well on it's way to my target of $ARB being 2x the Fully Diluted Valuation of $OP. https://t.co/uJSKilhc0u pic.twitter.com/z635BpCztr — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) May 15, 2023 Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, also shares this view. In mid-April, the notorious altcoin whale wrote that “Arbitrum is the fastest growing blue chip chain not yet valued at blue chip status and will rerate to be top of the alt L1/L2 stack.” His reasoning: When it comes to dApps with real value and innovation, Arbitrum dApps are at the forefront. “While these bullish conditions sustain this year, FDV [Fully Diluted Value] is a meme. Especially considering there are no major unlocks until next year,” added Kang.

42410746,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgoiD,1684227794,"Bitcoin-Ether Correlation Weakest Since 2021, Hints at Regime Change in Crypto Market","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the world's top two cryptocurrencies by market value, moved in tandem for much of 2022. That positive relationship has weakened this year, signaling an impending regime change in the market.  As of Monday, the 30-day rolling correlation between changes in bitcoin and ether prices was 77%, the lowest since 2021 and notably weaker than 96% seen two months ago, according to crypto data provider Kaiko.  Ether, in the past, has decoupled from bitcoin for brief periods. The latest weakening of correlation may be long-lasting, meaning bitcoin, the world's largest and most liquid digital asset, may no longer anchor ether and the broader market, according to Pulkit Goyal, Vice President of trading at OrBit Markets, an institutional liquidity provider of options and structured derivatives in digital assets.  ""What we are seeing could be the beginning of a long-term regime change. As Ethereum has shifted from PoW to PoS, the economics of supply and demand underlying the 2 tokens will continue to diverge,"" Goyal told CoinDesk.  ""Bitcoin will cement its status as the ""digital gold"" or a blue-chip stock while Ether will be seen as a growth stock or an emerging market,"" Goyal added.  Kaiko's latest weekly newsletter said voiced a similar opinion in the weekly newsletter, saying, ""Both BTC and ETH seem increasingly driven by divergent idiosyncratic factors.""  In September 2022, Ethereum, the world's largest smart contract blockchain, transitioned from the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism of verifying transactions to the proof-of-stake setup. Recently, Ethereum implemented the Shapella upgrade, de-risking the passive investing strategy of locking or staking coins in the smart contract platform in return for rewards. The amount of ether burned by the network is closely tied to the degree of network usage.  Bitcoin, meanwhile, continues to be a macro asset, taking cues from inflation figures and expected changes in fiat liquidity and retaining its appeal as a hedge against traditional finance. Bitcoin's pace of supply expansion is halved every four years through a programmed process called mining reward halving. The fourth halving is due next year.  ""Post the transition to a proof-of-stake governance mechanism, it is possible that Ether is seen as a different asset class in the same sphere and this might change but for the time being, Bitcoin is more governed by macroeconomic factors and institutional investment while Ethereum although affected, might just be less correlated to the macroeconomic conditions for the better or worse,"" analysts at Bitfinex said in an email.  ""It's a good move for the crypto market, as these two assets can be viewed now from the perspective of price action as to different asset class, although in the same sphere,"" Bitfinex analysts added.  The decoupling between the two might boost trading activity in bitcoin-ether pairs listed on major exchanges, including Binance.  ""For traders, the decoupling could present new opportunities to capture the relative value between the 2 tokens without involving the dollar. In fact, demand for options in the BTC/ETH cross has picked up lately in the OTC space,"" Goyal said.

As the once frenzied sell pressure subsides, the market sees the bulls hesitating on the sidelines, uncertain of their next move. While DOGE’s price action continues to captivate the attention of both enthusiasts and skeptics alike, its current trajectory is influenced by a unique combination of factors. Retail accumulation has emerged as a significant force, driving the coin’s value amidst a backdrop of relatively low demand from whales. As the dog-themed digital asset navigates these shifting tides, its future remains bleak, leaving investors and observers eagerly speculating on what lies ahead for Dogecoin. Source: Santiment Dogecoin Supply Distribution And Market Expectations Dogecoin’s recent supply distribution analysis has shed light on the behavior of cryptocurrency holders. Since the beginning of May, addresses with smaller DOGE holdings have been steadily accumulating the meme-inspired digital currency. This accumulation has instilled hope among DOGE holders, who anticipated a significant rally during the latest meme coin season. Since the beginning of May, addresses with 100 million to 1 billion DOGE have been reducing their holdings. It was the second-largest group of whales overall, accounting for nearly 20% of the circulating supply. In line with these expectations, retail traders have actively participated in accumulating DOGE in the past few days, contributing to its overall demand. Despite its status as one of the pioneering meme coins, Dogecoin failed to secure a prominent position in the ongoing meme coin craze, which has captured the attention of the crypto community. However, while the accumulation trend among smaller DOGE holders points to a potential rise in its value, there has also been noteworthy sell pressure originating from some of the largest whales. This conflicting market behavior has created an environment of uncertainty for Dogecoin. Source: Coingecko As of the latest data from CoinGecko, DOGE is currently priced at $0.072314. Although the cryptocurrency has experienced a slight setback with a 1.2% slump in the past 24 hours and a 0.1% decrease over the past seven days, it remains to be seen how these market dynamics and the ongoing supply distribution will shape the future of Dogecoin. DOGE total market cap slightly above $10 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: PEPE Outperforms Bitcoin In Social Media Buzz, Triggers Bullish Run For Frog Coin Uncertainty Looms Over Dogecoin’s Future Despite recent indications of a potential shift in Dogecoin’s market dynamics, it’s important to note that the cryptocurrency has not yet become oversold. While smaller DOGE holders have been accumulating the digital currency, the level of buying pressure remains low. This leaves open the possibility of bears regaining control of the market. It’s still too early to determine which direction DOGE will move in the coming days and weeks. The balance between bullish and bearish forces is delicate, with both sides vying for dominance. While some investors are optimistic about the potential for a DOGE rally, others remain cautious. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

The EU’s Council, which represents 27 member states, unanimously approved the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), making the bloc set to be the first major jurisdiction in the world with a crypto licensing regime. It also agreed new anti-money laundering measures on crypto funds transfers.  “I am very pleased that today we are delivering on our promise to start regulating the crypto-assets sector. Recent events have confirmed the urgent need for imposing rules which will better protect Europeans who have invested in these assets, and prevent the misuse of crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism,"" said a statement from Elisabeth Svantesson, minister for finance of Sweden, who chaired the talks as Council Presidency.  Agreement to the laws was largely expected after ambassadors gave a green light to both MiCA and tax measures last week.  MiCA requires crypto firms such as wallet providers and exchanges to seek a license to operate across the bloc, and stablecoin issuers to hold suitable reserves. Its main features were politically agreed in June, but it’s been subject to administrative hold-ups. Major provisions take effect just over a year after it’s published in the bloc’s official journal, which is now likely in June or July.  Later in the day, ministers also agreed on new measures to force crypto providers to disclose details of their customers’ holdings to tax authorities, which will be shared within the bloc in a bid to avoid stashing funds in secret overseas wallets.  ""Crypto-assets and e-money have great potential to drive economic activity and innovation – but they also carry risks of reducing transparency and enabling tax evasion or fraud. Updating our tax rules to address these issues will help national administrations to collect tax more efficiently and keep up with evolving technology as Europe moves forward with its digital transition,"" Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice-president for an Economy that Works for People, said in a statement.  The new tax rules, known as DAC8, were proposed by the European Commission in December based on a model from the OECD, and the latest draft of the bill was released on Friday. They won’t pass into law just yet as the European Parliament has not given its non-binding opinion on the issue.

Currently, the flight is from bank deposits to the U.S. Treasury money markets, but as the ether yield economy becomes more mainstream, “it is hard not see more demand for ETH deposits and ETH yields,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  Bernstein notes that in the “hierarchy of yields,” money market yields at peak rates are the obvious choice for investors, but these are in U.S. dollars, a fiat currency base.  Ether holders are seeing nearly one month waiting period for setting up as network validators on Ethereum.  Read more: Ether Holders Embrace Near Month-Long Wait for Staking ETH  “Any hard landing leading to a decline in rates and USD debasement would immediately make ETH yields in ETH terms extremely attractive,” the note said.

These yields are directly linked to Ethereum ecosystem activity, which continues to see increased adoption from both retail and institutional investors, the analysts wrote.  “The new crypto crypto cycle will be about yield this time,” the report said. Banks make money by not sharing yields with savers, “Ethereum shares all that it makes with stakers and does not dilute its monetary policy,” the report added.  Ether staking trends post the Shanghai upgrade have beaten expectations, Bernstein said, with the amount of ether staked as a percentage of total ETH reaching around 15%, an increase of 2% since the upgrade, addressing any concerns of a supply overhang.

Data from the on-chain analytics tool Glassnode show bitcoin wallets holding more than one token crossed the millionth mark on Monday. This is a 20% bump since February last year.  The data shows that bitcoin wallets holding one token grew by 79,000 between November and January – amid the collapse of crypto exchange FTX as prices fell from over $22,000 to briefly under $16,000.

12677371,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533093,1684222545,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Here’s What’s Holding Back A Rally To $30,000","The Bitcoin price remains in a crucial situation in which neither the bulls nor the bears have been able to gain the upper hand so far. While the bears feel comfortable that they can push the price below $25,000 due to a perceived head and shoulders pattern, the bulls are scrambling to invalidate this thesis. Both sides still have a chance to win. While the bulls want to prevent a daily close of Bitcoin above $27,550, the bulls are fighting to do just that. The goal is to break the H&S neckline to confirm the invalidation of the pattern. Why $30,000 Is A Big Challenge For Bitcoin Right Now However, there are some market forces that are making things difficult for both the bulls and the bears. Some of these factors have been compiled by the analyst “MAC_D” for CryptoQuant. According to him, the rise in the Bitcoin price could be limited for the time being because of the decline in US BTC holdings. CryptoQuant’s data shows that US institutional investors’ BTC holdings have steadily declined in recent months, presumably due to the uncertain regulatory environment and Operation Choke Point 2.0. In the past, a bull market has always been accompanied by an increase in US institutional investors’ BTC holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally This price catalyst could therefore be out of play for the moment until courts or new legislation is created in the US for Bitcoin and crypto. Alternatively, US entities could of course turn to international exchanges and DEXs. A second obstacle for the bulls is the total supply of stablecoins, which shows how large the buying capacity is in the crypto market. It peaked at $99 billion in February 2022 and now stands at $71.1 billion, suggesting that buying power in the crypto market has declined. Third, the analyst argues that there is a “lack of new smart money players”. This is said to be “largely caused by supply and demand factors”, which should also be considered in light of the macro situation (tight monetary policy by the US and European central banks, recession fears). Liquidity Woes And Rising Spot Demand Moreover, there are other factors that could complicate a rally to $30,000 in the short term. As NewsBTC reported, Jane Street and Jump announced that they are ceasing their market-making activities in the US. As digital asset data provider Kaiko has investigated, this may have a significant impact on market liquidity. Interestingly, the market depth for BTC has barely changed since the announcement or last month and has remained at a low level. Kaiko interprets this to mean that Jump and Jane Street have already reduced most of their exposure (or have yet to make these adjustments). Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounce-Back: How Call Buyers Are Fueling The Crypto Recovery Due to the low market depth, Bitcoin’s intraday volatility has increased significantly. Nonetheless, BTC’s 30-day rolling volatility remains low at around 36%, well below the 2020-2022 average, Kaiko said. Another inhibiting factor could be the net dollar liquidity in the financial markets. Analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) recently stated that net dollar liquidity is back to end-March levels. According to him, the fair value for BTC is therefore between $27,500 and $28,000. Net dollar liquidity trading back to late-March levels. $95bln USD has been injected by the US Treasury since April 26th Fair value for #BTC (based on this) seems to be here or slightly higher toward $28k pic.twitter.com/el4PgvXZru — tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) May 15, 2023 In the short term, it also requires rising spot interest in Bitcoin. As analyst @52skew writes, spot deltas & CVDs show that the overall spot delta has been quite positive in recent days. Moreover, he notes how the Binance spot market is still largely driving the trends, with Coinbase also recently leading the moves with a strong positive spot delta (market buying). In his latest tweet, the analyst predicted: Short liquidity taken & now market is hunting long liquidity.

42410754,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgpBy,1684220890,BlockFi Creditors Say Crypto Lender Was a Victim of Bad Management,"A war of words between the BlockFi Creditors Committee and the bankrupt digital asset lender's management continued in a court filing published late Monday.  The creditors called BlockFi’s narrative that it was a victim of FTX and Alameda a “false case narrative” and blamed the firm's failure on poor management decisions and subsequently its restructuring agents.  The creditors committee pointed out that in the days after the FTX collapse, when crypto markets plummeted, BlockFi converted around $240 million in cryptocurrency into fiat, resulting in significant financial losses and potential tax issues for customers. BlockFi then deposited the proceeds and an additional $10 million into Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which later collapsed.  “SVB was not a depository institution of sufficient strength to meet the Bankruptcy Code’s protective requirements, prompting the United States Trustee to object to estate money being deposited there,” creditors wrote. “Eventually, an arrangement was reached whereby SVB would post sufficient collateral (in the form of a bond) should there be a bank failure.”  However, nobody at BlockFi bothered to follow through with this, including the restructuring team, and no bond was posted, the creditors said. “It’s a good thing the federal government stepped in to bail out all SVB depositors, including BlockFi,” they wrote.  The creditors argued that additionally BlockFi spent $22.5 million of customer funds to purchase a $30 million insurance policy for its directors and officers.  Since the lows of November 2022, bitcoin (BTC) has gained nearly 63%, according to CoinDesk market data, and creditors argue that there was nearly $100 million in value lost because of that decision to liquidate then. Notably a portion of this document is redacted, particularly key paragraphs where the creditors explain why they believe the BlockFi team was engaged in a “false case narrative”.  Recovery depends on FTX and Alameda  In the wake of its bankruptcy spurred by FTX's collapse, BlockFi is set to return nearly $300 million to custodial wallet users as per a recent ruling, while retaining $375 million from its interest-bearing accounts.  While the company managed to secure $4.7 million from the sale of mining rigs, significant recoveries hinge on the firm's claims against Alameda and FTX, with around $355 million in cryptocurrency frozen on FTX and a $671 million loan to FTX's affiliate, Alameda Research.

The bank initiated coverage of the stock with a hold rating and a price target of $55. On Monday, Coinbase shares closed 6% higher at $60.77.  Berenberg estimates that at least 37% of the $736 million of Coinbase’s first quarter net revenue came from the transaction fees and spreads it posted by trading crypto tokens other than bitcoin (BTC) as well as from fees from its staking services.“  At a minimum, these revenue sources likely would be targeted by the SEC in the enforcement action that we expect the commission to file soon,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote, adding that some of Coinbase’s other revenue streams, such as interest income from USD Coin (USDC) and custody, may also “get caught up in the SEC’s crypto-industry dragnet in the near future.”  Successfully pivoting away from the U.S. would be a tall order for the crypto exchange, as about 86% of net revenue that Coinbase generated in the the 12 months ended March 31 came from its U.S. operations, the note said.  Shorting Coinbase shares is too risky a trade, Berenberg said, especially as around 23% of its free float is already sold short. Shorting is a way of betting that a price will decline. An investor borrows a security and sells it in the hope that the price will drop. They then repurchase the security and return it to the lender. The borrower can then pocket the difference if they are right or fork out the difference if wrong.  Wall Street giant Citi cut its rating on Coinbase to neutral from buy earlier this month and slashed its price target for the crypto exchange to $65 from $80, also citing regulatory uncertainty.

The federal regulator asked the court to reject a Coinbase petition asking for additional regulatory guidance specifically tailored to the digital asset industry. The SEC has not yet made any decision on the petition and ""continues to consider"" the filing, the regulator said in a filing.  Coinbase filed its original petition with the SEC in July 2022, asking the regulator to provide guidance around digital assets. Last month, the crypto trading platform filed a Mandamus petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, asking it to force the regulator to respond to the petition during an escalating legal battle; Coinbase filed a response to an SEC Wells Notice the same week.  In its response Monday, the SEC said the company was expecting a response after less than a year, while the agency has taken up to five or 10 years to respond to petitions in other areas in the past.  ""As Coinbase’s own submissions make clear, considering the various paths it suggests is a necessarily complicated endeavor,"" the SEC filing said. ""Yet Coinbase filed its rulemaking petition fewer than ten months ago, supplemented aspects of the petition fewer than three months ago, and sought to supplement the record again only weeks ago.""  The SEC has received more than 1,600 ""form-letter comments"" and eight original comments, the regulator said. Coinbase filed three of the latter.  The federal securities regulator also noted that considering new rules or amendments to existing regulations does not preclude it from enforcing existing regulations.  ""Coinbase attempts an end run around the clear precedent foreclosing relief in these circumstances by arguing that all the Commission needs to do is memorialize its denial of Coinbase’s petition – a decision Coinbase incorrectly asserts has already been made,"" the SEC said.

The largest American crypto exchange had sued the SEC on April 25, demanding clarity on crypto regulation. The company filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, which requires the SEC to respond within a reasonable time. In the filing, Coinbase asks the SEC to formally clarify “which digital assets must be registered as securities.” In addition, the court should require the SEC to answer only “yes or no” to the question of whether it will impose rules on the crypto industry. SEC Responds To Coinbase Complaint Late Monday night (EST), the US regulator released its response, and the answer is once again more than disillusioning for the crypto community. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) wrote via Twitter that the SEC’s response is “an overwhelming maybe”. According to him, today’s filing marks the first time the SEC may have formally stated its views on whether and how the SEC will create rules for the crypto industry in court. The SEC told the court that crypto rulemaking may take years and that it is “in no rush”. Related Reading: Coinbase Engages Legal And Political Aids In Battling SEC Furthermore, the SEC acknowledged that it will continue to use enforcement actions as a substitute for rulemaking for the foreseeable future. In this regard, Grewal ironically states, “but not to worry – those enforcement actions may eventually ‘inform’ not-yet-planned rulemaking.” The SEC also alleges that Coinbase has no right to mandamus directing the regulator to perform certain duties: Perhaps recognizing this, Coinbase instead asserts that this Court should compel the Commission to act on Coinbase’s recently filed rulemaking petition. But no statute or regulation requires the Commission to take such action on a specific timeline. Further, the SEC writes in its reply brief to the court that Chairman Gensler’s public statements are not formal SEC guidance or policy statements and the public cannot rely on them as such. Grewal’s conclusion is therefore devastating: Overall the SEC’s response reinforces Coinbase’s long standing concern that our industry does not have clarity on what the SEC may consider to be within or outside its jurisdiction at any time, and it is likely to continue changing its mind along the way. Related Reading: Coinbase Q1 Report: Net Revenue Skyrockets 22% Quarter-Over-Quarter However, Grewal also announced in a tweet that Coinbase will take the opportunity to formally respond to the SEC’s letter next week. It remains to be seen what the next steps for Coinbase are and whether the writ of mandamus can bring anything beneficial to the crypto industry. The entire crypto market is currently at a crucial juncture price-wise. The total market cap stands at $1.098 trillion, just above the support line at $1.081 trillion.

12672974,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533060,1684209626,Bitcoin Bounce-Back: How Call Buyers Are Fueling The Crypto Recovery,"Bitcoin (BTC) has recently experienced a brief drop below its crucial support level but has quickly rebounded to the current price of $27,300. This has resulted in the return of Call buyers, who are hoping that the level will hold and push the price upward. This has resulted in a fast-paced market, with Gamma Call buyers focusing on May 18-26th $28,000-$29,000 Calls and $28,000-$30,000 Call spreads, resulting in a net profit of $2,500, according to a recent analysis by Deribit Insight. Related Reading: Analyst: VeChain Enters Buy Zone, Should You Jump In? The Call Of The Hour The recent surge in Call buying, although very near-dated, has resulted in an increase in the 7-14 day Implied Volatility (IV) after a weekend lull and pressure from the previous week. It is important to note that the $27,300 level is pivotal to the market’s performance, according to Deribit Insight. Being tested a couple of times already, a good push-up may compound confidence among investors. Vice versa, if the market fails to hold this level, it may result in a decline in the market’s confidence. According to the analysis firm, Bitcoin’s net positioning still appears bullish, despite some setbacks in the market. Recently, there was news of a ‘fake’ government selling wallet, which temporarily dashed hopes for Bitcoin bulls. However, market participants are still looking for momentum to rebuild, and there are signs that bullish sentiment is still strong. On the other hand, Bitcoin is facing stiff resistance ahead, particularly between the price range of $28,180 and $28,990. According to the crypto analyst Ali, this is a critical area where 1.24 million addresses have bought 973,220 BTC. However, on the flip side, there is also a crucial support level at $26,490. Failing to hold above this level could trigger a steeper correction in Bitcoin’s price, potentially leading to a drop to $24,100 or $23,190, according to the analyst. RSI Signals Strong Support At Key Level For Bitcoin According to the crypto analyst Crypto Con, the weekly Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) is attempting to make support on a very significant level – the 56 RSI value line. This line has marked local bottoms for every bull cycle, suggesting that it is an important level of support for the cryptocurrency. The more retests at this level, the healthier the price action is, as it indicates that buyers are willing to step in and support the market at this level. This is a positive sign for Bitcoin bulls, as it suggests that the current uptrend may continue for some time. The growing adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value is another factor that may be driving bullish sentiment in the market. Many investors see Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional investments, especially in an environment of low-interest rates and high inflation. This sentiment is reflected in the significant milestone achieved, with more than 1 million wallets holding at least 1 BTC, according to Satoshi Club. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading at $27,400, reflecting a 1.8% gain in the last 24 hours. However, the 50-day Moving Average (MA) currently stands at $27,600, which could act as a crucial resistance level that needs to be overcome if bulls wish to make another attempt at the $30,000 mark. On the other hand, if Bitcoin experiences further price declines, the 200-day MA, indicated by the yellow line on the chart below, could serve as a significant threshold for the cryptocurrency. This key level, located at $24,700, may halt any further price drops and prevent selling pressures from mounting in the near term and delaying Bitcoin’s bull run toward new highs.

Bitcoin Active Addresses Have Seen A Sharp Plunge Recently According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the active addresses are around cyclical lows of 566,000. The “active addresses” metric measures the daily number of unique Bitcoin addresses participating in some transaction activity on the blockchain. By “unique,” what’s meant here is that the indicator only checks whether an address has been involved in a transfer at least once. This implies that regardless of how many transactions an address might make, its contribution to the active addresses metric will remain just one unit. This restriction exists because the number of unique addresses can serve as an analog to the number of unique users visiting the blockchain, thus providing an estimate for the daily users on the network. Another indicator that’s made for tracking activity on the Bitcoin blockchain is the “transaction count,” which, as its name already suggests, tells us about the daily total number of transfers taking place on the network. When this metric has a high value, it naturally means that many transactions occur on the blockchain. Such indicator values imply a high demand for using the network currently, but the metric can’t say anything about how the activity is distributed; that’s where the active addresses indicator comes in. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Continue To Sell, Bearish Sign? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin transaction count (as well as its 30-day and 365-day simple moving averages) over the entire history of the asset: The value of the metric seems to have sharply surged recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 20, 2023 As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin transaction count has recently seen a rapid rise and has hit a new all-time high of about 682,000 daily transfers. The reason behind this explosion in the transaction count is the emergence of the BRC-20 tokens, fungible tokens created on the BTC blockchain using the Ordinals protocol (a way to inscribe data like text and images directly into the chain). These BRC-20 tokens have started a new memecoin mania, with PEPE being the largest example of such a coin. The insanely fast popularity of these tokens has meant that the demand for transacting on the network is more than ever before. What about the active addresses, though? Is this indicator also seeing a rise? Looks like the metric has plunged recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 20, 2023 From the chart, it’s apparent that the active addresses observed a rise at first, but then it plunged to a value of 566,000 addresses per day, around the current cyclical low. Related Reading: Stablecoins Interest Spikes As Traders Look To Exit Market This would mean that while the demand for making transactions is super high right now, the demand isn’t actually coming from a large number of users but a rather small number of them who are constantly making repeat transfers. “This is a curious scenario, whereby many BRC-20 users appear to have re-used their Bitcoin addresses,” explains Glassnode. “Perhaps due to having more familiarity with how account-based chains like Ethereum or Solana operate, and less so with the Bitcoin UTXO system.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,400, down 1% in the last week.

12670509,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533040,1684202438,Crypto Achilles Heel: How The Absence Of Settlement Infrastructure Is Holding Back The Market,"Ram Ahluwalia, the CEO of PeerNova, recently commented on the liquidity challenges the crypto market faces. According to Ahluwalia, the lack of a crypto bank settlement layer has led to a significant drying up of liquidity, hurting market makers and other participants in the industry. Related Reading: South Korea Crypto Exchanges Upbit And Bithumb Probed Over Lawmaker’s Scandal Crypto’s Biggest Challenge In traditional finance, the solution to this problem is provided by well-capitalized clearinghouse firms such as the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). These firms act as the intermediary between buyers and sellers, assuming the role of the seller to every buyer and the buyer to every seller. This allows market makers to settle instantly with counterparties without taking on any counterparty or settlement risk. The role of clearinghouse firms in traditional finance is crucial for ensuring market stability and facilitating efficient trading. By assuming the counterparty risk of every trade, these firms provide confidence and security that encourages market participants to trade with one another. However, the lack of a similar clearinghouse infrastructure in the crypto market has created significant challenges for market participants. Market makers and other participants are forced to assume counterparty and settlement risk without a centralized clearinghouse, which can be a significant barrier to trading. This has led to a drying up of liquidity in the market, making it more difficult for traders to find counterparties and execute trades. The Importance Of Infrastructure According to Ahluwalia, there is a growing need for a crypto bank settlement layer that can provide the same security and confidence as traditional clearinghouses to address this challenge. This would allow market makers to settle instantly with counterparties without taking on any counterparty or settlement risk. It would also help improve market stability and facilitate efficient trading, which would benefit the crypto market as a whole. However, the emergence of solutions such as Signature Bank’s Signet, a blockchain-based system and a competitor to Silvergate Capital Corp’s now-defunct SEN, has seemingly solved this problem for the crypto market, according to Ahluwalia. Before the two crypto-friendly bank’s debacle, these solutions provided market makers with instant settlement, allowing them to trade with counterparties without having to tie up capital on multiple exchanges or wait for funds to clear, which is crucial for improving capital efficiency. The lack of it can lead to a drying up of liquidity in the market. On the other hand, Ram Ahluwalia raises an interesting question regarding using a secure high Transaction Per Second (TPS) blockchain to settle transactions instead of the banking settlement layer. While decentralization has grown in popularity, Ahluwalia believes that certain risks are associated with relying solely on blockchain technology for settlement. One major issue is compliance with sanctions screening laws issued by organizations like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a division of the US Treasury. This list includes North Korea, drug cartels, Russian oligarchs, and Iran. Market makers were previously able to rely on banks to ensure compliance with these laws, but without this layer of oversight, market makers would be assuming more risk. Overall, for Ram Ahluwalia, in the context of a 24×7 crypto market, the need for a 24×7 bank instant settlement layer is critical to unlocking liquidity, and the recent loss of critical market infrastructure like Sen and SigNet has highlighted the importance of having a reliable settlement layer in place.

12669242,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532957,1684198812,Analyst Predicts Altcoins Boom Ahead of Bitcoin Halving – Is it Time to Invest?,"The Bitcoin and the altcoins market has since been on a rollercoaster ride over the last few months, with investors looking to make gains at every opportunity, especially with the current trend of the creation of meme coins such as PEPE, AIDOGE, TURBO, and so on. Now, with the Bitcoin halving around the corner, renowned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes it is time to accumulate alternative coins. In a tweet, published earlier today, the analyst noted: For altcoins, the time to accumulate them has come. One year before the halving -> time to buy those positions. Reached an important level here, which is also approx. 1 year before the halving. Time To Long The Altcoins Van de Poppe shared his analysis of historical data on altcoins‘ market cap dominance and identified crucial areas from 2016, where the altcoin price reaction ahead of a Bitcoin halving has gone according to his prediction. According to the analyst, multiple alternative coins may attract investments, leading to an increase in the altcoins’ market cap dominance. Notably, Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs every 210,000 blocks mined, which is approximately every four years. It is a mechanism put in place to ensure the scarcity of Bitcoin, which helps to maintain its value. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Halving The Key For A BTC Price Bottom? During the halving, the block reward is cut in half, which decreases the supply of new Bitcoins being produced. The last Bitcoin halving took place on May 11, 2020, and the next one is expected to occur between April and May 2024. One year before the next Bitcoin halving is the perfect spot to take that buy position on altcoins, according to van de Poppe. His current projection is reinforced by the crucial level of the altcoins market cap dominance, which is approximately one year before the next Bitcoin halving. This is the time when the market experiences a rise in altcoin prices, which leads to an increase in demand for these cryptocurrencies. Though the analyst did not hint at which alternative coins to bag, he went ahead to further ask his nearly 657,000 Twitter followers, “Which ones are you accumulating?” Expected Reaction After The Bitcoin Halving Altcoins have been making significant strides in the crypto market, and their dominance has been on the rise. In the past year, we have seen the dominance of altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) increase significantly. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin currently holds a market dominance of around 40%, while altcoins hold the remaining 60%. This is a significant shift from a year ago when Bitcoin’s dominance was close to 70%. Regardless, the altcoins market is expected to see a surge in price following the Bitcoin halving. In the past, altcoins have tended to outperform Bitcoin in the year following a halving event. This is mostly because investors often look for alternative investment opportunities when Bitcoin’s price becomes too high, and altcoins can provide an attractive alternative.

As CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams Jr. wrote, trading volumes will be key to watch, since they could amplify or mute the sentiment behind any directional move.  According to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the digital-asset manager Arca, so-called bid/ask spreads – the difference between the price a buyer is willing to pay and what a seller will accept – is wide, especially after some market makers quit crypto.  ""The prices of most digital assets are stuck in a wind tunnel,"" Dorman in a newsletter.  In traditional finance, stock-market action was muted as traders try to handicap the odds of whether U.S. lawmakers can agree on a plan to avoid a default by the federal government, with the Treasury's borrowings moving closer to the official limit.

Perpetual funding rates represent payments within the futures markets between participants who are long or short the asset. When funding rates are positive, holders of long positions pay a fee to holders of short positions. When funding rates are negative, the opposite is the case.  The interpretation is that funding rates can often indicate bullish or bearish sentiment, with the former represented by positive rates, and the latter represented by negative ones.  For bitcoin funding rates have been positive in 8 of the most recent 10 trading days. Ether by comparison has shown positive funding rates in 7 of the most recent days, declining to zero 3 times, but not falling below zero since April 6.

In a week, it sent a whopping 1,748,403,277 SHIB tokens to the project’s dead wallet. The burning mechanism is part of the processes that the Shiba Inu uses to maintain stability in its ecosystem. It is a strong measure to reclaim the value of the SHIB token as it removes more coins from circulation. Community Burns 1.74B Tokens Through 20 Different Transactions According to data from the Shiba Inu burning portal, Shibburn, over 1.74 billion SHIB coins were burned within 7 days. The community completed the burning mechanism for the week through 20 different transactions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tweets Surpass Dogecoin Despite Meme Coin Craze However, Shibburn disclosed that the Shiba Inu burn rate for the week decreased by 69.48% as against the previous week. The token burning data for the previous week showed that 3.98 billion SHIB tokens were sent to the dead wallet. The process was completed through 19 separate transactions by the community. The 24-hour token burning record has about 11.42 million Shiba Inu coins destroyed. This indicated a drop of 11.21% in the burn rate over the past day. Furthermore, Shibburn highlights the week’s top 3 SHIB token burners: Mysterious Wallet, Blaze Token, and SHIB Super Store. The Mysterious Wallet is among the top players in SHIB token burn as it destroyed 11.42 million SHIB coins through a single transaction. The wallet has been a major contributor to the SHIB token-burning mechanism. Besides its massive destruction of SHIB tokens, the wallet still holds over 335.79 billion SHIB worth more than $2.96 million. The prominent Shiba Inu Community-led burn project, SHIB Super Store, is the next top token burner. It sent about 10.45 million SHIB tokens to the protocol’s dead wallet on May 8 through a single transaction.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action The Shiba Inu community has kept removing lots of SHIB tokens from circulation through the burning process. But SHIB’s value is yet to mark a remarkable recovery. The entire crypto market has been battling with the influence of the bears pushing most assets’ prices to the bearish zone. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00000886, indicating a slight gain of 0.80% over the past 24 hours. Its market cap is $5.22 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $96 million. Its 7-day and 30-day price actions indicated a drop of 1.40% and 20.74%, respectively.
