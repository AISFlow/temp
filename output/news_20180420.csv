But ""the Chief Scientist has never said such a thing,"" Quirion's office told CoinDesk via email.  The comments appeared in an article produced by the Agence Science-Presse – a non-profit news agency – and were published on the Chief Scientist's government website.  Titled ""Bitcoin above the law? False,"" the article is part of the agency's fact-checking series ""Detecteur de rumeurs"" and was produced independently of Quirion's office.  The article examines the merit of the widespread assertion made by government leaders, financial institutions and regulators that criminals frequently use cryptocurrencies to carry out illegal activities such as money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The piece concludes that bitcoin ""makes up only tiny amount of criminal money in circulation around the world,"" adding that the reason for this is ""it is less attractive for those wishing to carry out transactions without leaving a trace.""

According to Russian legal information site RAPSI, the Vyborgsky District Court of St. Petersburg blocked Bitcoininfo.ru in 2016, claiming that cryptocurrencies are ""a means of virtual payment and accumulation,"" and therefore, the provision of related information is illegal because it undermines the country's sole legal currency - the ruble.  The court did not invite the defendants to the initial trial, and they were unaware of the court's decision to block the site until access was cut off, Russian crypto publication Anycoin said. The original appeal period closed by that point.  Bitcoininfo reportedly attempted to appeal the ruling despite missing the window, but the court declined to review it. Anycoin reported last month that the Supreme Court would review the case after subsequent reviews, which it has now passed onto the St. Petersburg City Court as of Friday.  According to RIA Novosti, the same St. Petersburg court reviewed a similar appeal in February and overturned a decision to block 40 bitcoin-related sites.  The Russian government has largely expressed opposition to informational sites about cryptocurrencies.

Chief operating officer Juthica Chou told CoinDesk that the startup has seen roughly $7.5 million traded weekly through 700 swaps and options contracts. Since the platform launched its derivatives products, it has cleared $130 million notional – meaning the total number of assets traded at their spot price during the time of the transaction.  LedgerX kicked off trading of its regulated swaps and options contracts last October, after receiving approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in July of 2017. Within its first week, the startup saw 176 contracts traded with a notional value around $1 million, as previously reported.  Since then, average trade volume has grown an average of 40 percent month-over-month, Chou said. Currently, 2,000 contracts are of open interest, with the longest-dated active options being $15,000 and $25,000 strike calls slated to expire in December 2019. In other words, the investors holding those contracts can purchase the assets if bitcoin reaches those levels before next December. However, traders will only make money if bitcoin does actually exceed that level, as previously reported.  Chou said the cryptocurrency market's recent dip did not have a significant impact on swap and options trading, explaining:  ""Significant corrections remind people that there are ways to monetize expected volatility even when price goes down and we've seen that reflected in our trading activity. Our sophisticated participants are not just buy-and-hold people, let me put it that way.""  LedgerX has 90 individual and institutional traders making up its participant base, she said. Both younger, relatively newer traders and more traditional ones trade on the startup's platform.  While LedgerX only trades bitcoin swaps and options, the company is planning to expand, Chou said. Specifically, the startup ""plans to add ethereum support in the near future.""

42401461,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcp9l6,1524239153,"Stellar Run: XLM, IOTA, ADA Spike in Good Week for Altcoins","Alternative cryptocurrencies shone bright this week, as the wider cryptocurrency market saw continued resurgence.  The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies rose 25 percent week-on-week to $375 billion, according to CoinMarketCap – that's up from below $250 billion just 10 days ago.  But bitcoin, with 5.4 percent appreciation over the last seven days, ranks only third from last in the list of the biggest gainers among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap this week.  Meanwhile, the bitcoin dominance rate fell from 42.8 to 38.5 percent, indicating a drop in the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by bitcoin and, conversely, growing investor interest in altcoins.  And, no wonder; names like stellar (XLM), IOTA and Cardano (ADA) are topping the list of biggest gainers, showing appreciation of up to 51 percent.  Other major cryptocurrencies like the Ripple (XRP) and bitcoin cash (BCH), though, have gained at least 30 percent each. While ethereum's ether token (ETH) has appreciated by 16 percent, and litecoin (LTC) is reporting 16 percent gains.  Top gainers  Stellar  Weekly performance: +51.26 percent  All-time high: $0.9381  Closing price on April 13: $0.24629  Current market price: $0.372532  Rank as per market capitalization: 8  XLM picked up a bid following a bullish triangle breakout on April 12 and rose to a 7.5-week high of $0.3883 on Bittrex. The rally has been backed by positive news flow, with Novatti group, a global software technology and systems integration provider, integrating XLM into its remittance service.  Further, trading volumes have increased 27 percent since April 13, according to CoinMarketCap. The high volume rally adds credence to the bullish breakout seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  The breach of the long-term falling trendline, bullish triangle breakout and the ascending (bullish biased) 10-day MA, favor further gains in XLM. However, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, so a minor pullback cannot be ruled out.  IOTA  Weekly performance: +38.64 percent  All-time high: $5.69  Closing price on April 13: $1.32  Current market price: $1.83  Rank as per market capitalization: 9  IOTA crossed the long-term falling trendline in a convincing manner on April 15, confirming a bull reversal. So, it is not surprising to see the cryptocurrency is well bid and trading at $1.95 on Binance – its highest level since early March.  The rally coincided with the announcement that the first cryptocurrency-powered charging station, set to go live in the Netherlands, will use IOTA. The positive news flow may have strengthened IOTA's appeal.  Daily chart  The cryptocurrency looks set to test resistance at $2.30 (Feb. 17 high), albeit after a healthy pullback, as the 14-day RSI shows overbought conditions. That said, the bias remains bullish as long as the cryptocurrency trades above the descending trendline.  Cardano  Weekly performance: +38.60 percent  All-time high: $1.33  Closing price on April 13: $0.200532  Current market price: $0.277932  Rank as per market capitalization: 7  Cardano's (ADA) impressive rally could be associated with a listing on the Houbi cryptocurrency exchange and the addition of new ADA pairs on Binance.  The cryptocurrency crossed the key resistance of $0.2543 in a convincing manner on April 16 and has hit a high of $0.2928 – a level last seen on March 6. Trading volumes also have jumped 29 percent week-on-week, signaling the rally is here to stay.  However, like XLM and IOTA, ADA also looks overbought as per the 14-day RSI and, hence, we are unable to rule out a pullback.  Top losers  Verge  Weekly performance: -21.48 percent  All-time high: $0.240605  Closing price on April 13: $0.091562  Current market price: $0.071898  Rank as per market capitalization: 23  Verge's XVG token took a beating on April 17 after Pornhub announced it would accept XVG for payments. The developers had hyped the situation ahead of the official announcement, by describing the mystery partnership as the biggest cryptocurrency collaboration to ever hit the market.  Most, though, were expecting verge to name TokenPay as the mystery partner, so many in the investor community felt disappointed by Pornhub partnership.  Daily chart  As seen in the above chart, the token fell from $0.118 to $0.065 after the partnership announcement on Tuesday and extended losses to $0.06. The ascending trendline seems to have rescued the bulls for now.  However, the relative strength index (RSI) has found acceptance below the rising trendline. Further, the 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA bearish crossover indicates the short-term bias is bearish. So XVG might re-test and possibly break below the trendline support next week.  Binance coin  Weekly performance: -10.56 percent  All-time high: $22.48  Closing price on April 13: $13.54  Current market price: $12.11  Rank as per market capitalization: 20  Binance coin (BNB) is threatening to drop below the long-term ascending trendline, as seen in the chart below. The cryptocurrency is reporting losses on a weekly basis, despite Binance completing its ""coin burn"" – a process similar to share buyback, aimed at a reducing the circulation in the market (supply) and boosting demand.  It appears the positive impact of coin burn was priced in well in advance, as the token was better bid last week.  Moving forward, BNB risks a deeper sell-off unless it stages a solid rebound from the ascending trendline support.

42401460,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcp9k7,1524229255,"Bitcoin Bull Trap? Not So, Says Lesser-Known Price Indicator","Is the reversal of a lesser-known bitcoin price indicator signaling a bull trap?  That's the question being asked by Twitter's more expert crypto analysts after bitcoin's rise to $8,500 this week, a figure that's up more than 25 percent since its early April lows. As such, many investors and traders are wondering if the market's rally, propelled largely by a single day of strong gains, is over (if only for now).  Stepping back, the indicator in question, ETH/BTC, which tracks the value of ether against bitcoin, has been behaving oddly of late. In the past, ether's rise against bitcoin has been greeted as a negative sign for bitcoin, one that signals more traders are willing to exchange bitcoin for ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.  Still, this time bitcoin is leading the way.  After bottoming out around $6,400 on April 1, the subsequent recovery seems to have helped oversold ether regain poise (ETH fell 53.8 percent in March, while BTC dropped 32 percent). So, the argument that bitcoin's rally could be a bull trap does not hold ground this time.  As per the historical data, the ETH/USD pair and bitcoin are inversely related and the former tends to work as a lead indicator for the latter.  Looking back  The inverse relationship makes sense as the fiat money tends to flow into crypto markets via major assets like BTC. Then, once the bitcoin valuations look overstretched, the money is rotated into the relatively cheap alternative cryptocurrencies (popularly known as altcoins).  So, ETH/BTC tends to lead bitcoin.  In the chart above, we can get a glimpse of how this has worked in the past.  ETH/BTC topped out 0.15 on June 13, 2017, and BTC/USD bottomed out $1,826.20 in July 15.  ETH/BTC bottomed out at 0.02 on Dec 8, while BTC/USD turned lower from $19,891 on Dec. 17.  ETH/BTC turned bearish from its Feb. 1 high of $0.12 and BTC/USD bottomed out at $6,000 on Feb. 6  This time around, however, ETH/BTC has been rising with bitcoin, meaning bitcoin is rallying hand-in-hand with the ETH/BTC exchange rate.  Everyone's a winner?  Still, that's not to say things are totally different this time around.  Money is still being rotated out of bitcoin and into lesser-known cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap's Bitcoin Dominance Rate, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by bitcoin.  Indeed, the above chart shows the BTC dominance rate topped out at 45.62 percent on April 2 and fell to 40 percent yesterday – the lowest since March 1, which shows growing investor interest in other cryptocurrencies.  However, the dominance rate of others (lesser-known cryptocurrencies) has risen sharply from 17 percent to 24 percent in the last four weeks.  If bitcoin witnesses a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, then the money may flow back into bitcoin from the lesser-known altcoins, thus boosting the BTC dominance rate.  In this case, the ETH/BTC rally may come to a halt.

The parliament's members voted by a large majority on Thursday to support a December 2017 agreement with the European Council for measures aimed, in part, to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and terrorism financing.  The parliament members passed the move by 574 yes votes to 13 no votes, with 60 abstentions, according to a release.  The new legislation seeks to address the anonymity of the financial technology by implementing rules for cryptocurrency exchanges, platforms and wallet providers. Under the measures, such entities must be registered with authorities and will to have to apply due diligence procedures, including customer verification.  According to the release, the updated directive will come into force three days after publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. After that, member countries of the EU will have 18 months to bring the new rules into national law.  Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and co-rapporteur Krisjanis Karins said in the release:  “Criminal behaviour hasn’t changed. Criminals use anonymity to launder their illicit proceeds or finance terrorism. This legislation helps address the threats to our citizens and the financial sector by allowing greater access to the information about the people behind firms and by tightening rules regulating virtual currencies and anonymous prepaid cards.”  Another co-rapporteur and MEP, Judith Sargentini, said that ""billions of euros"" are being lost every year to money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion and avoidance, adding that that money ""should go to fund our hospitals, schools and infrastructure.""  Sargentini continued:  ""With this new legislation, we introduce tougher measures, widening the duty of financial entities to undertake customer due diligence.""  The European Council's December consensus agreement also proposed a range of new EU-wide penalties for those convicted of money laundering.

The target resistance level to beat yesterday (long-term descending trendline) was $8,285. A high volume close (as per UTC) above that mark would have signaled a long-term bullish trend reversal.  The daily chart below shows bitcoin closed yesterday at $8,273 on Bitfinex, meaning the breakout remained elusive. However, a new 24-hour candle (as per UTC) opened above the descending trendline support (seen today at $8,230), creating a false picture of a bullish breakout.  Daily chart  So, while it appears as though the bull breakout has happened, the move is more of a sideways breach (unconvincing breakout) of the long-term trendline hurdle.  As such, the major level to watch out for on the high side is now $8,460 (April 15 high). A convincing move above that level would establish higher highs and higher lows pattern (bullish setup) and would likely confirm a longer-term bull reversal.  The risks of a pullback are still high, given the unconvincing breakout. A failure to hold above the descending trendline support (former resistance) of $8,230 could yield a drop to $7,823 (April 17 low).  The key levels to watch out for in the next day or two are resistance at $8,460 (April 15 high) and support at $7,823 (April 17 low).  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,310 on Bitfinex.    View    A daily close (as per UTC) above $8,460 would open up upside towards $9,000–$9,177 (March 21 high).  A move below $7,823 would indicate the rally from the April. 1 low of $6,425 has ended and could yield a sell-off to $7,200–$7,000.

42401468,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcp9WL,1524214843,Cloud Giant Xunlei Claims Blockchain Advance With 'ThunderChain',"Xunlei, the NASDAQ-listed cloud network provider, has launched its proprietary blockchain platform, despite ongoing class actions over an alleged initial coin offering (ICO).  At a press event in Beijing on Friday, the company announced its open blockchain platform dubbed ""ThunderChain,"" which is designed to enable developers to build decentralization applications.  Based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism, Xunlei makes the significant claim for ThunderChain that it provides processing capacity in the millions of transactions per second.  Xunlei explains that the platform combines its proprietary blockchain with its existing capacity in cloud-based content delivery hosted on a peer-to-peer distributed network.  Founded in 2003, the firm became notable in China for its early development of a peer-to-peer download app called Thunder, which makes use of internet users' idle broadband capacity to expedite downloads and uploads of digital content.  While branding ThunderChain as a new product launch, Xunlei told CoinDesk that it is, in fact, built upon an existing blockchain platform that it has been using to generate its custom token, LinkToken, since October 2017.  As reported by CoinDesk, the firm first announced its move into the blockchain space in October last year. At the time, users could obtain LinkTokens by purchasing Xunlei's then-new cloud storage device – called the OneThing Cloud – to share their spare broadband bandwidth.  The announcement initially caused the company's stock price to skyrocket from $4 to over $20 in November of last year, but it dropped again to around $10 in January following a Chinese financial self-regulator's accusation that the product launch was, in effect, an ""initial miner offering.""  The agency, China's National Internet Finance Association, issued a statement in January, warning residents over activities that require users to purchase hardware in order to participate in a token-generation process and have the substance of an ICO – a fundraising method explicitly banned by the Chinese authorities.  As a result, Xunlei investors formed two class action lawsuits against the firm, alleging it knowingly conducting an unlawful and disguised ICO.  However, in response to CoinDesk and comments seen on various media outlets, Xunlei has, on several occasions, firmly denied the accusations.  “We have been very straight on our business practices – we do not sell tokens,” Chen Lei, CEO of Xunlei and a defendant in the two lawsuits, told the South China Morning Post earlier this month.

42401448,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcp9XK,1524212421,Tezos Co-Founder Sanctioned By US Financial Watchdog,"The co-founder of Tezos, the cryptocurrency project that made headlines with its $232 million initial coin offering last year, has received a sanction order from a U.S. financial regulator.  According to a report by Reuters, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) prohibited Arthur Breitman from association with broker-dealers for two years and handed him a $20,000 fine over allegations that he made false statements about the project while employed at investment bank Morgan Stanley. Breitman did not admit or deny the allegations, the report added.  Approved by the U.S. Congress in 2007, FINRA is a self-regulatory body with oversight of dealers and brokers in the country. Breitman was registered with the agency during his employment in Morgan Stanley from 2014 to 2015, Reuters said.  The regulator alleged that Breitman failed to disclose his involvement in developing and pitching for Tezos during his time at the bank, according to the report. He thus violated a rule mandating that registered broker-dealers must to notify employers of side businesses that are expected to bring financial compensation.  Breitman also allegedly provided false information when answering questionnaires from his employer over any outside business activities.  While the report indicated that an attorney for Breitman played down the impact of the sanction on the Tezos blockchain network, it comes at a time when the project is still going through close scrutiny in various legal cases.  Following its record breaking ICO in July of last year, at least four class action suits have emerged since November 2017 against the firm, alleging it violated U.S. laws by issuing tokens that are in effect unregistered securities.

42401453,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcp9eD,1524208213,Blockchain Slump? Banks May Be Fatigued But Insurers Are Pumped,"Progress reports on blockchain projects in the banking and insurance sectors offered an illuminating comparison at the Blockchain Expo in London Thursday.  While bankers came across as browbeaten and anxious, their cousins in insurance were anything but.  Indeed, the tone for banking was set on a panel looking at the potential of blockchain for financial services, where Claudia Coppenolle, head of digital market management for Deutsche Bank, began by acknowledging her belief that the hype cycle around business applications for blockchain is clearly past its peak.  ""It’s heads down for delivery. People are getting close to MVP [minimum viable product] and just want to get this out,"" she said. “But we still need to learn. We can’t just put a product out and hope it works. It won’t.”  As with banking, being risk averse is in the DNA of insurance companies, but an afternoon session featuring the likes of Allianz and startups such as Etherisc showed the insurance industry is not short on enthusiasm for innovation.  Etherisc co-founder Christoph Mussenbrock arguably looked further toward a decentralized future than his banking counterparts, boasting that his startup has a live product where the insurance payout is triggered by data fed to the ethereum blockchain – in this case records of flights arriving and departing.  If a flight is late, someone who has bought insurance against this risk will simply be automatically reimbursed.  Mussenbrock told attendees:  ""We believe it’s not just a better database, but allows a decentralized economy. We see a shift of control toward the customer; the classic insurance model the firm controls the policy and has all the power.""  Elsewhere, there were signs incumbents are open to such creative approaches.  Oliver Volk, the blockchain expert at Allianz's reinsurance unit, spoke on behalf of the B3i insurance consortium, which he said has been expanded rapidly, adding 23 new members to the original founding group of 15 following the first outing of a prototype for contractual management.  The group is now ready, Volk said, to invite insurance brokers into the consortium, with the latest news being the creation of B3i Service AG, a startup incorporated in Zurich that is now beginning a funding round. Volk also confirmed the consortium intends to have something in production by the end of the year.  But there were other updates as well. Allianz is also running pilots for securing electronic medical prescriptions using a blockchain, not to mention working on an internal token for moving money between affiliates around the globe, as revealed earlier Thursday by CoinDesk.  Still, Martin Baier, the program manager for business innovation and development (including blockchain) at the insurer Zurich, sees other use cases as perhaps hitting the market more quickly, predicting the first real cases for insurance would be around efficiency gains in claims processing and fighting insurance fraud.  In this way, he framed the remaining obstacles as merely finishing touches for impending launches.  “In the claims process there are lots of parties involved, so [it's] a good area for blockchain; we just need to get our data standards sorted out,” said Baier.  Post-hype blues  But if insurers were forward-looking, panels on banking often sought to contextualize what speakers cited as the slow movement of tests and trials to production.  Herve Francois, the blockchain lead at the Dutch bank ING, for example, agreed the hype is definitely past.  “We are in the low point,"" he said. ""But that’s how it works – we tend to overestimate value in the short term, but underestimate impact in the long term.”  Meanwhile, Boris Spremo, operations director for emerging business and architecture at Bank of New York Mellon, said flatly that ""the technology is not ready yet.""  Another barrier to bank adoption, he said, is regulation. Right now, ""the regulators are cautious, especially in capital markets,"" Spremo said. ""And then we need critical mass"" for the tech to work.  This comment compared to statements made by Coppenolle at Deutsche Bank, who elsewhere acknowledged that large institutions like hers are necessarily slow-moving.  “We are not agile,"" she said. ""We are a global operation and our clients have broad needs. ... If our payment engine fails because we were trying out some new blockchain KYC thing, our clients would get very upset.”  Insurance uprising  Still, there were bright spots for bankers, even if the insurers stole the show.  Francois noted how ING successfully swapped €25 million worth of liquid assets using the collateral lending application of fintech startup HQLAx on R3’s Corda distributed ledger platform.  “We did this live transaction last month. We will be in production by year end. It’s been a close walk with regulators, and we are now talking to more of them in Asia,” he said.  That's not to say insurance doesn't have hurdles.  Matt Peterman, CEO and co-founder of InsurPal, agreed that fraud detection is an area ripe for standardization. As it stands, he said, the industry takes invasive measures to fight fraud.  Volk concluded by pointing out some differences between insurance use cases and those in banking, which hinted that perhaps blockchains are a more intuitive fit for the insurance industry.  “When you talk about blockchain and scale it’s a little bit easier for the insurance industry than in financial services,” he said. “In terms of transactions per second, we don’t have that many so that’s not really a limitation for us.""  In this way, he sought to explain the situation merely as one of two different sectors charting their own course toward perhaps inevitable efficiencies.  Volk concluded:  ""We are simply starting with the easiest contracts and working forward.”  Image via Ian Allison for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/20/blockchain-slump-banks-may-be-fatigued-but-insurers-are-pumped,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2dc0e32d5c8453b60a800f17eabd982805160701-2792x1662.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428894,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLedph,1524193243,Bad Checks: Twitter's Identity Crisis Is Costing Users More Than Bitcoin,"Trust, but verify.  Borrowed from a Russian writer, it's one of crypto's most widely embraced slogans, though one that's becoming even more relevant on social media, where battling factions bent on promoting the next great high-tech investment are now turning the very symbols meant to protect users against them.  Whether it's an account impersonating the world's largest exchange or its most widely known tech visionaries, no company or individual is too sacred for a simple takedown that's spreading like wildfire, propelled by lax verification practices at name-brand social media giants.  Still, it's perhaps ""crypto Twitter"" that's bearing the brunt of the criticism.  Armed with a photo ID, scammers are successfully duping Twitter into giving them a ""blue check mark"" of authenticity so they can impersonate real individuals and entities, all in an effort to bilk users out of money.  Take ""seifsbei,"" a verified account associated with freelance film producer and director Seif Elsbei, which was hacked and thenposed as the official account of the verge cryptocurrency. The hacker didn't stop there, later posting messages as crypto exchange Bitfinex and ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.  The verified account ""Protafield"" displayed similar bad behavior in early April, briefly changing its name and account details to impersonate crypto exchanges to specifically stage fake ether giveaways.  And these incidents display how crypto Twitter's current mess isn't likely to be saved merely by the blue check mark, or any other simple verification process.  “People at home see this as a stamp that Twitter sees this as a good account, which can be very subjective,"" said Tim Pastoor, founder of the Netherlands-based digital identity startup 2way.io.  By vetting merely the identity behind the account, and not the intent, when issuing blue check marks, Twitter inadvertently makes scams even more dangerous, he continued.  Speaking to the overall cat-and-mouse game many crypto companies are having to play on Twitter, a Bitfinex representative described curbing such efforts as almost a full-time job.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “We dedicate a lot of resources towards combating illegitimate Twitter accounts and educating our users on how to spot them. However, our impact on certain sites is limited.”  Fickle reputations  There are several patterns that complicate the trouble with crypto Twitter.  For one, scammers have quickly learned to use highly technical language to cloak misinformation in trusted terminology, said Nick Lucas, founder of the Los Angeles-based social media analysis startup CoinTrend. This means simple vocabulary lists and language analysis, processes Twitter and other social media sites use, won’t be enough to weed out scams, he said.  Yet, Pastoor pointed out that bots and spam accounts often promote tokens in packs, swarming to give each other good reputations and boost visibility, which could make it easier to spot systematic scams.  However, it remains a tricky endeavour, and so Pastoor recommends that Twitter take a page from traditional psychology to help combat the problem.  Most people trust their close friends more than acquaintances, so a layered approach to trust could offer some tools for filtering the noise. For example, a user may trust a coworker’s friend more than a complete stranger, but less than a family member. Just as Facebook lets people control which people they see posts from – friends only, select groups or the public – Twitter could give users more control over who shows up in their feeds.  “There are definitely going to have to be iterations,"" Pastoor said. ""I would probably recommend starting with allowing people to filter based on people that they already trust, and to maybe make more use of your second or third-degree networks.""  Twitter declined to comment on any topic related to these events or policy changes in general, but Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey recently admitted that the platform's verification system is broken.  Changing hands  The issue is made even more confusing by the fact that accounts can change hands among owners, not only through hacks, but also simple handovers, and those new owners may have different motives.  For instance, what started much of the debates around Twitter's policies was the suspension of the ""@bitcoin"" Twitter handle.  Before the bitcoin scaling debate came to a head last fall, with a significant contingent of enthusiasts splitting off the core bitcoin network to create bitcoin cash, the @bitcoin Twitter handle tweeted information in support of bitcoin. The account has been operated by many owners over the years, and the latest is an anonymous bitcoin cash fan.  As such, the account became highly controversial, tweeting out incendiary comments aimed at Bitcoin Core developers and several other leading figures in the cryptocurrency community who were on their side. Many Core developers saw this as misleading, since the handle was tweeting out things Bitcoin Core, which a majority of users and businesses still see as the ""true"" bitcoin, didn't stand behind.  Because of the outrage, Twitter briefly suspended the account and then stripped it of its blue check mark (the account is active again but no longer verified).  Speaking to the debates that have plagued the leaderless tech community for some time, Sterlin Lujan, a bitcoin cash supporter and communications ambassador for Bitcoin.com, told CoinDesk:  “These social media networks should not allow handles to be censored or shut down arbitrarily, just because a bunch of people do not like it.""  And while Twitter has said the blue check mark does not imply its approval or endorsement, Lujan contends, “A person with a check mark has a stronger likelihood of appearing at the top of searches and feeds. What it boils down to is that Twitter verification processes need to be made more clear.”  Market influencers  While Twitter's verification process is still uncertain, what remains clear is Twitter's impact on the cryptocurrency markets.  Not only can scammers have a dire impact on user's crypto holdings, but even those earnestly voicing their interest in a certain crypto project can cause price swings. For instance, Lucas has seen a clear correlation between tweets from influential Twitter accounts and market volatility.  “There’s basically a lot of influence on Twitter when John McAfee or someone mentions a specific coin,” Lucas said.  As an example, when McAfee tweeted about ""burst,"" a crypto token project focused on creating a ""greener"" mining process, on December 22, the price of the cryptocurrency quickly doubled.  A similar, albeit temporary, spike happened the previous week when McAfee tweeted about another crypto token project, Safe Exchange Coins. The day before McAfee's tweet, the cryptocurrency was selling for roughly a penny each, but within 24 hours of the tweet, the price doubled and by the following week, the coin briefly sold for more than $0.06.  Some argue that when McAfee charges $105,000 per tweet, he's basically advertising for companies for a fee. However, he told CoinDesk it's not really advertising because he only promotes projects he truly believes in.  Twitter chatter doesn’t only drive prices up for new cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens, though. It can also have negative impacts as well.  For example, Lucas has noticed that a lot of Twitter feuds about bitcoin code changes and technical updates correlate to price dips.  “If everyone is talking negatively about something that is getting pushed into a core repo coin, that can also have an impact. If someone with a big following tweets something, it can cause a scare,"" Lucas said, adding:  “There’s a lot more influence coming from specific accounts, unlike, say, Reddit, which pushes more topics to be talked about rather than creating influence.”  Twitter account on computer screen image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/20/bad-checks-twitters-identity-crisis-is-costing-users-more-than-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ad42a7a446f1d5c6b0616ff95e4d44d767cd5de-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428887,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLedhh,1524186145,€2 Million Donation to Fund World Food Programme Blockchain Project,"The European nation of Belgium has contributed €2 million ($2.4 million) to support the United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP) and its technology projects, including its blockchain-based payments pilot for refugees.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, WFP launched an ethereum-based payments pilot in 2017 with the intention of increasing the efficacy and transparency of cash transfers to displaced Syrians in Jordanian refugee camps.  As such, Belgium's contribution will be used to expand research of the agency's blockchain solutions in addition to its unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) project, which it intends to use for topographical data collection and damage analysis to better cope with natural disasters.  ""Only by finding better ways to deliver aid more efficiently will we close the gap between requirements and aid delivery on the ground,"" Belgium's deputy prime minister and minister for development cooperation, Alexander De Croo, said in a statement announcing the decision Thursday.  He continued:  ""Belgium lauds the efforts of the WFP to come up with innovative solutions to save more lives and help more people in need.""  The U.N's food assistance branch claims the project, dubbed Building Blocks, ""is delivering more [aid] for less, offering donors better value for money.""  WFP chief of staff Rehan Asad said in the statement that it was necessary to meet mounting global crises with innovative solutions.  ""Humanitarians must relentlessly look for ways to harness the most promising digital technologies in the service of the world's most vulnerable people,"" he said. ""We are grateful to committed partners such as Belgium for helping us do just that.""  The WFP is one of several U.N. agencies exploring blockchain applications. In 2017, the U.N. Office for Project Services (UNOPS) organized a blockchain working group which, in addition to the WFP, includes the participation of the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP), the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), U.N. Women, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the U.N. Development Group (UNDG).
