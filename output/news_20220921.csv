42416179,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubTSx,1663797436,"SEC Wants to ‘Remake the Law,’ Rather Than ‘Apply it,’ Says Ripple General Counsel","The legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and payment protocol company Ripple Labs could soon be coming to a close – that is, if a federal judge decides the crypto company did not violate federal securities laws.  Stuart Alderoty, general counsel at Ripple Labs, told CoinDesk TV the crypto company is feeling “confident,” and thinks it could be “the beginning of the end” of the case, which began in 2020.  “There are no allegations of fraud in this case. There are no allegations of misrepresentation. There are no allegations of market manipulation,” Alderoty said during an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” “It really is a technical issue and we believe it’s an issue that can be resolved as a matter of law by the judge.”  Read more: SEC Sues Ripple Over 7-Year, $1.3B 'Ongoing' XRP Sale  Both the SEC and Ripple have filed summary judgment motions with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in a bid to avoid going to a full trial. CoinDesk sought comment from the SEC but a response was not available by press time.  In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs for allegedly selling XRP, a cryptocurrency closely tied to the company, as unregistered securities transactions. The SEC alleges the company sold XRP tokens while letting investors believe they would get a substantial return on the company’s profits.  Alderoty, who has been with Ripple for nearly four years, reiterated his stance that Ripple does not fulfill the requirements set by the Howey Test in a U.S. Supreme Court case. The test helps determine whether or not something can be deemed a security, and therefore an “investment contract.”  “We believe that unless there is a contract for an investment, there’s no case and actually, there’s no authority for the SEC to even weigh in,” Alderoty said. “We believe that they fail on every single prong of the Howey Test.”  Read more: SEC, Ripple Call for Immediate Ruling in Suit Over Whether XRP Sales Violated Securities Laws  Aldertoy added that the SEC does not “identify any contract for an investment between Ripple and an XRP holder,” and that there were no post-sale-guarantees on behalf of Ripple to investors.  “What the SEC is suggesting is that a common interest is a substitute for a common enterprise and it’s not,” Alderoty said. “We've made no promise to any holder of XRP that we will take steps, or are obligated to take steps, on their behalf to do those things.”  Was Ripple was singled out among the different projects within the crypto ecosystem? He said the company may have been used by the SEC to set an example. The aftermath, however, led “nearly every U.S. exchange to delist or suspend trading in XRP,” Alderoty said, which erased “$15 billion in market capitalization” from the company and prompted it to move its operations “offshore.”  “Maybe they [the SEC] thought they [could] send a broader message to the entire market,” Alderoty said. “But I think what they've learned is that if you challenge a well-resourced company, that well-resourced company can put on a very robust defense and really expose the SEC, that what [it's] doing in this case is not applying the law.”  The SEC is “seeking to remake the law,” Alderoty said. “They’re engaging in litigation behavior to further a desired result rather than a faithful allegiance to the law.”  Read more: Crypto Doesn't Need More Guidance, SEC Chair Gensler Says",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/21/sec-wants-to-remake-the-law-rather-than-apply-it-says-ripple-general-counsel,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5a9f19d14e5cfe9f46ad335137a2956b444c697-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416187,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubU7D,1663795960,Market Wrap: Cryptos Decline as FOMC Delivers Expected Rate Hike,"Price Action  Bitcoin traded lower on Wednesday following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision. Price momentum accelerated as U.S. markets opened and maintained trajectory following the expected interest rate decision.  Bitcoin (BTC) fell 1%, and still sits below $19,000. During the 13:00 UTC (9:00 a.m. ET ) hour Wednesday, the price of bitcoin turned sharply higher, on above-average volume, unlike the same time on Tuesday.  Ether (ETH) decreased 3%, falling below $1,300 and also losing additional ground from Tuesday’s loss. Wednesday’s gain marks the second consecutive day that ether prices have turned negative. (Note: While cryptocurrency markets technically never close, Market Wrap compares the current 24-hour candle with the prior 24-hour candle.)  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose 1.65%  Economic Calendar: The U.S. central bank announced a 75 basis point (BPS) hike as expected, marking the fifth consecutive rate hike since March 17.  The Summary of Economic projections, expectations for a specific basket of economic factors, indicated that economic growth will be tepid moving forward.  Contained within the summary is the “dot-plot,” which showed that additional interest rate hikes are on the horizon  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities traded lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 declining 1.7%, 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively.  Commodities: In energy markets, WTI crude oil declined 0.7% while natural gas rose 0.8%. European Brent crude fell 0.4%, while gasoline (RBOB) rose 1.5%. In metals, gold rose 0.7%, while copper futures fell 1.8%  The Dollar Index (DXY) rose 1%, trading higher along with bitcoin, despite their general inverse relationship to each other.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC falls, and the outlook is challenging  Bitcoin traded lower on Tuesday as investors reacted to a widely expected 75 basis point (BPS) interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee, the rate-setting section of the Federal Reserve. Investors’ optimism was growing even before the announcement at the end of the FOMC meeting Wednesday. BTC’s hourly chart showed five consecutive hours of positive movement, leading into the start of the U.S. trading day.  Bitcoin’s price rose as high as $19,900 before reversing course to current levels.  So what’s next for bitcoin? The issues driving the Fed’s continued monetary hawkishness was more important than the size of the interest rate hike. Consider the following points specific to BTC’s outlook.  The Fed stated plainly that inflation remains high, and the central bank is committed to returning inflation to its 2%. The bank barely mentioned the possibility of improvement in 2022.  The federal funds rate is projected to increase to 4.4% by year’s end and close to 4.6% by the end of 2023, indicating equally aggressive rate hikes through the remainder of this year.  Expectations for GDP growth range from 0.5% to 1.5% for 2023 and 1.4% to 2% for 2024, according to the FOMC.  Estimates for higher, future interest rates and muted expectations for economic growth, are likely to present a hurdle for asset valuations. Thus, today’s report implies that bitcoin and other risk assets will continue to face challenges.  Technically, BTC looks poised to trade flat, which has become an ongoing theme. As mentioned in Tuesday’s Market Wrap, BTC is trading relatively close to its “point of control” (POC), signaling that its price is close to where market participants have largely agreed that it should trade since January.  Opportunities exist when an asset’s price deviates sharply from its perceived value, or new information presents itself that has not been incorporated in the price.  An example of this would be the 10% decline that occurred on Sept. 13 as the price of BTC exceeded bitcoin’s point of control. Currently, the 2.5% spread between current price and a POC of $19,754, doesn’t offer a compelling enough opportunity, absent the emergence of a catalyst.  Applying Bollinger Bands to BTC offers a similar view. Bollinger Bands measure an asset’s 20-day moving average, and plots two standard deviations above and below that average. Statistically, an asset’s price is expected to remain within two standard deviations of its average, 95% of the time.  An asset’s price breaching the upper or lower limit of its Bollinger Band often signals the price has moved too far in one direction. BTC’s current price in comparison with its 20-day average implies that it is trading close to fair value for the moment.

According to official information, El Salvador purchased 54% of the bonds maturing in 2025 for a total of $432 million. It bought 22.4% of the bonds maturing in 2023, for a total of $133 million.  Bukele said that El Salvador will launch a new offer for the remainder of the 2023 and 2025 bonds in eight weeks. As with the latest repurchase, it will be done “at market prices,” Bukele added. According to Bukele, the initial repurchases have saved the country more than $275 million.

Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf both said their banks had no plans for that either.  In April, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who leads a subcommittee within the U.S. House of Representatives’ Natural Resources Committee, recruited almost two dozen Democratic colleagues to urge federal environmental officials to devote further scrutiny to the consequences of cryptocurrency mining.  Raising capital has become difficult for miners this year as the price of bitcoin (BTC) has slumped and energy prices have skyrocketed. Miners have had to get creative, while various companies are attempting to fill the void for miners. Decentralized finance (DeFi) firm Maple Finance, for example, is starting a $300 million lending pool for mid-size bitcoin miners across North America and Australia.

But as inflation sits at persistently high levels, &apos;we&apos;ll need to bring the federal funds rate to a restrictive level and keep it there for some time,&apos; Powell said in the post-Fed decision press conference. Looking at intraday price action, bitcoin (BTC-USD), +2.4%, initially fell to sub-$19K moments after the Fed&apos;s rate hike, only to shoot back up to $19.44K at 3:23 p.m. ET. Similarly, ether (ETH-USD), +0.2%, dipped to as low as $1.32K before rebounding to $1.35K at the time of writing. Given crypto&apos;s relatively strong relationship with stocks over the past year, its not surprising to see equities move in a similar fashion during Wednesday&apos;s session.

42416186,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubU2B,1663787403,Bitcoin Lightning-Enabled ‘Listen-to-Earn’ Podcast App Gets an Upgrade,"Bitcoin listen-to-earn podcast app, Fountain Podcasts, now allows its listeners to get paid in bitcoin (BTC) for their first hour of listening per day.  Founded last year, Fountain uses the Lightning Network – a layer 2 network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that helps make bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper – to pay listeners in bitcoin. Users get rewarded for listening to podcasts, engaging with promotional content, referring friends and creating user generated content.  Read more: THNDR Games Launches Play-to-Earn Bitcoin Solitaire Mobile Game  According to Fountain, its previous system, “Flow,” wasn't intuitive. Listeners felt the mechanics behind the model were vague and unrewarding.  “We’ve been looking closely at the data and gathering lots of useful feedback from users. … Clearly the Flow system has not been working. This is why we are launching a new earning system that is more simple, intuitive and transparent. Most importantly, it will allow users to earn more over time,” the company stated in a blog post.  How does Fountain work?  Nick Malster and Oscar Merry founded Fountain in 2021 after being inspired by Adam Curry’s Podcasting 2.0 project, an initiative that seeks to advance and decentralize podcasting. They combined this inspiration with their passion for Bitcoin (and some pre-seed funding from crypto investor Anthony Pompliano) and Fountain Podcasts was born.  “We saw what Adam Curry was doing with Podcast Index – the idea that value can be sent from the listener to the creator directly as they listen. So we thought, what if we can … allow podcast listeners to earn bitcoin as they're listening?” said Malster in an interview with CoinDesk.  For listeners  In order to get paid, listeners download the Fountain app and start listening to their favorite podcast shows. The podcast selection on Fountain is similar to traditional podcast apps like Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Users earn satoshis or “sats” (100 millionth of a bitcoin) at a random rate for their first hour of listening. Payment is made to a built-in wallet hosted by Fountain.     Users can also earn bitcoin by listening to promoted content and referring friends and family to Fountain. Earned bitcoin can be transferred out or used to pay for likes and comments. Users can also fund their in-app wallet with BTC if they want to increase their engagement level.  “Withdrawals are not available immediately but are unlocked after further listening. If you listen to podcasts regularly, you will be able to cash out within a week or so,” Malster told CoinDesk. (Fountain wouldn’t disclose the minimum threshold for withdrawals.)  More creative listeners can create clips of their favorite episodes and, if other listeners engage with those clips (by liking or commenting), the creators of the clips receive bitcoin from that engagement. Clips can be created, edited and published within the app for free.  Read more: Move Over Ethereum – Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Has Apps Too  For podcasters  Podcasters get paid when listeners choose to pay them. First, a podcast creator must download Fountain and “claim” their show. Podcasts are distributed via publicly available RSS feeds that have emails associated with them. (RSS feeds are online files with content that continuously updates.) Access to an email associated with a podcast feed allows you to claim that podcast.  Once a show has been claimed, the owner can automatically earn bitcoin whenever listeners elect to pay a small streaming rate (sats per minute) to support the show or when listeners pay to post comments (known as “boosts” in the Fountain app).  Fountain’s business model  Fountain also offers a premium version for a monthly fee. The subscription fee allows listeners to create custom playlists and send payments without incurring transaction fees.  “So with Fountain Premium, you get a few additional features, some new clipping tools, the ability to create playlists of your clips. But, again, the revenue that we get from Fountain Premium goes back into paying users,” Malster said.  Fees are Fountain’s lifeblood. The company makes money by taking a cut of all payments. For example, when non-premium users send payments to support podcasters, Fountain takes a cut. The company also takes a 20% fee from funds paid by podcasters who want to promote their content. The non-conventional aspect of its business model is built on maintaining a budget to pay listeners.  “That money goes back into paying listeners. So we really optimize our business model to be able to continue paying our regular listeners who come to Fountain every day, to allow them to keep on earning,” Malster said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/21/bitcoin-lightning-enabled-listen-to-earn-podcast-app-gets-an-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2772a74330f92d64f6ac0a5816ea4821d1b309d4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421450,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMcH,1663785291,"Privacy-Enabled Crypto Applications Are Coming for Enterprise, but Not Overnight","My single biggest strategic goal is to build out and industrialize secure, private business applications that run on public blockchains, and the team at EY has been making steady progress for the last five years.  Our zero-knowledge proof Nightfall technology is coming on-stream and the first applications that enable it are not far behind.  Despite this enormous progress, it’s important to temper expectations because enterprise systems behave very differently from consumer products. Buyers operate with different reasoning and have different metrics and standards for success. There are five challenges I see in the industrializing and scaling process ahead.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  The most important one is simply that enterprise sales and adoption cycles are relatively slow. No, your corporate client isn’t going to click OK, give you access to their address book and let you DM all their suppliers!  Enterprise software cycles often take about six months for the selling, another two to three months for initial implementation and often another 12-18 months to scale the rollout. It’s not uncommon for major enterprise implementations to take up to two years from start to finish.  It takes a bit longer to go through the product engineering process as well. One of the biggest challenges I foresee is the fine-grained management of data privacy as companies start to bring their business ecosystems onto Ethereum. If you’re moving a supply chain, who gets to see what? Should the manufacturer be allowed to see details on every supplier back in the chain routinely, or only in an emergency?  Sometimes suppliers have their own proprietary relationships with suppliers that they don’t want to disclose. The more complicated the rules that buyers and suppliers want to impose, the tougher it will be to design information infrastructure to handle these complexities.  We anticipate a blend of on-chain and off-chain, mutable and immutable data going into this process. Designing the details, prototyping, testing and then scaling these solutions will take time.  See also: Why Crypto Should Support the American Data Privacy and Protection Act | Opinion  Another critical hurdle we face is that on-chain privacy systems are not yet complete. Nightfall gives us the ability to move fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFT) around under privacy.  The engineering roadmap for Nightfall alone is substantial. We have already developed tools for verifying identities and tracking stolen NFTs (and insuring, canceling and replacing them, all under privacy), but they are yet to be fully implemented in the production version.  Nightfall just covers moving tokens. It unlocks several business cases like inventory management but it doesn’t support complex business logic. For that, new tools are under development that will allow us to compile standard solidity contracts into zero knowledge circuits.  Once we can build complex business logic like volume discounts and rebates, we can start to implement typical enterprise business agreements in procurement, for example. Then it will be possible to not only capture the movement of assets but also the smart contracts that govern ordering and payment as well.  Even once it is possible to handle both logic and transfers under privacy, constraints will remain. The biggest one we foresee is that privacy systems “leak” data. Transferring assets into and out of a privacy layer, for example, leaves a trail.  Do this enough times or in the absence of other parties doing similar transactions and it starts to become possible to make educated guesses about who is doing what on-chain.  Finally, there is the matter of scale and compute capacity. Some of our largest enterprise clients are contemplating supply chain networks that will generate around two million transactions a day. At a transaction cost of 1 cent, that adds up to $20,000 per day in gas fees, which is about $7 million a year. This is not sustainable with all of the other expenses enterprises face. Given the volumes involved for larger enterprises, transaction costs must come down another order of magnitude at least.  For prices far below 1 cent per transaction, this implies a technical solution that looks like a layer 3 network handling most of the supply chain transfers. Keep in mind that as you bring on a whole network or industry, the total transaction volumes might be as much as 100 million a day.  As whole industries embrace blockchains for supply chain operations, the volumes and scaling will start looking like consumer payments volumes on credit card networks. In other words, very big.  Solvable problems  Every single one of these problems is solvable – and there are already solutions on paper or in test for each one. Of course, they will not all work on the first try and some of them will prove to be impractical. I believe all these issues will be solved over the next two to three years.  As we get more direct experience and comfort operating with privacy-based solutions, the pace at which solutions are developed will start to accelerate.  As with all big industry transformations, there is a kind of relativity theory of time involved. For those who are not following the space, they will be stunned by how quickly solutions mature and emerge. For those of us knee-deep in the design work, it will feel like several lifetimes.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/21/privacy-enabled-crypto-applications-are-coming-for-enterprise-but-not-overnight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e41dfdc862a162a5c707c8ac33ebfa67e8dc12fc-2048x1480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393955,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdESt,1663784442,"Amid Market Rout, Crypto Miners Are Still Building","Throughout the summer, CoinDesk traveled to two U.S. states to visit bitcoin (BTC) mines to see how, even in the midst of a crypto winter, miners are still building data centers to power the Bitcoin network.  Bitcoin miners have had a tough few months as the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency has dropped precipitously. With low bitcoin prices, miners’ revenues have diminished, and some have been forced to sell their mined tokens, machines and even facilities for cash to run their operations.  On top of that, the Biden administration on Sept. 8 dropped a report calling for industry standards to limit cryptocurrencies’ environmental footprint. Should these fail, authorities and legislators in the U.S. should consider measures to limit or eliminate energy-intensive proof-of-work algorithms that bitcoin miners use to drive the Bitcoin network, the report recommended.  Still, bitcoin miners are busy building out more capacity. Visiting these sites shows how the industry in the U.S. is continuously iterating. Mining data centers come in many shapes and sizes, depending on the location and available energy supply. Miners have been at the forefront of trying various innovative permutations of data centers, such as immersion cooling, that are used for other purposes, too.  These buildouts have borne fruit for the network, with computing power steadily growing over the past few months.  Merkle Standard and Bitmain facility in Washington  Near Washington state’s border with Idaho lies a 30-year-old paper mill that has been closed since 2020. It is situated close to a river and has its own water treatment facilities, but little other than homes is around its remote location. It’s just about the last place where you’d expect to find a bitcoin mine testing some of the world’s most innovative mining rigs, but there it is.  The facility is a co-venture between private bitcoin miner Merkle Standard and Bitmain, the world’s largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining rigs. The site is currently capped at operating at 100 megawatts (MW), about the annual capacity of 10 homes in the U.S., and has the electrical infrastructure to reach 225 MW, Merkle Standard Chief Operating Officer Monty Stahl told CoinDesk during a site visit.  The water treatment facility is no miscellaneous accessory. The site is a testing ground for Bitmain’s S19 XP Hydro, a mining machine that cools itself using water pipes that run near the processor chips.  In order to run these machines, “you need to understand and respect water chemistry,” Stahl said. Operating these pricey rigs with the right type of water is key to their longevity and efficiency, he added.  “In my opinion, this is superior technology and more scalable than immersion,” because the chips aren’t sunk into chemical blends, said Stahl.  The site manager also takes pride in the blue collar talent that he inherited from the mill. He is often amazed looking at how the people that run the water treatment plant do things, he said.  Most of the mining, however, takes place outside of the paper mill, in Bitmain’s Antbox mining containers. These are shipping containers that have been repurposed to hosting mining machines. Merkle Standard has preserved the paper mill and plans to reopen it. About 150 people were employed there, he notes.  Walking through the cavernous halls of the paper mill, steps echoing, feels like something out of a horror movie. Time stopped when the paper mill closed due to bankruptcy in 2020, but it never started again. A few details in the space are stark reminders of the people who are no longer there: a microscope standing upright at the lab ready to be used, a plaque commemorating the one-millionth ton of newsprint produced in 1994, a board noting the longest-serving employees.  “It’s humbling to work here every day” and to be reminded of what this place had meant for generations of people that worked there, said Stahl.  CleanSpark, Atlanta Area, Georgia  CleanSpark (CLSK) was founded in the late 1980s as a software company, only to meander from one business to another; in the middle of the last decade, it was an alternative energy company. Its evolution as a bitcoin miner is apparent across two sites in Georgia.  At College Park, near Atlanta’s Hartsfield airport – the world’s biggest by passenger traffic – is a 47 MW bitcoin mine divided into four parts.  The site was originally a traditional data center with about 50 clients, which have slowly been leaving the building. About six are left, including the city of College Park. Once they are gone, the building will be retrofitted with immersion-cooled bitcoin miners, said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark. The building uses what looks like air-conditioning equipment to cool down the machines; cold air is pumped through vents placed in front of the racks where the mining rigs sit.  Just next door is another bitcoin mine that uses evaporation cooling. One of the walls of this building is a kind of perforated wet wall the air goes through before coming into the building, its temperature dropping as it goes through the water, which in turn evaporates. On another wall are fans to pull the air into the room. When water evaporates from a surface, the surface’s temperature drops, much like when sweating during a run. The company says it plans on eventually retiring this system for another type of evaporative cooling.  A few mining containers made by Bitmain and called AntBoxes sit outside the building, which work similarly to the evaporation cooling building; their back walls are fitted with streaks of a cardboard-like material where the steam comes through.  The final part of the College Park facility of which the CleanSpark team is proudest is a set of air-cooled containers running outside a building the company has designed, laid up in two stories. This is the loudest part of the facility, which is why the company built a sound-diminishing wall and planted trees around this building.  The temperature changes every few seconds as one walks through what the company calls “Clean Block.” Hot air comes out of one side of the containers and cool air comes into the other. It’s like walking through a supermarket with an open freezer door in one aisle and a hot lamp heating food immediately in the next.  About 40 minutes away, in Norcross, is CleanSpark’s newer facility. Using “immersion cooling,” the mining rigs, with their fans removed, are immersed in a mineral oil in big tanks. As the liquid heats up from the heat of the machines, it rises and spills over and is directed into a cooling system.  Instead of loud fans, “it’s like being in a spa,” remarked Matthew Schultz. He wasn’t wrong. The sound of the mineral oil flowing does sound like a relatively quiet indoor fountain.  Bitfarms, Moses Lake, Washington  “That’s an old semiconductor plant,” said Jayden Perry excitedly. The manager of the Bitfarms (BITF) sites in Moses Lake, Washington, was pointing to what looked like a steel and concrete giant sleeping in a golden wheat field, right by one of the Bitfarms facilities. The friendly regional manager admitted that he likes learning about now-abandoned industrial facilities in Washington’s agricultural heartland.  The Canadian mining company bought two sites in November 2021 from an undisclosed party and is working to revamp them to Bitfarms’ standards. The sites are all air-cooled, meaning they use the outside air and sets of fans to keep the temperature low, as temperatures most of the year are cool in this part of the country. One part of the revamp project is to change and organize the cabling of the racks so that the machines aren’t buried behind a web of dusty cables. Another is to install Antminer S19J Pro miners.  The two sites, which total 20 MW and around 6,100 machines, run on hydropower supplied by the Grand Coulee dam, the biggest in the U.S. by power produced.  The Bitfarms facilities aren’t the most exciting or innovative of the bunch, but they are nonetheless part of the network of computers that keeps bitcoin going. The sites are also indicative of a trend that has just started amid the crypto winter: consolidation. Smaller operators are increasingly struggling to break even and are forced to liquidate their facilities, opening up the market to well-capitalized firms looking to buy new sites. The mining firm is also expanding across four countries – the other three being Canada, Paraguay, and Argentina – in order to shield itself from geographic risks.  Read more: Bear Market Could See Some Crypto Miners Turning to M&A for Survival  The bitcoin mines on our latest trip show something that is often forgotten: While supporting a decentralized infrastructure revolutionizing finance, these facilities are just huge, noisy data centers that consume a lot of power.  Miners are essentially working on data center design, and the technology going into these facilities, like cooling, wiring and managing the machines, could all be used in data centers beyond crypto.  As much as the Bitcoin network is in many senses designed to consume a lot of energy, mining firms have a built-in incentive to keep their costs low – or risk falling behind a very competitive market. This pushes them to try out different ways to build and operate data centers; from mining at the edges of the world, like Siberia, to plunging millions of dollars of equipment into mineral oil to keep them cool.  Some miners, like Hive Blockchain and Hut 8, which were not included in this story, are already trying to diversify into other data centers like those processing artificial intelligence and cloud computing.  Perhaps in just a few years, your Google Maps directions or your Yelp reviews could be processed in a data center that was inspired by bitcoin mines.

42416185,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubTx9,1663784148,Fed Hikes Rates to Highest Since 2007; Bitcoin Slides Toward $19K,"In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point), marking the third consecutive time this year that central bankers decided for a hike of that magnitude – and stiffening headwinds in the bitcoin market.  The federal funds rate will rise to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest since late 2007. The rate had stayed near zero for more than two years. Traders are currently betting that the federal funds rate will go above 4.25% before central bankers pause the campaign.  Once the terminal rate – still a matter of disagreement among central bankers – is reached, some economists project it will likely stay at that level until inflation comes down significantly, possibly to the Fed’s target rate of 2%. Yet, projections by the Federal Reserve's own top officials are estimating rate increases through 2023.  ""If the Fed remains hawkish, we are likely to see markets test lower lows and remain muted until inflation figures appear to start improving,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin (BTC) whipsawed in the hours after the announcement, but sold off later in the afternoon along with U.S. stocks. As of press time, bitcoin was changing hands just below $19,000. As recently as last week, the largest cryptocurrency had traded above $22,000.  FOMC statement  ""Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,"" according to the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a group of Fed officials who sets monetary policy.  The decision comes after the August consumer price index (CPI), released last week, showed that inflation, excluding energy and food prices, rose 0.6% from the month before.  The worse-than-expected report kindled speculation that the U.S. central bank might raise rates for a full percentage point, or 100 basis points. More recently, the CME FedWatch tool showed that traders were pricing in a 18% chance for a full percentage point hike.  A 1% hike would have been “radical and a signal to markets that the country's central bank has lost control and is in panic mode, and that the likelihood of a recession has just increased considerably,” said Scott MacDonald, chief economist at Smith's Research & Gradings.  With an increase of 75 basis points, the Fed stays in line with the magnitude of recent rate increases by the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada.  What's next  Federal Reserve board members and presidents doubled down on further interest rate hikes in their economic outlook, with no pivot in sight for 2023.  ""My main message has not changed at all"" since the Fed's economic symposium last month in Jackson Hole,"" Powell said during a press conference following the interest rate decision. ""The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2% and we will keep at it until the job is done.""  At the end of this year, the federal funds rate is expected to reach 4.4%, indicating the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates at the next FOMC meetings. The Federal Reserve does not expect rate cuts until 2024, damping hopes of eased financial conditions anytime soon.  Powell, speaking about financial conditions, said that ""what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level.""  ""Today, we've just moved probably into the very, the very lowest level of what might be restrictive,"" he added.  Traders in traditional markets are already betting that a 75 basis point rate hike is the mostly likely scenario at the FOMC’s next monetary-policy meeting in November. Just one month ago, the odds of a hike of that magnitude were seen as nil.  What it means for crypto markets  Crypto markets were volatile in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision. Bitcoin dropped below $19,000 but soon rebounded to $19,500, then slid to $18,900. Equities also saw wild swings during Powell's press conference. At press time, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq traded at around where they opened on Wednesday.  ""Markets are crazy in the short-term,"" said Alexandre Lores, Quantum Economics' director of blockchain market research. ""Over a longer period I see this as a neutral or bearish move, and expect BTC and ETH to respond in a neutral or bearish fashion.""  ""This is yet another reminder that crypto moves at the whims of the Fed,"" said Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko. ""We saw this just last week when there was a sharper price reaction to the CPI release than to the [Ethereum upgrade] Merge. I don’t foresee crypto, especially BTC and ETH, bucking the Fed’s influence any time soon.""  Joshua Lim, a crypto derivatives trading specialist, said a 75 basis point hike would be “well received,” given that the probability of a larger move was priced in by traders as well.  “With Fed terminal rates in the mid-4% range, one thing we continue to hear is markets’ interest in real-world yields on-chain. This is a growing area, with on-chain credit to electronic market makers being the bulk of it,” he said.  Jocelyn Yang contributed to this article.

42393778,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAytX,1663782934,Nasdaq Joins BlackRock as TradFi Defies the Bear Market and Embraces Crypto,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett may still hate cryptocurrencies, but other stalwarts of traditional finance (TradFi) are following his maxim to be ""fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful,"" piling into digital assets following this year’s rout.  The crypto winter – which has driven bitcoin (BTC) down more than 70% since its November peak – has been a painful reminder of how volatile the industry can be. TradFi’s commitments to crypto amid the decline, however, makes this winter stand out from prior ones.  Most recently, Nasdaq (NDAQ), the second-biggest U.S. stock market operator, announced this week that it will start a crypto custody service – finance jargon for holding onto investors’ assets, keeping them safe – as it aims to cash in on burgeoning demand for crypto among institutional investors. The move came after BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, said last month that it will offer cryptocurrencies to its institutional clients, and Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., which processes essentially all U.S. stock trades, released its own blockchain as it looks to speed up the settlement of trades.  Those are just some of the big TradFi players entering the sector this year, but what they all have in common is that they are citing strong demand from institutions. With smaller investors still licking their wounds from this year’s price plunge, the narrative has shifted largely to how TradFi can profit from this new industry, embracing a field that many say is the future of finance.  Cash on the sideline  TradFi is probably far from done getting into crypto. And with Nasdaq and other large TradFi players entering the crypto industry during a bear market, it seems obvious the sector is anything but dead.  ""We think that there’s a lot of investors on the sidelines,"" Jamil Nazarali, CEO of the new crypto exchange EDX Markets, said in a CoinDesk TV interview this week. Nazarali himself just made the leap from TradFi. He previously held a senior role at Citadel Securities, one of the biggest U.S. stock traders. And EDX is part of the TradFi-comes-to-crypto trend, given that its backers include Citadel Securities and other big firms like Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments.  Large investors seeking to get into crypto are likely to want to do so through their existing partners, instead of through a new broker or other trading-services provider, Nazarali said. Many TradFi banks are extending their reach into crypto-linked products to offer their institutional clients options to diversify into the industry. On Wednesday, French lender Societe Generale, which has been actively expanding its digital assets offerings, said it’s offering new services for asset-management companies looking to invest in the industry.  Nasdaq’s move this week is ""going to bring more institutional players in and we welcome it,"" Nazarali said. Overall, he believes that having TradFi slowly dipping its toes into crypto is a good start and will eventually lead to more widespread crypto adoption.  Read more: New Crypto Exchange Aims to Bring What Old Crypto Hates: Wall Street Intermediaries  ‘Regulatory clarity’  One of the main hurdles preventing mass adoption among the TradFi crowd is uncertainty around regulations. Many crypto services are already waiting on regulators for any indications of what legislation to adhere to, but the process is moving slowly. In the U.S., there are questions about which regulator will oversee which crypto assets – and how stringently.  '""You see entrepreneurs in the space that have been here for several years, waiting for regulatory clarity, and they’re struggling,"" said Bruno Ramos de Sousa, head of global expansion at Hashdex, a crypto asset-management platform.  Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which shares responsibility for crypto oversight in the U.S., has argued that the crypto industry doesn't need any more specific guidance. This leaves traditional investors confused as regulators try to catch up with how to properly govern the industry, a situation that could undermine the U.S. role as a global financial powerhouse if it doesn’t provide more clarity and crypto becomes an even more important market.  Read more: Crypto Doesn't Need More Guidance, SEC Chair Gensler Says  The Apple example  Another question: Will TradFi take over crypto, making it look more like old-school finance, or will it go the other direction, with crypto fundamentally reshaping how finance works? With conventional finance players coming into digital assets and regulators bringing a more conservative way of governing markets, there is a chance crypto will be absorbed by Wall Street-types and resemble the finance status quo.  Crypto firms are moving into TradFi’s turf, too. The U.S. division of exchange giant FTX, for instance, has introduced stock trading this year. Big crypto exchanges have enough money to buy stock exchanges, Ramos de Sousa argued. And there’s talk of tokenizing all manner of traditional assets, essentially bringing a crypto ethos to the broader financial system.  Buffett provides a lesson here, too. For years, he famously avoided tech stocks, arguing understanding them was outside of his grasp. And then several years ago, he dove into Apple (AAPL), one of the techiest of stocks, recognizing that the strength of its brand among consumers was similar to the dominant position other companies he liked had.  His switch was gigantic; Apple is now one of largest investments of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), the conglomerate Buffet founded. Buffett’s move into an industry he was once hesitant about could point the way for TradFi in crypto.  “It’s probably the best business I know in the world,” Buffett once said on CNBC about Apple. “I should have appreciated it earlier.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/21/nasdaq-joins-blackrock-as-tradfi-defies-the-bear-market-and-embraces-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42e9dd7f5ba5a9d2fa1240ee35dac638bf27f52d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The lawsuit relates to the Texas Whinstone bitcoin mine, slated to be one of the world's largest by power capacity, which Riot acquired from Northern Data just last year for $651 million – $80 million cash and 11.8 million shares of Riot stock.  In the lawsuit filed on Sept. 7 in a Delaware court, Riot claims that Germany's Northern Data failed to disclose $84 million in liabilities to a third party, which the third party asked for in April of this year. At the time, Riot was trying to negotiate the final closing price for the acquisition but Northern Data ""delayed and obfuscated,"" the lawsuit claims. Riot also says that Northern Data continues to stall negotiations and has delayed paying almost $114 million it owes to Riot.  ""Northern Data rejects the claims made and management does not expect this matter to distract Northern Data from its overall business strategy,"" said Jens-Philipp Briemle, head of investor relations at the German firm.  Briemle added that the lawsuit is only seeking to ""submit certain claims to an independent accountant for resolution"" and is not seeking $114 million in damages.  The Whinstone mine is entangled in a separate legal battle with one of its hosting clients, Japanese GMO Internet.

42421449,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMZB,1663779649,A Call to the SEC: Treat Crypto Assets as if Clients Matter,"Last week marked an exciting moment in technological innovation. The Ethereum blockchain – a global, decentralized computer that anyone can use – changed the way it verifies transactions in a long-anticipated update called the Merge.  Despite opening additional opportunities for innovation, this dramatic change highlights legal uncertainty for crypto investors and asset managers. Strict adherence to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) “custody rule” would suggest asset managers, acting on behalf of investors, stay away from crypto staking. This is at odds with the fiduciary duty asset managers owe their clients by denying a legal and potentially lucrative revenue stream. It’s a catch-22.  Scott Walker is chief compliance officer at Andreessen Horowitz and Neel Maitra is a partner in the Washington D.C. office of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati.  What the law dictates is clear: Registered advisers must comply with the SEC’s custody rule, which is designed to reduce the risk of misappropriation of investor holdings. More specifically, this rule usually requires that advisers place client assets (funds and securities) with a “qualified custodian” (often a bank or broker-dealer), and that an independent public accountant periodically verify the assets.  Unfortunately, regulatory uncertainty in this area frustrates even the most compliance-minded asset manager. Only a handful of clearly qualified crypto custodians operate in the U.S. – and these few qualified custodians service only a limited number of crypto assets. Notably, when one of these qualified custodians provides crypto custodial services, their services seldom extend to staking, voting or other participatory features of crypto assets.  Responsible investment advisers who manage crypto assets have, when possible, already been staking assets for years on other blockchains.  Though digital assets as a whole are often considered risky investments, there’s an argument to be made that avoiding crypto staking abdicates an obligation to clients. Investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to optimize portfolios and, where appropriate, make informed governance decisions for their investments.  For example, a manager that does not vote for the shares it manages in General Electric (GE) or IBM (IBM) or declines to take dividends, runs the risk of legal action from its clients and regulators alike. Crypto asset holders deserve similar protections from their investment advisers.  See also: SEC's Crypto Guidance Pushes US Banks to Rethink Custody  Yet, asset managers are caught in a bind. The custody rule continues to require advisers to custody crypto assets with custodians who may have inadequate arrangements for staking, voting or other participatory features. Custodians, like all institutions, have limited time and resources to onboard assets and attendant features.  Holders of crypto assets are the greatest losers from all of this – deprived of robust crypto custodial solutions, deprived of the legal certainty that would require their advisers to stake and/or vote their assets and deprived of a reliable return.  It doesn’t have to be this way.  This dilemma – drawn into sharper focus by the Merge – is one the SEC is uniquely positioned to resolve. Unlike the plethora of complex policy issues facing crypto, this issue could be settled easily. The SEC could acknowledge the novel features of certain crypto assets, such as staking and voting, and adjust the existing custody rule accordingly.  Updating the SEC’s custody rule is consistent with, and arguably compelled by, two fundamental parts of the agency’s mission; namely, protecting investors and maintaining orderly markets.  Given the scarcity of crypto custodial solutions, the SEC could clarify that, in certain circumstances, registered investment advisers (that are not qualified custodians) can use a combination of software and comprehensive internal controls to self-custody crypto. This doesn’t have to result in any relaxation of custodial rules – in fact, we strongly believe the SEC should put in place robust, technology-neutral principles regarding crypto custodianship.  For instance, the SEC could adopt or modify rules that require:  Transparency around self-custodied crypto holdings so that advisory clients can independently review their holdings via the internet  Investment advisers who self-custody crypto to periodically assess the quality of the software they use and to have some legal recourse for any relevant service provider’s commercial and technological failures  Advisers to provide robust and clear disclosures regarding the risks of crypto custody and the security measures they adopt, as well as to have the appropriate insurance for cyber risks and audit arrangements around crypto  We know these measures are feasible because the best crypto asset managers already have one or more of them in place. Ideally, the SEC would backstop and police these measures through its examination program, which already has the capabilities to evaluate and assess crypto holdings and risk programs.  See also: Crypto Doesn't Need More Guidance, SEC Chair Gensler Says  Indeed, the SEC has a long history of performing robust examinations of custody practices and has routinely brought enforcement actions to protect investors. These are good investor protections, and it seems reasonable to hold crypto asset managers to the same standards as other investment advisers.  If the SEC really wants to protect investors in crypto assets in the same way it protects investors in more conventional investments, as its chairman recently declared, then implementing the suggestions set out above would allow the commission to demonstrate that in a meaningful way.  The SEC has the ability to solve this issue on behalf of investors. We hope it elects to do so.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Neel Maitra, Scott Walker",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/21/a-call-to-the-sec-treat-crypto-assets-as-if-clients-matter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75cd71fb79224101d5757eba6484802e3ba7d568-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wright’s lawyers told an Oslo court Wednesday in the seventh and final day of a civil case brought by Twitter personality Hodlonaut.  District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen must now decide whether Hodlonaut’s comments that Wright was a “fraud” were lawful free speech. Wright has said he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous author of the 2008 white paper that began the cryptocurrency revolution, but has not been able to prove this claim. He told the court last week that he had destroyed some of the key evidence he could use to verify that he was indeed Satoshi.  The Norwegian constitution and European Convention on Human Rights, both of which protect free speech while also safeguarding a private life, have their limits, Wright’s lawyers argued.  Read more: Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi? Hodlonaut and Wright Go to Trial to Find Out  Tweets sent in 2019 by Hodlonaut, whose identity has since been revealed as Magnus Granath, were a “lasting, well-thought-through and reckless campaign that others were to take part in,” Wright’s lawyer Halvor Manshaus told the court. “To call somebody a fraud and a scammer – that, I would say, is harassment …That is not protected by freedom of expression.”  Halvard Helle, who like Manshaus is a partner at Schødt law firm in Oslo, said the series of tweets proclaiming Wright a fraud constituted “persistent ongoing attacks” which go “way beyond what should be the climate of expression in a liberal democracy.”  Hodlonaut vs. Wright: Summing up the facts  The case may hinge on whether Granath’s references to Wright as “mentally ill” and a “scammer” should be taken as statements of fact, capable of being proven or mere value judgments.  Much legal argument was also dedicated to deciding whether the statements need to be deemed true now or to have been believable back in 2019. If so, that could reduce the weight given to expert forensic evidence presented to the court that suggest Wright’s documents were forgeries – testimony not available to Granath at the time.  Read more: Craig Wright’s Abnormal Psychology  The trial was attended by Wright’s legal team of eight, Granath’s of two, journalists and a class of around a dozen students. The students, there to learn about the practical application of Norwegian compensation claims, didn’t seem too engaged by the ins and outs of the foundation of Bitcoin. (One of them told CoinDesk at lunchtime that the proceedings had been “all a bit boring,” and they did not show up for the afternoon.)  While the objective of the case is not purely to test the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, Granath’s lawyers are seeking an assurance that it was lawful to state that Wright is fraudulently trying to prove he is Bitcoin’s inventor. Wright’s lawyers, meanwhile, emphasized that the Australian had never wanted to be publicly badged as Satoshi.  “Mr. Wright is a private person,” said Helle, adding that Wright had “felt an intense distaste for being outed as Satoshi … it happened against his will.”  Nonetheless, Wright’s lawyers drew attention to the character witnesses who supported Wright’s claims to be Satoshi – including testimony from colleague Stefan Matthews, chairman of the board of nChain.  It was “unthinkable” that Matthews would have cooperated with Wright for several years if Wright hadn’t really been the founder of the cryptocurrency, Helle said. (Granath’s lawyers said Matthews’ evidence was “absolutely not trustworthy” on the basis that he profited from Wright’s claim.)  A private proof offered to prominent Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen that Wright possesses Satoshi’s private keys must have been genuine because Andresen had used a brand-new laptop and wallet for the test, Manshaus said – but the lawyer seemed aggrieved that the challenges still didn’t stop there. (Andresen later said he believed he had been fooled by Wright.)  “For each step you take to prove that Craig Wright is Satoshi, there’s criticism,” Manshaus said.  An unfair target?  Counsel for Granath, meanwhile, emphasized the holes in Wright’s claims and accused Wright of picking Granath unfairly as a target in a campaign of his own.  “It has not been proven in any shape or form that these tweets have had an impact,” Ørjan Salvesen Haukaas, Granath’s lawyer, said, adding that Wright was “trying to use Granath as an example to other people.”  Wright “has used lies and manipulation in order to try to prove that he is in fact Satoshi Nakamoto … he gave incorrect information on several counts to the court” in relation to the matter, Haukaas added. “Nothing speaks in favor of Wright being Satoshi.”  Evidence heard earlier by the court cited anomalies in the fonts in a document that purported to be an early draft of Satoshi’s 2008 white paper.  While Judge Engebrigtsen gave few clues as to her views, she did appear to struggle with exactly what Haukaas was asking her to decide in a case which, in part, has been brought to halt a parallel libel case being heard in the U.K. If Engebrigsten finds in favor of Hodlonaut, Wright will not be allowed to sue for damages in connection with the tweets, effectively ending the U.K. suit.  “I can’t make any decision for a claim in the U.K.,” Engebrigtsen said. She then appeared to acknowledge Haukaas’ clarification that he was seeking to establish that there is no financial liability for damages due to the tweets.  Twitter insults  Granath’s lawyers cited legal precedents to show it was legitimate to criticize a public figure such as Wright, and that the strong tone of the 2019 messages was consistent with how people use Twitter – including Wright himself.  Previous evidence had shown Wright himself bandying insulting terms such as “cuck” and “soy boy.”  Indeed, Wright gave CoinDesk an example of his frank way of speaking as he left the courthouse.  “Ross Ulbricht is a piece of s***,” Wright told reporters, declining to interact with CoinDesk because, he claimed, the publication supports a campaign to free the incarcerated founder of the Silk Road contraband market. (CoinDesk almost never adopts a formal editorial position on issues, and it has not taken one on Ulbricht. The site has published an op-ed by his mother, part of a big tent of diverse contributors that also includes regulators and veterans of the intelligence community. CoinDesk has also interviewed her.)  Catch up on the trial thus far:  Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi?

42421443,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMV3,1663773700,Amazon and Wanda Sykes Think Spying on You Is Hilarious,"Next Monday, Sept. 26, will mark the premier of “Ring Nation,” which its producers describe as “a half-hour, studio-based series that gives audiences a daily dose of life's unpredictable, heartwarming and hilarious viral videos shared by people from their video doorbells, smart home cameras and more.”  The light tone is reflected in the choice of host, comedian Wanda Sykes. The videos will specifically come from Ring brand video devices, and the Amazon-owned company is a co-producer of the show.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Critics, however, are arguing the show is anything but a low-stakes revamp of “America’s Funniest Home Videos.” Technology advocacy groups Fight for the Future (FFF) and Media Justice instead allege that “Ring Nation” is “normalizing and promoting Amazon’s harmful network of surveillance cameras,” and that Ring’s Neighbors app “amplifies racial profiling and further subjects communities of color to racist policing and criminalization.”  Amazon acquired Ring for a reported $1.2 to $1.8 billion in 2018 as part of its larger strategic push into “smart home” devices and commercialized data gathering. Unlike traditional security systems, Ring doorbell cameras upload their video to Amazon’s servers. The full extent of Amazon’s use of those videos is unclear, but it is known that Amazon can and has accessed and shared them with police departments without a warrant or user consent. Ring has refused to even disclose how many users’ videos it has shared without permission. Installing a Ring camera on your own property, in short, borders on giving Amazon permission to do whatever it wants with the footage.  See also: Why Crypto Should Support the American Data Privacy and Protection Act | Opinion  FFF and Media Justice have launched a campaign for the show’s cancellation. IndieWire reports that a broader coalition of 40 activist groups have now signed on to the campaign, including the generally pro-video citizen journalism nonprofit WITNESS and the UCLA Center for Race and Digital Justice.  Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey (D) has also decried the show, saying, “Amazon appears to be producing an outright advertisement for its own Ring products and masking it as entertainment … The Ring platform has too often made over-policing and over-surveillance a real and pressing problem for America’s neighborhoods, and attempts to normalize these problems are no laughing matter.”  Instead of “America’s Funniest Home Videos,” “Ring Nation” might be much better compared to the 1990s poverty and brutality exploitation touchstone “Cops.” The show is co-produced by MGM subsidiary Big Fish Entertainment, formerly behind an even more exploitative riff on the “Cops” model called “LivePD,” which was, not coincidentally, cancelled in the summer of 2020 when George Floyd’s murder by police showed Americans (for really the first time ever, we swear) that police brutality existed. “Cops,” incredibly, is still in production, but only airs internationally, not in the U.S. The brutality of American policing, it seems, is still good entertainment in other countries, but all too real at home.  On a similar note, “Ring Nation” producers say the show is intended for syndication – that is, primarily terrestrial broadcast. There is no indication it will appear on Amazon’s streaming platform, suggesting that Amazon may be working to expand Ring’s market by targeting the show to lower-income viewers who aren’t yet Amazon customers – while hiding it from more-connected audiences such as the coastal media.  This makes Wanda Sykes’ involvement particularly objectionable. It seems obvious she’s being leveraged to mute objections from the Black communities most harmed by mass surveillance and police state paranoia. Organizers of the “Cancel Ring Nation” campaign point out that “footage from Ring cameras was used to track and monitor protesters who took to the streets, exercising their First Amendment rights, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder … Racial profiling and racist policing are core components of Ring’s business model, which profits off fear.”  See also: Zoom Has Privacy Issues, Here Are Some Alternatives  That is, Ring sells more surveillance devices when audiences are more afraid of their neighbors. So while the “Ring Nation” press announcement leans on wedding fails and cute animals caught on Ring cameras, you can bet the show will also traffic in “suspicious” characters “caught in the act” and other forms of fear mongering.  Shows like “Cops” are no longer palatable to American audiences because the U.S. policing agenda has been shown to be about serving the powerful and protecting them from the weak – especially the weakest of all. American police have killed 129 children across the U.S. since 2015, according to a database maintained by the Washington Post, a number worth remembering when Ring tries to sell itself with footage of cute trick-or-treaters.  Actual cops have squandered the deference once accorded them by society through corruption and incompetence. Amazon and founder Jeff Bezos would like to offer a friendlier vision of public safety – one based not on human relationships or community solidarity, but on artificial intelligence and omnipresent spying.

42393946,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdDYT,1663772824,"Crypto Remains a Priority for UK Under New Leader, Drawing Industry Excitement","The U.K. said it still plans on becoming a crypto hub despite a recent leadership shuffle, and industry advocates are thrilled.  Even with all of the change in its leadership, the U.K. government is set to press forward with former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak’s plans to turn the country into an international hub for crypto, Richard Fuller, the country’s new economic secretary to the Treasury, said at the U.K.’s first-ever crypto debate in Westminster last week.  The local blockchain community’s hopes for innovation-friendly regulations that could push the U.K.’s stagnant crypto industry forward were dented when Sunak stepped down from his position in July, and perhaps even more so when he lost to Liz Truss in the contest to be prime minister.  But Fuller's comments came as a “great signal of progress” to the crypto community, according to Baroness Manzila Uddin, co-chairwoman of a cross-party parliamentary group that’s focused on the metaverse and Web3.  Read more: With New Prime Minister, UK Still Wants to Be Crypto Hub: Treasury Official  In April, Sunak, along with Fuller’s predecessor, John Glen, made headlines when they announced their plans to turn the country into a crypto hub.  When the seemingly crypto-friendly Sunak resigned in July, Ian Taylor, executive director of CryptoUK, a London-based lobby group, told CoinDesk that it could simply mean Sunak and Glen will be back “in a different form.”  “However, you can say all of the hard work the community has done in the last two years educating Rishi Sunak and John Glen has now gone away,"" Taylor said at the time.  Little from Truss so far  Truss had revealed little about her stance on crypto aside from a couple of pro-innovation statements she made years ago.  Kwasi Kwarteng, Truss’ pick as finance minister, has likewise remained silent on crypto, although the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy he previously oversaw seemingly supported the development of blockchain technology.  “Clearly, it's good to see the continued statements of intent – with many in the industry perhaps fearing this was Sunak's baby, and scarce little from Truss herself in recent times,” Nick Jones, CEO of Zumo, a U.K.-based crypto wallet startup, told CoinDesk in a statement.  Sendi Young, managing director of U.K. and Europe at Ripple and Rushd Averroës, CEO of London-based crypto app Babb, said it is an exciting time for the U.K. crypto industry.  During last week’s crypto debate, Fuller said the government still plans to move forward with the new Financial Services and Markets bill, which seeks to regulate stablecoins. Those are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of other assets like gold or the U.S. dollar. Fuller also said a separate Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill will go ahead which could also give authorities the power to seize crypto assets tied to crime.  Fuller also echoed the government's goal of enforcing strict rules for crypto promotions in line with local ad regulations.  “The strategy outlined in April by Glen is still very much in play,” Taylor said in an email to CoinDesk.  But some worry that the U.K.’s plans for crypto aren’t enough to catch up with other countries.  “I am concerned that what has been offered to date has been a patchy and piecemeal approach to regulation, compared to the far more comprehensive proposals in, for example, the European Union’s draft regulation,” Peter Grant, a member of Parliament, said at the crypto debate.  In response to that concern, Fuller said that in the months ahead the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority, the country’s financial regulator, will study the broader implications of crypto.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/21/crypto-remains-a-priority-for-uk-under-new-leader-drawing-industry-excitement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b20c120a3a4888657da884973019907626fcd24-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416178,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubTNv,1663772232,US Stablecoin Bill Negotiations Wrestled Over Digital Dollar Approval: Source,"Democrats pushed for a provision directing the U.S. Federal Reserve to move forward on a digital dollar, but the negotiations concluded with a new directive for another Fed study in this year’s legislative effort to regulate stablecoins, according to a person familiar with the talks.  A draft of the House bill, which is now circulating among lawmakers and the industry, won’t yet represent the authorization Fed officials have said they are waiting for from Congress before they decide to issue a central-bank digital currency (CBDC). The federal government has been inching closer to such an approval, with the U.S. Treasury Department recommending in a recent report that work on a digital dollar should continue while the executive branch also comes to a decision.  The important – though potentially fatally timed – House legislation is also said to maintain a role for state regulators and squeezes the ability to issue algorithmic stablecoins, though it is likely past the point at which it can become law this year.  The lawmakers negotiating the legislation are close to releasing the language that will be considered by the House Financial Services Committee in a markup as soon as next week, according to people poring over draft language circulated this week. While a committee-approved bill would be hard-pressed at this late stage to clear the further hurdles required – passage in the full House of Representatives and then Senate approval – some of the compromises made in this version could survive if the bill is negotiated again in next year’s congressional session.  Read more: House’s Stablecoin Bill May Face Fatal Delays for 2022 Progress  Negotiations had progressed quickly at first, but the talks stalled during the summer. Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California made a statement after that temporary impasse, saying the legislation would “require the Federal Reserve to research and develop a central bank digital currency.” The latest version only calls for the research.  A Waters spokesperson couldn’t be reached for comment.  Another of the sticking points for Republicans had been in maintaining a role for state regulators in overseeing nonbank financial firms issuing the tokens. The bill seems to have settled that issue by keeping the states involved in overseeing nonbank token issuers, which would also seek federal licensing. Banks issuing stablecoins would be supervised by their usual regulators.  Were the legislation to become law, it would mark the first major U.S. effort to regulate cryptocurrencies – even if it’s just one sector of the industry. Stablecoins are used as the less-volatile side of trades involving other crypto, and the tokens are usually tied to a steady asset such as the U.S. dollar.  “We're running out of time in this Congress, but I'm very hopeful that the Financial Services Committee might produce a stablecoin regulation bill,” Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a committee Democrat who leads one of its subcommittees, said in a recent CoinDesk interview. Himes said he’s hopeful that “if we don't actually get anything done in this Congress in a few months remaining that in the next Congress, we're in a position to do so.”  The midterm elections are now weeks away, which usually slams the brakes on new legislation.  “We do not see a path for Congress to enact stablecoin legislation this year as the Senate is far behind the House on this issue,” Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen, wrote in a Wednesday research note. “If the House votes, it will create a foundation for early action next year in the House regardless of which party controls the chamber.”  While a key Republican, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, had pushed a stablecoin bill with some similar provisions in the Senate this year, he is retiring from the Senate at year’s end.  Stablecoins have drawn serious attention from lawmakers and regulators as a potential source of wider financial risk, even before the failure of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST).  That spectacular collapse further cemented the federal government’s interest in regulating stablecoins, and algorithmic tokens were singled out as particularly problematic.  The legislation would generally require stablecoins to be fully backed by reserve assets. So-called “payments stablecoins” would be those supported by liquid assets, and their algorithmic cousins – referred to as “endogenously collateralized stablecoins” – would be restricted. Existing algo tokens would be grandfathered for two years while new issuance is shut off for the same period while regulators study them.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/21/us-stablecoin-bill-negotiations-wrestled-over-digital-dollar-approval-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24d8e623a494eb0e79fa9aa185391f7d10936feb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The services will allow the asset managers to offer crypto funds in a ""simple and adapted"" way within a framework that is compliant with European regulations, the bank said Wednesday.  The service has been adopted by French asset manager Arquant Capital SAS, which is opening a range of funds investing in crypto, starting with two products based on bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and derivatives.  The move by Societe Generale, which had over $1.6 trillion in assets as of 2021 and is among the largest banks in Europe, demonstrates the appetite by mainstream financial institutions to offer crypto-related services to their clients as demand increases.  This has been particularly prevalent among French banking heavyweights in recent months. In July, CoinDesk reported that BNP Paribas, France's largest bank, said it was entering into crypto custody in a partnership with Swiss digital asset safekeeping firm Metaco.

42411726,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXHF,1663769498,What Is Loopring and How Does it Work?,"Even though the Ethereum merge, the long-awaited transition of the blockchain to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, has been completed, issues remain with high transaction fees and congestion. One protocol that aims to help with these problems is the blockchain-based project Loopring (LRC).  Loopring has developed a layer 2, or companion system, technology to help Ethereum scale, or increase capacity, by as much as 1,000x, according to the former head of business. Not only that, but the improvements in scalability allegedly do not affect the Ethereum protocol’s security.  See Also: What Are Layer 2s and Why Are They Important?  What is the Loopring protocol?  Loopring is a program designed to work on top of Ethereum’s blockchain (a layer 1, or base, blockchain). This means that Loopring seeks to make the experience of using Ethereum faster by processing elements of Ethereum transactions on its own network. You can think of it as creating a side road off the main highway to help ease congestion.  Loopring’s developers claim this helps the protocol reach throughput approximately 1,000 times greater than Ethereum, with peaks of 2,025 transactions a second. Unlike Ethereum’s sky-high fees, transactions on Loopring cost less than a cent.  You may have heard of other blockchains, such as Avalanche and Solana, that also claim to be faster and cheaper than Ethereum. However, unlike Loopring, these are known as layer 1 blockchains. This simply means they are independent blockchains with their own validators, just like Ethereum.  Loopring’s token powers an eponymous decentralized exchange that lets you trade Ethereum tokens, like USDC, AAVE and ETH, at a fraction of the cost of decentralized applications native to the Ethereum blockchain, such as Uniswap.  Key features of Loopring  Loopring accomplishes its high throughput and low cost through something called zkRollups. Let’s break that down.  Zk stands for “zero-knowledge,” which itself is short for “zero-knowledge proofs.” This is a method of processing transactions privately. It allows one party to prove to another party that something is true without providing any extraneous information about the transaction itself.  A zero-knowledge proof could let you know that it is raining today without having to look out the window, or prove to a border control agent that you are eligible to enter the country without telling your name and address. Zero-knowledge proofs are important for cryptocurrency protocols that don’t want to leak excess information to third parties or trust a central organization in case something goes wrong.  Rollups are a type of scaling system that collects batches of transactions, then “rolls” them up into a single transaction and processes it on a base layer blockchain like Ethereum. Rollups are a way of cutting costs and increasing speeds because multiple transactions can be processed at once and split the cost of a single transaction.  ZkRollups combine both of these technologies. Looping describes it as “the most secure scaling mechanism the industry knows of, whereby users can access their assets in all circumstances.” It’s suitable for applications that require trustlessness, like decentralized exchanges or lenders.  See Also: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  Loopring’s token  The Loopring network is powered by its native utility token called loopring (also known by its ticker, LRC).  LRC launched in 2017 and primarily powers Loopring’s decentralized exchange , which launched in February 2020. When using the DEX, you have to pay in LRC each time you process a trade. Precisely 80% of the money goes to liquidity providers, and the remainder is split between insurers and Loopring’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).     What makes LRC price go up and down?  Like any cryptocurrency, LRC is highly volatile. LRC boomed at the end of October 2021, rising from $0.38 to all-time highs of $3.70 within a fortnight. Analysts linked the rising price to rumors that GameStop, the video game retailer that was central to a social media-fueled surge at the beginning of 2021, would use Loopring to create a marketplace for trading non-fungible tokens (NFT) – blockchain-based art. This rumor did prove to be true, as GameStop did launch its NFT marketplace using Loopring. This however has not driven the price to rebound to earlier highs. The price of LRC in 2022 has fallen steeply with the majority of tokens during the crypto bull market and has fallen to as low as 30 cents as of Sept. 2022.  More broadly, some analysts think LRC’s price is pegged to the success of Ethereum and rival scaling systems and layer 1 blockchains. Some people think the need for scaling will dissipate if Ethereum scales itself, while Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, thinks the two advancements will complement each other.",POSITIVE,ETH | LRC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LRC | TRADING | ZRX,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-loopring-and-whats-driving-its-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fe28c335eda260d9e138dba7ca3bc8aa500a687-1617x1855.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was holding steady at just above $19,000, as traders awaited an expected interest-rate hike later Wednesday by the Federal Reserve. (Scroll down to Market Moves for Omkar Godbole’s preview of the meeting.)  The largest cryptocurrency appeared to be moving in line with traditional markets, where investors were mostly staying on sidelines ahead of the meeting. The Fed decision is expected at 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC), followed by a press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.  Ether (ETH) was also little changed at just over $1,300 – ostensibly bringing relief to traders still reeling from last week’s 24% plunge, as the Ethereum blockchain successfully underwent its much-hyped Merge to a more energy-efficient system.  CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa reported that “funding rates” – which are similar to interest rates but which are what traders pay for leveraged bets on crypto exchanges – reverted to normal levels; which could be a sign that the ether market is turning less bearish  In the news, the stablecoin issuer Tether was ordered by a U.S. judge in New York to produce financial records relating to the backing of USDT.

Market Moves  Fed Preview: Bitcoin Investors to Look Past Jumbo Rate Hike and Focus on Economic Assessment and Borrowing Cost Estimates  By Omkar Godbole  With risky assets, including bitcoin, under pressure ahead of Wednesday's pivotal Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting, pundits think markets have already incorporated a super-sized rate hike.  So the focus will be on what the Fed says concerning the persistent core inflation (core inflation strips out the energy and food components), the labor market and the demand conditions that have remained stronger than policymakers judged in July.  ""The theme for tomorrow to me is not about 75 [basis point hike] or 100, even though I am in the 75 camp. The theme for tomorrow is that the Fed thought the economic weakness we saw in Q2 was going to assist them in getting inflation back to target and they no longer have confidence,"" Jon Turek, author of the Cheap Convexity blog, wrote in a note to subscribers Tuesday.  The Fed saw evidence of a slowing economy at its July meeting, but the data released since then suggests otherwise. Notably, the jobs market has remained firm, keeping wages higher. The August consumer price index (CPI) figure released last week revealed that prices for things like rent and services are preventing inflation from cooling.  Read the full story here.

Customers may now utilize the new capability to receive USDC on their accounts just the way they receive traditional deposits through wire or an automated clearing house network.

FV Bank CEO Miles Paschini said in an interview that, &apos;We believe this feature will greatly enhance the user experience and open up more frictionless commerce.&apos; Paschini noted that the bank might consider other stablecoins in the future, but at present, USDC will be the only stablecoin approved for deposit into USD.

The declaration follows the bank&apos;s publication in August of a draught paper describing the goals, dimensions, dangers, and prospects for the creation of a digital rial. Purpose of Creating Crypto-Rial According to the CBI, the purpose of creating the crypto-rial is to make banknotes into programmable entities. Its high level of security is regarded to be one of its defining attributes. The nature of crypto-rial makes it simple to monitor, and even if the data on smartphones gets hacked, the crypto-rial can still be recovered. The crypto-rial, which would be entirely digital and look like banknotes and coins, is anticipated as a new kind of national currency, according to past CBI pronouncements. CBI Project is Confidential The CBI&apos;s crypto project has not fully revealed, but what is known indicates that the digital currency is not intended to rival other national cryptocurrencies. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), in contrast to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, are centralized, not anonymous, and compliant with anti-money laundering regulations.

42416192,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubc9P,1663765856,EU Finalizes Legal Text for Landmark Crypto Regulations Under MiCA,"The European Union has finalized the full text of its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation. Officially, the text is still open to comments, but sources briefed on the talks have told CoinDesk that it is, in practice, finalized.  A leaked draft of the bill dated Sept. 20 and verified by CoinDesk urges EU enforcers to take a “substance over form” approach to the law, meaning its provisions could even apply to some assets categorized as non-fungible tokens (NFT).  MiCA, once passed into law, will require issuers of crypto assets to publish white papers containing technical roadmaps, for platforms to register with the authorities, require stablecoin issuers to hold capital and be prudently managed.  The new draft also features changes that could indicate how the EU might treat algorithmic stablecoins, which were notably excluded from MiCA's scope when it was first introduced in 2020. Algorithmic stablecoins – similar to the recently collapsed terraUSD (UST), which used another cryptocurrency and a bit of code to balance its price and supply – should fall within the scope of regulation ""irrespective of how the issuer intends to design the crypto asset, including the mechanism to maintain a stable value.""  ""Offerers or persons seeking admission to trading of algorithmic crypto assets that do not aim at stabilizing the value of the crypto assets by referencing one or several assets should in any event comply with Title II of this Regulation,"" a Recital in the draft said, referring to the section of the law that lays out requirements for crypto asset issuers.  A Recital is a text that introduces an EU law and sets out its motivation. Though not – unlike the substantive articles of the regulation – legally binding, a recital can be used by supervisors and courts when interpreting the scope of the legislation.  An older draft also sought to limit the issuance of stablecoins that reference a non-EU fiat currency like the U.S. dollar which the industry feared would block popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDC out of the EU market. The new draft seemingly removes this cap.  Are NFTs in or out?  NFTs are typically designed to have a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, interchanged or subdivided, but the rise of fractionalized assets – where a set of fungible tokens are issued to represent one NFT – have been drawing some attention from regulators as they could resemble traditional securities.  While the leaked draft – thrashed out in a series of technical meetings following a June 30 deal – shows MiCA doesn’t apply to NFTs that are genuinely unique and incapable of being traded with each other, “the issuance of crypto-assets as non-fungible tokens in a large series or collection should be considered as an indicator of their fungibility,” the final compromise text says in a Recital, even if the issuer gave it a unique identifier.  The details of the provision have caused concern within the industry. The exact drafting used could determine whether in practice the regulation covers the bulk of the NFT market – such as similar, but distinct Bored Apes, implying issuers and trading platforms would be caught by its strictures.  When considering whether to regulate a particular asset, national and EU regulators “should adopt a substance over form approach under which the features of the asset in question should determine the qualification, not its designation by the users,” the text added.

42416189,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubc4N,1663764496,Indonesia Wants Citizens to Steer Local Crypto Exchanges: Report,"Regulators in Indonesia are introducing a new rule requiring domestic cryptocurrency exchanges to be mostly led by its citizens, according to a Bloomberg report.  The rule would require at least two-thirds of directors and commissioners on crypto trading platforms to be Indonesians residing in the country, officials from the country's trade ministry and commodity futures trading regulatory agency said at a parliamentary hearing in Jakarta.  “That way, at least we can stop them from fleeing the country if any problem arises,” Didid Noordiatmoko, the agency’s acting head , said, according to the report.  Noordiatmoko didn’t say when the revised regulation would be issued, but said revisions will be made to Indonesia's existing guidelines for operating crypto exchanges.  The regulator's comments follow an effort by South Korea to hunt down Terra co-founder Do Kwon. The country had issued an arrest warrant for Kwon on charges of fraud, four months after Kwon's $40 billion Terra network collapsed.  Additional revisions to the rules in Indonesia include gradually doubling the minimum capital requirement for crypto exchanges to 100 billion rupiah ($6.7 million) in line with their growth, banning exchanges from reinvesting crypto assets and storing users' money in third-party bank accounts, according to Deputy Trade Minister Jerry Sambuaga.

42421097,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSYv,1663763400,"Digital Dollar Likely Won't Be Part of Retail Banking World, US Lawmaker Says","A U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) may be one step closer to reality after the White House published several reports analyzing the technical and policy aspects of a digital dollar last week. Congressman James Himes (D-Conn.) has been an outspoken advocate for a U.S. central bank digital currency, going so far as to publish a white paper on the issue in June 2022.  Himes, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy has also overseen a number of hearings on crypto assets and their role in national security and related issues.  The six-term congressman spoke to CoinDesk after the White House, Treasury, Commerce and Justice Departments published half a dozen reports in response to U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto on Sept. 16.  The following interview has been edited for clarity.  CoinDesk: Thank you so much for joining me. I really appreciate it.  Congressman Jim Himes: Yeah, happy to be with you.  I'm sure you must be busy and it's Friday, so let's get right into it. It's been a pretty intense day with the six reports published by the White House as well as several federal agencies or departments today. But I know you in particular have been talking about central bank digital currencies for quite a while now and, of course, you published a white paper titled “Winning the Future of Money,” I think in June, right, a few short months ago. What's your take on the multiple papers published today by the White House and the Treasury Department on this issue of central bank digital currencies?  The element of the various releases on central bank digital currency didn't break a lot of new ground. I was very happy to see that in the text they emphasize the importance of the United States not getting left behind technologically. I actually think that may be one of the more compelling reasons to continue, but it is a lot of work on the technological side, on the implementation side, making sure that if we do a CBDC that it's really a very robust network with all of the safety considerations we would have.  I was glad to see they said, ""let's keep cranking away."" But that's not enormously groundbreaking, I think. Overall, sort of when you move outside of just the narrow alley of central bank digital currency, I think the White House's releases were a good contribution to an effort that is really picking up very notable momentum in Washington.  I actually think the action is largely on Capitol Hill. In the Financial Services Committee on which I sit, there's a bipartisan effort to get a stablecoin bill put together. On the Senate side, you've got an Agriculture Committee bill that would describe the authorities of the Commodity Futures Trading [Commission].  Where the rubber meets the road, I think Congress is making good progress. Now, not necessarily like we're going to pass new laws in the next couple of weeks progress, but you have to remember that two years ago if you'd said “digital asset” or “cryptocurrency” in the halls of Congress most people would look at you funny and not know what you were talking about. So I do think that there's been real progress on Capitol Hill.  Out of curiosity, have the reports today, or even just your own views on central bank digital currencies, have they evolved? Or where do you see any changes between what you've published, what the Federal Reserve is looking at, what Treasury published, and just this conversation in general that we’re hearing right now around CBDCs?  I think the story of the last couple of months has been one of the market re-instilling some rationality to the digital assets market. An awful lot of people have lost an awful lot of money, and that makes me sad, but – and when I say an awful lot of money, I mean, you hear figures like $2 trillion thrown around. That's just a staggering amount of money. That says two things. Number one, clearly people's desire to expose themselves to digital assets got way ahead of the underlying value, however you would wish to define that. And for that and other reasons I think it's actually really good that Washington is beginning to focus hard.  Now, that doesn't mean that Washington is going to satisfy people. When you talk about digital assets, you've got points of view often extremely aggressively expressed, I'm here to tell you, ranging from the pure libertarian – total anonymity, untraceable, whatever – to the world of a central bank digital currency, where you see China actually operating what, my guess is, there's not a lot of privacy protection there.  You also have the interesting fact that we still don't have a digital asset that is proving to be a robust means of exchange, and it may be fun to contemplate questions like whether bitcoin is an appropriate asset class in your 401(K). But where this will really be interesting for people is if and when it becomes a medium of exchange, and you can send money to South America or buy a consumer good in the U.K., and obviously, we're not there yet.  To that point, do you think that the reports that we saw today are really doing enough to address these questions of usability and still maintaining some semblance of privacy, some semblance of not being a tool for just censorship or surveillance?  Yeah, I think they point the way. The language was pretty strong on urging the regulators to really take a firm hand with the more irresponsible behavior that we've seen. There are an awful lot of people buying into digital assets that are either imperfectly described, maybe that's a euphemism, where people really don't know what they're buying, to out and out fraud. Of course, the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and others have been pretty aggressive about going after the fraudsters  I think that the administration's releases point the way, but the real action, the real specifics aren't in those releases, right? The real action and the real specifics will ultimately be incorporated into legislation in the place where I work. And like I said, I'm gratified that there's been a lot of education, but I do think that the time is now to start to start moving something.  I'm very hopeful, for example, we're running out of time in this Congress, but I'm very hopeful that the Financial Services Committee might produce a stablecoin regulation bill, and … the Senate seems to be taking the lead on the jurisdictional questions of what regulator has authority over what product and hopefully, we'll make some real progress. And if we don't actually get anything done in this Congress in the few months remaining, then in the next Congress, we're in a position to do so.  Just jumping on that, do you think that the level of education is at a point now where once you're done with this stablecoin bill, and, between you and me, I think the stablecoin bill sounds a lot like, with libra, between the collapse of Terra/LUNA, there's been a lot of stablecoin-specific action. Do you see other crypto issues, to the SEC and [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] jurisdiction, for example, coming up and being something that we can see actual legislation on within the next maybe a year or two?  Yeah, absolutely. In fact, you already see it on the Senate side. It's not where I work, but on the Senate side, you already see the Senate Agriculture Committee defining the role for the CFTC, so you already see that happening. Again, I wouldn't anticipate – particularly with an election coming up in seven weeks or so – I wouldn't anticipate that that will pass. But this is how we start educating and discovering kind of what the various equities are.  I sometimes joke, this is a really interesting and important space, but it was introduced to the Congress in just about the most catastrophic way possible. And, of course, I'm referring to the hearings that the Financial Services Committee held on libra. Prior to that, I don't know that many members of Congress had ever even considered the concept of a stablecoin or knew much about digital assets. I sometimes joke that if you had a bunch of evil lobbyists sitting around after a bottle of whiskey and saying, ""what's the most catastrophic way to introduce the Congress to a concept,"" one guy would say, ""well, give me [Meta (formerly Facebook) CEO Mark] Zuckerberg."" And then let's have him talk about a pervasive global currency. I mean, it was just a catastrophe, right? That sort of soured an awful lot of people for no particularly good reason. I mean, I don't know that there's anything wrong with Mark Zuckerberg, I'm just saying that as a sort of presentational matter that may not have been the best introduction.  You've had a lot of work done since libra to educate people. I am hopeful that in the next year or so, we may see a really serious stab at providing some regulatory clarity here.  Not to get into specifics here, but do you see any projects or any efforts out there – and feel free to not name specific names – but any projects that are kind of the counterexample to libra? Ones that lawmakers can look at and say, ""wow, okay, this makes sense, this is something that appeals to me, and this is helping me understand what you're trying to do better?’  I probably would not get in the business of predicting which models which stablecoins are likely to again cross that gap of becoming a common medium of exchange. We're not there yet, but there's no question in my mind that there's a use case there. Whether stablecoins are going to replace the current payment systems that are out there, everything from your debit card to Zelle and Venmo and all the various payments, I don't know, I'm a little skeptical about it. You don't you don't look at those current payment methodologies and say, ""boy, this is really a pain in the neck.”  But I have no doubt that two things are gonna happen. I sometimes draw an analogy, and maybe I'll be accused of being naive here, but I sometimes draw an analogy between the way we're thinking about crypto assets generally today, and the way we were thinking about the internet in, let's say 1996 or 1997. We sort of sensed that there was something there. There were all kinds of what, in retrospect, were absolutely wacky ideas. We're going to deliver cat food or kitty litter to your door for free, all these sorts of models that turned out to be sort of crazy. I'm not sure that we would have necessarily in the mid-1990s predicted exactly what the internet was going to do. But lo and behold, it transformed our lives, really. I sort of feel like we're in a parallel moment like that.  If we sort of expand the aperture to blockchain generally, not just digital assets, there's no question in my mind that there's going to be some transformative aspects of it. But in the meantime, we're going to see a lot of nonsense, and we may not know that it's nonsense until an awful lot of people have lost a lot of money and in a non-common sense business model.  So I want to jump on something you said just now, referring to existing payment systems and tools, and this is kind of tying back to CBDCs, but the Federal Reserve recently announced that it's hoping to launch FedNow as a real time payment system within the next year. Given that, does the calculus around focusing on a central bank digital currency or digital dollar, is it the same? Or does it have to change now that the Fed is actually moving to be more active with this new system that you can argue solves a lot of the same kind of issues that digital dollar would try to solve?  Yeah, I think so. I think that's right, in the wholesale arena. I think that FedNow [the Fed's payment system coming in 2023] is probably a part of a really good, innovative modernization of our financial sector generally. It was not that long ago that trading 100 shares of stock was a $200 commission proposition with five days of closing, there's all kinds of risk associated with that. There's no reason for it, right? The only reason that transactions don't close instantaneously today is that the architecture doesn't support that. And so I do think FedNow is a really good step in the direction of where we want to be, which is taking out an awful lot of the time that used to be involved in the clearing and settlement of securities and currencies and commodities.  I think it's really good, but where I don't think we're going to go, I wouldn't say, ""well, it's going to penetrate into the retail banking world."" There are those who make the argument that individuals should be able to open an account at the Federal Reserve, or maybe they think it's a postal banking thing, a public banking thing. The idea of postal banking is certainly not unprecedented, and it's worth thinking about, I guess.  I do think that the notion that we're going to take the Federal Reserve, who already has massive regulatory duties, and by the way, needs to run our monetary policy and say, ""now, you're going to be the banker to 320 million Americans,"" and in doing that, we're going to wipe out what is one of the primary competitive advantages of the United States, which is our banking sector, I think that's probably not likely. There may be those who think it's a good idea, but I think they're in a pretty small minority.  Fair enough. So something that I think is a little unique about your experience is you chaired the Subcommittee on National Security in House Financial Services and you're part of the Select Committee on Intelligence. Just looking to this idea through those lenses specifically, are there any maybe national security or national interest questions that you think a digital dollar could really address? Or just how are you looking at these questions or even the accessibility through those lenses?  I might add to your list, too, I chair the Select Committee on Economic Disparity and if I can take you off course for one second, I get really excited about the possibility that digital assets could ultimately bring more people into a bank environment, or if not a bank environment, at least provide products and services that are cheaper and more relevant to more people.  So let's imagine a central bank digital currency exists. My intuition is, and it's only my intuition, that it might have a special appeal because it's full faith and credit, it might have a special appeal to a percentage of Americans who are people in our country, by which I mean immigrants, who don't trust the banking system, who are skeptical of financial institutions, but if they believe that the money on their phone is full faith and credit, they might actually use it for payment, they might use it to do cheaper, money transfers, perhaps to family and other countries.  So I get pretty excited about the opportunity to expand in a cost effective way, services to people who are underserved, or if they are served, they're served by very high cost financial products. That's not your question, but let me come back to your question, which is that of course, I think that, like anything else, like any technological innovation, digital assets pose both opportunities and threats to our security. The obvious one that one talks about all the time is, anonymity poses some very serious issues. I mean, who really wants to use a fully anonymous payment mechanism? Yes, my libertarian friends want to use that because they don't want the government knowing what they're doing.  But the other group of people who use that, of course, are those who are up to no good, whether it's drug dealers or terrorists or human traffickers. So there's that and then there's also the interesting question and if you were British or Chinese or Korean, you would probably regard this differently than then I, that we regard it as Americans, which is the U.S.-built SWIFT Network, the clearing programs, the international payment mechanisms are one tool with which we are familiar and when we need to we can get visibility when and – this may be a particularly American thing – when you go before a judge and demonstrate probable cause you can actually access the information of those of whom you suspect breaking of breaking the law. That may not be true of other payment systems that are hosted or sponsored by other countries.  Editor’s note: Due to technical difficulties, Rep. Himes was asked to repeat his response to the final question.  An awful lot of people, the estimates are that 19% or so of Americans are unbanked or underbanked. Part of that, of course, is that a lot of people have suspicions about the big financial institutions and I'm intrigued by the possibility that a full faith and credit CBDC for example, might might offer the confidence that would cause somebody to use that as a payment mechanism or as a way to remit money to a home country or something like that. I do think there's real possibilities there, not to mention the possibilities that could be generated either by the private sector directly or by the private sector building on a digital token that was a full faith and credit card thing.  In the more traditional realm of national security there's what we always worry about, which is the question of anonymity if you have a payment system into which we have no visibility and that could be a foreign payment system or a payment system, which is deliberately obscured like what you see with some of these mixtures and such. There's, I think, two categories of people who really need anonymity. There's libertarians, who want that for their own reasons, and then there's, of course, people for whom anonymity is a professional necessity and that's the folks that are up to no good.  There may be others but obviously, we do not want a totally opaque means of payment that could be abused by terrorists or dealers or human traffickers. The other and the last thing I would say is to the point of transparency we're good in this country in terms of not abusing American civil rights or U.S. person civil rights, I should say, the distinction being that if you're in this country, regardless of if you’re a citizen or not, you're entitled to constitutional protection. We have a system that says that if you convince a judge that Sam is potentially committing a crime, that judge will give you permission to get evidence of that crime. There are plenty of countries where you wouldn't want that, because they don't care about civil rights. That's a pretty important part of our justice system here.  Lastly, I would just note we don't want technological developments to get radically away from us. The United States since World War II has been a technological leader in every realm, and we don't want to be – I suppose it's okay to be a fast follower, but we really don't want to be left behind by Chinese innovations or even European innovations. We may not worry about the Europeans as a foe, but every time I contemplate the possibility that we might not be at the technological forefront, it's sad.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/21/digital-dollar-likely-wont-be-part-of-retail-banking-world-us-lawmaker-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fcae4d161cc3a2424b4f3331d3ddb99380c9d50-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416203,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubd2l,1663763003,Bitmain Discounts Bitcoin Mining Machines in an Already Depressed Market,"Bitmain, one of the two largest bitcoin mining rig makers, said it's cutting prices that are already down 70% this year during a crypto bear market and global energy crisis.  Miners have been struggling in a market that has seen the price of bitcoin slide 60% since the start of the 2022, hitting their revenues. Energy, a major operational cost, has surged as flows of oil and gas from Russia dwindled following the imposition of sanctions by governments worldwide after it invaded Ukraine, driving up prices worldwide.  Bitmain said in a Tuesday tweet that it will drop the price of an Antminer S19 Pro 100 terahash (TH) model to $19/TH, about 30% below the market price in an index maintained by Luxor Technologies. Bitmain declined to specify what the price was prior to the discount. But only 200 machines can be bought with the discount, according to terms of the deal posted on Bitmain's website. That means bulk buyers are likely to also purchase the Antminer S19 XP model at over $45/TH, according to Lauren Lin, an operations manger at Luxor's ASIC trading desk.  (A terahash is a metric unit of computing power, or hashrate, on the Bitcoin network. Mining machines, also known as application-specific integrated circuits, are often priced per terahash to help make different models comparable.)  Last year, miners were clamoring to sign advance contracts with Bitmain and its peers, MicroBT and Canaan, as a bull market sent the bitcoin price to a record high, driving up production. Demand has since slowed and the price of rigs has dropped from an average of $68/TH on Jan. 1 to $20.8/TH on Sept. 20, Luxor Technologies data show.  ""The market is choking on the volume of new hardware, some that was preordered and financed with the hope of expansion,"" said Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of CMG Cryptocurrency Mining Group and Maverick Group. An indicator of how much North America was flooded with hardware was illustrated about a month ago, when hardware imported into the U.S. was cheaper by as much as $1.5/TH compared with China.  Based on conversations with analysts, Matt Schultz, the executive chairman of bitcoin miner CleanSpark, estimates that there are 250,000-500,000 new mining rigs sitting in their boxes across the U.S.  ""Bitmain's new discount price of $19/TH will definitely lead the rig market to drop further,"" said Arcane Research analyst Jaran Mellerud.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/21/bitmain-discounts-bitcoin-mining-machines-in-an-already-depressed-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f89d0b078d54383918329f15ae93786362596e5d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The “phygital” bundle includes a comic book cover from DC’s “The Brave and the Bold,” in both printed form and as a non-fungible token (NFT) redeemable online.  Funko’s aim is to “marry the two worlds” of physical and digital collecting, CEO Andrew Perlmutter said in an interview. DC fans who purchase the collectible can connect their crypto wallet and claim the NFT online, minted on the World Asset eXchange blockchain (WAX) – a network that supports 60 million NFTs (including ones issued previously by Funko, Topps, Atari and other mainstream brands) and 30,000 dapps.  Funko has been making strides in releasing NFT components to its flagship “Pop!” action figures for the past year. In August 2021 it kicked off its digital asset extension with its Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collection, allowing users to purchase both figurines along with an NFT.  Starting Oct. 7, Funko will begin selling the 30,000-unit “Brave and the Bold” collection at Walmart.  “We think this is a great opportunity to test out what this could look like with retailers, and if we wanted to expand our NFT business to physical retailers as well as digital,” Perlmutter told CoinDesk.

42416198,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubcdb,1663761600,Introducing ‘Women Who Web3’ – CoinDesk’s Newest Podcast,"When Kamala Alcantara showed up this summer at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, she knew she was in for an amazing experience, but she never imagined that her time at the festival would lead to her becoming CoinDesk’s newest podcast host.  In many ways, Kamala, who prefers to be called Kamz, was like any other attendee at Consensus. She was there to hear thought leadership in Web3, to connect with others in the space and to help out at her company’s booth on the expo floor. What made her stand out from the rest of the crowd was the three-month-old baby strapped to her chest all the while.  Kamz, fresh off maternity leave, was excited to dive headfirst into all things Web3 at Consensus and get back to her role as a UX researcher for a well-known blockchain company. Her Consensus schedule was so full that she almost forgot she signed up to audition at the “So You Think You Can Podcast” talent search.  After receiving a reminder message Kamz, with her baby in tow, made her way to the Consensus podcast booth. The CoinDesk team asked if she could talk about anything in crypto for 15 minutes, to which she replied, “I don’t know, but I can try!”  What happened next is the birth of CoinDesk's newest podcast, “Women Who Web3.”  The world needs more women who Web3  Despite Web3’s promise of inclusivity and democratic community building, it is not the most diverse industry. Surveys often show that half as many women invest in cryptocurrency compared to men and typically one can’t participate in Web3 without using cryptocurrency.  This disparity can perhaps be attributed to the tech industry’s long-standing lack of feminine representation. As it stands, women only account for around 25% of technical roles despite making up nearly half of the workforce.  Like tech, crypto and Web3 communities are often dominated by men, with some of those men being very outspoken about a woman’s place, or lack thereof, in these spaces.  The lack of feminine representation in the Web3 community is what Kamz talked about in the Consensus podcast booth. She expounded on her experience as a woman navigating this new space and her gratitude for organizations dedicated to onboarding women into Web3.  Kamz herself is no stranger to discrimination in the Web3 community. At a recent event, she was told that women shouldn’t be in the non-fungible token (NFT) space by two well-known creators – a jab that was followed by the suggestion that Kamz should be at home with her baby instead of at the event.  “Every single day, unfortunately, I’ve been validated that we need to have a space for women because there are plenty of men and some women who don’t believe that we should be a part of this,” said Alcantara.  What we love about Kamz  As a brand in the space, CoinDesk is well aware of the need for greater inclusivity and is committed to uplifting voices from all backgrounds. That’s part of the reason the “So You Think You Can Podcast” talent search was added to the Consensus lineup. We were hoping to make it easier for newcomers to start podcasting, and we are so glad we did.  When Kamz took to the booth and did her thing, the stars aligned in such a way that can only be described as Consensus magic. CoinDesk’s Executive Producer of Podcasts Jared Schwartz’s ears perked up as soon as Kamz started talking. According to Schwartz, who has been in the podcasting biz for 15 years, Kamz has all the makings of a great podcast host. She is charismatic, conversational, passionate, asks smart questions and can pivot on the fly.  On top of Kamz’s natural podcasting ability, her passion for Web3 and uplifting and onboarding women into the space fills two major gaps in the CoinDesk podcast family of content. We need a show focused on Web3 and we have yet to welcome a solo female host. That is, until now.  And thus a podcast was born  “Women Who Web3” is CoinDesk’s newest podcast, hosted by the one and only Consensus legend, Kamala “Kamz” Alcantara. This powerful and entertaining podcast celebrates women supporting women, investing in women and bridging the gender gap in wealth through Web3.  Each week brings a new and exciting guest sharing their insights on topics like starting an NFT project, creating belonging and inclusivity in digital spaces, building prosperous Web3 projects, investing in cryptocurrencies and building wealth.  While “Women Who Web3” is a celebration of women in the space, it is also a reminder to celebrate our humanity. A reminder that it is okay to feel stress while navigating new technology and juggling life’s responsibilities. To emphasize this, Kamz ends each episode with a mindfulness meditation to give listeners a moment to take it all in.  Kamz’s infectious positivity is sure to leave you feeling refreshed and inspired after each episode.

However, those looking to capitalize on price-positive developments should consider ether's increasing sensitivity to stocks, which makes the cryptocurrency vulnerable to broad-based risk aversion.  The 30-day correlation between ether and Nasdaq, Wall Street's tech-heavy index, has strengthened from 0.58 to a four-month high of 0.765, according to data tracked by trading giant Cumberland. The correlation value of 0.7 and higher implies a significant positive relationship between the two.  ""The ETH/Nasdaq [30-day] correlation is nearly back to the highs of the year – a feature which has overshadowed the idiosyncratic dynamics of the Merge (for now),"" Cumberland tweeted on Tuesday.  ""In price action space, this degree of macroeconomic correlation has made it difficult for crypto-native participants to extract alpha from their edge: the deep understanding of on-chain dynamics,"" Cumberland added.  In other words, weakness in Nasdaq could keep ether under pressure, disappointing those betting on big gains on the back of improved post-Merge fundamentals.  The Merge completely shifted the Ethereum blockchain to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism from the proof-of-work mechanism, whereby miners solved complex transactions to solve complex algorithms to verify transactions in return for rewards received in ETH and regularly liquidated those to fund operations. According to Cumberland, the Ethereum miners used to liquidate some $100 million worth of ETH per week.  So, a significant chunk of miner selling has left the market since the Merge. If that's not enough, ether's daily issuance has declined by 95% since the technological change that has made Ethereum more environment friendly.  While macroeconomic factors and inter-market correlations may play spoilsport in the short term, Cumberland is optimistic that the drastic reduction in supply would eventually bode well for ether's price.  ""The sudden disappearance of $100 million/week of miner selling is an off-chain supply/demand feature so large and unignorable that the manifestation of its impact is not a question of if, but rather when,"" Cumberland tweeted.  ""Over the longer term, it's nearly impossible to fight the flows,"" Cumberland added, drawing attention to the bullish impact of previous bitcoin halvings – a programmed code that reduces the per block BTC emission by half every four years.

42393788,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAzdh,1663759800,Evaluating Ethereum: 1 Week After the Merge,"Last week, Ethereum made its historic shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake – officially abandoning the energy-intensive, miner-based system that it had previously used to process updates to its decentralized ledger.  In crypto circles, the occasion of the Merge was observed like a holiday – celebrated virtually and in person at watch parties complete with music, speeches and even some special guests.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The largest Merge watch party was sponsored by the Ethereum Foundation and featured talks from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and other community leaders. It had 41,000 concurrent YouTube viewers at its peak.  The fact that the Merge happened overnight in much of the world only added to the excitement for many viewers. Staying up until 3 a.m. and waiting for Ethereum to finalize its first proof-of-stake blocks felt like waiting for the ball to drop in Times Square on New Year's Eve. In both cases excitement built up to a critical moment when – in just an instant – the world flickered from one reality to another.  But just as watching a crystal-studded disco ball slowly descend a pole feels a bit contrived, one couldn’t help but feel a bit underwhelmed when, after years of waiting, a successful Merge was marked by blocky, difficult-to-decipher text on a black-and-white computer terminal. At least New Year’s Eve had fireworks.  The network is, however, already showing signs of change.  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain  Decreased energy costs  The first and most obvious immediate impact of the Merge was the one that it had on the network’s energy usage. Switching from mining to staking meant ripping out precisely the component of blockchain tech that gives it a bad environmental reputation.  Proof-of-stake’s lottery-based system for proposing blocks is vastly more energy efficient than its power-hungry proof-of-work predecessor.  Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum foundation, told CoinDesk he predicted that the Merge – by shifting the second-largest blockchain network to a more efficient mechanism – would decrease global energy use by 0.2%.  This statistic has been disputed. In the short term, many Ethereum miners have found refuge on other networks, like Ethereum Classic, which continues to operate using proof-of-work. The movement of one-time Ethereum miners to these other chains has slightly damped the impact the Merge will have on decreasing overall crypto emissions.  But in the long term, mining on proof-of-work blockchains is unlikely to become profitable enough for most Ethereum mining outfits to continue operating.  Chandler Guo, the miner behind a controversial Ethereum proof-of-work fork (ETHW), admitted as much himself in an interview with CoinDesk’s “First Mover”: “Some people [miners] have free electricity and can [continue] to work on the [ETHW chain],” Guo said. “The other 90%, bankrupt.”  Moving to Bitcoin is not really an option either because the computer chips that are best suited to mining on Ethereum (GPUs) tend to be poor at mining on Bitcoin, whose miners typically use specialized computer chips called ASICs.  So while the immediate environmental impact of the Merge was blunted somewhat by the existence of other proof-of-work chains, its net-positive impact on emissions continues to look sunny.  Read more: Did the Ethereum Merge Drop ‘Worldwide Electricity Consumption’ by 0.2%?  New validators  Ethereum's new validator system ushered in a new cast of characters responsible for keeping the chain up and running. With these new characters came new concerns around network centralization.  Shortly following the Merge, Gnosis Chain founder Martin Köppelman drew attention for a tweet observing that 420 of Ethereum’s first 1,000 proof-of-stake blocks were proposed by just two entities: Lido, the community validator collective we’ve talked about before in this newsletter, and Coinbase, the U.S.-based crypto exchange.  Ethereum developers frame proof-of-stake as a more decentralized and secure alternative to mining – making it possible for anyone with 32 ETH to play a role in supporting the network, no fancy equipment required.  As the Ethereum Foundation’s Tim Beiko explained to CoinDesk ahead of the Merge last week, “Proof-of-work is a mechanism by which you take physical resources and you convert them into security for the network. If you want your network to be more secure, you need more of those physical resources. On proof-of-stake, what we do is we use financial resources to convert to security.”  But a few entities like Lido, Coinbase, Kraken and Binance have amassed more than 50% of the resources required to secure the network. They’ve done so by making it possible for people with less than 32 ETH to pool their resources and become validators – almost like a crypto equivalent of fractional shares.  Centralization is not just a proof-of-stake problem. Köppelman followed up his original tweet by noting that Bitcoin, which continues to use proof-of-work, also has issues with centralization: “No, dear Bitcoin fans, it is not better in Bitcoin. In fact you need only 4 entities to come to >72%”  But it’s hard to make a 1:1 comparison between Bitcoin’s mining pools, which include computers owned and operated by individual miners, and Ethereum’s staking pools – which include staked ETH from a mix of holders. One of the key differences: While Bitcoin miners can remove their equipment from a pool, Ethereum stakers won’t be able to remove their stake until Ethereum's Shanghai update, which is still six to 12 months out.  This means Ethereum’s pool operators can, at least for now, act without fear that their users will get angry and cut ties. (To be fair, Lido spreads its stake among several different validator services – meaning it should be more difficult for one party to act unilaterally against the network’s best interest.)  Whether or not it has become worse under proof-of-stake, why might centralization be a problem? Well, we’ve seen recently that centralization makes it easier for regulatory agencies to exert influence over a blockchain’s operations.  Recent U.S. sanctions against Tornado Cash – the Ethereum mixer program used to obfuscate transactions – are forcing validators and their legal teams to determine whether they need to stop Tornado-linked transactions in order to comply. If enough validators refuse to propose or attest to blocks containing Tornado-linked transactions, it will become difficult for those transactions to make it onto Ethereum’s ledger.  With a lawsuit earlier this week hinting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission considers the entirety of Ethereum as falling under its jurisdiction, one imagines that centralization concerns will continue to take center stage in the months ahead.  Reduced issuance  The most visible on-chain impact of the Merge has been on the issuance rate of ETH, the network’s native currency.  With Ethereum’s update to proof-of-stake, the network has drastically reduced the amount of new ETH issued with every block. In the long term, due to a burning mechanism introduced with the network upgrade EIP-1559, there’s a possibility that this may make Ethereum deflationary – meaning its token supply could decrease over time.  Ethereum is not deflationary yet: Around 4,000 new ETH have been issued since the Merge. But this is still around 95% less ETH than would’ve likely been issued under proof-of-work (around 70,000 new ETH, according to ultrasound.money).  The price of ETH has dropped significantly since the Merge. But for ETH holders, reduced issuance has been heralded as one reason to remain hopeful: Less ETH in circulation means every individual token is theoretically more valuable.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETC | EXCHANGE | MINING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/21/evaluating-ethereum-1-week-after-the-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23e196eb28af7a36cd0cab93e336c27654d5bbfb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the report, the CBI was quoted saying the goal of the ""crypto-rial"" is to turn banknotes into programmable entities.  The announcement comes after the bank published a draft document outlining the ""goals, dimensions, threats and opportunities for the development"" of a digital rial in August.  In May 2021, former CBI Governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said the bank had already developed a ""primary version"" of a digital rial. The CBI's current head, Ali Salehabadi, said earlier this month that the bank had the necessary infrastructure and rules in place for a CBDC.  Although the country's government views crypto as a means of circumventing strict U.S. sanctions – even placing a $10 million import order to be paid in crypto earlier this year – the CBI has revealed little about its work on a digital rial, or its function.  The digital currency is not designed to compete with global cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, according to the report.  The central bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Arbitrum paid about 400 ether ($530,000) to the hacker who flagged the vulnerability.  The threat was found in the way transactions are submitted and processed on the network, through a tool known as a bridge, which allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchains. Attacks on bridges have become one of the biggest security threats in crypto, accounting for almost $1 billion stolen in the past year.  The white-hat hacker, known as 0xriptide, said in a Tuesday post that the vulnerability would affect any depositor attempting to bridge funds from Ethereum to Arbitrum Nitro, Arbitrum’s latest version.  0xriptide discovered that all incoming transactions through the bridge were sent via a message to the Arbitrum blockchain’s Delayed Inbox, which ran a check to see if the contracts behind those transactions were either in the completion process or had already been completed.  0xriptide found that slots meant for data storage were empty because a Nitro function meant to verify the transactions automatically changed the data. That would have allowed a bad actor to manipulate the bridge’s smart contract – accessible to everyone because it is open-source software – and set their own address as a receiver address.  A single line of code would have prevented anyone from making changes to the critical contract. It was, however, removed to allow for cheaper transactions and the vulnerability it created wasn't noticed, 0xriptide said.  “The largest deposit recorded on the inbox contract was 168,000 ETH (~$250mm) with typical total deposits in a 24-hour period ranging from ~1000 to ~5000 ETH.” This means the vulnerability could have potentially led to hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen funds.

The business was among the most successful before the disaster, achieving a record of $119.18 in April. However, the incredible rise opened the door for a historic crash. Investors and users became worried as a result of the death spiral. The Terra community has approved a proposal that imposes a 1.2% tax burn on all on-chain transactions to revitalize LUNC.

42416200,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubcnf,1663751443,Fed Preview: Bitcoin Investors to Look Past Jumbo Rate Hike and Focus on Economic Assessment and Borrowing Cost Estimates,"With risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), under pressure ahead of Wednesday's pivotal Federal Reserve meeting, pundits think markets have already incorporated a super-sized rate hike.  So the focus will be on what the Fed says concerning the persistent core inflation (core inflation strips out the energy and food components), and the labor market and demand conditions that have remained stronger than policymakers judged in July.  ""The theme for tomorrow to me is not about 75 [basis point hike] or 100, even though I am in the 75 camp. The theme for [Wednesday] is that the Fed thought the economic weakness we saw in Q2 was going to assist them in getting inflation back to target and they no longer have confidence,"" Jon Turek, author of the Cheap Convexity blog, wrote in a note to subscribers Tuesday.  While the Fed saw evidence of a slowing economy at its July meeting, the data released since then suggests otherwise. Notably, the jobs market has remained firm, keeping wages higher. The August consumer price index (CPI) figure released last week revealed that sticky inputs like rents and services are preventing inflation from cooling.  Turek added that the bigger thing to watch for is where Fed Chair Jerome Powell thinks the bank stands in getting inflation back to 2% through tightening-induced economic pain.  ""The hawkish risk for tomorrow is that he now thinks we are still pretty early on,"" Turek noted.  That would imply a hawkish-for-longer stance, disappointing investors expecting rate cuts or renewed liquidity easing in 2023 and may deepen the crypto bear market. Bitcoin's market value has declined nearly 60% this year, predominantly due to the so-called Fed tightening.  Josh Olszewicz, head of research at digital asset fund manager Valkyrie Investments, said, ""the Fed will probably raise rates 75 basis points this week while issuing forward guidance on raising rates at a smaller clip for November and December meetings. Likely at 50 bps each. Next year we should see a few 25 bps hikes.""  ""This isn't a change in direction from Fed tightening. This is a more to say that they are beating inflation but not quite done yet, as midterms elections are coming,"" Olszewickz told CoinDesk, adding that markets will remain mostly risk-off until the Fed either pauses tightening or turns to rate cuts.  Hawkish expectations leave the door open for a relief rally  Since last week's CPI release, markets have seen hawkish repricing of Fed expectations.  The interest rate currently stands between 2.25% to 2.5% and the current betting is for the borrowing cost to peak around 4.5% – a significant upward revision from the pre-August CPI pricing of 4%. Further, bitcoin and ether (ETH) have declined by 15% and 20% since the CPI release, and the S&P 500 has slipped by 4.5%.  So if the interest dot plot – a graphical representation of each Fed official's projection for the benchmark interest rate – and Fed comments match market expectations, risk assets will likely bounce.  ""Expectations are very hawkish and the Fed can come out just as expected and still be more dovish than expected,"" Brad McMillan, chief investment officer and a managing principal at Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in the Fed preview. ""That limits the market downside from this meeting and just may provide some upside going forward.""  While wage growth remains a problem for the Fed, inflation expectations, which can become self-fulfilling, have cooled since the July meeting. Further, the housing market seems to be slowing. (Rising housing prices lead to higher rents and rent contributes to inflation.)  If the Fed focuses on the drop in inflation expectations and housing market slowdown instead of the stick core inflation, risk assets may take it as a dovish surprise and chart a relief rally.  ""There are signs that inflation may be peaking, as high-frequency housing data is softening. The real question for this Fed meeting is whether it notices – and chooses to acknowledge – those trends. If so, that would likely be interpreted as a surprise on the dovish side in its comments. And that would rattle expectations,"" McMillan wrote.  According to Cheap Convexity's Turek, the Fed will look past inflation expectations and focus more on getting the benchmark interest rate to a level that ""equilibrates the demand and supply across the whole economy in a way that is consistent with their 2% inflation target.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/21/fed-preview-bitcoin-investors-to-look-past-jumbo-rate-hike-and-focus-on-economic-assessment-and-borrowing-cost-estimates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25e3f2d23645a003caad9aed817188bb1615ad6a-2327x1745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The EOS price action displays a bearish failure to break below the $1.20 support level leading to a 5% growth with two lower price rejection candles. Moreover, the ongoing recovery phase forecasts a prolonged consolidation in the coming days, between $1.40 and $1.20.

The price movement for Ether was progressive from the beginning of the second of the year. ETH gradually surged over the $1,800 level before the Merge. To some reasonable extent, the positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum&apos;s transition from PoW to PoS contributed to the surge. As a result, several participants in the crypto industry tilted towards the second largest crypto asset by market cap. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Is Declining Following The Merge, Vital Trading Levels To Follow The token recorded a huge increase in its trading volume and other Ethereum derivatives over the period. However, the launch seems to come with a bearish trend for Ethereum. Just some hours following the Merge, ETH started a southward movement. The increasing selling pressure depleted the value gradually as the price kept decreasing. Through the past weekend, Ether plummeted below $1,300 as it lost sustainability on some supportive levels. Is Another Ethereum Correction Underway? There&apos;s a hint for a more bearish pattern from the Ethereum technical chart. This implies the possibility of another correction of 25% from its current price, which hovers around the $1,350 region. So, ETH might dip further to $1,000.

42416201,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubcsh,1663744987,Ether Funding Rates Revert to Normal Days After Successful Merge,"Funding rates on ether (ETH) futures have reverted to normal levels nearly a week following the Merge, during which a popular trade saw traders paying unusually high fees in order to remain in their positions.  Such trades led to unusually large liquidations on ether futures, with weekly trading volumes on spot ether surpassing those of spot bitcoin for the first time.  The rates are now at pre-Merge levels of 0.0045% on Binance and other crypto exchanges for short positions, or bets against price rises. Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets.  As previously reported, funding rates for ether futures slid to around negative 0.3% in the first week of September – meaning traders paid 30 cents to exchanges every few hours on a $100 position, an amount that quickly added up when traders handling millions of dollars continue to hold their position over several weeks or days.  That represented a new all-time low for funding rates, breaking the previous low of -0.157% set during the March 2020 sell-off, analysts from research firm Delphi Digital pointed out in a Tuesday note.  “The crowded trade was to buy spot ETH and short ETH perps. Traders were buying spot ETH in order to receive the [Ethereum proof-of-work] airdrop,” Delphi analysts said, adding that this trade quickly unwinded after the Merge as traders reversed their positions by selling spot ether and unwinding their ether futures positions.  EthereumPOW refers to the version of the Ethereum blockchain that continues to run on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The blockchain was established as a fork of the Ethereum network, which switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism last week in an event known as the Merge. The PoS network now continues as Ethereum.  As such, similar levels were last seen in June 2021 and followed by a massive short squeeze in July, but such market dynamics did not occur during September. A short squeeze refers to a sharp price increase that forces traders who had sold a borrowed asset in anticipation of repurchasing it at a lower price – a strategy known as shorting – to close out their positions, usually leading to a further increase in prices.

42416206,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubd7n,1663733826,Stablecoin Issuer Tether Ordered to Produce Documents Showing Backing of USDT,"Tether has been ordered by a U.S. judge in New York to produce financial records relating to the backing of USDT as part of a lawsuit that alleges Tether conspired to issue the stablecoin as part of a campaign to inflate the price of bitcoin (BTC).  The order requires Tether to produce “general ledgers, balance sheets, income statements, cash-flow statements, and profit and loss statements” as well as records of any trades or transfers of cryptocurrency or other stablecoins by Tether including information about the timing of the trades.  It also orders Tether to share details about the accounts it holds at crypto exchanges Bitfinex, Poloniex and Bittrex.  While attorneys representing Tether moved to block the order to release, calling it “incredibly overboard” and “unduly burdensome,” the presiding judge disagreed, writing that the “documents Plaintiffs seek are undoubtedly important.”  “[The] Plaintiffs plainly explain why they need this information: to assess the backing of USDT with US dollars,” wrote Judge Katherine Polk Failla.  “The documents sought in the transactions RFPs appear to go to one of the Plaintiffs' core allegations: that the … Defendants engaged in cyptocommodities transactions using unbacked USDT, and that those transactions ""were strategically timed to inflate the market,"" the judge continued.  Tether subsequently issued a statement labelling the order ""a routine discovery"" that ""does not in any way substantiate plaintiffs’ meritless claims.""  ""We had already agreed to produce documents sufficient to establish the reserves backing USDT, and this dispute merely concerned the scope of documents to be produced,"" Tether said.  Concurrently, there is also a lawsuit before the New York Supreme Court to have the New York Attorney General release documents it gathered in its investigation into Tether’s reserves. CoinDesk is a party to this case.  The New York Attorney General’s probe into Tether’s reserves concluded in February 2021 with an $18.5 million settlement.

Over the last 24 hours, ETH rose by 2%, price action continues to be mundane. In the last week, the Ethereum price fell by 21%. Technical indicators pointed towards continued bearishness. Buying strength declined substantially, which has pushed the price of Ethereum closer to its immediate support line. If buyers do not defend the closest support line, then Ethereum could head for a further decline on its one day chart. For the bearish thesis to be invalidated, ETH has to hop past several resistances. Selling dominance can further push the altcoin down.
