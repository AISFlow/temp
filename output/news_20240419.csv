Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Price Has Risen To $60,000 In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has discussed why the short-term holder selling pressure may be declining for BTC. The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Always Sell Into Halvings, Is This Time Any Different? The STHs include the “traders” of the market who make many moves within short periods and don’t tend to HODL their coins. This group can be quite reactive to market movements, easily panic selling whenever a crash or rally takes place. Generally, investors in profits are more likely to sell their coins, so one way to gauge whether the STHs would be likely to take part in a selloff is through their profit/loss margin. Here, Moreno has cited the profit/loss margin of this cohort based on its realized price. The realized price of the group appears to have been going up in recent weeks | Source: @jjcmoreno on X The STH realized price (highlighted in pink) here refers to the average cost basis or acquisition price of the investors part of this cohort calculated using blockchain transaction history. When the spot value of the cryptocurrency is above this level, it means that these holders as a whole are sitting on some net profits right now. On the other hand, the price being below the metric implies the dominance of losses. From the above chart, it’s visible that Bitcoin has been above the STH realized price for the last few months, meaning that these traders have been enjoying profits. This is typical during bull markets as the price keeps pushing up, letting these investors make profits. While STHs tend to stay in the green in these periods, tops do become probable to take place if these profits get extreme. As is apparent in the graph, the profit/loss margin spiked to significant levels just as BTC set its latest all-time high, which continues to be the top thus far. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Forms Bullish Pattern That Led To 50% Rally On Average Recently, as Bitcoin has consolidated between the $60,000 to $70,000 range, the STH realized price has rapidly risen, now attaining a value of around $60,000. This occurs because as STHs have traded in this range, their acquisition prices have been repriced at these higher levels, thus pushing up the average. BTC has been quite close to this level recently so that the STHs wouldn’t be holding that much profit now. “Bitcoin selling pressure from traders may be declining as unrealized profit margins are basically zero now,” notes the CryptoQuant head. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to show action contained within its recent range as its price is still trading around $65,200.

Chirag Tomar, 30, was arrested at the Atlanta airport on Dec. 20, 2023, while visiting family on a travel visa. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Both carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  Tomar’s case was first flagged by Seamus Hughes of CourtWatch.  According to court documents filed in the Western District of North Carolina, Tomar and his co-conspirators created a fake version of Coinbase Pro’s website to fool Coinbase customers to fork over their login info. Between at least June 2021 and Tomar’s arrest in late 2023, at least 542 victims were scammed out of their crypto.  Court documents show that the U.S. Secret Service was able to identify Tomar as a member of the crime ring because he used an email account in his real name to communicate with known and unknown co-conspirators in the fraud. He also kept a spreadsheet of his victims and how much had been stolen from each and sent “stolen or fraudulently obtained” identity documents to other email addresses used to open up accounts at Binance, another cryptocurrency exchange.  Between June 2021 and October 2022, Tomar made internet searches for “fake coinbase page,” “coinbase scam,” “scams in the USA,” and “how to take money from coinbase without OTP.”  Tomar used the same email address to apply for his travel visa to the U.S.  Using the proceeds of his fraud, Tomar funded a lavish lifestyle, purchasing Rolex and Audemars Piguet watches, “high-end luxury vehicles such as Lamborghinis and Porches,” and traveling to London, Dubai and Thailand.

26055402,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604119,1713564020,"Bitcoin Halving: Anticipating Price Impact, Miner Challenges, And Long-Term Outlook","The highly anticipated Bitcoin Halving event is close, bringing with it heightened expectations regarding the long-term impact on the Bitcoin price. There are concerns, however, that this quadrennial event may already be priced in, as Bitcoin recently reached an unprecedented all-time high of $73,700 on March 14. This surge broke the pattern of previous Halvings, where Bitcoin had never surpassed its previous ATH before the event. However, historical data reveals significant price increases in the year following previous Halvings. Experts Predict Delayed Bitcoin Halving Price Impact Analysts argue that the compounding impact of reduced issuance takes several months to materialize, suggesting that the Halving itself may not prompt a significant rally before or immediately after the event. Deutsche Bank analysts share this sentiment, highlighting that substantial price increases have typically occurred in the run-up to previous Halvings rather than immediately after them. Related Reading: Analyst Forecast: Litecoin Poised For $250-$300, But Can It Hold? Another factor to consider is the increased production costs for Bitcoin miners resulting from the Halving. As the mining reward decreases, participating in the mining process becomes less profitable. This has historically led to a decline in the hashrate, the total computational power used for Bitcoin mining. JPMorgan analysts predict that production costs could rise to an average of $42,000 after the Halving. One JPMorgan analyst wrote, “This estimate is also the level we envisage Bitcoin prices drifting towards once Bitcoin-Halving-induced euphoria subsides after April.” While these factors may influence short-term price movement, historical data reveals that the price of Bitcoin has experienced significant increases in the year following previous Halvings. The respective price gains for the three previous halvings were 8,760%, 2,570%, and 594%. However, it’s important to note that each successive halving has a diminishing impact on the new supply of Bitcoin. Mining Industry Shake-Up In the mining sector, Halving could lead to significant revenue losses, estimated to be around $10 billion annually. According to Fortune, publicly traded miners have taken measures to increase their resilience, diversify their offerings, and optimize their operations. However, mining stocks have faced challenges, with some experiencing significant declines. While larger miners may undergo a period of adjustment, smaller miners and pools may be pushed offline. This could result in a wider market share for the surviving miners. Experts at private asset management firm Bernstein expect the mining industry to consolidate, with “smaller and less efficient players” potentially selling assets to raise capital and shore up their balance sheets. The increased market dominance of the surviving miners is expected to be profitable over the long term, especially with the continued structural demand for Bitcoin from ETFs. Timing The Bitcoin Bull Market Peak Cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital has provided insights into the potential timing of Bitcoin’s bull market peak based on historical Halving cycles and the current acceleration seen in the market. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has traditionally reached its peak in the bull market approximately 518-546 days after the Halving event. However, the current cycle has shown signs of unprecedented acceleration, with Bitcoin surpassing previous all-time highs roughly 260 days ahead of historical norms. Nonetheless, the recent “pre-Halving retrace” has slowed down the cycle by around 30 days and counting. Related Reading: The Next Dogecoin? Top Trader Points To This Memecoin Taking into account this accelerated perspective, if Bitcoin’s bull market peak is measured from the moment it breaks its old all-time high, it may occur 266-315 days later. As Bitcoin achieved new all-time highs in March, this suggests a potential bull market peak in December 2024 or February 2025, according to Rekt’s analysis. Both perspectives carry significance throughout the cycle, especially if the acceleration trend persists. However, prolonged retracements or consolidation periods can slow down the cycle, potentially pushing the anticipated bull market peak further into the future. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $64,300, up from the $59,000 mark reached in the early hours of Friday.

42390939,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdR57R,1713561866,Bitcoin Pioneer Hal Finney Posthumously Wins New Award Named for Him,"The Human Rights Foundation has announced that computer scientist and privacy advocate Hal Finney, who played a role in getting Bitcoin going 15 years ago, will posthumously be the first recipient of an award named in his honor.  This roundup is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.  Fran Finney, his widow, will accept the inaugural Finney Freedom Prize on Hal’s behalf and plans to donate the monetary prize of 1 bitcoin {{BTC}} to a yet-unnamed charity. Hal Finney died in 2014 due to complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.  HRF Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein said the award is meant to honor those who make vital contributions to Bitcoin.  “Obviously we can't give it to Satoshi. So, beyond that, it's Hal. No one even comes close to his contributions,” Gladstein told CoinDesk in an interview. “He coded until his last days. I mean, he literally contributed to human freedom until his muscles didn't cooperate anymore.”  Read more: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?  “Hal would have been thrilled to see how this Bitcoin ecosystem has grown, and to learn that this once-obscure software project is now used by tens of millions of people worldwide,” Fran Finney said in a pre-recorded acceptance speech. “He would be honored to be the first recipient of this award, and humbled to have it be in his name. I feel great privilege and responsibility in accepting the first prize on his behalf.”  The Human Rights Foundation has set aside an additional 32 bitcoin, worth over $2 million at current prices, out of its own treasury to make awards well into the future. “Our view is that in 40 years, it'll probably be the world's largest cash prize,” Gladstein said.  For the next three years, the foundation will name a new laureate on Jan. 10, also known as “Running Bitcoin Day,” or the day Hal Finney posted on Twitter (now X) about becoming the first person besides Satoshi Nakamoto to download the Bitcoin software. After that, the awards will be handed out to coincide with Bitcoin halvings, approximately every four years. (The next one happens in a few hours from press time.)  Read more: This Bitcoin Halving Is Different. But Is It 'Priced In'?  The first four awards, including Finney’s, are meant specifically to retroactively reward those who made the biggest contributions to Bitcoin within the periods between each of the first four halvings: 2009-2012 (Finney), 2012-2016, 2016-2020 and 2020-2024. After that, the prize will go to those who contribute most in the intervening four years.  A “Genesis Committee” of seven individuals – including “The Genesis Book” author Aaron van Wirdum, Africa Bitcoin Conference founder Farida Nabourema, Bitcoin Core dev Gloria Zhao, bitcoin++ and Base58 co-founder Lisa Neigut, Fedi founder Obi Nwosu, Stone Ridge Holdings CEO Ross Stevens and Running Bitcoin Challenge co-founder Vitus Zeller – was picked to lead the nomination process until 2028.  Committee members will then nominate their successor, who will serve a four-year term.  “This is a prize that will outlast us all,” Gladstein said, noting that the last Bitcoin halving will take place sometime in the next century. “Hopefully we can have some kind of intellectual lineage here going through the decades. The first seven are only going to choose somebody who they really feel embodies their ideals so hopefully you get a committee in 100 years that's somewhat reflective of the initial committee.”  Who is Hal Finney?  Even if Hal Finney had never discovered Bitcoin on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, becoming the first person to receive a bitcoin transaction and contribute code to the project, it’s likely he would be remembered by the Bitcoin community for his many contributions to cryptography and his privacy advocacy  A graduate of the California Institute of Technology, Finney began to make contributions to foundational cryptographic communications tool Pretty Good Privacy (better known as PGP) in the early 1990s, before working for the PGP Corp. directly until retirement. The program remains one of the best ways to encrypt online communications.  “The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete,” he wrote to a group of cryptographers, at a time when the U.S. government was looking to limit the public’s access to strong encryption.  Finney’s work on PGP led to his interest in digital currencies, which he thought could better protect people’s privacy than the emerging payment options like credit cards that were beginning to dominate (and still dominate) the web. In 2004, Finney created a prototype digital asset that reusable proof-of-work system, which although it didn’t catch on, went on to directly inspire Bitcoin.  See also: Bitcoin and the Rise of the Cypherpunks  Four years later, when Satoshi unveiled the Bitcoin white paper, Finney was one of a few people who took notice. He responded on Satoshi’s announcement post on the cryptography mailing list that he looked forward to seeing how the concept would be developed and was offered early access to the project source code.  Between 2009 and 2013, when Finney announced he was paralyzed on the BitcoinTalk forum, he made several key contributions to the Bitcoin software. Throughout his life he was a frequent marathon runner, alongside his wife Fran. In a 2009 Less Wrong blog post, Finney wrote “my dream is to contribute to open source software projects even from within an immobile body.”  There are some who believe that Finney is Satoshi, or a possible contributor to a group that referred to itself under the collective name. A recent post by Bitcoin OG Jameson Lopp disputes this claim, after reviewing timestamps that show Finney was often probably elsewhere while Satoshi was online. Finney himself denied that he was Satoshi Nakamoto.  “We wanted to do the prize not just to honor Hal’s contributions to Bitcoin, but digital privacy and freedom generally,” Gladstein said. “It is something that is very important to us.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/19/bitcoin-pioneer-hal-finney-posthumously-wins-new-award-named-for-him,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db9865c9711f8e706a132b6eb857a18d4a14c769-1806x1012.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26053181,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604064,1713560432,Bitcoin Accumulation: You Won’t Believe How Much BTC Holders Have Bought Since The Crash,"Bitcoin holders have again reaffirmed their faith in the flagship crypto despite its recent price declines. This follows recent data showing that Bitcoin accumulation addresses recorded a new all-time high (ATH) amidst the current market downward trend. Accumulation Addresses Record New All-Time High Of Bitcoin Inflows Data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows that over 27,700 BTC was transferred into accumulation addresses between April 16 and 17. This is a new all-time high (ATH) for these addresses in terms of their daily Bitcoin inflows. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Rally To $3 As Price Reaches ‘Ultimate Support Test’ Before now, the highest amount of BTC sent to these addresses in a day stood at 25,500, recorded on March 23 earlier this year. Interestingly, the March 23 record came just about a month after Bitcoin inflows into accumulation addresses hit an all-time high (ATH) of 25,300 BTC on February 21. Accumulation addresses are wallets with no outgoing transactions and have a balance of over 10 BTC. Accounts belonging to centralized exchanges and Bitcoin Miners are excluded from this category. Meanwhile, these addresses must have received two incoming transactions, with the most recent occurring within the last seven years. These addresses can be considered the most bullish on Bitcoin, and the growing accumulation trend from these wallets shows how much faith these long-term holders have in the flagship crypto. Furthermore, they are also believed to be positioning themselves ahead of the bull run, as BTC may never drop to these price levels once it comes into full force. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s CEO, Ki Young Ju, also highlighted the significance of this development, noting that on-chain accumulation has remained “very active” even as the demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has stagnated for four weeks. This suggests that Bitcoin bulls could help shore up the demand gap left open by these ETFs. BTC Price Shows Strength Bitcoin dropped below the $60,000 support level following reports about Israel’s retaliatory attack on Iran. However, the flagship crypto showed strength as it quickly rebounded above the $60,000 price mark. This is significant considering how much Bitcoin and the broader crypto market declined rapidly following Iran’s attack against Israel on April 13. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are On The Move Again, But Are They Bullish Or Bearish? Furthermore, the quick price recovery also suggests that Bitcoin has established strong support around the $60,000 price range and could be set for a parabolic move to the upside once this period of consolidation is over. Crypto analyst Crypto Rover also recently commented on Bitcoin’s future trajectory, stating that the crypto token will come out with a “banger” soon enough. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $62,000, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This insight comes as Bitcoin appears to be recovering slightly from its week-long decline. The asset is up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours, with a current trading price of $64,968 at the time of writing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Hysteria: Will History Repeat Itself Or Are We Heading For A Market Meltdown? Bitcoin Next Move According To This Chart Pattern Brandt’s analysis, presented through a series of charts, outlines a distinctive pattern in Bitcoin’s historical price behavior, characterized by three distinct phases.: the Hump-Slump, Bump-Rump, and Pump-Dump cycles. As per Brandt’s observation, while Bitcoin has completed the initial two phases of the cycle, the third phase, marked by the “pump” component, remains unfulfilled, hinting at potential bullish momentum ahead. What say you?? $btc pic.twitter.com/IDvIpkZeER — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) April 18, 2024 Meanwhile, amid heightened market volatility and uncertainty, Bitcoin has faced notable price fluctuations, experiencing a nearly 10% decline over the past week. However, recent bullish momentum has seen the cryptocurrency surging by 3.7% in the past 24 hours, with its price briefly climbing above $65,000 after hitting a 24-hour low of $60,000. This upward movement aligns with Brandt’s suggestion of a pending bullish phase in Bitcoin’s price cycle, adding weight to the anticipation of a potential market “pump.” Insights From Industry Leaders And Analysts In addition to Brandt’s analysis, industry leaders and analysts have offered their perspectives on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of Skybridge Capital, has recently projected a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, forecasting a potential price surge to $200,000 following the upcoming halving event. Scaramucci cited various factors, including the influence of new financial products like spot ETFs and increasing institutional interest, as key drivers behind Bitcoin’s anticipated price appreciation.

While many remain unfazed by the market dynamics, some sectors of the crypto community have turned more pessimistic, and their bags are seemingly going down instead of up. Related Reading: Are Altcoins Cooling Off? Analyst Weighs In On This Cycle’s Market Despite this, some projects have shown a remarkable performance this week. Among the top gainers today, privacy protocol Railgun has skyrocketed 53% in the last 24 hours after a week of support from crucial figures in the crypto industry. Vitalik Buterin Shows Support To Privacy Tools On Monday, news broke that Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin had transferred 100 ETH, worth around $325,000, to Railgun. The project is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) privacy protocol that allows DeFi private transactions. Although the move raised criticism, most replies supported his use of privacy tools. Some users pointed out that Buterin’s every on-chain move is watched and speculated on. Ethereum’s founder later addressed the news, expressing support for the project’s use of the Privacy Pools protocol, which “makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users’ privacy.” Privacy is normal. Railgun uses the privacy pools protocol ( https://t.co/DekkatsMR5 ) which makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users' privacy.https://t.co/MG0huDzpAu — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 15, 2024 Buterin also stated in his post that “privacy is normal,” an idea he has expressed several times before. He has researched the use of Privacy Pools to achieve an equilibrium between blockchain privacy and regulatory compliance. After the post, Railgun (RAIL) skyrocketed 257%. The token went from trading at $0.56 to changing hands for $1.97 in a few hours. Moreover, the rest of the privacy tokens market saw a pump, with tokens like Monero (XRM) and Oasis Network (ROSE) rising 7% and 12.3%, respectively. As of this writing, privacy tokens are 4.7% up, per CoinGecko data. Railgun Defends From Crypto Laundering Allegations On Tuesday, the crypto news platform Wu Blockchain highlighted the alleged links between the privacy protocol and the North Korean hacker group Lazarus Group. The post affirmed that Lazarus Group “is also a user of the coin mixer Railgun.” Moreover, the news platform pointed out that, in January 2023, the US FBI claimed over $60 million worth of stolen ETH was laundered through Railgun. Additionally, the post stated that the privacy protocol became the “main alternative” after the Tornado Cash sanctions. Railgun shut down Wu Blockchain’s claims, deeming them “not true and false reporting.” The post stated the news was “a mistaken, false allegation in the first place.” However, they clarified that the Lazarus Group is blocked from using the protocol’s system due to the “Private Proofs of Innocence” (Private POI). The Private POI tool was implemented a year ago and gives “cryptographic assurance that funds entering the RAILGUN smart contract are not from a known list of transactions or actors considered undesirable by respective wallet providers.” Congratulations to the exchange website @Poloniex who since yesterday are serving spot markets for $RAIL token! pic.twitter.com/P1RL8bKWsZ — RAILGUN – Private & Anonymous DeFi (@RAILGUN_Project) April 19, 2024 Despite the controversy, the price of RAIL remained above the $1 support level, hovering between $1.00 and $1.30 in the following days. RAIL continued an upward trajectory after its listing on the crypto exchange Poloniex. At writing time, RAIL is trading at $1.85, an 18.2% surge in the last hour. According to an X user, a whale recently bought 152,034 RAIL tokens, which could have fueled the price jump. Moreover, following its remarkable week, RAIL has increased 156% in the last seven days, with its daily trading volume rising a stellar 376% from yesterday.

Ripple CEO Underpredicts Crypto Market Cap Appearing in a recent interview with Fox Business, Garlinghouse shed light on the growth potential of the cryptocurrency market as well as its performance since the beginning of the year. The Ripple CEO was questioned about his previous optimistic forecast for the crypto industry’s market capitalization, in which he projected that the market cap would double to approximately $5 trillion by the end of the year. According to CoinMarketCap, the current global cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at roughly around $2.25 trillion. Related Reading: Here’s What Would Happen If The Bitcoin Price Fell Below $58,000 In response to the inquiry, Garlinghouse expressed his belief that his previous predictions were not overly ambitious, emphasizing the market’s potential for further growth. He admitted to underpredicting the industry’s potential market capitalization by the end of 2024, citing factors such as the current supply and demand dynamics driving additional increases. Garlinghouse noted that the current market conditions are characterized by increased demand and reduced supply, with these dynamics playing a significant role in the performance of cryptocurrencies. He disclosed that the Spot Bitcoin ETF market and the overall sentiment regarding Bitcoin’s value have significantly boosted demand for the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s supply is diminishing due to the increasing number of large-scale investors purchasing the cryptocurrency rapidly. Additionally, the impending Bitcoin halving event is expected to further decrease the cryptocurrency’s supply. Assessing the current state of the crypto market, Garlinghouse stated that since the last six months, Bitcoin has been up by more than 250%, with further increases anticipated. He also asserted that this overperformance was largely driven by the approval and launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Regulations Are Vital For Market Development Garlinghouse has disclosed that establishing proper regulatory frameworks for the cryptocurrency market would yield positive outcomes for the market in the future. He explained that one of the primary factors hindering the growth of this evolving market was the United State’s prevailing anti-crypto stance, suggesting that the country’s enforcement actions on the developing industry were “problematic.” Related Reading: Goldman Sachs On Bitcoin Halving: ‘It doesn’t Matter If It’s A Buy The Rumor, Sell The News Event’ The Ripple CEO highlighted several countries, including Dubai, Singapore and the United Kingdom, which have been proactively embracing cryptocurrencies and implementing proper regulatory systems to foster further growth in the market. Garlinghouse has asserted that the US has significantly lagged in recognizing the transformative and innovative impact of the cryptocurrency market, attributing this setback to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its current Chair, Gary Gensler.

The action perhaps helped bitcoin's rebound to $65,000, marking the $60,000 level as a key support level for bitcoin's price where buyers step in.  Large bitcoin {{BTC}} investors substantially increased their holdings as prices dipped below $60,000 in early Friday's panicky action on the crypto markets ahead of the asset's much-anticipated halving event.  Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock's ""large holder netflow"" metric shows that Bitcoin addresses holding at least 0.1% of the supply added 19,760 BTC worth over $1.2 billion to their holdings on Friday at an average price of $62,500.  Large holders – often called whales in crypto slang – are major market players who control large amounts of a digital asset and are usually considered to be smart, well-informed investors. Their purchases and sales can have a sizable impact on markets, thus crypto watchers closely follow their behavior to anticipate price movements.  ""Bitcoin whales may have finally started buying the dip,"" IntoTheBlock said in an X post on Friday. ""Historically, accumulations by these addresses have often preceded rises in bitcoin's price.""  The recent action marks a significant change in whales' behavior compared to earlier this week, when large investors didn't step in to capitalize on weakness, prompting fears about further downside.  The purchases perhaps fomented bitcoin's sharp rebound past $65,000 from its overnight lows of $59,600 as Israel carried out airstrikes in Iran. Prominent crypto trader Skew also pointed out that the recovery was at least partly driven by spot BTC buyers. Recently, BTC settled at around $64,000, up 1% over the past 24 hours.

42390960,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRGXF,1713549007,IRS Unveils Form Your Broker May Send Next Year to Report Your Crypto Moves,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Services has revealed what the agency has in mind for the first-even crypto tax reporting form.  Observers suggest the industry will need some more information before the draft form makes sense.  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has previewed what crypto investors' future tax form might look like when it finishes its much-debated rule on how cryptocurrency transactions should be reported to the federal government.  The IRS offered a draft of the 1099-DA form that would be meant to figure out the taxable gains or losses when brokered digital assets change hands. The form reveals the agency will likely have an array of individual token codes that can be filled in, and it includes spaces for wallet addresses and where to find transactions on the relevant blockchain.  ""Brokers must report proceeds from (and in some cases, basis for) digital asset dispositions to you and the IRS on Form 1099-DA,"" according to the instructions included with the form, which shows a 2025 date. ""You may be required to recognize gain from these dispositions of digital assets.""  This unveiling is preliminary and may still change depending on the final outcome of the tax rule proposed last year. While the establishment of U.S. tax practices for crypto is among the necessary steps toward ridding investors of uncertainty and confusion, cryptocurrency businesses are nervous about how the IRS will identify the digital asset brokers that would need to comply with the new system – potentially including wallet providers, decentralized platforms and payment processors.  This version of the form asks the filer to check a box that describes the type of broker they are: kiosk operator, digital asset payment processor, hosted wallet provider, unhosted wallet provider or ""other.""  ""Some of those boxes relate to economic activity such as kiosks or payment processors, while others are customer-relationship based such as hosted or unhosted wallet provider,"" Miles Fuller, the head of government solutions at TaxBit, told CoinDesk. ""I am curious how the IRS anticipates using this information and how certain brokers such as centralized exchanges or decentralized protocols that are covered under the current regulations may fit into these boxes.""  Fuller was also interested in the Treasury Department's IRS anticipating that brokers would be ""using some sort of digital asset registry to identify which crypto was being sold on the form,"" he said. ""No formal registry currently exists, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out.""  Jessalyn Dean, vice president of tax information reporting at Ledgible, pointed out references to so-called wash sales and that the form provides for transactions that are only recorded internally by crypto firms. She contended in her analysis of the form that at least one of the boxes on non-deductible losses would need more guidance on how it works.  ""As expected, the look and feel are similar to the Form 1099-B for reporting sales of traditional financial products,"" Dean said, also noting the IRS has ""packed a lot of lines and boxes into this form.""  The IRS is inviting public comments about the draft form. It remains unclear when the tax agency will produce a final rule, though the 2025 form suggests a completion at some point this year.

42390981,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRFxL,1713547454,Bitcoin Will Power the Next DeFi Summer,"In 2023, we said goodbye to Crypto Winter. Now, it’s time to say hello to a new era of DeFi Summer, this time centering on the most buzzworthy yet also durable trends: Bitcoin. With Ordinals proving demand, exchange-traded fundes (ETFs) providing access and Bitcoin scaling solutions emerging, 2024 is set to unlock the ~$1 trillion asset class in ways previously unseen.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.  The initial decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution in 2020 centered around smart contracts unleashing blockchain utility beyond the simple maintenance of a ledger and asset. It transformed the technology into a platform for vast, interoperable financial ecosystems. On the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), people worldwide could essentially become their own banks, accessing hundreds of interoperable financial applications. This evolution offered a promising look into a future of finance governed by immutable code rather than fickle human beings.  As DeFi Summer unfolded, the technology and enthusiasm fueling DeFi extended to non-financial blockchain applications, notably non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Blockchains demonstrated their versatility by hosting not only financial systems but also becoming hubs for art, culture and gaming. Spurred by the constant inquiry of ""what's next,"" blockchain technology seemingly expanded into every conceivable use-case, often stretching beyond its core utility and practicality at the height of the craze.  Ultimately, the initial buzz about NFTs and blockchain's expansion turned to fear during the 2022 crypto winter, although this wouldn’t be the end for NFTs. 2023 witnessed a revival in the blockchain enthusiasm, thanks in part to NFTs making a strong comeback, this time taking the form of Ordinals on Bitcoin. Similar to how DeFi Summer revealed new blockchain capabilities, Ordinals and BRC20 tokens showcased Bitcoin's potential, sparking excitement about the future possibilities of blockchain technology.  See also: With COMP Below $100, a Look Back at the 'DeFi Summer'  The question arose: If Bitcoin could support NFTs and tokens, what other applications could its unparalleled security and popularity cover?  Unlocking BTCFi  In retrospect, the NFT craze of 2021 can be interpreted as the fading-out of a hype cycle. While valuable, the technology was more a reverberation from DeFi’s big technological splash. In contrast, the current enthusiasm around Ordinals feels like the fading-in of a new cycle, representing newly discovered demand that will undoubtedly have downstream effects. This isn't merely a repetition of past utility; it's an intriguing development whose potential is just beginning to unfold.  Prior to the advent of Ordinals and BRC-20, there was a widespread belief that Bitcoin served a solely passive role within the blockchain ecosystem, offering little beyond basic asset functionality. This perception has shifted dramatically. Thanks to a number of significant advancements from a usability standpoint, Bitcoin is emerging as a critical security-provider for DeFi and as an asset with newfound utility and interoperability.  The future of Bitcoin DeFi involves bringing the Bitcoin network's security to EVM-compatible smart contracts. Leading EVM-compatible Bitcoin scaling solutions are innovating methods to incentivize bitcoin miners to secure both the BTC asset and smart contracts simultaneously but independently. Ensuring miners, and consequently bitcoin itself, gain value is essential for expanding the Bitcoin network beyond safeguarding just the BTC asset.  Unlocking the BTC asset  Historically, BTC has served mainly as a passive store of value, not actively involved in DeFi security or commerce. Yet, much like ETH's dual role in securing Ethereum and serving as currency, bitcoin has the potential to evolve into a versatile asset beyond the base Bitcoin chain. The introduction of Bitcoin staking in 2024 is set to transform BTC from a passive to a rewards-generating asset, marking a significant shift in its utility.  See also: DeFi Has a Risk Problem and It's Time to Solve It  Once DeFi ecosystems become massively aligned with both bitcoin miners and bitcoin holders/stakers, those ecosystems become the greatest and safest platforms for ""BTCFi."" As advancements such as HTLC atomic swaps and innovative bridging solutions overcome technical hurdles, BTC is set to pour into DeFi protocols. This influx will unlock extraordinary utility for the world's premier and most trusted blockchain-based asset.  Building bitcoin DeFi together  Bitcoin is leading the creative front of blockchain innovation for the first time in years. Now that the Bitcoin base layer is widely recognized as permanently secure, it’s time to build solutions to bring it to new heights. Given that the BTC asset is the definitive self-sovereign asset, it only makes sense that the Bitcoin network should be the core protector of the future of self-sovereign decentralized finance.  We, the Bitcoin community, are acutely aware of the vast potential lying dormant within our network and its currency. It's time to step forward and unlock this potential, fostering innovations that empower Bitcoin, DeFi and the pursuit of financial independence worldwide.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Brendon Sedo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/19/bitcoin-will-power-the-next-defi-summer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8039d96c079b23f02082947834f016b01a4f296-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Google Trends data, which uses a 100 point scale to determine the relative popularity of keyphrases, there is more interest than ever in the Bitcoin network halving.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.  Interest in the term has steadily ramped up since the start of 2024, alongside search interest in the phrase “Bitcoin” (which is still below its 2017 peak in terms of search interest).

Less than 60 blocks away, the fourth Bitcoin halving will see the number of bitcoin paid out as a block reward to miners cut in half from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This particular halving is notable for a number of reasons, including the resurging interest in Bitcoin as a developer ecosystem, the onshoring of the U.S. mining industry following China’s ban and the relatively recent launch of spot bitcoin ETFs that helped ignite a (now ebbing) market rally.  “This is the first halving in which major U.S. asset managers are educating on Bitcoin, and there’s no better Bitcoin education than learning about the halving.

Though it's not just fund managers having fun.

Related Reading: All Quiet On The Bitcoin ETF Front – Should You Be Paranoid? A glimmer of hope emerged with Tether’s (USDT) recent movement. Tether, the issuer of the world’s most popular stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, transferred a whopping $318 million worth of USDT from its treasury wallet directly to exchanges on the Ethereum network. Source: X This outflow suggests potential anticipation of increased demand for USDT, which could, in turn, signal rising investor interest in the broader cryptocurrency market. Historically, Tether has minted large amounts of USDT during periods of heightened crypto activity, and the rumor mill now churns with speculation that another billion USDT might soon be minted specifically on Ethereum. However, analysts caution against blind optimism. While an increase in USDT activity could bode well for Ethereum, it’s not a guaranteed path to prosperity. Other blockchains, like Tron, are also capable of handling USDT transactions, offering investors alternative avenues. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.289 trillion.

42390963,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRGCj,1713542574,Leaving Behind Bitcoin Sectarianism,"I’ve always tended to be heterodox in my beliefs, my social attitudes and the way I reason outside of scholarly consensus.  Patrick Dugan is the founder of the Omni Foundation, CEO of TradeLayer and coiner of the term ""crypto-dollarization"".  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.  It was about 11 years ago that I sent the wire to Mt. Gox to purchase my first bitcoins {{BTC}}. A few months later I relied on those coins to survive getting robbed of all my items and cash in capital controlled Argentina. LocalBitcoins was my realization of the reality of Bitcoin as world-changing technology, and my survival tool in an emergency.  Then after getting into arbitrage trading and dipping into the bull market of 2013, I found work with the Mastercoin Foundation, funded by the first initial coin offering (ICO). In March 2014 I saw the debate over reactivating OP_Return as a soft-fork, but with a lower, 40 byte limit — the argument was that a higher threshold would enable spam.  I saw the vehement passion by which the byte-size conservatives argued, and found it perplexing. Little did I know that this debate over whether the limit should be 40 bytes versus 80 bytes would continue to snowball into a whole ideological sectarian rift in the Bitcoin community.  When I got into crypto, it was all about, you know, being able to control your own money, whether that means surviving being robbed of all your cash in a country with capital controls, buying LSD from a foreign chemist or any number of things synonymous with righteous resistance against tyranny and fostering human freedom and thriving.  See also: Designer Drug Markets Get Boost From Crypto  But what resulted in the intervening years has been infighting. In short, the Bitcoin community, since the so-called “Blocksize Wars,” has seen fierce opposition between the pro-data people and the people who want Bitcoin to be a data-light form of digital gold.  See also: What Is Bitcoin Meant to Hedge?  Meanwhile, I dreamed a dream of decentralized derivatives backing synthetic dollars without any banking, earning yield off of basis trades when bitcoin price trends lead to futures contango (when longer-dated futures have a higher premium so there’s time value in being long bitcoin and short futures).  To quote a famous man:  What  Here’s what happened:  A number of U.S., citizens who transacted sums as small as $1,500 on LocalBitcoins were arrested, serving jail sentences for peer to peer trading  LocalBitcoins and many similar platforms were shut down  BlackRock made us an offer we couldn’t refuse: Finally putting BTC as a ticker mainstream American baby boomers can purchase with their IRA accounts, causing our USD-denominated wealth to go up  U.S. resident participation in most crypto activities became so problematic through tax enforcement complications, know-your-customer headaches and increasingly draconian penalties (such as the i6050 $10,000 threshold penalty for sending someone BTC or any other coin), meaning U.S. bitcoiners became predominantly focused on holding and not using BTC  Stablecoins emerged as the de facto blockchain-based way to transfer value (which started on the Mastercoin protocol, but due to the fees, quickly migrated to Ethereum). USDT on Tron is the category winner.  The U.S. Foreign Accounts Tax Control Act or the OECD’s Common Reporting Standards laid a brush fire to the wildcat offshore banking of the 1990s and early 2000s, leaving us with a world closer to global financial governance.  The Lightning Network, an attempt to create a flexible, low-cost way to spend BTC, found itself constrained with the irreducible on-chain cost of opening new channels, which limited any routing abstractions to try and fix the problem.  The first major upgrade of Bitcoin network that was acceptable to political consensus since the 2017 Segwit upgrade, Taproot, got used as a work-around for the 80 byte OP_Return limit, leading to a renewed burst of NFT-trading activity around Bitcoin, driving up transaction fees. (This has rankled conservative bitcoiners who now want to avert any future upgrade for fear of similar ingenuity.)  Jeremy Rubin, a prominent Bitcoin developer with an alternative way to scale the network, has become the subject of insults and scrutiny as possible agent provocateur for the supposed crime of making a moderately conservative upgrade meant to make Bitcoin more usable, mostly at his own expense as well as the expense of years of free labor for the team.  BitVM by Robin Linus is the new Lightning; it’s like making a virtual machine out of switches in Minecraft, facilitating peg-in-peg-out without upgrading the core protocol. Jeremy Rubin has volunteered efforts on it such as flattening arrays. There is much debate about its limitations despite these herculean R&D efforts to make a path around the Holy Mountain of an ossified protocol (instead of drilling a tunnel through with a hard fork upgrade).  In other words, in the past 15 years that Bitcoin has been around, a number of attempts designed to make the first and most important blockchain a suitable platform to develop on have failed or been resisted by the community. Did the “number go up”? Yes, yes it did. But is Bitcoin any better off? It’s hard to say.  The time has come to honestly ask: did we fail?  The Bitcoin community is not significantly closer to having a peer-to-peer medium of exchange reality where access to global liquidity and freedom of commercial association is a universally ensconced human right. And our *enemies*, people who hate human freedom, are actually closer to attaining the Carrol Quigley dream of a global college of ordoliberal consensus (i.e. a New World Orderrrr).  We’re still busy arguing about ways to accomplish things that really could be done very easily with a single fork, but the issue is political and a preponderance of precautionary principle precipitating our placid perversions.  Let me put it another way: it’s super weird when an engineering culture of crypto-anarchists develops anti-intellectualism.  Having said that, I’ve been humbled by my own business trip-ups trying to make a work-around to Bitcoin’s inbuilt limitations. After years of experimenting on Bitcoin and having to rewrite my core software due to an avalanche of tech debt trying to cross-compile with the whole Bitcoin C++ project, and many years of boom and bust, I’m finally shipping. And I’m shipping on Litecoin first. Because, hey, Litecoiners are nice people. They, like me, have been humbled by pain.  See also: Tether Stops Support for Bitcoin Layer Omni  Being humbled by pain did another things to me. It forced me to start practicing gratitude and that led me back to God, first in a reconstructionist sort of heretical Catholicism or revisionist protestant Christianity, and then to a reconstructionist, Quran-centric Sufi Islam. And one thing I learned from studying religion the last two years (building in the bear market, you might say) is that human beings love to be sectarian. We love it! It’s like, our favorite thing.  Asserting one’s moral superiority over people who are otherwise your ideological brothers based on invented distinctions is one of the “finer things” in life. Repudiating human-made distinctions that distract from the purity of God’s principles is a major theme in the Qur’an (6:159, 30:32,42:14) and Gospels (Mark 7:5-8, Luke 9:46-56). It’s clear that us bitcoiners have fallen into the same tendency, because to err is human, but to forgive is divine mah Brothers!  What’s happening in the state of the Bitcoin Ummah in this, the year of our Lord 2024, the month of April, the 4th halving, is we’re starting to appreciate that we’re too successful to fully succeed at sabotaging ourselves with endless sectarianism. The outspoken voices of a purist minority are being eclipsed by the onslaught of new users and capital inflow, and the unrelenting march of innovation by a few brilliant weirdos who are doing things with zero-knowledge proofs, embedding DeFi with work-arounds, and other hacks, to force Bitcoin to work as a medium of exchange that non-hodlers can utilize.

26040954,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604084,1713542411,Toncoin Price Jumps 17% As Tether Widens Payment Choices On Telegram’s TON Network,"Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the market, USDT, has made a significant expansion move that has propelled the Toncoin price, the native token of The Open Network (TON), by 17% in the past 24 hours. Tether Expands Reach To 15 Blockchains On Friday, Tether announced the launch of its USDT dollar-pegged token and Tether Gold (XAUT), a gold-backed digital token, on The Open Network. This development marks a significant move for Tether, expanding its presence to 15 blockchains. The integration of TON with Telegram, which boasts over 900 million global users, is expected to provide a “seamless and borderless” experience for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments within Telegram’s user base. With the introduction of USDT and XAUT on TON, Tether aims to facilitate the easy transfer of value between users in the TON ecosystem and other blockchain networks while increasing the transfer speed and reducing costs. Related Reading: Analyst Forecast: Litecoin Poised For $250-$300, But Can It Hold? Paolo Ardoino, CEO at Tether, expressed excitement about the launch, emphasizing their support for The Open Network’s vision of an open and “decentralized internet.” Ardoino stated: We’re excited to bring USD₮ and XAU₮ to The Open Network because we support its vision of an open and decentralized internet and a borderless financial system. The launch of USD₮ and XAU₮ on TON will allow seamless value transfer, increasing activity and liquidity while offering users a financial experience that can match those found in the traditional financial system. This furthers our mission of powering open financial infrastructure across the blockchain space. 11 Million TON Tokens To Drive Adoption Of USDT, XAUT Meanwhile, The Open Network claims to “revolutionize” global peer-to-peer payments, allowing Telegram users to send money instantly without needing a blockchain address or downloading a new app. Notably, USDT on TON will be complemented by fully integrated on-ramps supporting most fiat currencies globally. Additionally, integrated global off-ramps will facilitate users’ withdrawal of supported fiat currencies directly to their bank accounts or cards. The TON Foundation has allocated 11 million TON tokens as incentives to drive adoption. Five million TON will be utilized to boost rewards in USDT/TON liquidity pools across TON decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like StonFi and Dedust. Another 5 million TON will be distributed to users who deposit USDT to the Earn campaign of Telegram’s wallet. Furthermore, withdrawals to TON from supporting exchanges such as OKEx, Bybit, and KuCoin will be free for all users until the end of June 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Could Catalyzed $100,000 Price Surge: Bitwise CEO Ultimately, the introduction of USDT and XAUT on TON, coupled with the incentives provided, is expected to accelerate the adoption of TON and establish it as a “faster, easier and more cost-effective” cross-border payment system compared to traditional financial services, according to The Open Network’s announcement. Toncoin Price Rallies Following the disclosure of the partnership, the Toncoin price surged, reaching a high of $8.02 on Friday. This marked the end of a sharp decline over the past week since the token achieved its all-time high (ATH) of $8.79 on April 11. After reaching the new ATH, the Toncoin price dropped to a low of $5.42 on Saturday, April 13. However, with the recent partnership announcement, the Toncoin price has regained its bullish momentum and is currently trading at $6.59. It aims to surpass the price resistance level of $7.70, which will pave the way for reaching and surpassing the $8 mark. This would provide a favorable trajectory for the Toncoin price to conquer and exceed its current ATH.

Given the recent run and the extreme valuation in COIN, leveraged long Coinbase via CONL is the wrong trade at this point in time. Among the many different product offerings that the innovators on Wall Street have concocted through the years, some of the more risky may arguably be leveraged ETFs. I've covered a few of these types of funds in the past for Seeking Alpha. In my experience, leveraged ETFs typically track with broader indexes or specific market sectors. More recently, we've seen single-stock leveraged ETFs enter the market as tradeable securities. One such fund is the GraniteShares 2x Long COIN ETF ( CONL ). Fund Objective & Details Perhaps obvious from the name of the fund, CONL exists solely to add leverage to shares of Coinbase ( COIN ). Per the fund's latest fact sheet : The Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 2 times (200%) the daily percentage change of the common stock of Coinbase Global Inc. GraniteShares launched CONL in August 2022. Interestingly, for most of the fund's history, it was intended to be a 1.5x leveraged ETF. However, in January 2024 GraniteShares changed the fund objective to hunting 2x COIN returns. CONL AUM: $366 million Expense ratio: 1.15% TTM Yield: 0.23% One of the benefits of single-stock leveraged ETFs is simplicity. While these funds are designed to be trading instruments rather than long term investments, leveraged ETFs are an easy way to get more upside on high conviction trades without the need to directly use margin or options. With CONL, a trader who believes COIN will appreciate in the short to medium term can essentially add synthetic buy power to his/her position while only risking the capital that they put in. Of course, if the trader is wrong, they'll lose more than they would have had they just purchased COIN stock outright. Risks With Levered ETFs Fundamentally, CONL has all of the same risks as buying COIN. Buying individual stocks puts the trader/investor at the risk of underperforming the index. As a crypto-proxy stock, Coinbase is further out on the risk curve than what may be typical for most individual stocks. It's not abnormal for COIN to trade 5-10% up or down in a single trading session during times when there is volatility in the crypto market. Data by YCharts In the roughly 3 months since CONL transitioned from a 1.5x leveraged ETF to a 2x leveraged ETF, the fund has indeed offered a total return nearly double that of Coinbase stock. Though it should be noted that COIN has been in a large uptrend since the end of January that appears to now be rolling over. On the way down, CONL is going to double the losses of COIN. Again, that's by design, as the fund is rebalanced daily. An additional way CONL holders can lose is if the market experiences chop for a sustained period of time. In the example below, I'm taking the closing prices for both COIN and CONL from 4/18/24 as a starting point and simulating total returns, assuming 5% moves up and down each day: 5 percent chop model (Author's Calculations) 20 days of back and forth 5% trading sessions in COIN shows how quickly CONL can begin to decay. Even if the GraniteShares 2x COIN fund works as designed and doubles the returns of COIN, it only takes a few weeks before CONL starts underperforming due to market chop. So while the leverage can work very well in a sustained uptrend, the fund will decay over time from daily rebalancing without a strong uptrend. This illustrates why traders really need to time entries and exits right to make the 2x ETF justified over simply buying the stock directly if holding for longer than a few days. Is Long Coinbase Even The Right Trade? I actually covered Coinbase recently for Seeking Alpha and focused on the company's Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling blockchain called ""Base."" There are certainly some positive signs from both Base usage and from the company's recent quarterly earnings report: Data by YCharts The resurgence in the crypto market late last year helped propel Coinbase to nearly two year highs in both quarterly revenue and net income - the latter of which broke a seven-quarter streak of negative performance. Indications from the public chain data for Q1-24 are also very good: Coinbase Monthly Exchange Volume (The Block) Coinbase did over $157 billion in exchange volume during the month of March. It's the company's highest single month since November 2021. Additionally, Coinbase's exchange volume from both January and February exceed figures from all three months during Q4-23. The point is, Coinbase's first quarter is going to be strong. Despite some of the positives, COIN is ridiculously overvalued: COIN Value Grades (Seeking Alpha) COIN stock is trading at 88 times forward earnings, 10 times forward sales, and 8 times book value. By any realistic stretch of the imagination, the positives have been priced in. Given that, I expect COIN's stock to experience a great deal of weakness in the short to medium term. If GraniteShares' leveraged ETF performs as designed, weakness in COIN will be twice as bad for CONL. Final Takeaways I think I've made the case at this point that products like CONL are not optimal for buy and hold investors. These instruments are for active traders who want a simple way to execute high conviction ideas. Given the run that COIN has had following the approval of spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs and the excitement around the block reward halving, I suspect short term gains in COIN have been made and the stock has a high likelihood of struggling for the next several months. In such an environment, CONL will perform even more poorly. I'd personally stay away from CONL at this point in time. If you've ridden this thing up from the lows, take the money and run.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4684724-graniteshares-2x-long-coin-etf-take-the-money-and-run?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26039683.jpeg

As part of his analysis, van de Poppe suggested that the attention might shift from Bitcoin once the event occurs. A Narrative Shift To Occur Post-Halving Van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that narratives will change as the halving event approaches but failed to specify what the new narrative will be when this happens. However, in a previous X post, the crypto expert laid out some of his expectations for the crypto market going forward, which included what he expected the new narrative to be. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are On The Move Again, But Are They Bullish Or Bearish? According to Van de Poppe, the narrative will shift to Ethereum (ETH) and projects that are focused on Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and Real World Assets (RWA). These sectors, along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and meme coins, have been projected to be among the leading narratives in this bull run. Meanwhile, the crypto expert, who has so far continued to state that altcoins are greatly undervalued, expects these crypto tokens to bounce “in their Bitcoin pairs” once the hype around the halving is over. Furthermore, Van de Poppe mentioned that altcoins will show bullish strength from this second quarter until the summer after which a correction will come in the third quarter of the year. Before now, the crypto expert listed ten altcoins he believes could make the most price gains when the altcoin season begins in full force. These tokens include Chainlink (LINK), Celestia (TIA), Arbitrum (ARB), Polkadot (DOT), Cosmos (ATOM), DYDX (DYDX), WooNetwork (WOO), Sei (SEI), Skale Network (SKL), and Covalent (CQT). Expectations For Bitcoin In the short term, Van de Poppe expects Bitcoin to experience a relief bounce to around $70,000. However, he didn’t sound so bullish about the flagship crypto’s long-term trajectory, predicting that Bitcoin will face a period of consolidation that he doesn’t expect to change in the “coming months.” In another X post, he said, “It’s a waiting game on Bitcoin currently, as momentum is relatively gone.” He added that he expects Bitcoin to continue “the retracement and consolidation,” while altcoins will bounce up in their BTC pairs during this period. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Rally To $3 As Price Reaches ‘Ultimate Support Test’ This predicted consolidation period looks to be the re-accumulation phase in the stages of Bitcoin halving, which crypto analyst Rekt Capital once referred to. Elaborating on what this period is like, Rekt Capital stated back then that many investors get “shaken out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving.” Once this period is over, Bitcoin is expected to make its “parabolic uptrend,” a phase that Rekt Capital noted historically lasts just over a year. In line with this, it is worth noting that most of Bitcoin’s price gains usually come between six months to a year after the Bitcoin halving has occurred.

The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF provides a safer and easier way to invest in bitcoin, with assets held at a regulated custodian. The custodian employs various security measures, including cold storage and insurance, to protect investors' assets. Bitcoin is consolidating just below its all-time high and is forming a bullish pattern which could set up a break higher. Owing some bitcoin in your portfolio seems prudent, and thanks to the new ETFs on the market, is easier than ever before. This article looks at the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) and evaluates whether it is a good way to invest in bitcoin and position for a break-out. Bitcoin Making a Bullish Consolidation Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $73.7K earlier this year, partly driven by new funds `into ETFs like ARKB. However, the previous all-time high of $69k from 2021 is major resistance and stalled the rally. Bitcoin is now trading back below the $69k high at $63.5k as shown by the weekly chart. BTCUSD Weekly Chart (TradingView) After making an impressive 90% rally from the early 2024 low, the rally was too stretched to make a sustainable break to new highs. Consolidation would be healthy and should set up an eventual break higher. Assuming there is a small dip/consolidation followed by a break-out, a bullish cup and handle pattern would form. Cup and Handle Pattern (Investopedia) We can already see the ""cup"" and some ""handle"" have formed. Some traders may want to wait for a fully complete pattern, but by that time the price will be 20% higher. I tend to speculate as a pattern is forming and accept more risk for potentially more reward. Zooming in slightly to the daily chart, the pattern resembles a bull flag, which is valid as long as prices hold above $60,760. A break of this level could lead to a sharp drop to $50.8k, but the larger cup and handle pattern could still form, and the outlook would still be bullish. BTCUSD Daily Chart (TradingView) In short, bitcoin is technically bullish in multiple timeframes. Fundamentally, there are potentially bullish catalysts, including the upcoming halving expected on 19th April. As the chart below shows , the previous three halvings have been positive as supply is constrained. Reactions to Halving (VanEck) The growth of ETFs should also have a positive effect. The total AUM of crypto funds is rapidly heading towards $100B and driving up prices. The institutional race for Bitcoin, catalyzed by the high demand for ETFs, is significantly impacting the market by absorbing available BTC supply and consequently driving up prices. This has resulted in BTC-backed ETPs accounting for approximately 4.9% of the total BTC supply, with the ten newly introduced BTC Spot ETFs holding 3.9% of the supply, valued at $48.2 billion. ARKB - Is it Safe? ARKB is one of the new ETFs which make buying and holding bitcoin much safer and easier. As per the prospectus , The Trust provides investors with the opportunity to indirectly access the market for bitcoin through a traditional brokerage account without the potential barriers to entry or risks involved with holding or transferring bitcoin directly or acquiring it from a bitcoin spot market. One of my main concerns in the cryptocurrency space is the security of my holding, and ARKB addresses this by holding its assets - currently $2.7bn in bitcoin - at a custodian. The Trust will custody its bitcoin at a regulated third-party custodian, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (""Coinbase Custody"" or the ""Bitcoin Custodian""). The Bitcoin Custodian is chartered as a New York State limited liability trust company that provides custody services for digital assets. The custodian employs various methods to keep the assets safe, including holding ""a substantial portion of the private keys associated with the Trust's bitcoin in ""cold storage"" or similarly secure technology"" and ensuring assets are ""held in segregated accounts on the Bitcoin blockchain, commonly referred to as ""wallets,"" and are therefore not commingled with corporate or other customer assets."" Of course, this is not 100% safe, and I am comforted to see the custodian holds insurance. Even if another Sam Bankman-Fried debacle were to unfold , the assets should be covered. The Bitcoin Custodian maintains a commercial crime insurance policy, which is intended to cover the loss of client assets held in cold storage, including from employee collusion or fraud, physical loss including theft, damage of key material, security breach or hack, and fraudulent transfer. The conclusion is that ARKB is safe, or at least as safe as possible. The risks come from bitcoin itself, which is a volatile asset, and from ARKB underperformance/expenses. ARKB - Correlation to Bitcoin ARKB was launched on January 9th this year, so there is not much data to track in regard to performance and how well it tracks the underlying asset. So far, at least, it has correlated very closely, as it should. BTCUSD v ARKB (TradingView) There are slight swings away from its NAV, but the discount and premium have always stayed within 1%. Data by YCharts ARKB does have an expense ratio of 0.21% which was waived briefly until the AUM grew above $1B. This will drag the performance down slightly in the long term but with such a volatile underlying asset, it is hardly a major concern. Other factors may knock the correlation off track. One is liquidity and potential slippage with large trades under volatile conditions. Bitcoin has not had a major drawdown / volatile period since the ETFs were launched earlier this year so their performance under times of stress is still unknown. Another risk is that, according to the prospectus, ""a temporary or permanent ""fork"" of the Bitcoin blockchain could adversely affect an investment in the Trust."" A fork happens when a split in the Bitcoin network creates two separate branches, each with its own protocol. In terms of liquidity of ARKB itself, this is ample with an average daily dollar volume of $149.12M. Other Risks ARKB itself has minimized the risks involved with trading and holding bitcoin. As mentioned earlier, the main risk comes from bitcoin itself. It has rallied 90% this year and has reached formidable resistance at the 2021 high. A pullback / consolidation is normal, healthy even, but this could develop into something more serious. Dropping below the 2024 low of $38.5k would suggest bitcoin is in a new downtrend. While it should eventually recover, the drawdown could be significant. Other Funds There are over a dozen bitcoin ETFs and very little to tell them apart as they should all track the price of bitcoin. Expenses and safety are perhaps the main considerations, and ARKB compares favorably. Cryptocurrency ETFs (ETFdb.com) The funds with 0% expense ratios are deferring expenses like ARKB did in the period after launch. GBTC's 1.50% expense ratio is now prohibitive, but the differences in the rest of the funds are small. IBIT is ARKB's main competitor, but there is only 0.09% difference in the expense ratios. Conclusions Bitcoin is making a bullish pattern in multiple timeframes and should be setting up a more sustained break to new all-time highs. ARKB is a safe, cheap way to gain exposure to bitcoin and position for the break-out.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4684710-bitcoin-is-set-to-break-out-but-is-arkb-a-good-way-to-gain-exposure?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26038371.jpeg

26036116,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604059,1713535244,"Bitcoin Halving Could Catalyzed $100,000 Price Surge: Bitwise CEO","As the cryptocurrency community excitedly awaits the impending Bitcoin halving, Bitwise Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hunter Horsley has weighed in on its impact on BTC, predicting that the event could potentially propel prices to $100,000 or even higher. Horsley expressed his optimistic outlook toward the upcoming Bitcoin Halving on the X (formerly Twitter) platform. Every four years, the Halving has historically been linked to greater price increases, and Horsley’s upbeat view indicates that this cycle might be no different from the others. Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Is Being Underestimated According to the CEO, the much-anticipated event is presently being significantly underestimated in the crypto space. He claims that the market has never priced in it in the past, and it will not be priced in this time either, expressing his confidence toward the occasion. Related Reading: Bitwise CEO Predicts $11 Billion Drop In Bitcoin Supply Post Halving Horsley highlighted the historical relevance and transformative implications of these occurrences, drawing comparisons with past Halvings and citing the notable profits that investors achieved in 2020, 2016, and 2012. He stated that following months of debate by investors on whether the previous three halvings were priced in, Bitcoin grew by 5.4x, 2.8x, and 88x, respectively. Given the past price developments, the Bitwise CEO anticipates this Halving to serve as a catalyst for the $100,000 target for BTC. Horsley’s prediction seems very reasonable since the figure is just about a 47% increase from the digital asset’s current price. It is worth noting that the opinions of fully deployed current holders are not used to measure the impact of the Halving. Rather, it depends on whether there will be a significant and sustained increase in demand in addition to the daily decrease in the supply of natural sellers. In all, the Bitwise CEO foresees a steady growth in demand along with the conditions for a substantial Halving event this year. As investors prepare for the possible impact of this historic occasion on Bitcoin’s price trajectory, this audacious prognosis highlights the possibility of massive price increases not only in BTC but the entire cryptocurrency market. BTC Move Into No Man’s Land With the Halving less than 24 hours away, Cold Blooded Shiller, a cryptocurrency analyst, has reported that Bitcoin has entered No Man’s Land. “There are some interesting discussion points on BTC right now, but we have just entered No Man’s Land,” he stated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Always Sell Into Halvings, Is This Time Any Different?

While Shiller does not think the results will be the same this time, it’s quite reasonable if no recovery happens due to this degree of loss.

Previous halvings were accompanied by other cryptocurrency ecosystem catalysts that acted as tailwinds.  The growth of investors using bitcoin as a macro hedge has reduced volatility this cycle, the report said.  The direction of digital asset markets following the bitcoin {{BTC}} halving is more likely to be driven by macroeconomic factors even as crypto fundamentals remain strong, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Thursday.  “These factors are largely exogenous to crypto and include increased geopolitical tensions, higher for longer rates, reflation, and rising national debts,” analyst David Han wrote.  The recent elevated correlation of altcoins to bitcoin underlines this, Han wrote, “indicating BTC’s anchor role in the space even as BTC firms its position as a macro asset.”  While previous halvings have historically kickstarted a bull market, “these cyclical runups have often been accompanied by other ecosystem catalysts that provide additional tailwinds,” the report said.  The quadrennial reward halving slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply by 50% and is expected to occur late this evening or early tomorrow UTC.  While crypto has been largely been viewed as a “risk on” asset class, Coinbase says “bitcoin’s continued resilience and the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has created a bifurcated pool of investors (for bitcoin in particular) – one which sees bitcoin as a purely speculative asset, and another that treats bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ and hedge against geopolitical risk.”  The growth of investors that use bitcoin as a macro hedge partly explains the reduced magnitude of pullbacks this cycle, the report added.  Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS) expressed similar sentiment in a report last week. It said “caution should be taken against extrapolating the past cycles and the impact of halving, given the prevailing macro conditions.”  Read more: Goldman Cautions Against Extrapolating Previous Bitcoin Halving Cycles for Price Predictions",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/19/crypto-markets-will-be-driven-by-macro-factors-following-the-halving-coinbase-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/655f6b5aa1b4a0767b302ed975cbb82fd0f79370-5760x3240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin recovered slightly as its halving event approaches, adding 5% over 24 hours. Ether also rose, rising 4% to $3,000. According to Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETP specialist at CEC Capital, the uptick for bitcoin will continue for U.S. markets and then readjust and push back to earlier levels. Bitcoin reached a weekly low of $58,800 this week and is currently approaching the $65,000 mark. The halving is predicted to take place late Friday or early Saturday UTC. The quadrennial event slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply by 50%. Altcoins also gained, with dogwifhat (WIF) jumping 18%, Ethena Labs’ ENA 16% and Sei Networks’ SEI by 14%.  U.S.-based spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registered outflows totaling $4.3 million on Thursday, extending a four-day run of withdrawals ahead of the supposedly bullish mining-reward halving. Since April 12, the ETFs have witnessed a cumulative net outflow of over $319 million, with Grayscale's GBTC accounting for a large share of the withdrawals, provisional data published by Farside Investors showed. On Thursday, GBTC lost $90 million in outflows, which was partially offset by inflows into Fidelity's FBTC and BlackRock's IBIT. The Grayscale ETF has experienced outflows since day one for several reasons, including the fund's relatively costly fees. So, while GBTC outflows may not be a cause for concern, the recent slower inflows into other ETFs might be.  Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is acquiring TradeStation Crypto, the digital asset-focused division of online brokerage TradeStation, to expand its regulatory licensing in the U.S. ""We can confirm Kraken has recently purchased TradeStation's crypto business,"" a Kraken spokesperson said via email.

The takeover hasn't previously been disclosed publicly. Florida-based TradeStation Crypto has acquired money transmitter and other types of regulatory licenses in most U.S. states over the past few years.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows changes in prices for bitcoin perpetual futures on Binance and aggregate market-wide open interest (lower pane) over the past 24 hours.  As perpetuals recovered from Asian session lows, open interest declined.  The divergence indicates that the price recovery was partly fueled by a short squeeze.

The halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoin and has historically led to a bull market in the price. This time, the halving cycle may not repeat due to diminished effects on supply, a pre-emptive rally, and the possibility of a ""sell the news"" event. Thesis Summary The Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Halving is upon us, and there will definitely be a lot of movement and speculation around this event. Every four years, more or less, the Bitcoin mining reward is halved, which has significant implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem and price. This time around, the halving is highly anticipated. Will things play out differently, or will we see a repeat of the cycle? As an investor, what is the best way to play this event? Let's get right to it. What is the Bitcoin Halving? As the name well implies, during the halving, the Bitcoin mining block reward is slashed in half. If you are new to BTC, two questions may have just entered your head: What is Bitcoin mining, and what is a block? Bitcoin can be defined as digital code, and this digital code is brought into existence through Bitcoin mining. This process involves the use of specialized hardware to resolve a complex cryptographic equation. The first miner in the network who succeeds at doing this is rewarded with an amount of newly created Bitcoin. Why? Because this process of ""mining"" actually serves to validate and confirm transactions in the Bitcoin network. In fact, the reward is obtained as a result of the miner validating a new ""block"" (set of transactions) into the Bitcoin network or blockchain. When is the Bitcoin Halving? As I write this, it is April 18th 2024 12:24 PM ET Time. The Bitcoin halving is expected to happen in around 1 day and 7 hours, according to this Bitcoin halving countdown . Following the halving, the Bitcoin mining reward will go from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. The last time the halving happened was May 11, 2020, so roughly four years ago. While a lot of people simply say that halving happens every four years, it is not set for a particular time but actually happens after 210,000 blocks have been mined. Why Is the Bitcoin Halving Important? But enough with the technicalities. Why is the BTC halving so important? There are at least two key reasons why the Bitcoin halving is so important: It's a key part of the system's design which makes holding BTC fundamentally appealing It has a significant impact on the price, so far, a positive one. The Bitcoin halving serves to reduce the final supply of Bitcoin that will ever exist. Without it, the Bitcoin supply would keep inflating at a steady pace. Through the halving, we know that, eventually 21 million Bitcoins will have been mined into existence, and that will be the end of it. BTC Supply (Medium) By 2033, 99% of all Bitcoin will be mined. By the way, this chart is somewhat dated, as we are now almost exactly at the 4th Bitcoin halving. The fact that Bitcoin has a limited supply is one of its appeals as a form of digital money/gold and store of value, and it is probably not an accident that the supply of Bitcoin was designed in a way to mimic that of gold, since most of the mineable gold we know of is already above ground. Now, the second reason people are very interested in the halving event, is because of its correlation, not necessarily causation, with the Bitcoin price. BTC Halving Cycle (Author's work) As we can see in this long-term chart of the Bitcoin price, there are some clear price dynamics at play that have repeated themselves. Following the halving, we usually enter a bull market, shown in green. Around 18-24 months later we enter a bear market, shown in red, and then leading up to the next halving we enter a consolidation/distribution phase, shown in orange. With that said, time to answer a couple of questions about this cycle: Why does the BTC price move this way? Will it play out the same this time? There are at least a couple of theories around why the Bitcoin price appreciates after the halving. For one thing, if the Bitcoin reward halves, then the supply of new Bitcoin is now smaller. Less supply, in the face of equal or higher demand, can lead to higher prices. The idea is that BTC miners, which are net sellers, are now applying half the selling pressure to markets. On the other hand, there's also an understanding that if the Bitcoin reward is now halved, the market will eventually adjust the Bitcoin price so that miners can stay profitable. However, there is a problem with this theory. Firstly, as we have shown above, a very large part of the Bitcoin supply has already been mined. With every halving the effect of the reduced supply is much smaller, and this is now the fourth halving. We could speculate that at this point, the reduction in the block reward will be too small to actually have a noticeable impact on supply. The other reasons why the BTC cycle may be playing out around the halving, could also simply be explained by expectations. If everyone is expecting a bull market to take place after the halving, then it makes sense to buy. And this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Will History Repeat? So, will history repeat this time? Will we see a bull market after the halving? My short answer is no; this time is different. First off, consider the fact that the BTC cycle, as it has played out in the past, has already been broken. The Bitcoin price has already broken above its previous cycle high, ahead of the halving, something that had never happened before. In fact, we have already had a significant bull market before the halving, will this continue? On the other hand, this halving event, and its potential impact, is now being tracked by almost every market participant. It is rare that things play out exactly like everyone expects them to, and we saw a recent example of this. BTC ETF sell-off (Author's work) Following the BTC ETF approval, the cryptocurrency sold off by over 20%. Could this also be a sell the news event? To sum up, here are the reasons I believe BTC may not follow the halving cycle: Effect on supply change has been diminished after four halvings Halving cycle has already been broken, and we have seen a pre-emptive rally. People will be looking to ""sell the news"". It lines up with my technical analysis (see below). How To Profit From The Halving The most important question, though, is how do we profit from the halving Well, that depends on how you think the BTC halving will affect the price. I have laid out my own theory as to why this time will be different. However, I will discuss below the two ways you can play the halving, depending on where you stand. Option 1: Cycle Will Repeat If we are indeed repeating the halving cycle, then we must simply look at what happened in the past, and apply a similar strategy this time around. BTC Halving cycle (Author's work) Based on history, now would be an ideal time to accumulate Bitcoin, while the best time to sell would be around 12-18 months after the halving. So, buy Bitcoin now, and sell around April-August of 2025 Option 2: Sell The News The way I see it, with the latest sell-off in Bitcoin, we now have an ideal setup to rally into the halving and achieve one final high, and then sell-off. BTC TA (Author's work) The way I see it, we are completing an impulse from the 2023 lows, and we are now ready to begin a final wave ((V)) inside the larger circle wave 3. Measuring the length of wave 1 from the bottom of 2, the 2 fib ext projects us towards $98,219. This could be an ideal level to sell in my opinion, as it also coincides with the blue trend line coming from the previous Bitcoin tops, and we could also expect some significant psychological resistance at the $100,000 level. Yet again, with everyone expecting Bitocin to surpass $100,000, wouldn't it be funny if we stopped just shy of that after the halving? Takeaway And, of course, there is a third option. Ignore the noise and keep accumulating Bitcoin for the long term, which is perhaps the most prudent approach. The Bitcoin halving serves to remind us why Bitcoin is actually so valuable. It is a decentralized and censorship-resistant form of money with a limited and immutable supply, something which in today's world, no pun intended, is in short supply.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4684632-bitcoin-halving-what-to-know-and-how-to-profit-btc-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26031246.jpeg

26029927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604029,1713526225,The Next Dogecoin? Top Trader Points To This Memecoin,"Crypto trading sensation Ansem, known on X (formerly Twitter) as @blknoiz06, has directed the market’s gaze towards the Bitcoin Runes ecosystem, labeling it as the nascent grounds for the next 100x crypto opportunity, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Ansem, whose prowess is well-documented through his previous astronomical gains of 170x on Solana (SOL), 520x on dogwifhat (WIF), and 80x on Bonk (BONK), stirred the crypto community with his recent Dogecoin comparison. On the cusp of Bitcoin’s highly anticipated halving today, Ansem doubled down on his initial assessment, particularly highlighting two tokens within the Bitcoin Runes ecosystem: Bitcoin Wizards (WZRD) and PUPS. He equates WZRD with Dogecoin, suggesting it has the potential to mirror Dogecoin’s viral success. In contrast, he compares PUPS to the lesser-known but highly profitable dogwifhat (WIF). Related Reading: Elon Musk Latest Tweet: How Much Did Dogecoin Gain From It Today? In a tweet that caught the eye of both investors and enthusiasts, Ansem elaborated on his reasoning behind the picks, stating: Great thread, been saying, I believe Runes are next asymmetric 100x opp in crypto. The meme that got DOGE founder interested in Bitcoin & the phrase magic internet money is still used today – representative of bitcoin culture. DOGE equivalent = WZRD, WIF equivalent = PUPS. Ansem references a thread on X by Immutable Edge (@ImmutableSOL), who delved into the historical and cultural significance of the “Magic Internet Money” meme, originally sparked by mavensbot’s viral Reddit ad. The “Magic Internet Money” meme dates back to February 18, 2013, when mavensbot, a digital artist, submitted a hand-drawn depiction of a blue wizard to promote Bitcoin on Reddit. This ad, created during Bitcoin’s early adoption phase, was crucial in cultivating a cultural ethos around Bitcoin. It resonated deeply within the community, encapsulating the whimsical yet revolutionary nature of Bitcoin’s rise. The ad’s simplicity and authenticity resonated with the Reddit community, propelling Bitcoin from a niche internet experiment to a major financial phenomenon. Within weeks of the ad’s debut, Bitcoin’s value surged from $27 to a record high of $1,132 by November 2013. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Weekly Golden Cross: Why This Analyst Believes The Bull Rally Is Far From Over Bitcoin Wizards, one of the highlighted tokens, aims to rekindle this original spirit. The token leverages the iconic imagery and cultural narrative of the “Magic Internet Money” meme to foster a new wave of interest and adoption. The creators of WZRD are not only paying homage to Bitcoin’s roots but are also embedding this storied meme within the mechanics of a modern cryptocurrency, aiming to capture both nostalgia and innovation. The Bitcoin Wizards project is part of the broader Bitcoin Runes ecosystem, which reached a lot of hype prior to its launch. According to Ansem, WZRD’s history and deep roots in memes give it the perfect ingredients to become the next Dogecoin, just on Bitcoin Runes. Moreover, the analyst assessment comes at a critical time for the crypto market, which is often influenced by the narratives that capture the community’s imagination. As the Bitcoin halving event unfolds, many eyes will be on the Bitcoin Runes ecosystem to see if it can indeed replicate the meteoric rises seen in BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals. At press time, WZRD traded at $12.15, up 70% in the last 24 hours.

The TON network was launched by Telegram, but separated after regulatory concerns.  Tether, the company behind the $108 billion market cap USDT, said it is expanding the dollar-pegged stablecoin and its gold-backed XAUT sibling natively on The Open Network (TON), a blockchain adjacent to messaging app Telegram.  Tether's transparency page earlier today showed that there's $10 million worth of USDT authorized on the TON blockchain, with $3 million being already issued.  With the move, Tether aims to boost USDT and XAUT for ""borderless, peer-to-peer payments"" among Telegram's nearly 900 million users, according to a statement issued during the Dubai 2049 conference. The expansion will also benefit the rapidly growing TON ecosystem, where users will be able to use the stablecoins in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  ""The launch of USDT and XAUT on TON will allow seamless value transfer, increasing activity and liquidity while offering users a financial experience that can match those found in the traditional financial system,"" Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in the statement. ""This furthers our mission of powering open financial infrastructure across the blockchain space.”  The Open Network is a decentralized layer-1 network initiated by Telegram but operating independently since the company abandoned development due to regulatory concerns. The ecosystem has seen rapid growth lately with incentives for onboarding Telegram users, boosting the number of monthly active addresses to over 1.7 million from less than 100,000 six months ago, according to blockchain data by Tonstat. Telegram also recently switched to the network's native token, toncoin (TON), from euros as a payment for its advertisement platform.  Read more: TON-Based Economy Starting to Take Root in Telegram, TON Foundation Says  The TON token was up earlier in the day, then tumbled as much as 15% following the news. It's still up 7% over the past 24 hours and tripled in price this year, boasting nearly a $25 billion market capitalization.  While the crypto wallet on Telegram supports various blockchains for deposits and withdrawals, ""to encourage the adoption of TON, trading fees are substantially reduced,"" Halil Mirakhmed, chief operating officer of Wallet in Telegram, which operates independently from Telegram, told CoinDesk. ""Within the Ton Space ecosystem only USDT on TON is available, streamlining the user experience for those invested in the TON ecosystem,"" he added.  Following the announcement, Ramp Network, a fintech company connecting crypto with traditional banking rails, said Friday it will enable purchases and withdrawals of USDT on TON. The company will start by allowing on-ramping from fiat currencies to USDT on TON on its website and integrate to third-party wallets supporting TON-based assets, and plans to add off-ramp capabilities later.  ""Crypto transactions should be as simple as texting,"" Ramp CEO Szymon Sypniewicz said in a statement.

Matthew Dixon, CEO of Evai.io, has highlighted LTC’s resilience compared to Bitcoin during this period of market volatility.

42390970,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRHHP,1713516860,Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register Five-Day Withdrawals Streak Ahead of Halving,"The U.S. spot ETFs lost $4.3 million in outflows on Thursday, taking the five-day tally to over $319 million.  GBTC again led the outflows, while inflows into BlackRock's IBIT continued to slow.  The U.S.-based spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registered cumulative outflows of $4.3 million on Thursday, extending the four-day run of withdrawals ahead of the supposedly bullish mining reward halving.  Since April 12, the ETFs have witnessed a total net outflow of over $319 million, with Grayscale's GBTC accounting for a large share of the withdrawals, provisional data published by Farside Investors showed.  For instance, on Thursday, GBTC alone saw a significant loss of $90 million in outflows, which was partially offset by inflows into Fidelity's FBTC and BlackRock's IBIT.  The Grayscale ETF has been losing money since day one for several reasons, including the fund's relatively costly fee structure. So, GBTC outflows may not be a cause for concern, but the recent slower inflows into other ETFs might be.  BlackRock's IBIT attracted just $18.8 million on Thursday, down 93% from the monthly high of $308.8 million on April 5.  ""Key liquidity drivers, such as stablecoin growth and US-listed Bitcoin ETF inflows, have slowed down - as we have mentioned for several weeks. ETF flows peaked on March 12, and four consecutive days of net outflows have recently been seen. Demand for US-listed Bitcoin ETFs appears saturated, as even a 10-15% decline in Bitcoin prices has not increased net inflows,"" Matrixport said in a market update early Friday.  Bitcoin changed hands at $64,700 at press time, down over 13% from the record highs above $73,500 last month, CoinDesk data show.  The pullback could be attributed to several factors, including U.S. tax payments, the dwindling probability of the Fed rate cuts, and Iran-Israel tensions.  ""The geopolitical risk in the Middle East could have been a qualified event to allocate into Bitcoin, but prices traded lower instead of up. This was a real test in cementing Bitcoin as a risk-off asset—unfortunately, Bitcoin somewhat failed as its price stagnated and sold off,"" Matrixport added.  Late Friday, Bitcoin's blockchain is set to halve per block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, reducing the pace of supply expansion by 50%. Historically, halvings have presaged major rallies, though the magnitude and duration of uptrends have not been consistent.  The consensus in the crypto community is that the impending halving will put cryptocurrency on a long-term bullish path. However, several observers, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, have suggested otherwise, with the later signaling the potential for deeper price correction after the halving.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/19/bitcoin-spot-etfs-register-five-day-withdrawals-streak-ahead-of-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b53cfa82766953ae1a35280e08d80682d4961f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If history repeats itself, bitcoin will enjoy a strong rally after the event, the broker said.  A potential increase in network fees could offset the impact of reduced rewards, Benchmark noted.  Crypto miners are the group most affected by bitcoin's {{BTC}} reward halving, and they are better positioned this time round due to the cryptocurrency's gains in the past six months, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Thursday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value rallied about 140% in the past two quarters, while ether {{ETH}}, the second-largest, added 85%, CoinDesk Indices data show. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, gained 115%.  The quadrennial event slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply by 50% and is expected to occur late this evening or early tomorrow UTC.  Benchmark cited Haris Basit, the chief strategy officer of bitcoin miner Bitdeer Technologies (BTDR), who said the recent increase in the price of BTC could bail out many of the Bitcoin network’s less-efficient miners in the near-term.  Given bitcoin’s recent outperformance, the “role of the halving in driving the retirement of inefficient mining rigs and reducing the network hashrate would be much less dramatic than it would have been absent the rally,” Basit said at a Benchmark-hosted event.  “Most of the publicly traded bitcoin miners have initiated or announced plans to increase their electricity and hashrate capacities as a means of adjusting to their reduced revenue and gross profit profiles,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer wrote, noting that due to uncertainty around the halving nearly all of the listed miners’ stocks are down year-to-date despite a 46% rally in bitcoin in the same period.  “The impact of the halving on bitcoin miners’ economics could be more offset over time if history repeats and a strong rally in the price of the cryptocurrency occurs during the months following the event,” Palmer wrote.  The broker noted that a potential increase in network fees could also help to mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards.  The halving’s effect on the cryptocurrency’s price “could be magnified by the concurrent demand shock created by the emergence of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following their approval in the U.S. in January,” the report said. “We expect the inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest.”  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Partially Priced In With No Big Rally Expected Afterward: Deutsche Bank",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/19/bitcoin-miners-are-better-positioned-for-the-halving-this-time-round-benchmark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d561d051c1e2ae6d43fd2d58d2999fbbd9de8ea-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26021082,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603998,1713514242,"Bitcoin Set To Soar To $200,000 Post-Halving: Skybridge Founder","In a recent interview on the future of Bitcoin, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner of Skybridge Capital, has made a compelling prediction that the Bitcoin price could potentially reach $200,000 following its forthcoming halving event. This forecast comes at a time of considerable volatility within the crypto markets, exacerbated by recent geopolitical tensions and broader economic uncertainty. Bitcoin Poised To Hit $200,000 During the interview, Scaramucci provided insights into the forces he believes will drive Bitcoin’s price in the coming months. “Well, I mean, look, you could get shocks like wars and you could get, you know, God forbid a terrorist calamity or something like that that could take Bitcoin down 10 or 15%,” he explained. Despite potential short-term setbacks, Scaramucci emphasized the underlying demand dynamics bolstering Bitcoin’s price, particularly highlighting the influence of new financial products like ETFs and the growing interest from institutional investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Always Sell Into Halvings, Is This Time Any Different? He elaborated on his bullish outlook, linking it to the anticipated Bitcoin halving, an event that historically impacts the supply side of Bitcoin economics by reducing the reward for mining new blocks, thereby constraining supply. “But long term with the halving coming this week, I think this thing trades to $170,000, possibly to $200,000,” Scaramucci asserted. The discussion also veered into the broader implications of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional financial products, such as ETFs. Scaramucci argued that these instruments play a critical role in broadening Bitcoin’s investor base. He dismissed concerns over the potential for ETFs to lead to centralization of Bitcoin ownership. “In terms of adoption vis-a-vis the ETF, you look out your four-year time horizon. It will still be less than 10 % of the overall ownership of Bitcoin. So this whole notion that the ETFs are gonna overly centralize Bitcoin, I don’t buy it. I think what the ETFs are, though, is they’re a great conduit for people that are used to buying them.” BTC Is Still In The Web 1.0 Era Scaramucci compared Bitcoin’s trajectory to the early internet era, particularly drawing parallels with significant tech stocks like Amazon during the dot-com bubble. “In 1999, Amazon was an emerging stock on an emerging technology, and it was quite volatile. And you lost 20 to 50 % eight times on Amazon. You lost 80%. Yeah, that one time in March of 2020, it went down 80%. But if you held Amazon over that period of time, $10,000 is worth a little over $14 million today.” Related Reading: No Fed Rate Cuts? No Worries For Bitcoin, Says Research Firm He also addressed concerns about Bitcoin’s practical uses, contrasting its current utility with more traditional assets like gold, which also do not offer direct cash flow. Scaramucci highlighted innovative financial practices within the crypto ecosystem that provide returns similar to traditional cash flow, such as yield-generating accounts and borrowing agreements available through platforms like Galaxy Digital. Regarding potential market downturns akin to the dot-com bust, Scaramucci acknowledged the risks but remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s resilience and long-term value proposition. “I think if we go through a dot-com bust in the broader market in the next year or two, I think you’ll have a price shock in Bitcoin consistent with a dot-com bust. However, if you’re willing to hold that asset, which we are over a rolling four-year period of time, no one has ever lost money in Bitcoin,” he noted, underscoring the importance of a long-term investment horizon. At press time, the BTC price rallied back above $64,000.

42390969,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRHCH,1713509801,Polymarket Traders See 32% Chance of No Fed Rate Cuts This Year,"Traders on Polymarket now put the probability of the Fed holding rates steady in 2024 at 32%, compared to 7% in March.  Traditional markets have scaled back expectations to two 25 basis points rate cuts from six in early January.  The probability that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged this year is rising.  Betters on blockchain-based betting site Polymarket now see a 32% chance of the Fed keeping the benchmark interest rate steady between 5.25% and 5.5% by the end of the year. That’s a significant change from the 7% probability seen nearly a month ago.  Meanwhile, punters see a 27% probability of a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut.  The hawkish shift in the market sentiment could dampen the demand for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies and technology stocks. According to some analysts, bitcoin’s {{BTC}} surge to record highs above $73,000 in the first quarter was primarily fueled by the anticipation of swift interest rate cuts.  The uptrend in the leading cryptocurrency by market value has stalled since mid-March, with prices trading between $60,000 and $70,000.  Hawkish pricing on Polymarket is consistent with traditional markets, where traders now see just two 25 basis points rate cuts in 2024 versus six in early January. Bank of America recently pushed out the timing of the first Fed rate cut to December from June, while Societe Generale said the central bank would not cut rates until 2025.  No urgency to cut rates  A few weeks ago, markets and policymakers were convinced that inflation would continue to cool in the coming months, allowing the Fed to cut rates rapidly in the year’s second half.  However, the latest data, particularly March’s strong jobs report and hotter-than-expected inflation print, which showed a third straight monthly acceleration in the cost of living, has weakened the case for immediate rate cuts.  “We know that there is no traditional justification for U.S. rate cuts in the short term. Employment is strong, retail sales are beating expectations, Q1 GDP is expected to be not much lower than Q4, and inflation is proving stubborn. Even Fed Chair Powell, yes, he who less than four months ago told us that cuts were imminent, is now suggesting that they may hold rates high for longer than previously anticipated,” Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in Wednesday’s edition.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that inflation has returned to the U.S. economy, indicating that rate cuts may not happen any time soon.  On Thursday, New York Fed President John Williams joined the hawkish bandwagon, saying, “I definitely don’t feel urgency to cut interest rates” given the strength of the economy.""  “I think eventually...interest rates will need to be lower at some point, but the timing of that is driven by the economy,” Williams said at the Semafor’s World Economy Summit held in Washington.  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he is comfortable “being patient,” hinting that the end of the year is the likely timing for the first rate cut.  San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly echoed a similar sentiment Monday, saying, “The worst thing to do is act urgently when urgency is not required.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/19/polymarket-traders-see-32-chance-of-no-fed-rate-cuts-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c7cc940bb8d37d1d28af672e7a55271883cfde9-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $572 resistance zone. BNB price started a fresh increase after it found support near the $515 zone. The price is now trading below $555 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $540 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $572 resistance zone. BNB Price Faces Hurdles After a downside correction below $550, BNB price found support near the $515 zone. A low was formed at $513.6 and the price started a recovery wave, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move above the $525 and $530 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the $540 pivot level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $630 swing high to the $513 low.

The price is still trading below $550 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $555 level. The next resistance sits near the $572 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $630 swing high to the $513 low. Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $572 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $600. A close above the $600 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $630 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $650 level in the coming days. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $572 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $532 level. The next major support is near the $520 level. The main support sits at $515. If there is a downside break below the $515 support, the price could drop toward the $500 support.

With the next one just around the corner, how are miners behaving this time? Next Bitcoin Halving Is Less Than Two Days Away Now In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed Bitcoin miners’ behavior in the build-up to the next Halving. The “Halving” is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the cryptocurrency’s block rewards (the compensation miners receive for solving blocks) are permanently slashed in half. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Forms Bullish Pattern That Led To 50% Rally On Average This event occurs approximately every four years, and according to NiceHash’s countdown, the next one will occur in just over 32 hours. The countdown to the next halving event | Source: NiceHash Bitcoin miners earn revenue from two sources: transaction fees and block rewards. Historically, the former has been quite low on the BTC network, so the miners primarily depend on the latter to pay off their running costs. Since the block rewards are cut in half during Halvings, these events naturally deal a significant blow to the miner’s revenues. As such, it’s not surprising that the miners have generally shown a reaction to the event in the past cycles. “One of the common dynamics that occur in every cycle of cutting the issuance of new BTC is the significant selling pressure exerted by miners,” says the quant. One way to gauge the degree of selling pressure coming from these chain validators is via the Miner to Exchange Flow metric. This indicator tracks the total amount of Bitcoin moving from miner-associated addresses to wallets connected to centralized exchanges. As miners usually deposit Bitcoin to these platforms for selling, this flow can provide hints about their selling behavior. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) BTC Miner to Exchange Flow over the last few years: Looks like the 30-day MA value of the metric has observed a steep plunge in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow had surged to high levels in the 2020 Halving event, implying that this group had potentially been participating in a selloff. This selling push may have come from the miners planning to exit, given the sharp revenue reduction that was set to occur. The graph, though, clearly shows that no such selling pressure has emerged this time around despite the event being just around the corner. Related Reading: 69% Of PEPE Holders Left In Profits After 26% Plunge So, what’s going on here? The analyst suggests that the Bitcoin miners may have already completed the latest round of selling in advance (as the exchange inflows from the cohort did spike in February).

Tokenized gold PAXG is up 3%.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} came back over $62,000 as the market recovered after reports of limited damage from an Israeli strike on Iranian military targets.  ABC News first reported that Israel had launched a retaliatory strike against Iran on Friday morning.

Al Jazeera reported that Iranian authorities are downplaying the nature of the attack, claiming it was a limited drone strike.

26004409,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603910,1713492003,Bitcoin: Expect The Unexpected – Analyst Sees Unconventional Bull Run Post-Halving,"Bitcoin has been moving lower ahead of the Halving event, going against analysts’ expectations. This price action has been unexpected and shows how the coin tends to go against predictions, basically charting its path. Bitcoin Breaking The Mold In light of Bitcoin’s randomness, especially in the past few months following the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), one analyst expects the coin to continue defying expectations by clocking in a bull run that defies historical trends. The analyst cites two recent instances where Bitcoin defied expectations to justify this bullish outlook. First, following the rapid expansion in the 2020 to 2021 bull run that saw Bitcoin soar from less than $10,000 to fresh all-time highs of around $70,000, prices sharply contracted in 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $455,000: Expert Echoes Previous Halving Pattern Then, the United States Federal Reserve shifted its monetary policy to curb raging inflation by rapidly increasing interest rates. Following this and other market-related events, Bitcoin prices dipped below the all-time high of the previous cycle of $20,000. By November 2022, prices fell to as low as $15,000, accelerated by the collapse of FTX. This retest of previous highs and fall below $20,000 had never happened before. Another anomaly occurred last month. For the first time, Bitcoin prices expanded and broke the previous all-time highs of around $70,000 before the Halving event. As Bitcoin’s past price action shows, prices only rally to fresh all-time highs after Halving. However, this changed when BTC soared to $73,800, possibly paving the way for bulls to join in and push the coin back to unchartered territory post-Halving. Is BTC Ready For A Multi-Year Rally? With this in mind, the analyst believes Bitcoin will continue uniquely shaping its path, deviating from history. For instance, the analyst thinks BTC will outperform altcoins in the coming months. The analyst adds that increased regulatory scrutiny following high-profile collapses like FTX and Luna could dampen altcoin enthusiasm. Related Reading: Here’s What Would Happen If The Bitcoin Price Fell Below $58,000 The coin will ride on the fact that it is the only one with an ETF from the United States SEC receiving investments. As a result of this capital injection, Bitcoin will likely register a multi-year “up only” phase, just like gold did once its ETF was approved. Prices remain depressed ahead of this. Though prices are increasing at spot rates, the coin is within a bear formation. Currently, BTC has local resistance at around $65,000.

Chainlink 30-Day MVRV Ratio Has Plunged In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed the latest trend in Chainlink’s 30-day MVRV ratio. The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” is a popular on-chain indicator that tracks the ratio between LINK’s market cap and realized cap. The market cap naturally refers to the total valuation of the asset’s circulating supply at the current spot price. In contrast, the realized cap is a different type of capitalization model that calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by instead taking the price at which each coin in circulation last moved on the network as its “true” value. Related Reading: 69% Of PEPE Holders Left In Profits After 26% Plunge Since the last transaction of any coin was probably the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would signify its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap sums up the cost basis of every coin in circulation. In this view, the realized cap would be nothing but a measure of the total capital the investors have used to purchase the asset. In contrast, the market cap represents the value that they are holding right now. The MVRV ratio compares these two models, and its value can provide hints about whether the overall market holds more or less than it puts into Chainlink. In the context of the current topic, the 30-day version of this indicator is of focus, which restricts itself to only the investors who bought within the past month. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this LINK indicator over the past couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have registered a steep decline in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink 30-day MVRV ratio has recently taken a sharp plunge and dipped under the 0% mark. The 0% mark is where the market cap and realized cap are exactly equal, so below it, the latter would be greater than the former. When this is the case, the investors are carrying losses. This recent plunge into the negative has naturally come for the metric as the cryptocurrency’s price has plummeted, putting the 30-day buyers underwater. In the chart, Ali has highlighted a specific pattern that Chainlink appears to have followed regarding this indicator, plunging deep into the negative territory. “Each time Chainlink MVRV 30-Day Ratio has dropped below -12.24% since August 2022, it’s signaled a prime buying opportunity, averaging 50% returns!” notes the analyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Slow Down After 700,000 BTC Selloff, Reversal Sign?

This unexpected profitability has raised questions about how a blockchain like Ethereum can be profitable. Ethereum Revenue Potential As noted in a recent analysis by the on-chain data platform Token Termina, the collection of transaction fees is a critical aspect of Ethereum’s business model. All network users are required to pay fees in ETH when interacting with applications on the blockchain, which serves as an important source of revenue for Ethereum. Once transaction fees are paid, a portion of the ETH is burned and permanently removed from circulation. This process, commonly referred to as “ETH buyback,” benefits existing ETH holders, as the reduction in supply increases the scarcity and value of the remaining ETH tokens. Thus, the daily burning of ETH contributes to the economic benefit of those holding Ethereum. Related Reading: Here’s What Would Happen If The Bitcoin Price Fell Below $58,000 In contrast to the burning of ETH, Ethereum also issues new ETH tokens as rewards to the network’s validators for each new block added to the blockchain. These rewards are similar to traditional stock-based compensation and are designed to incentivize validators to secure and maintain the network’s integrity. Nonetheless, it’s important to note that the issuance of new ETH tokens dilutes the holdings of existing ETH holders. According to Token Terminal, the difference between the daily USD value of the burned ETH (revenue) and the newly issued ETH (expenses) represents the daily earnings for existing ETH holders, essentially the Ethereum blockchain owners. This calculation allows for the determination of Ethereum’s profitability on a day-to-day basis. Reduced Transaction Costs Drive $3.3 Billion Growth In addition to the overhauled revenue model implemented by the Ethereum blockchain, the launch of the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade to the Ethereum ecosystem at the end of the first quarter of 2024 brought significant changes, including the introduction of a revolutionary data storage system called blobs. This upgrade has reduced congestion on the Ethereum network and significantly reduced transaction costs on Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum (ABR), Polygon (MATIC), and Coinbase’s Base. Implementing the Dencun upgrade, alongside the adoption of blobs and Layer 2 networks, has significantly impacted Ethereum’s revenue. According to Token Terminal data, the blockchain’s revenue has witnessed an 18% annualized increase, amounting to an impressive $3.3 billion. These revenue gains can be attributed to reduced transaction costs, making Ethereum a more attractive platform for users and developers.

Over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s revenue has declined by over 52%. This downturn can be attributed to the broader market dynamics and the temporary decrease in investor enthusiasm. Examining the data over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s market cap (fully diluted) has decreased by 15.2% to $358.47 billion. Similarly, the circulating market cap has declined by 15.2% to reach the same value. Additionally, the token trading volume over the past 30 days has declined 18.6%, totaling $586.14 billion. ETH is trading at $3,042, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours. It remains to be seen whether these changes and the reduction in fees will have the same effect in the second quarter of the year, and how this, coupled with a potential increase in trading volume, can push the ETH price to higher levels.
