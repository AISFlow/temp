42406276,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetOre,1619739223,CFTC Appoints Former DEX Lawyer as Head of Fintech Wing,"Jason Somensatto, a former lawyer at decentralized exchange project 0x Labs, is the new acting director of LabCFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) financial technology research division.      Somensatto will take over from Melissa Netram, who departed the post in early April. Before joining the CFTC in February, he was a senior counsel at 0x, whose ZRX token was the first ERC-20 token to be listed on Coinbase’s professional trading platform. 0x raised $24 million in an initial coin offering in 2017.      Somensatto declined to comment when reached, but the current LabCFTC “Team” page confirms his role.      While a number of high-profile regulators have recently taken positions in crypto businesses, Somensatto is one of the individuals moving the other way this year.      In a statement, Acting CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam praised Somensatto’s appointment.      “I am grateful that Jason has agreed to serve as the Acting Director of LabCFTC,” he said. “Given his experience and deep knowledge of the digital asset marketplace, I am confident he will continue supporting the agency’s important role within this evolving space.”      Prior to Somensatto’s tenure, LabCFTC was headed by Daniel Gorfine, the first director of the CFTC office, and Netram, who took over in October 2019.      That same month, then-Chairman Heath Tarbert announced the division would be spun out into its own independent office, reporting directly to the CFTC chair.      The group acts as a research division within the federal regulator, publishing primers on the crypto industry as well as “Requests for Input” on issues like Ethereum and the surrounding market.      The CFTC oversees all derivatives and other commodity products in the U.S., and is the regulator responsible for green-lighting bitcoin and ether futures products. The agency is also nominally responsible for spotting potential fraud or manipulation in the markets of some other cryptocurrencies, like litecoin and dogecoin.      While President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the U.S. federal securities regulator, Gary Gensler, was recently confirmed to his post by the Senate, there’s no clear picture yet of who Biden will tap to lead the CFTC on a permanent basis.",POSITIVE,ZRX,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | ZRX | RESEARCH | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/cftc-appoints-former-dex-lawyer-as-head-of-fintech-wing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6313239873b73234e5cf3dc4c9c3def0e6518ff2-893x505.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406278,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetOpg,1619738502,"Enforcing KYC, AML Laws Is Key to Reducing Ransomware Attacks: Task Force","Better enforcement of cryptocurrency regulations can help address an increasing number of ransomware attacks, a public-private task force claimed Thursday.      The Ransomware Task Force, led by the Institute for Security and Technology with support from Microsoft, McAfee and various government agencies, published a report proposing a host of government and company responses to the growing threat of ransomware attacks, including recommendations to disrupt payments to the developers who develop this form of malware.      A ransomware attack is one where a malicious actor hijacks a computer or network, locking it until the victim pays a ransom, often in cryptocurrency (ransomware victims paid close to $350 million in crypto to attackers last year). Paying the ransom is not necessarily a guarantee the perpetrator will share a decryption tool to unlock the computer.      The report recommended properly enforcing existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws to help tamp down payments made in crypto, and hinted that additional regulations may be necessary.      “The cryptocurrency sector that enables ransomware crime should be more closely regulated. Governments should require cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading ‘desks’ to comply with existing laws, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combatting Financing of Terrorism (CFT) laws,” the report said.      The report noted that this sort of regulatory enforcement would have to be international. A single nation enforcing KYC/AML laws would be insufficient, given that some companies set up shop in countries with more lax regulations.      “A single country’s laws or capabilities will be insufficient to tackle this global threat,” the report said.      Kemba Walden, an assistant general counsel at Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, said in a panel announcing the report that many ransomware developers want payments in bitcoin, rather than privacy coins.      This is because of the low trading volumes for these privacy coins, the report said. However, while malicious actors may not be using privacy coins, the report did warn that attackers might use mixing services to obfuscate how transactions occur.    Read more: Bitcoin Is Aiding the Ransomware Industry    Chainalysis Director of Market Development Don Spies, who is a member of the task force, told CoinDesk the group came together around the idea that the ransomware threat is likely to grow.      “I think one of the main goals of this was not to propose additional, stifling measures but to help folks realize that you can actually take a stab at this with existing measures,” he said. “In the regulatory space, AML, if we just enforce existing laws on the books in a consistent manner, I think we have the ability to really combat what’s going on.”      Pamela Clegg, vice president of financial investigations at CipherTrace, said in a blog post one of the goals would be to disrupt the ransomware business model, saying crypto is just one aspect of the issue.      The task force received support from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Europol, with members hailing from a host of government agencies and private entities.      Spies said he volunteered to join the group, and was not paid for his participation.      In video remarks at the unveiling of the report, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called the report an “impressive accomplishment.”      “The Department will work to implement many of your recommendations because one thing is clear: Ransomware is a threat to national security,” Mayorkas said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/enforcing-kyc-aml-laws-is-key-to-reducing-ransomware-attacks-task-force,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0899d0878ff9b9533c5134bc4e11562e4cf45283-1920x1324.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406277,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetOsd,1619732452,Batman NFTs Are Coming After Artist Has 'Pleasant' IP Chat With DC Comics,"Comic book artist Neal Adams, known for his sketches of Batman and the X-Men, is launching a series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) despite a warning from publisher DC Comics forbidding artists from using its intellectual property (IP).      Adams has released nine NFTs featuring superheroes Batman, Robin and Deadman, according to an announcement on Thursday. He said he had a “pleasant” exchange with publisher DC Comics about the launch.      “We did have a pleasant interchange with DC, and in the end, DC was simply asking for a bit more time to assess the situation,” Adams said in an email.      DC Comics declined to comment.      In March, DC Comics lawyers wrote a letter to freelance artists warning them not to use DC IP as NFTs; at the time, the company said it was considering plans for its characters.      NFTs are cryptographic assets that can have variable features. So far, they have been used to represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items, from art to sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers.    Read more: Batman Is Ours Alone to Exploit: DC Comics Warns Against Using Its Characters in NFTs    Recently, former DC Comics artist Jose Delgo, who is known for his sketches of Wonder Woman, made $1.85 million by selling NFTs featuring the superhero and other licensed characters, according to a report in Gizmodo.      Adams said his NFT partnership with Portion features five animated comic illustrations from 1994 to 2021, and stressed he has “full ownership” of the art despite his work having been published in DC Comics and Marvel.      “We don’t inform any companies of the sales of my artwork because I am the owner of the art and the companies I work with buy reproduction rights, so there is no reason for us to inform them of my art sales,” Adams said.      Portion has helped Adams to navigate the NFT landscape and launch his collection.      “As long as I have a fan base of people who appreciate my work and want to own a piece of comic book history, I believe this work will be valued,” Adams said.    Legal viewpoint    From a legal perspective, the NFT market is a gray area as artists attempt to monetize and launch pieces. Artists could be bound by an agreement with the publisher and subject to IP infringement laws.      Cynthia Gayton, a Virginia-based lawyer who specializes in intellectual property, explains when a publisher engages an artist, the artist commonly agrees to assign all IP rights to any work that they create to the publisher.      “Comic book characters are often subject to both copyright and trademark laws. For U.S. copyright, assignments have to be in writing,” Gayton said in an email, stressing that her comments shouldn't be considered legal advice.    Read more: Performance Artist Known for Eating $120K Art Basel Banana Is Doing NFTs With Dole    Gayton explains there are additional elements to take into consideration in the comic book industry that explain publishers’ behavior.      “For example, comic book artists are often guided by story arcs and canons – so artists may have access to promotional and other business ideas and plans that publishers often make great efforts to keep under wraps,” Gayton said.      That would be considered “confidential information,” which is also something an artist may have agreed to protect.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/batman-nfts-are-coming-after-artist-has-pleasant-ip-chat-with-dc-comics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c2d220e404469ca2d3d81b4b5aa9d1a81fc4086-1500x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $52,964 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 3.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $52,622-$55,851 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin was dropping Thursday, going as low as $52,622 and settling at $52,964 as of press time. There’s been an almost $3,000 price change over the past 24 hours for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, ranging from $55,851 down to $52,622.      It’s the season for alternative cryptocurrencies, or “alts,” according to Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. This might help explain why bitcoin has suddenly lost some of the momentum seen earlier this week.      “When new money flows into BTC, people are less focused on alts,” Rosenblum told CoinDesk. “Once it feels like the bullish pattern for BTC breaks down, people roll some of those profits into alts.”    Bitcoin market dominance    The market dominance of bitcoin continues to decline, and it’s less than half of the total blockchain market Thursday. At 49.5% at press time it is down from 73% at the start of 2021.      “Crypto natives might be taking profits in BTC to free up some capital to invest in alts,” Rosenblum said.      Zachary Friedman, chief operating officer at quantitative firm GDA Capital, senses bitcoin’s rally might just be pausing.      “As we have seen with most bull cycles, bitcoin typically leads the charge,” Friedman said. “Once bitcoin tops, money is redistributed into altcoins, which marks the nearing end of these cycles, historically.”      While ether keeps pushing to new highs almost daily, bitcoin’s all-time high above $64,400 came two weeks ago.      For now, BTC is out of the limelight.      “Ether and alts will likely keep up the bulk of the action for the next leg of this cycle,” Friedman said.      Read More: Coinbase Debuts ‘Buy With PayPal’ Feature (but Read the Fine Print)    Ether breaks new record, again    Ether (ETH) rallied to a fresh all-time high Thursday around $2,800, before fading later in the day.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading around $2,708 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), down 0.75% over the prior 24 hours.      “Since the end of March, we’ve seen ETH going stronger against BTC,” said Élie Le Rest, partner at crypto quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      The technical proposal EIP 1559 to fix the Ethereum blockchain’s problematic capacity constraints may be aiding in the bullish sentiment.      “This bullish trend on ETH may be seen through different angles, but the upcoming upgrade including EIP 1559 is seen as a strong catalyst of the recent ETH bull run,” Le Rest said.      Jason Lau, chief operating office of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, said ether appears to have decoupled from bitcoin.      “This is significant as ETH/BTC had been in the ~0.02-0.04 BTC range for almost the past two years, but recently just hit ~0.05 BTC” Lau said.      As of press time, the ETH/BTC pair, which signals traders rotating in and out of bitcoin into and from ether, is up 2.6% and well over 0.05 BTC. It has been mega bullish since April 27.      “The [non-fungible token] boom, recent scalability improvements, Ethereum protocol upgrades and DeFi growth have all contributed,” Lau said. “Those upcoming features are a great incentive for investors to tag along, contributing to ETH against BTC”      Read More: As Ether Pushes Ever Higher, Crypto Traders Plot Price in Bitcoin Terms    BNB now non-negligible share of digital-asset markets    One of the biggest gainers in the altcoin space this year is Binance coin (BNB), an asset used to offset trading fees charged on the Binance exchange.

42406283,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetOyX,1619726686,Russian News Outlet Calls for Crypto Donations as Kremlin Cracks Down on Media,"Meduza, one of Russia's leading independent news organizations, called for donations in fiat, bitcoin, ether and BNB after Russian authorities labeled it a “foreign agent” last week.      The label, basically marking Meduza as an “enemy of the state,” can hurt its ability to contact sources and report news, the team said in a statement.      “They are trying to kill Meduza,” the team said in another editorial statement. “The Ministry of Justice deemed us a ‘foreign agent.’ As a result, we lost our advertisers. It means that our funds are running out. Right now.”      On April 23, the Russian Justice Ministry designated Meduza as a foreign agent, which means the journalists will have to mark every article they write as published by a foreign agent. They will also have to submit detailed financial reports every quarter.      According to the editor-in-chief, Ivan Kolpakov, on Monday many advertisers pulled out. Because of the financial urgency, Meduza launched a fundraiser on Thursday, asking donors to send money via a bank card payment, PayPal or crypto transfers in bitcoin, ether and BNB.      Meduza joins a small number of Russian organizations that accept donations in crypto, including one led by prominent politician Alexey Navalny as well as several human rights-related groups.      Read more: Russian Activists Use Bitcoin, and the Kremlin Doesn’t Like It    Bitcoin for ‘enemies of the state’    “If people are afraid to send us money from their bank accounts, and they might well be, they can send us crypto,” Kolpakov said, adding:    “The scale of political repression in Russia [is] so large these days that people might be worried about their personal data. People who went to political rallies are getting deanonymized by facial recognition systems and harassed by the police.”    Read also: Facial Recognition Tech May Be Being Used Against Russian Protestors      Kolpakov added that the list of cryptocurrencies will be expanded. For now, they chose bitcoin and ether because they are the most popular, and BNB because it has the cheapest transaction fees. The team is also thinking of issuing and selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) to raise funds, Kolpakov said.      “If it was up to me, I would take all the donations in crypto,” Kolpakov said. “We believe in crypto and blockchain, we believe it’s the future of global finance. Plus, for many years, our readers have been asking for an option to donate crypto.”      The donations have been flowing in. In the initial hours following the announcement of the fundraiser, Meduza received dozens of small donations, over 0.29 BTC and 3 ETH in total (or more than $23,800).      Meduza will contest the “foreign agent” status in court but the chances of winning are slim, Kolpakov said. So for now, the team is trying to buy some time and decide what to do next.      “Among other things, we’re going to see if we can live off donations,” he added.    The black mark    Meduza’s troubles are part of a larger trend of recent police actions against journalists in Russia. On April 9, the police raided the apartment of a prominent investigative journalist Roman Anin. On April 17, Anin’s colleague, Ekaterina Arenina, was detained after interviewing people for her story about torture in Russian prisons.      Over the past weekend, police also detained several journalists who reported on protest rallies against the imprisonment of the politician Alexey Navalny, who was demanding medical help while in prison. Student magazine editors were placed under house arrest last year.      In December, several individual journalists were branded as foreign agents by the state. Last July, former prominent defense reporter Ivan Safronov went to jail on treason charges.      Meduza is an online news outlet that provides news in Russian and English. It was founded by the core team of another Russian media outlet, Lenta.ru, in 2014, after editor-in-chief Galina Timchenko was fired by the owner for Lenta’s coverage of Ukraine’s 2014 revolution.      Many journalists left the publication in protest. When Timchenko and two other editors founded Meduza, some of those journalists joined the startup. The team has been operating from an office in Riga, Latvia, which is a short flight from Moscow. Core reporters are still based in Russia.      Meduza has joined the list of designated foreign media agents that includes Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as well as several journalists.      Meduza must now publish a notice of foreign agent status in a larger font than the main text of its articles. This week, Meduza started adding such notices at the top of every article and tweet, typing it in all capital letters on Twitter.      The law on foreign agents was passed in 2012, defining a foreign agent as an organization that is involved in political activities and receiving funding from abroad. However, there was no precise definition of political activity. Currently, 75 nonprofits in Russia, including human rights, election monitoring and educational groups, have this status.      Read more: Bitcoin Dissidents: Those Who Need It Most      In December, the law was amended so that individuals can also be designated foreign agents. Immediately after that, five journalists and civil rights activists were deemed foreign agents.      “For years, Russian authorities have used the ‘foreign agents’ law to suppress independent groups,” Human Right Watch wrote in 2020.",POSITIVE,BTC | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/russian-news-outlet-calls-for-crypto-donations-as-kremlin-cracks-down-on-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5dfd18b422bcc386effcde526d11ccf585ace782-960x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434291,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPB3Vh,1619722265,What China's Blockchain Services Network Means for the World,"China’s government has made the development and use of blockchain technology a national priority. To understand the impact this will have on global trade, one only needs to look at the country’s embrace of open-market economic reforms to forecast what is about to happen.      Once China’s leadership decides something is a priority, it is only a matter of time until the impact reverberates across the globe. China opening its economy changed the balance of world trade and finance, and prioritizing blockchain technology will be another core factor catapulting Beijing ahead as a leading global superpower.    Omer Ozden is CEO of RockTree Capital, a merchant bank and fund focused on mobile internet and blockchain projects with offices in Beijing, Shanghai, New York and Toronto.    What this means for Western nations is a shift in power to the Far East that is accelerated by the coordinated implementation of technology as the rails of that transfer.    Digital revolution 3.0    Just as the Internet allowed for information to progress from antiquated paper and physical delivery systems to digital form with immediate delivery, blockchain technology allows for assets to make the same leap from paper to digital.    Assets, including money, are now represented digitally, with global instant settlement 24/7 on an immutable ledger. Wall Street is beginning to understand this Cambrian explosionhttps://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/en/science/origin/04-cambrian-explosion.php of possibilities, as the total value of digital assets exceeds more than $2 trillion. A similar moment in time occurred back in the late 1990s, when Wall Street and the Clinton Administration woke to the monumental growth that was anticipated over the decades to come through their embrace of the internet for e-commerce.    Yet, whatever possibilities were ambitiously imagined back then for enterprises, such as a Seattle-based tech startup selling books online, looking back we can see the internet over-delivered on even the most optimistic of expectations.    How it started    China officially woke to the possibilities of blockchain when President Xi Jinping announced in late 2019 the nation would make blockchain technology a national priority. After that, it expedited the development of the Blockchain Service Network (BSN) and a renminbi-pegged Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).      One of the main aims of China’s national blockchain infrastructure is to build an open-source protocol that enables enterprises to access, build and adopt blockchain technology into their commerce, be they domestic or international.      The BSN was launched just under a year ago with the backing of China’s State Information Center, China Mobile, China UnionPay and Red Date Technology, which oversees the development and operation of the national network.    BSN today    Domestically, the BSN has already grown to over 120 public city nodes attracting development and use by small to large scale enterprises, and government.      Internationally, the BSN has expanded through partnerships with a handful of the leading global blockchain protocols and consulting firms including Ethereum, Polkadot, the former JPMorgan unit Quorum (now part of ConsenSys) and even Ernst & Young.    Read more: Inside China’s Effort to Create a Blockchain It Can Control    Most recently, BSN announced its partnership with Casper Network, a new blockchain developed in part by Ethereum researchers and other academics and industry leaders that launched its mainnet in March of this year. The partnership allows for the development of permission-based (curated) and permissionless (open) blockchain for enterprise in China as well as internationally, a segment that is poised for rapid adoption and scale as global blockchain infrastructure becomes linked and interoperable.      These integrations will enable a new global blockchain infrastructure that also solves for many of the congestion and high transaction fee issues plaguing the most used blockchain (Ethereum). These pain points have been most exposed by decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and they are driving some major users away. This could be similar to when mobile phone users who were accustomed to their BlackBerry handsets eventually ditched them in favor of various brands of touchscreen smartphones.    Where we are headed    Paper-intensive international trade finance and logistics are now being conducted on blockchains and eventually, with the advent of the digital RMB, payments and settlements, will become digital, instant and cost efficient, eliminating frictions from centralized, paper-based systems (that are as archaic as mailing a postcard home versus sending an SMS message, or T+2 in public equities markets versus the T+0 settlement of bitcoin).      The BSN will soon become one of the largest and fastest-growing enterprise blockchain ecosystems in the world and, perhaps most importantly, the largest in China. This comes at a time when the world’s most populous country (and the dominant global exporter) is on the verge of becoming the world’s largest economy.    Read more: Michael Sung: China’s National Blockchain Will Change the World    With directives coming from President Xi, enterprises and government in China are not shy about adopting this nascent technology. Thus, much of the initial scale of enterprise usage of blockchain will likely occur in China while, internationally, those linked with China’s massive cross-border trading systems will turn major routes of commerce and finance into a “Digital Silk Road.”      This comes at a time when just this week President Biden's 100th day address to Congress confidently spoke of the United States' goal to reassert itself as the leader in other future technologies such as AI, biotech, clean energy and electric vehicles yet, glaringly, missed the opportunity to reference blockchain.      We know the digital economy is inevitable. The world’s journey to this path has been expedited by the events of the past year, and adoption has accelerated. It is doubtful there will be a larger or more pervasive nationally backed blockchain than China’s BSN, which has a significant head start on anything being developed in the western world – at least for the next decade.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Omer Ozden,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/29/what-chinas-blockchain-services-network-means-for-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47fca9b14358fbc935db358864b7f10f5685f5f8-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology sent out an emergency notice to the city’s data centers on Tuesday asking them to report any involvement in crypto mining operations, according to a document obtained by Reuters.      Data centers are required to report the amount and share of power used up by the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the notice said.      The probe was directed by city authorities, and recipients of the notice included the country’s three largest telecommunications operators, an official of the bureau told Reuters.

In March, Inner Mongolia, an autonomous region in China, declared it would force crypto mining businesses to close by April.      Despite China’s ban on crypto exchanges, the country remains a mining hub, contributing up to 65% of the global mining hashrate (the computing power used to mine cryptocurrencies). After a series of accidents in Southern China’s coal mines, resulting power outages caused the global bitcoin hashrate to drop dramatically, as miners in the region rely on cheap energy from coal.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/beijing-to-track-crypto-mining-impact-on-energy-consumption-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41e647fd1cf8cc95c295d55515a72252298906c8-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434310,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPB43h,1619717847,DeFi Is Now a $100B Sector,"As the Coinbase public listing approached, many analysts were looking for a $100 billion valuation. The cryptocurrency exchange, founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, hit that mark briefly after listing, but COIN has settled down to a less-rarified valuation.      Meanwhile, CoinGecko calculates a total market capitalization of $128 billion for decentralized finance (DeFi), the corner of the cryptocurrency industry that represents a wide range of lending, trading and betting activities carried out almost entirely on blockchain networks using tokens as proceeds and collateral. The top five tokens on CoinGecko's list are UNI, LINK, LUNA, AAVE and CAKE.      The following chart is from a CoinGecko page that tracks the combined market cap of all DeFi tokens:      Coinbase, it should be noted, listed DeFi as a potential competitor when it filed for a public listing, but for whatever reason, market caps aren't how we usually talk about the DeFi market. We usually talk about the value of assets people have deposited in DeFi apps to earn yield.      But that measure gives a similar reading: There is now more than $100 billion worth of assets locked up in DeFi.      These get to be very large numbers, numbers that are worth reviewing to illuminate a story that somehow continues to be missed even as cryptocurrency has started going mainstream.      Here at CoinDesk we have focused on DeFi on Ethereum because DeFi originated on Ethereum, and it is where the best-known entrepreneurs have committed to operating.      Those aforementioned deposited assets are referred to as total value locked (TVL). TVL on Ethereum, using the most widely cited data site, DeFi Pulse, is $66 billion as of this writing, more than quadrupling since Jan. 1 when it was $15 billion.      Meanwhile, DeFi has taken off in a big way on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). According to Defistation, the current TVL on there is $38 billion, led by PancakeSwap but also including money markets filling a similar role to Aave and derivative solutions that fill a similar role to dydx.      DeFi on BSC has grown much faster than on Ethereum; it first hit $1 billion in TVL only at the end of January.    DeFi vs. ICOs    Here's a chart that compares funds entrusted to Ethereum's many DeFi smart contracts in the last year or so to funds that went to founders in initial coin offerings during the 2017-2018 boom (an updated version of one published here):      It should be noted that DeFi Pulse was in the midst of updating how it tracks the TVL for the robo-adviser for yield, Yearn Finance, when this was made, and so those numbers aren't in this graph. According to Yearn itself, though, it has had several billion dollars tied up.      Read more: DeFi reshapes the CoinDesk 20      While the 2020 surge was known as ""DeFi Summer,"" it's already evident the market is much bigger now.      For example, TVL first broke $1 billion in February 2020. It broke $10 billion in September, on Ethereum. Earlier this month, the money market platform Compound broke $10 billion in TVL all on its own.      Tuesday night, the original DeFi protocol, stablecoin minter MakerDAO, also broke $10 billion for the first time.    1 million users? Maybe 2 million?    Richard Chen, at the venture firm 1confirmation, has been assembling on-chain data about users using Dune Analytics. One chart is worth citing here in particular.      This shows there are at least 2 million wallets that have interacted with DeFi protocols. So that probably means something like more than a million individuals, maybe even close to two? It's very hard to say, but it is also worth noting that sometimes individuals participate in DeFi via third parties. So while some users hold many wallets, it's also true that some wallets represent many users.      Whatever the real count of users, the amount of money changing hands shows these applications are real businesses. The site Crypto Fees has been tracking usage fees charged on different DeFi applications. The top DeFi applications it lists (Uniswap, SushiSwap and Compound) show a seven-day average of daily fees collected ranging from $1 million to $4 million.      If there's one kind of finance that everyone understands, it is lending. The blockchain software company ConsenSys just released a first-quarter report on DeFi on Ethereum, showing a growing market for loans:      DeFi represents a much more credible narrative with more substantive businesses because it shows products with genuine returns and provides a way for people to earn impressive yields on deposits rather than making wild bets and hoping.      Wild bets are the best way to describe much (though certainly not all) of the investing that took place in the initial coin offering boom of 2017 to 2018. That boom drove the prior bull run, and the public appeared capable of making that connection.      Four years later, the cryptocurrency industry is in a bull run again, but the public appears incapable of connecting it to these billion-dollar deposits into this new iteration on finance. For whatever reason, the main topics are, again, bitcoin's price and, somehow, non-fungible tokens and dogecoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/defi-is-now-a-100b-sector,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92a6a73a8a8f30d4575853a1a3037a31278a4527-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421776,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXplAz,1619714784,The Node: Bring on the Bitcoin ETFs,"Financial Times writer Pan Kwan Yuk makes the case that markets are too immature for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). There have been dozens of proposals put forward, beginning with the Winklevoss twins' failed bid eight years ago, which have all been summarily rejected. Typically the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cites limited trading activity and the potential risk of market manipulation as reason for shooting down these proposals.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Bitcoin ETFs stand as the “Holy Grail” for the crypto industry because they provide a “low-cost way for investors to access bitcoins without the hassle of dealing with digital wallets and custodians,” Kwan Yuk notes. Without writing off the possibility entirely – the industry is “too big to ignore” – she suggests the SEC take its time in determining now is the right time to introduce these financial products to U.S. investors.  She says, inexplicably, that bitcoin’s liquidity problem stems from its design. There will only ever be 21 million BTC – meaning in a supply crunch, “investors could find themselves locked into the shares.”  Real liquidity concerns exist in bitcoin markets. It’s an asset that most frequently trades behind the walls of centralized exchanges. Each exchange is essentially its own market, and those markets can have liquidity issues depending on the time of day or number of active traders.  But, taken as a whole, bitcoin is remarkably liquid. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently tweeted his auto manufacturer sold 10% of its BTC stash to “prove” it was a liquidity alternative to cash (perhaps to convince skeptical board members.) Meanwhile, as The Block’s Frank Chaparro noted, bitcoin’s spot activity (just on a dozen or so trusted exchanges) is well over $1 trillion this month alone.  When looking at the type of institutions looking to put forward a BTC ETF, like Fidelity and VanEck, it’s unlikely they would choose custodians with limited access to the market. Things can happen. The March 2020 ""Black Thursday"" event saw massive liquidations across the board, made worse from a supply crunch in particular assets. But that wasn’t unique to crypto alone.  Finally, look just to our northern neighbor Canada, whose three bitcoin ETFs immediately became among the most active financial products on the Toronto stock exchange. They had no issue hoovering up BTC either.  It's hard to call any market immature that is now worth more than $2 trillion.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/29/the-node-bring-on-the-bitcoin-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5655efe0d042145f58e64519247fd37af244d568-2400x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project looks to take on automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap and SushiSwap with a novel approach that relies on their real-world counterparts: the professional market makers paid to make sure various crypto assets have baseline liquidity.      “We’re kind of like an un-automated market maker,” Hashflow founder Varun Vruddhula quipped in an interview.      Ethereum AMMs work without the need for such firms, relying on smart contracts to do the work of finding a market for any given token pair. Hashflow’s approach combines a headless front end with professional trading shops working behind the scenes.      “With Hashflow,” Vruddhula explained, “you have someone who specializes in market making do the market making. Now, they have the choice to accept funds from lazy LPs, and they all get to split the yield based on the equity ownership of the pool.”      Alameda Research, Galaxy Digital, Genesis Block and Ledger Prime are the trading desks involved at launch. Other backers include angel investors Balaji Srinivasan, Alex Pack and Kain Warwick.      Read more: ‘Party Starters’: Stellar Event Sees Frank Discussion of Crypto Market Makers      By bringing professional firms (and their off-chain pricing decisions) into the equation, Hashflow is able to reduce the gas fees associated with each trade – a key selling point as it looks to compete with DeFi’s top platforms among ever-price-conscious traders.      ""Hashflow connects DeFi users with a network of CeFi market makers running liquidity pools,” Electric Capital’s Avichal Garg told CoinDesk via Telegram. “By routing orders across highly liquid pools run by the world's biggest market makers, Hashflow can permissionlessly offer the best prices with far lower gas fees than traditional AMMs.”      The product going live today will only feature private pools, Vruddhula said, but general DeFi investors can start adding money to the pools within the next three to four weeks.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/29/hashflow-defis-un-automated-market-maker-launches-with-32m-in-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89c56ccca1b7e570d724f955216fae0cd81504f7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434295,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPB3bh,1619712012,Coinbase Debuts 'Buy With PayPal' Feature (but Read the Fine Print),"Coinbase is allowing U.S. users to buy cryptocurrency with their PayPal accounts in a major expansion of the exchange’s funding rails.      The option, announced Thursday, could cost unwitting users substantial sums in fees.      It is also another sign of crypto's increasing mainstream acceptance. PayPal, long coy and standoffish about the sector, began allowing users to buy crypto on its own platform last year and has gradually expanded this service. Coinbase, one of the crypto industry's oldest startups, recently listed its shares on the Nasdaq.      Coinbase users can now buy up to $25,000 in crypto daily using PayPal, according to the exchange's settings page. They’ll lose nearly 4% of such purchases to PayPal-specific fees.      The PayPal integration is the third big-spender option alongside bank buys via automated clearing house (ACH), also capped at $25,000 daily, and wire transfers, which have no cap. Needing only the PayPal login to set up, it could offer users a workaround to Coinbase’s cumbersome linking process for credit and debit cards ($5,000 weekly maximum) and bank accounts.      Buying crypto through PayPal ranks among Coinbase’s priciest payment options (and Coinbase is already notorious in some circles for its high fees). The 3.99% fee is as expensive as debit card buys despite a far higher limit. And it is markedly higher than bank buy fees of 1.49%. Depositing U.S. dollars from PayPal into Coinbase triggers a 2.5% levy; ACH transfers are free.      ""The fees cover the costs of payment processing,"" said a Coinbase project manager, Eddie Lo, through a spokesperson.      A CoinDesk reporter previewed $25,000 AAVE buys on Coinbase using every available funding option. Choosing PayPal, the order would have triggered $959 in fees Wednesday night. (The reporter’s PayPal account is funded by his debit card.) Paying with the bank account tied to that same debit card would cost $367 in fees, for comparison. Paying with the debit card itself would not have worked because of the $5,000 weekly cap.      (The reporter did not execute either purchase. He did, however, buy $5 in AAVE Wednesday to test the PayPal feature and lost 99 cents to fees.)      Coinbase has provided U.S. customers with PayPal sell functions since 2016 and withdrawal capabilities since late 2018. It expanded the option to much of Europe two months later. Cash withdrawals are live in the U.S., U.K., European Union and Canada.      Coinbase said in a blog post it plans to expand the PayPal buying feature to “more countries” in the months ahead.      UPDATE (April 29, 16:26 UTC): Added a quote from a Coinbase product manager and background about the two companies.

VC firms Parafi, 1Confirmation, Spartan Group, Nascent and Nima Capital also joined the Ethereum-based protocol’s equity round, said CEO Teddy Woodward. His company last raised cash in an October 2020 seed round. It will use this raise to build out the team ahead of version 2.0.      The round gives fresh runway to one of the larger fixed-rate lending firms in a decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape dominated by variable-rate programs. Woodward said Notional has executed $10 million in loans since emerging from stealth last autumn, dwarfing its closest fixed-rate competitor but falling far, far short of Aave’s $3 billion+ in variable loans.    Read more: Notional Launches Out of Stealth to Bring Fixed-Rate Lending to DeFi    Woodward said Notional’s fixed rate terms are catering to a different clientele. It doesn’t exist “ “just to allow people to make leveraged bets on the price of different assets,” he said.      “Variable lending is great for trading and yield farming but there's this entire new class of activity that it's just not at all suited for,” he said. “When you introduce the ability to borrow and lend at fixed rates for long periods of time, all of a sudden you can do so much more than just trade and speculate.”      Woodward said roughly half of Notional’s users take out cash for “real-world” concerns. He cited one Australian customer who borrowed against his ether to pay down a mortgage. Woodward said this would not have been fiscally reasonable to execute on Aave or Compound: “The volatility is just too great.”      Still, Woodward said the other half of Notional loans go to “active DeFi users” pursuing crypto-specific pastimes such as yield farming.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/29/notional-raises-10m-to-grow-defi-lending-protocol-with-real-world-potential,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7c81d292843ec9383fabcdfe13e9298b317110-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434303,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPB3rh,1619707689,Proposed Legislation in Germany Could Allow $425B to Flow Into Crypto: Report,"A new German law could theoretically bring as much as €350 billion (~$425 billion) of institutional investment into the cryptocurrency market, financial newspaper Boersen Zeitung reported.    The report cites analysis by Sven Hildebrandt, CEO of Distributed Ledger Consulting (DLC).  The bill, which was approved by Germany’s parliament last week, is expected to take effect on July 1 if it is approved by the upper house, the Bundesrat.  Under the legislation, wealth and institutional investment fund managers, known as Spezialfonds (special funds), will be able to invest up to 20% of their portfolio in crypto.  If they all did so to the 20% limit, nearly $425 billion would move from other assets into crypto, based on the total assets under management (AUM) of such funds in Germany.  The legislation could prove a significant development for wider acceptance of crypto institutional investment across Europe, given Germany’s status as the eurozone’s most powerful economy.  There have been other signs of such acceptance of crypto emanating from Germany in recent months, with Deutsche Bank announcing its intention to offer custody and brokerage services to its institutional clients in December.

42434301,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPB3ph,1619707090,"As Ether Pushes Ever Higher, Crypto Traders Plot Price in Bitcoin Terms","Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, reached a fresh record high early Wednesday, widening its lead over market leader bitcoin (BTC).      The trend looks set to continue, with ETH/BTC (the ether-bitcoin price ratio) breaking out to a multi-year high in a sign of increased capital flow into ether.      Ether rose to $2,800, surpassing the peak price of $2,762 reached Wednesday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The cryptocurrency has rallied by 43% so far this month, decoupling from bitcoin, down 7%. The ETH/BTC ratio has jumped to 2.5-year highs above 0.050, confirming a major bullish breakout on technical charts.      ""ETH/BTC has broken out after a multi-year consolidation, and the trend looks very strong,"" Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, said. ""There are no further resistances here, and we expect to see ETH/BTC push through 0.10 eventually.""      The implication is the ongoing capital rotation out of bitcoin and into ether is likely to continue over the coming months.      A report earlier this week from digital-asset manager CoinShares showed ether funds and investment products drew $34 million last week, while bitcoin funds lost $21 million.      ""The demand is shifting,"" Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, told CNBC earlier this week, adding that capital is moving from one asset to another.      Raoul Pal, CEO and co-founder of Real Vision Group, also foresees continued ether outperformance.      ""At this point in the risk cycle, and with Ethereum 2.0 coming (cheaper fees and less supply), I'm struggling to not sell all my BTC and move my entire core position to ETH,"" Pal tweeted earlier this month. ""To be clear – I'm a massive BTC bull, but I think ETH is the better asset allocation for performance right now.""      Developers expect the Ethreum 2.0 upgrade or the switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism by the end of this year or early next year. After that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Butrin plans to implement a ""sharding"" upgrade in a bid to expand Ethereum's capacity to process transactions by splitting its database into 64 mini-blockchains. That may bring down transaction fees, bringing more network activity and stronger demand for ether.      While the path of least resistance for ETH/BTC appears to be on the higher side, it may not be smooth sailing, said Stack Funds' head of research, Lennard Neo.      ""The breakout seen on the weekly chart is quite significant as the next resistance dates back to May 2018 at the 0.09 value,"" Neo said. ""ETH/BTC may re-test former hurdle-turned-support at 0.04-0.045 before further gains unfold.""      Also read: Ether Soars to New All-Time High and JPMorgan Notices      A potential bull market correction in bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, cannot be ruled out and will likely lead to a temporary pullback in ETH/BTC. That's because a bitcoin drop usually yields bigger drawdowns in ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies.      Bitcoin's bounce from recent lows near $48,000 has stalled near $55,000, and buyers are refusing to step in despite the U.S. Federal Reserve keeping to its pro-easing stance on Wednesday.      The weekly chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has crossed below zero, indicating a bearish reversal for the first time since March 2020.      ""A break above $60,000 is needed to revive the bullish view,"" Balani said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/as-ether-pushes-ever-higher-crypto-traders-plot-price-in-bitcoin-terms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba7cb17611e84bb7c6f1783e5d28f5b370da4637-1508x749.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Apifiny Prime, the trading arm of Apifiny (pronounced the same as “epiphany”), joins a select group of crypto companies such as Coinbase, Gemini, eToro and Circle in holding a FINRA broker-dealer license.      Slowly but surely, institutional-grade infrastructure is being built to connect the global cryptocurrency industry. New York-based Apifiny is building a kind of crypto conglomerate involving trading, market-making and bitcoin mining.      “A broker-dealer license will allow us to bridge the traditional financial market with the crypto market,” said Apifiny CEO Haohan Xu. “As a broker-dealer, we are able to offer securities to our clients, such as closed-end funds. That could be a fund that tracks a basket of crypto or a fund that tracks the performance of a sub-sector of crypto like DeFi (decentralized finance).”    Read more: Behind ‘Prime Broker’ Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms    Getting hold of a license from FINRA was a long and involved process, said Bob Morris, Apifiny's chief compliance officer.      “FINRA looked into our background and our large footprint in the digital asset business,” Morris said in an interview. “They tread very carefully when it comes to crypto, and we had to provide a lot of due diligence. It was a yearlong process, and of course, COVID-19 didn't help matters.”    Rise of prime brokerage    For the crypto sector to recreate the all-in-one white glove services institutional investors expect in the traditional world has been a goal of firms like Coinbase, Genesis and BitGo, but Xu said Apifiny’s prime brokerage service is mostly focused on trade execution.      Apifiny connects professional traders with 40-odd global exchanges to search the best execution prices, the company said. It has recently added Crypto.com, Huobi Global, OKEx, Kucoin, AscendEX, HBTC and Blockchain.com as trading venues.      “One of the biggest problems in the crypto space is around price discovery and liquidity,” Xu said, adding:    “Bitcoin may be more global in nature than Apple stock or even USD, but it's traded in a very localized way with regional exchanges dominating their respective markets, creating many isolated liquidity pools. This has prevented institutions from getting involved and is a problem we are helping to solve.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/29/crypto-trading-business-apifiny-snags-finra-broker-dealer-license,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/778b8b797d75026c2897edfad5a5bd64a584ed4d-1200x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He is now auctioning an NFT with a little more “meat” from a market just as crazy: San Francisco housing.      Kenna is selling the rights to a 75-year lease in his 20Mission co-living space as an NFT. Whoever wins the auction will pay $1 a month and no utility fees in a 41-unit building in the Mission District, where tenants regularly pay up to $2,200 in monthly rent, he said.      The effort is an example of NFTs potentially transcending the world of digital tchotchkes for more “real-world” use cases.      “Now, if somebody wants to pay a million for it, I don't think that's unreasonable,” Kenna said, arguing NFT-linked leases offer advantages in liquidity and transferability. “I think there's some serious value here, but not because it's an NFT.”    Read more: Purse Opens Nakamoto’s, San Francisco’s Bitcoin-Only Retail Shop    Kenna said NFTs could give tenants more opportunities to transfer their leases. Furthermore, the technology allows him to perpetually collect a slice of secondary deals. He said he placed the baked-in smart contract royalty at 1%.      “One percent on a property transfer is nothing. I mean people are putting 10%, 20% royalties on a picture,” he said.      When asked for comment, McKenna Brink Signorotti LLP, a California real estate law firm and counsel to 20Mission, said: ""By tokenizing physical, non-virtual real estate, the real estate landscape we have come to know will be revolutionized.""

In a press conference that followed the Fed's two-day meeting, Powell was asked whether he believed there was a risk to financial stability in trends such as the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. The Shiba Inu-represented crypto, which was started as a joke, is up more than 6,000% year to date.      The question was framed amid the backdrop of low interest rates and easy monetary policy that has sparked interest in speculative investnments such as GameStop's stock and dogecoin.      ""You are seeing things in the capital markets that are a bit frothy, that's a fact,"" Powell said. ""I won't say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but also it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.""      In a bid to combat the fallout from COVID-19, central banks around the world have poured new money into financial markets, which, in turn, has had a major impact on cryptocurrencies through asset price inflation.      Powell was upbeat about the prospects for a swifter economic recovery in the U.S., pointing toward ""very well-capitalized large banks"" and low funding risks among financial institutions.

The $300 million Series D was led by Oak, a growth capital firm focused on health care and fintech. Previous investors Declaration Partners, PayPal Ventures, Mithril Capital and others were also involved. Paxos announced a $142 million Series C in December.  The latest raise comes during a month when bitcoin hit all-time highs north of $64,000 and Coinbase’s public listing put the cryptocurrency industry in the national spotlight.  “We’re raising this capital not because we think this is some kind of local maximum,” Paxos CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla said in an interview. “This really puts us in a great position now to scale the business and take advantage of opportunities to make acquisitions.”  Paxos, founded in 2012, offers a slew of services connecting traditional players to the cryptocurrency markets. Just last week the firm secured a conditional charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to spin up the Paxos National Trust Bank.  Read more: Paxos Becomes Third Federally Regulated Crypto ‘Bank’  Cascarilla said the new funding was not related to capital requirements for establishing a crypto bank but about keeping up with enterprise demand.  “I would really call this confidence capital,” he said. “What this is about is our customers knowing that we’re going to be around for the next five to 10 years so that they can feel comfortable using us as their infrastructure.”  Paxos was named as the infrastructure provider for PayPal’s crypto service last year. The relationship has expanded to include users of the PayPal-owned Venmo payments app. Other clients include Revolut, Credit Suisse and Societe Generale.  Cascarilla said the 175-person Paxos has no plans for a stock offering anytime soon, despite Coinbase leading a passel of crypto firms into the public markets.

42434307,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPB41h,1619689800,Bitcoin Transfers From Miners to Exchanges Hit 6.5-Month Low,"Bitcoin miners continue to reduce their supplies to exchanges in a sign of bullish price expectations.    The seven-day moving average of the daily volume of coins transferred from miners to exchanges fell to 152.77 BTC on Wednesday, the lowest since Oct. 8, according to data provided by Glassnode.  The metric has declined by 80% since topping out at 805 BTC on Feb. 23.  Reduced miner supply to exchanges is taken to represent bullish sentiment among those responsible for generating coins. By choosing to hold onto more of their BTC now, it implies miners anticipate selling them later at a higher price.  Miners mainly operate on cash and are constant sellers in the market, liquidating at least some part of their holdings every day to fund operational costs.  Miners boosted their supply to exchanges in January and February, meaning peak distribution or profit taking happened back then.  Glassnode’s miner position change metric, which gauges the 30-day change in the supply held in the miners’ addresses, also shows miners have returned to accumulation mode this month.  The indicator crossed above zero at the end of March, signaling renewed holding by miners, and has now risen to the highest level since September 2018.  The balance held in miner addresses has also increased by over 8,000 BTC to 1,809,992 BTC over the past two months, as per Glassnode data.  However, reduced miner supply to exchanges does not imply a price rally, as it constitutes a small part of the total network volume, as tweeted by Glassnode CEO Rafael Schultze-Kraft.  As of Wednesday, miner transfers to exchanges accounted for less than 1% of the total exchange inflow of 32,912 BTC.

Powell was adamant that China's approach was not the one the U.S. should be taking.      “Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast,” said Powell. “The currency that's being used in China is not one that would work here.

42386600,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU8vf,1619662077,"Using Binance to Trade Coinbase, Tesla, Apple? Here Are the Risks","Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has pushed into a wide range of businesses in recent years in pursuit of profit and industry dominance – from sponsoring its own blockchain, to backing a decentralized exchange, to launching its own “utility token,” BNB, now trading at an $87 billion market capitalization.    But it’s Binance’s latest venture – a foray into trading tokenized versions of stockshttps://www.binance.com/en/stock-token of Tesla, Apple and Coinbase – that’s now threatening to bring unwanted attention from national and regional regulators.    Binance launched a ""stock token"" trading service on April 12. The exchange's timing was notable because the launch came just a few days before Binance's biggest U.S.-based competitor, Coinbase, started trading through a direct stock listing on Nasdaq.      According to Binance, its new service would let users buy “stock tokens” – representing public companies’ shares or even fractions of shares. They’re settled in Binance’s dollar-linked stablecoin, binance USD (BUSD). The tokens are fully backed by shares held by CM-Equity AG, a licensed and fully regulated asset management firm in Germany, according to Binance.      Yet, red flags have already been raised by regulators in different countries and regions, over the possibility Binance’s new push might run afoul of securities rules.      “Their marketing has been very aggressive, and they’ve used that term ‘stock’ very heavily,” said Henry Chong, chief executive at Labuan-based digital stock exchange Fusang. “I think that’s what is getting really uncomfortable right now.”      Binance says the new stock tokens, provided in concert with a German firm, are compliant with European market regulations.      “Stock tokens entitle the holders to gain economic exposure to the underlying shares in a convenient and trusted manner,” a Binance representative said in an email about whether the stock tokens should be considered a security. The representative said it’s “expected” that there would be an “identical move” in the price of the token whenever the underlying stock goes up or down.      The process works like this: Once a Binance user opens a trade in stock tokens, a Swiss company called Digital Assets AG (DAAG), on behalf of a German firm called CM-Equity AG, purchases the corresponding amount of the company’s shares. A token is then minted on a private blockchain by Digital Assets.      The underlying shares are put into a security account associated with CM-Equity AG, and Digital Assets AG sends the token through CM-Equity to Binance.      “It is a financial instrument where people are buying, and that’s why Binance is a tied agent of CM-Equity AG,” a DAAG representative said. “CM-Equity AG has the license to sell securities and financial instruments.”      James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, praised the tokenized stock as an “innovation” but said several risks could arise for people who want to use it.      “How can you actually trust that token is what it says it is?” Angel asked. “You are not going to have all of the rights of ownership if you own one of these tokens. What you basically have is a side bet on the company. And the real question is, who’s on the other side? And is it collateralized to the point where you trust the process?”      Digital Assets AG said it is not taking any short positions against the underlying stocks, unlike some CFD (contract for differences) providers in traditional finance.      “We take the same position as the clients,” the company’s representative said. “We don’t sell short and we are not selling the order flow to market makers like Robinhood.”    The disadvantage of having no physical headquarters    A big question, for some cryptocurrency-industry veterans, is why Binance didn’t use its own blockchains to mint the tokens.      Binance has two blockchains: Binance Chain, focused on high-speed transactions, and Binance Smart Chain, to host decentralized finance applications and other digital assets.      “I don’t understand why people in the digital asset space aren’t just actually issuing tokens that represent equity for real,” said Chong, the Fusang CEO. ""The whole point of blockchain technology is supposed to simplify all of these layers and layers of intermediaries.”      Binance has thrived, in part, because it’s operated in young and always-changing cryptocurrency markets, where regulations aren’t nearly as coordinated across international jurisdictions as mature markets like stocks or even bonds and foreign exchange.      Notably, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has repeatedly refused to answer questions about where his firm is headquartered.      “They always say they don’t operate in any jurisdiction,” Chong said.      “They are working with a regulated German broker for these transactions and apparently made the decision that represented sufficient regulatory cover,” Richard Johnson, CEO of Texture Capital, a New York-based company that offers tokenized securities for private capital markets, said through a spokesperson.      For traders, there’s also the existential question of whether Binance might end the new service abruptly – for any reason.      A two-page “Binance Stock Tokens Trading Service Agreement” on Binance’s stock token website says that “Binance.com reserves the right to suspend or terminate Binance stock tokens trading service without notice. If necessary, Binance.com has the right to suspend and terminate Binance stock tokens trading service at any time.”    Alternatives to Binance’s stock tokens    Binance said in an email to CoinDesk that the company does not charge commission fees on the tokenized stocks while running a tight spread model. The goal for launching the product is to allow users to access the underlying shares in a more affordable way.      While Binance’s new service may attract regulatory attention due to the exchange’s size, the effort isn’t the first of its kind. Popular crypto derivatives exchange FTX provides similar products, also through a partnership with Digital Assets AG and CM Equity.      Terraform Labs’ Mirror Protocol allows users to mint crypto assets that mimic the value of shares in publicly traded companies.      “Binance doesn’t allow withdrawals because then the underlying broker dealer wouldn't be able to keep serving Binance – it would break the KYC (Know-Your-Customer) chain,” Do Kwon, founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, said. “So these stock tokens on Binance and FTX can never be transferred out, and therefore can never be composed into smart contracts.”",NEGATIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/using-binance-to-trade-coinbase-tesla-apple-here-are-the-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25fa71fa7eb5ee2ae55114dc96235f973288b710-898x508.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
