21664665,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566597,1703284210,Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive 99% BNB Price Crash To $2,"BNB, the native token of the Binance Exchange, has grown to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world. Its current price of $260 puts its market cap above $39 billion, making it the fourth-largest asset in the market. However, despite the notoriety that the cryptocurrency has gained during this time, one crypto analyst still expects a massive price crash, one that could shake the entire crypto market to its very core. BNB Long-Term Distribution Points To Crash In the initial analysis that was posted to the TradingView website on Tuesday, December 19, crypto analyst Alan Santana pointed out that the BNB token had been in what “can be considered a long-term distribution phase.” He identifies this distribution phase on the chart shared which looks to have begun after the altcoin hit its $670 all-time high price in 2021. Related Reading: Solana Flips BNB To Become 4th-Largest Crypto, Is Ethereum Next While this is pointed out to be bearish, the levels at which Santana believes this bearish pressure could take the price back to 2018 lows. In addition to this, the analyst explains that the BNB price is still trading below its 200-day Moving Average (MA). This, in itself, is very bearish for the asset’s price, but cannot send it 99% below its current price. However, he explains that this metric coupled with bad news about the exchange could be devastating. Source: Tradingview.com It is no surprise that the Binance Exchange has endured its fair share of problems when it comes to dealing with regulators. The exchange’s stablecoin which was issued by Paxos halted minting following instructions from regulators. Later, CEO Changpeng Zhao stepped down after the exchange and the founder agreed to pay $4 billion in fines to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crypto analyst stated that the chart points lower in such a case but pinpointing a particular endpoint is impossible. “It is impossible to say exactly if the final target will be $11, $6, $2 or $0.10, it is very hard to predict an exact target but, the chart is pointing lower,” Santana said. Token price starts to recover | Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview.com Waiting For The Best Timing Coupled with the indicators that the analyst has pointed out, he made follow-up posts to add other factors that could trigger a 99% crash in the BNB price. Pointing to the change in management that happened around a month ago, Santana explains that the next move by the exchange would be called “restructuring.” He stated: The company will undergo some “restructuring”, changes and improvements in the corporate network and thus everything most be frozen… Don’t worry though, the funds are SAFU. Related Reading: Solana Headed To $100? Here’s What’s Driving The Growth However, Santana explains that this will not just happen and that they would wait for the best time to actually carry out this move. According to the analyst, a drawdown from the current rally would be the best time for them. “So they would let the market correction play out after the SECs announcement late December or early January 2024. Once the market is about to bottom or hits bottom, then the ‘restructuring’ can start,” Santana said. “This would freeze billions of customers funds and allow time for the institutions, the big players, the Spot ETFs to buy Bitcoin low.” Despite the grim prediction that could crumble the crypto market if it happened, the crypto analyst believes that this is positive in the long term. “Life will continue to evolve, nature will pick who leaves and who stays, and time will decide who was right and who is wrong,” Santana concluded.

21662518,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566600,1703278814,Will Inscriptions On Polkadot Push DOT Prices Back Above $10?,"There has been a notable spike in the number of Polkadot transactions in recent days. The surge also coincides with DOT prices racing to new 2023 highs when writing on December 22. Taking to X, asynchronous rob noted that Polkadot is currently processing around 250,000 transactions per hour or 400-450 per block. Polkadot is a modern blockchain that aims to drive blockchain interoperability. Based on its design, relying on a Relay Chain and numerous Parachains, the network can process transactions cheaply, considering its high capacity. Polkadot Transactions Swelling: Blame Dota and Inscriptions The rapid expansion of transactions on Polkadot can be attributed to the recent launch of inscriptions, a new type of cross-chain asset developed by the Dota platform. Uniquely, Dota’s inscriptions aim to simplify the process of deploying and minting assets on Polkadot’s parachains. Related Reading: Solana Flips BNB To Become 4th-Largest Crypto, Is Ethereum Next Though parachains operate independently as “chains” that rely on the Relay Chain for security, this design will eliminate the need for Cross-Chain Message Forma (XCM), which is needed for Polkadot parachains to communicate. Usually, the XCM requires complex coding and can be time-consuming. Therefore, the simplicity of DOT-20 inscriptions by Dota directly explains why there is a surge in the number of transactions. According to Dota on X, inscriptions on Polkadot account for 98% of the recent transaction volume. Though there has been a change in the number of transactions processed, transaction fees on Polkadot remain low. At the same time, the network hasn’t “skipped a bit,” with capacity being around 10%. By how Polkadot is designed, network fees will increase only once 25% of the total network capacity is changed. To reach this level, each block being confirmed on Polkadot must pack at least 1,250 transactions. This will require even more inscriptions to be created via Dota, meaning despite the observed spike, Polkadot is technically underutilized from a bandwidth perspective. Will DOT Continue Rising In 2024? While the deluge of transactions also coincides with rising DOT prices, currently at 2023 highs, there have been concerns about inscriptions causing network congestion in a network like Bitcoin facing scaling challenges. Critics maintain that inscriptions, though defended by some, serve nothing more than spamming the network and discouraging use due to accompanying increases in transaction fees. For now, it remains to be seen if inscriptions will be sustainable, helping onboard more users. So far, Polkadot, as mentioned, can handle the uptick in transactions. Related Reading: BONK Crashes 31% After A Solid Month – Is the Success Story Ending? Even so, if there is a 3X rise in transactions exceeding the 1,250 transactions per block threshold, the demand for DOT will rise.

42418958,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9Sv,1703278382,7 Real World Asset Trends in 2024 That Will Unlock the Future of Finance,"In the ever-shifting landscape of finance, the past two years have provided us with a unique set of challenges. Chief among them was U.S. inflation – peaking at a staggering 9.1% in June 2022 – which prompted the Fed to implement a series of aggressive (and still ongoing) rate hikes.  Concurrently, the crypto industry weathered its own storm, marked by the downfall of major projects like Terra/Luna, Celsius, Voyager, and FTX, along with a supporting cast of banks – Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley Bank, among others.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  Amid this turbulence, blockchain builders have continued their inexorable march forward, with the realm of real-world assets (RWA) emerging as a beacon of innovation and resilience. At its core, real-world asset tokenization creates an investment vehicle on the blockchain that is linked to tangible assets such as real estate or automobiles, or anything else that could exist in physical form. Once ownership is recorded onchain, the asset can be traded, fractionalized, or held securely.  Read more: 5 Predictions for Real World Assets in 2024  As we step into 2024, here are seven RWA trends poised to reshape the financial landscape:  1. Stablecoins: The Bedrock of Programmable Money  As Federal regulation looms, stablecoins – epitome of programmable money – are on the brink of transformative growth, fundamentally altering our perception of what currency looks like. In the US, two issuers dominate this space – Circle (which issues USDC as a multi-chain solution) and Paxos (which offers while labeled solutions such as Paypal’s PYUSD). Globally, stablecoins have ~$125B in market capitalization and form the foundational infrastructure layer that will power the value internet. Offering stability and flexibility, stablecoins are set to revolutionize global payments, remittances, e-commerce, trade finance, and more.  2. Tokenized Treasuries: Bridging Traditional and Decentralized Finance  The true convergence of traditional finance and decentralized finance is embodied in tokenized treasuries. As risk-free short-term treasury yields have gone up from near zero at the beginning of 2022 to about 5.4% in October of 2023, companies like Franklin Templeton, Ondo, Backed, Maple, Open Eden, and Superstate have pioneered the tokenization of short-term US Treasuries and bank deposits. According to data token and analytics platform RWA.xyz, this new asset class now boasts a market capitalization of $700 million. Tokenized treasuries are tearing down barriers, offering new avenues for investment and financial inclusivity.  3. Private Credit: Empowering SMEs Through DeFi  The private credit market, valued at $1trillion market in the US and $1.7 trillion globally, has long eluded small and medium enterprises. DeFi lending protocols such as Centrifuge, Goldfinch, Credit, Maple, Huma, and others are changing the game and opening up the floodgates of access to debt capital from the public markets, the banking system and traditional  private credit originators. Focused on specific industries or geographies, RWA.xyz currently estimates the market to have about $550M in active loans with a continuation of momentum in the coming months.  4. Backed NFTs: Revolutionizing Collectible Financing  With yearly global sales of over $65 billion ($30 billion in the U.S. alone), it’s easy to see there is a lot of money in art. But traditional markets for art and collectibles lack liquidity and are burdened by exorbitant fees (auction houses often add 15-20% fees onto small-ticket items). The global collectibles market (coins, stamps, books, comics, art, toys, and more) is estimated to be around $400 billion and similarly lacks liquidity. Marketplaces like eBay and some smaller bespoke marketplaces cater to this industry, while lending options are generally restricted to pawn shops that have high rates.  Luckily, decentralized protocols like 4K and arcade.xyz are shifting the paradigm. By bringing physical collectibles onto the blockchain, borrowing and lending against assets like Supreme T-Shirts and comic books have become reality. These initiatives democratize lending, making it accessible to collectors worldwide.  5. Consumer Brand NFTs: Elevating Customer Engagement  Leading consumer brands, including Nike, Adidas, Louis Vuitton, and Coca-Cola among others, are embracing NFTs. From Starbucks on Polygon to Amazon's rumored private blockchain endeavors, brands are leveraging blockchain to enhance digital footprints, customer engagement, and entertainment experiences. Whether on public blockchains (Starbucks on Polygon) or private blockchains (rumors swirl around Amazon), by incorporating gaming and metaverse elements, these brands are shaping the future of consumer interaction.  6. DeFi in Climate and Regenerative Finance  Amidst growing ESG concerns, blockchain technology is catalyzing positive change in the $2 billion and growing carbon market. Companies like Flowcarbon are harnessing blockchain's potential to enhance transparency in this important market, which must see a 15-fold growth by 2030 to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals. Blockchain's accuracy and transparency at every stage of the carbon lifecycle are integral in fostering a sustainable future.  7. Tokenized Deposits and Wholesale Bank Settlements: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions  Blockchain technology is reshaping the way banks handle tokenized deposits and wholesale settlements. While a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) may not be a pressing issue to solve in the U.S., especially if private issuers can be regulated at Federal or state levels, several banks are experimenting on blockchain technologies on tokenized deposits and wholesale intra or inter-bank settlements. Pilots by industry giants like Citi and J.P. Morgan Chase demonstrate the potential for instantaneous cross-border transactions. This area will continue to expand in the coming months, enhancing efficiency in global finance.  These RWA trends herald a new era in finance, offering solutions to longstanding challenges. While their market capitalization may seem modest now, their transformative potential is immeasurable. Stablecoins, tokenized treasuries, decentralized private credit, physical backed NFTs, consumer brand NFTs, DeFi in climate & regenerative finance, and tokenized deposits/wholesale bank settlements are not merely trends; they are the building blocks of a more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable financial future.

42418975,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9gL,1703277890,"The Unified Future of AI, Blockchain and Virtual Worlds in 2024","In the annals of human history, 2023 may well be remembered as a year when the future ceased to be a matter of speculation and became a tangible reality. It was a year when artificial intelligence, a concept once relegated to the pages of science fiction, blossomed into a multifaceted tool, fluent in the diverse tongues of humanity. Like the fabled Tower of Babel in reverse, it bridged languages, bringing us closer to a universal understanding.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  In this same year, blockchain technology, akin to the invisible yet foundational forces of the universe, worked its way quietly into our digital cosmos. It provided a secure bedrock for our virtual possessions, all the while sparing us the labyrinthine complexities of its inner workings.  As for virtual worlds, they've seen a big turnaround in 2023. After the initial excitement and then the letdown of the metaverse in 2022, things started looking up again. This change came thanks to advancements by hardware companies. It's like we're on the brink of getting the “iPhone of Spatial Computing,” something that could really bring these digital worlds to life in ways we can touch and feel.  These developments, while distinct in their own right, did not occur in isolation. They represent the emerging threads of Technological Convergence – a concept where separate technological paths begin to intersect and influence one another, creating a unified tapestry of innovation. This convergence is more than just a blending of technologies; it is a harmonization that enhances, expands, and redefines our experience of the digital world.  As we step into 2024, we find ourselves at the precipice of this new era, where the seamless integration of AI, blockchain and virtual reality heralds a future of limitless potential and unprecedented digital interaction.  The convergence of AI and the metaverse  Intriguingly, this convergence is rooted in the very hardware that powers it. GPUs, known for rendering rich virtual spaces, are the same workhorses that train AI models. Their capability for parallel computing not only makes them invaluable in AI development but also in bringing to life the complex environments of the Metaverse. This synergy is evident in the surging value of GPU manufacturers like Nvidia, highlighting the intertwined growth of AI and virtual reality technologies.  Going into 2024, the convergence of AI and the metaverse looms as a pivotal development in our technological journey. We are on the cusp of witnessing AI transform the act of creation within the metaverse. This year, we predict that AI will evolve beyond its current capabilities, enabling creators to craft expansive virtual worlds merely through the power of description. The metaverse will no longer require intricate skills in 3D modeling and animation; instead, it will respond to the creative impulses of human thought, brought to life by AI.  The trust architecture of tomorrow  The year 2023 was a crucible for blockchain, with the industry navigating through legal challenges and corporate upheavals. These trials, reminiscent of the growing pains of any great technological advancement, heralded blockchain's maturation. Amid this legal maelstrom, the essence of blockchain – the digitization of asset ownership – stood resolute and unscathed, continuing its march towards technological revolution.  We foresee blockchain melding into the internet's fabric, akin to the unseen yet vital protocols that power our emails and instant messages. This convergence will see blockchain assets become a native dialect for the digital realm, essential, and most importantly, invisible to the user. The interaction with blockchain will be as effortless as sending an email, its complexities hidden, its efficacy and security omnipresent. In this future, blockchain is not just a technology; it is a silent orchestrator of digital trust and ownership.  Synergies between VR and the Metaverse  In 2023, virtual reality (VR) has ascended to become the next frontier in human-computer interaction, providing unprecedented bandwidth for digital communication and embodying the essence of presence. This leap forward has been propelled by advancements from leading hardware manufacturers, with the release of Meta Quest 3 and the eagerly anticipated VR headsets from Apple and Nintendo. Each stride in this domain is not just about technological progress; it is about redefining our very perception of and interaction with digital realms.  Looking ahead to 2024, we stand on the brink of a defining moment in the spatial computing industry. The potential use case of experiencing events like the NBA finals from the best seats in the stadium, all from the comfort of home, is poised to capture the imagination of the masses. This experience, bridging the physical and digital worlds, will likely be a catalyst for widespread adoption among the early majority. The journey ahead for VR is long and filled with potential, but the convergence of technologies like AI, blockchain, and advanced hardware is setting the stage for a seismic shift.  The cultural and economic impact  In the narrative of our digital evolution, Generation Z emerges as the vanguard of a new cultural epoch. Born into a world where virtuality is as real as the air they breathe, these digital natives are the first to fully immerse themselves in the fruits of technological convergence. Their initial forays, playful and experimental in creating memes and digital artifacts, are but the prologue to a deeper, more significant shift. With tools shaped by AI and the metaverse at their fingertips, they are not just using technology; they are reshaping it, bending the digital universe to their imagination and whims.  We see these young minds not just embracing but mastering the art of creation within these new realms. They are the pioneers of a world where user-generated content is not just a pastime but a new economic frontier. In their hands, creativity and innovation become more than expression; they are the keys to unlocking new forms of value and influence. The power once held by a select few in coding and legal intricacies is now democratized in the hands of these youthful creators, heralding a future where the digital realm is limited only by imagination.  In 2024  As 2024 unfolds, we are at the cusp of a transformative era in technology. The integration of AI, blockchain, and virtual reality is crafting a new digital landscape. This convergence is more than a mere amalgamation of technologies; it's a revolution in how we interact with the digital realm. AI's advancement is redefining creative possibilities in the metaverse, enabling environments to be molded by thought alone. Blockchain evolves into a fundamental layer of digital trust, making asset ownership seamlessly part of the internet's fabric. Virtual reality, on the brink of a breakthrough, is set to radically change our sensory experiences in digital spaces.  Crucially, this technological synergy is the playground of Generation Z, who are not just users but active creators and shapers of these realms. Their engagement with these technologies is not just about leisure; it's the forging of a new economic and cultural landscape where imagination is the primary currency.  In this new era, the limits of the digital world are defined only by our creativity, opening unprecedented avenues for innovation and interaction. The year 2024 marks the beginning of this exciting journey, promising a future where technology and imagination converge to expand the boundaries of what is possible.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Yemel Jardi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/22/the-unified-future-of-ai-blockchain-and-virtual-worlds-in-2024,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6edefcadb6a1d72050d549a70c77a310db79786c-5318x3413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418977,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9jR,1703277760,Who Won Crypto in 2023? The CoinDesk Market Index Broken Down in 6 Charts,"Sure, we love to geek out about blockchain technology, and wonder if all of this might someday serve as the foundation for an entirely new-built infrastructure of digital finance. But hey, what about the money end?  A cornerstone of capitalism is letting investors bet on the emergence of new technologies, and one thing that's notable about blockchain is that the industry has developed its own markets to bet on blockchain winners and losers. (Whether these markets pass muster with regulators is an entirely separate question; in the meantime you won't find Solana's SOL token trading on Wall Street.)  With that in mind, what better prism is there on the performance of digital-asset markets during 2023 than the benchmark CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), accompanied by a breakdown of year-to-date returns for the various industry sectors?  Below please find six charts highlighting some of the biggest takeaways from 2023.  CoinDesk's Bradley Keoun, founding editor of The Protocol newsletter, wrote this article, based on charts prepared by Tracy Stephens of CoinDesk Indices.  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) has 5x'd the S&P 500 this year  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is CoinDesk's broadest, most inclusive gauge of digital-asset markets – ""Crypto's S&P 500,"" as we like to call our benchmark index. In the year through Dec. 21, the CMI more than doubled, gaining 125% to be precise. As seen in the chart above, the bulk of the year's returns came during the first quarter of the year, and during the last quarter; in between, there were a lot of doldrums, bringing a lot of gut-wrenching anxiety (and layoffs) for the crypto industry, before the green shoots started to show. Bitcoin [BTC], the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, outperformed the benchmark, while Ethereum's ether [ETH], the second-biggest, underperformed. The CMI's year-to-date return was roughly five times the 23% figure for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the benchmark for U.S. stocks.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU) leads sector index returns  The CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU) led gains among the CMI sector indices, with a 167% return in 2023. The index corresponds to the Computing sector within the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard.  The definition of the Computing sector is as follows: ""The Computing sector consists of projects that aim to decentralize the sharing, storing and transmission of data by removing intermediaries and ensuring privacy for all users. All projects that aim to gather, transmit, store and share data and web services in a decentralized manner play a key factor in building the infrastructure of Web3. This includes on-chain and off-chain data transmission, social data platforms, peer-to-peer secure data transactions, open networks, free market private computation and decentralized file storage and file sharing.""  Ranking second among the sector indices was the CoinDesk Currency Index (CCY), with a 150% return. That index includes bitcoin [BTC], XRP [XRP], Stellar lumens [XLM] and dogecoin [DOGE].  Injective, RenderToken, Solana led CMI token returns  Can you say 32x? That was the return for Injective Protocol's INJ token [INJ]. Injective is a blockchain built for finance, using Cosmos blockchain technology, that claims to be the fastest among layer 1s. In August we reported on its “2.0” tokenomics upgrade to “dramatically increase the amount of INJ burned weekly,” citing a blog post at the time.  RenderToken [RNDR] from Render, a GPU rendering network that migrated this year to Solana from Ethereum, surged 972%. (RenderToken, for what it's worth, was the top performer in the top-performing Computing sector.) Solana's SOL zoomed 833%.  In notoriously volatile digital-asset markets, there is exactly zero guarantee that any of these gains are deserved or enduring. What is safe to say is that digital-asset markets in 2023 saw the reappearance of the type of mind-blowing returns – and high risk – that historically have attracted a lot of traders to crypto.  ApeCoin, Luna, DASH, BAL, OMG, ZEC were the big 2023 losers in CMI  We don't need to belabor the point here; in 2023, the biggest rewards probably accrued to crypto traders who went long. But it's possible some lucky or smart managers succeeded in shorting the right horses, as it were. A few of these projects were legacy failures i.e. Terra's LUNA [LUNA]. Others just sort of lost steam, like EthereumPOW's ETHW [ETHW], which basically died on the vine as the main Ethereum blockchain successfully completed its transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain, culminating in the so-called ""Shapella"" upgrade earlier this that allowed staking withdrawals for the first time. Ethereum Name Service's [ENS] and Zcash's ZEC [ZEC], representing projects still considered by many crypto analysts to be interesting enough, had a tough year.  Bitcoin extended its dominance  Sometimes it can be hard for normies to really get this, but bitcoin [BTC] is actually seen by many savvy crypto traders as the safe play. So on a risk-reward basis, one would be pretty hard-pressed to complain about the OG cryptocurrency's 164% year-to-date return through Dec. 21. (The chart above shows YTD leaders in the CoinDesk Currency Index (CCY).)  XRP [XRP], the payments token used in Ripple Labs's network, had a decent year with an 83% climb – as a crucial decision went its way in a pending case before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (Read Sam Kessler's story from earlier this year on why that decision suddenly made it worthwhile again to study the technology behind the XRP Ledger.)  The XLM [XLM] tokens from Stellar, which spent the year readying for its big ""Soroban"" smart-contracts upgrade expected in early 2024, weren't far behind, with a 73% return.  CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Sector (SMT)  Regular readers of The Protocol newsletter – highlighting blockchain tech; please subscribe here! – will quickly recognize this index: the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT); it captures the biggest core blockchain infrastructure plays beyond Bitcoin; those include heavyweight Ethereum as well as the myriad alt-layer-1 blockchains and rapidly-proliferating layer-2 networks that are vying for relevance.  In 2023 the SMT index has returned 107%, slightly underperforming the benchmark CMI, at least partly due to the outperformance of bitcoin, which isn't a member.  We've already talked about the market leaders Injective and Solana.  Ethereum's ETH turned in a respectable 87% climb, though the anti-#Flippening crowd will certainly note the drastic gap versus bitcoin's 164%.  Avalanche's AVAX [AVAX] had a big year, riding the narrative that it might get traction from institutional blockchain adopters; the project played a leading role in a big proof-of-concept demonstration by JPMorgan and Apollo.  The Optimism ecosystem's OP [OP] token gained as Coinbase's Base and several other projects chose the technology as the template for new layer-2 networks they wanted to build.  The SKALE [SKALE] token from Skale Network – describing itself as an ""Ethereum-native multichain network built to scale Ethereum dApps with a focus on high-throughput, fast finality, and zero gas fee transactions"" – scored big with a 151% 2023 rally.  Notable was the lackluster performance of Polygon's MATIC [MATIC] token, with 6.2% – even though the project was one of the most aggressive in positioning itself at the forefront of the Ethereum layer-2 race, and a leader in the adoption of hotter-than-hot ""zero-knowledge"" cryptography.  The Cosmos ecosystem's ATOM token was also somewhat of a disappointment on a relative basis, gaining just 20% even though its vision for a multi-chain, interoperable blockchain universe has pretty much taken hold throughout the blockchain universe. And it landed some major projects, including a new layer-1 blockchain for decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX, which migrated away from its prior status as a layer-2 network atop Ethereum.

Historically the quadrennial Bitcoin halvings like the one that's expected next year, have driven a four-year market cycle. But that history only goes back 14 years.  One area where crypto markets are exactly like traditional markets: Nobody really knows what's going to happen – everyone's just guessing.  Or as it's been said in the past about Wall Street stock pitchers: If they tell you to buy it, it means they've already bought.

42418980,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9iP,1703275210,Is it Really ‘Up Only’ for Bitcoin?,"It’s that time again — when your friends and family members who know you’re into Bitcoin text asking if now is the time to buy.  A time that signifies we’re at another peak in bitcoin’s price.  I know, I know. How bah-humbug of me.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  But the truth is, if you’re thinking about buying bitcoin right now, it might not be the best time to make a sizable purchase — despite the fact that we might see spot bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) approved in the near future (possibly as early as January).  Why?  Let’s start by looking at bitcoin’s price action during periods leading up to the last two Bitcoin halvings. (The next is due in late-April, when block 840,000 is expected to be mined.)  Trends from previous Bitcoin cycles  Bitcoin halving cycles last about four years (210,000 blocks produced at approximately 10 minutes per block). At the commencement of each cycle, the block subsidy reward that Bitcoin miners receive is cut in half, which triggers a bitcoin supply shock.  Historically, bitcoin’s price has risen dramatically during the year and a half that follows the halving. The price then tanks and trades in a range for the cycle’s other two and a half years.  From late-2013 until mid-2016, when the second halving occurred, bitcoin’s price fell from $1,166 to $156. It then rebounded to $780 — 67% of the previous all-time high — before falling 40% to $472 in August 2016.  The $472 price point marked a local bottom just one month after the second halving took place.  From late 2017 to late 2018, bitcoin’s price fell from $19,666 to $3,150 before rebounding to $13,882 — 70% of the previous all-time high. By March 2020, its price had fallen 72% to $3,867.  $3,867 marked a local bottom two months before the third Bitcoin halving, which occurred in May 2020.  Another two-and-a-half-year period that precedes a Bitcoin halving is coming to an end. This period began in late 2021 and will end in April 2024, when the fourth halving is scheduled to occur.  During this period thus far, bitcoin’s price has fallen from $69,000 to $15,522 before rebounding to $44,759 — 65% of the previous all-time high.  This 65% rebound — the current one — is awfully close to the 67% and 70% rebounds we saw in the two previous cycles.  And so the big question now is: Will bitcoin’s price retrace significantly leading up to the next halving as it has leading up to the two previous halvings?  If bitcoin’s price were to fall 40% from these current levels — as it did in 2015-2016 — we’d see bitcoin’s price at $26,855. (As of writing, it is approaching $44,000).  If it were to fall 72% — as in 2019-2020 — we’d see bitcoin’s price at $12,532.  I’ve seen very few people mention such numbers in the wake of the euphoria bitcoin investors are currently experiencing.  So, will this time be different?  Aren’t we waiting for billions of dollars to flow into bitcoin almost immediately after the spot bitcoin ETF is approved?  Maybe.  The spot bitcoin ETF  No one knows whether an approval of a spot bitcoin ETF is priced into the bitcoin market yet.  Some believe it is and that the announcement of a spot bitcoin ETF will be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event — a situation in which bitcoin’s price rises in anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF announcement, as it has been, but then sells off once the ETF is announced.  Others say it’s a “buy the rumor, buy the news” event — a situation in which bitcoin’s price rises in anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF and rises again once the ETF is announced.  The truth is that no one knows what will happen in the wake of a spot bitcoin ETF being approved and coming to market.  And with Bloomberg analysts predicting a 90% chance of approval by January 10, 2024, hardly anyone seems to be asking the following question: What happens to bitcoin’s price if the spot bitcoin ETF isn’t approved? (Though CoinDesk did.)  This scenario could easily be grounds for a significant drawdown in bitcoin’s price. The drawdown might not be as severe as the previous two, but it would likely be notable.  Also, what happens to bitcoin’s price in the event of a hard landing?  What if we don’t get a soft landing?  While the powers that be and major institutions will have you believe that we’re on our way to a soft landing or, at worst, a mild recession, those of us who remember hearing the exact same rhetoric in 2008 aren’t so convinced.  A number of reputable outlets have stated that we may be amid a “melt-up” — a situation in which asset prices rise parabolically before crashing catastrophically.  This isn’t hard to believe given that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at an all-time high, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are almost there, as well — all while we’re still in an environment in which investors can earn over 5% risk-free in money market mutual funds.  If a melt-up is currently taking place and bitcoin’s price is going along for the ride, then there are two more questions we have to ask: How high does bitcoin’s price rise before it comes crashing down, and what sort of investing strategy is best to employ if this is the case?  While the first question is difficult to answer, the second isn’t as challenging.  A BTC investment strategy for this point in the Bitcoin cycle  By all means, continue to HODL your BTC and DCA (dollar-cost average) into the asset, as these investment strategies have proven fruitful for anyone who has held BTC for more than four years.  The one thing you might want to avoid amid this euphoria is aping into a large position at these levels — especially with any sort of leverage. (To quote the Founder & CEO of Custodia Bank, Caitlin Long, “A fool and [their] leveraged bitcoin are soon parted.”)  If we see a massive drawdown in bitcoin’s price, you’ll want to have some cash on the sidelines to buy, not find yourself bitcoin-less and cash-strapped due to acting like an overzealous gambler.  As always, we don’t know where bitcoin’s price will go from here. Maybe it actually will move up only both into and beyond the halving.  But if history repeats itself and bitcoin performs the way it has right before prior halvings, we may see bitcoin at a significantly lower price as the halving in April 2024 approaches.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Frank Corva,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/22/is-it-really-up-only-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99e535ba4020c492f00afc441dad123a1128f3b9-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418960,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9W1,1703273748,How NFTs Will Make a Comeback in 2024,"At the close of 2023, we’re seeing a resurgence of interest in NFTs. NFT brands are selling products in major brick-and-mortar and online retailers. We’re seeing the launch of major blockchain-based games. And more established companies are coming into the NFT space. As a result, NFT-based brand building is poised to be a significant driver of Web3 adoption in 2024.  The next wave of successful NFT products will likely look quite different from much of what we've seen before. Instead of focusing on a small quantity of high-value assets, many of these products will be produced in large quantities – and sold at more affordable prices, targeting the broader consumer market. They'll be focused on direct value creation, rather than speculation. And many customers will acquire and use these digital assets without even realizing they're running on crypto rails.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. The Everything Token is available for preorder now, and will be in stores on January 23, 2024.  We’ve already seen experiments with mass-market NFTs as digital collectibles, from the likes of Nike, Reddit, Starbucks – and yes, even former U.S. President Donald Trump. And, similarly, NFT-native brands like Pudgy Penguins, Cool Cats, and Kitaro Studios have produced “phygital” activations, whereby a physical product comes with an associated NFT, either linked to the product directly or through a claim code delivered at the point-of-sale. In parallel, both major players like Ticketmaster and newcomers like tokenproof and YellowHeart have been testing out NFTs for event tickets, memberships, and other forms of fan engagement.  These sorts of products give an opportunity for consumers who aren’t familiar with NFTs to experience the digital ownership that comes with this novel tech. They’re typically sold at what we might think of as “normal” consumer product prices – tickets cost what they would normally cost; phygital prices are generally comparable to ordinary prices for just the physical object.  While early entry into NFTs required users to navigate complicated self-custodial wallets, these NFTs often come wrapped in a platform design that submerges the underlying blockchain technology through a partially or fully custodial wallet system. Yet this doesn’t stop consumers from receiving utility from the tokens and integrating them into their digital identity on social media and other platforms. Nor does it stop them from participating in the broader NFT ecosystem if they want to (indeed, in many cases, they can even transfer their branded NFTs to self-custody if they so choose).  Meanwhile, making digital assets more accessible – both technologically and in terms of price – expands the potential market dramatically, and provides a foundation brands can build upon.  As we describe in a book coming out in January, The Everything Token (you can preorder here), NFTs give a company or creator a way to benefit from the power of decentralized value creation by turning their customers into a community: the asset itself establishes a network linking holders to the brand and each other; at the same time, ownership incentivizes consumers themselves to share the brand with others and help build it.  Starbucks Odyssey members, for example, have set up entire third-party websites dedicated to the program and organized unofficial meetups and events without direct involvement from Starbucks. This has also extended into the digital realm, as members have spun their own group chats up with friends from the public Starbucks server, meaning community members who wouldn’t know each other without these NFTs now stay connected daily in both the digital and physical world.  This can be just as effective for small businesses and solo creators as it is for major companies. But it works best when the community can be broad and growing.  For a brand like Starbucks or Nike to get the most out of their NFT products, they have to eventually be able to bring those products to their full global customer base. Conversely, whenever a customer wants to become part of the brand’s digital ecosystem, they need to be able to. (This is, if anything, even more true for businesses with a more local following.)  This implies that the smaller, more broadly accessible NFT products we’ve been seeing aren’t just experiments – they’re the future. The success of “open edition” creator NFTs in early 2023 illustrated how effective this strategy can be for creators. And over the course of the year, it’s been clear that businesses have been figuring it out, too.  So we’re expecting to see brands go big with “small” NFTs in 2024. And as they do so, they’re likely to bring many more consumers into the space.

Arthur Hayes Doubling Down On Ethereum Arthur Hayes recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his optimism and prediction about the future of Ethereum, and the post has since caused quite a stir in the entire cryptocurrency community. Renowned for his perceptive market analysis, Hayes claimed to have had a revelation on ETH during one of his meditations, and this prompted him to significantly alter his cryptocurrency holdings. He sarcastically asserted in the X post to have gotten the direction from the Lord. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Will Skyrocket Due To AI-Driven DAO Revolution: Arthur Hayes Following this supposed heavenly direction, Hayes allegedly sold his Solana holdings and increased his stake in Ethereum. In addition, he has predicted a spike that would take the price of the cryptocurrency asset to an astounding $5,000. He further conveyed his love and appreciation for Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Hayes called Vitalik an Archangel while doing so. Hayes’ evaluation of the market dynamics might have played a role in his choice to divert from Solana to Ethereum. In another X post, Arthur Hayes shared a chart of Ethereum to back up his predictions. The crypto exchange founder has urged the crypto community to “get down” on the digital asset. The BitMex founder’s projections come after his previous call, in which he predicted that Solana’s price would hit $100. Hayes’ prediction has appeared to be almost accurate, as the digital asset’s price has recently reached a peak of $99. Since mid-December SOL has been demonstrating a rally, increasing by an astounding 350%. Despite the fact that Solana is displaying an upward trajectory, Hayes seems to think that Ethereum still has the potential to outperform SOL. Glassnode Co-Founders Give Next Target For The Crypto Asset Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, cofounders of Glassnode and collectively known on X as Negentropic, have highlighted the next target for Ethereum. According to the cofounders, the next target for ETH is $2,500 and has urged the community to keep an eye on this level. Related Reading: Is Ethereum (ETH) Ready For A Monster Move In January 2024? Negentropic asserted that the asset reaching the $2,500 target will be triggered by market enthusiasm. Another target identified by the founders is $2,700, which ETH will attain by continuous ambitious push. The co-founders also highlighted a support level at $2,100, which was once a resistance level but now a key zone. However, Negentropic pointed out that the level has now turned out to be critical for short-term rebounds. In addition, they asserted that if ETH ends up breaching the support level, it might activate the 50-Day EMA. As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,307, indicating a 1.30% increase in the past 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased by 19% to $16,690,793,321, its market capitalization has increased by 1.31% to $277,454,559,883.

It typically is applied to any freely traded market where larger or institutional traders operate (commodities, bonds, currencies, etc.). In this article we will apply WA to the cryptocurrency Cosmos ($ATOM) to make a forecast for approximate future events. Cosmos Price Data from MEXC Futures | Source: ATOMUSDT.P on tradingview.com. Link to the raw image: https://www.tradingview.com/x/r8asKWOI Cosmos $ATOM is currently in Phase D of a Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic #1. Note the volume spike near where I placed the SC and Spring. In Wyckoff Analysis these typically must align even if the overall form isn’t perfect. The only slight anomaly is that the ST dips sharply below the SC breaking the ICE (not labeled). There are Advanced Schematics that you can find online that accommodate many of these anomalous formations. Phase D is where demand greatly overcomes supply leading the rallies on higher (or noticeably increasing) volume. When an LPS occurs that is typically a favorable (even optimal) place for a long position. It recently finished a Reaccumulation, to which it’s rallying sharply.

In this case it’s at $18, but $15 is a preliminary target it must concretely clear first. Doing some more work using the Horizontal Count method with PnF charts yields different results. My settings are currently a $0.25 box size and a three box reversal on a High-Low lookback. When using the Horizontal Count method Extended Congestions need to be accounted for differently. The main thing is finding the relevant column in and out to create the Congestion Box. In our case that’s from 13 to 20 December 2023 spanning 7 bars. Since this is a Reaccumulation “breakout” we will need to add the value from the formula the Horizontal Count uses. 7 x $0.25 x 3 = $5.25 The relevant low to add this to is $10.25 so the PnF target is $15.5.

42418961,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9Uz,1703269561,2024: The Revenge of Bitcoin,"Andreessen Horowitz's (a16z) predictions for next year’s top crypto trends don’t mention Bitcoin at all. They’re not alone; with all the hype around burgeoning ecosystems on Ethereum and Solana, it’s easy to write Bitcoin off as old, obsolete and boring.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Matt Luongo is the CEO of Thesis, a venture studio and auditing firm which has built a family of projects across fintech, DeFi, infrastructure, and zero-knowledge cryptography such as Fold, tBTC, and Embody.  But that would be a mistake. In 2024, the world is going to be reminded of this in a big way. Next year will see the revenge of Bitcoin, for better or for worse.  My ambivalence may surprise you. I haven’t changed my mind about the transformative power of Bitcoin. But 2024 is looking like the year this asset finally breaks into the mainstream in an irreversible way. And the nature of that transition will determine whether the dream of decentralization and self-custody of assets moves closer to reality, or if the Bitcoin “brand” is co-opted as just another product from the likes of Vanguard and Amazon.  The catalyst for this is the impending approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, which is poised to unleash a tidal wave of investment in the world’s oldest cryptocurrency.  Here’s the problem: the inflow of new investors will be people who think they’ve invested in BTC, but never touch anything that actually lives on-chain. These ETFs will be “paper Bitcoin:” a representation, not the real thing, just like a dollar bill isn’t the same thing as gold.  For Bitcoin to succeed on its own terms, it must evolve as a technology, not just a store of value  And there will be no obvious reason for anyone to hold the underlying asset directly. There will be a whole universe of consumer apps letting people buy, sell, trade, lend, borrow — all using synthetic assets that never touch the blockchain.  “Bitcoin” will thrive, but the whole idea behind it, true self-custody, will be dead. How do we avoid a pyrrhic victory of this magnitude? By giving first-time HODLers something to do.  Bitcoin has always been the largest digital asset in terms of market cap. But it has not been the epicenter of innovation for years when it comes to use cases. In that sphere, Ethereum has dominated, recently joined by other popular chains such as Solana. This has led many, implicitly or explicitly, to think of Bitcoin as “done” — a finished product with enduring value but little room for growth or evolution.  We must shatter this myth. For Bitcoin to succeed on its own terms, it must evolve as a technology, not just a store of value. The stage for this has already been set by the rapid development of layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which have seen broad adoption over the past year.  Yet just as Lightning shows what is possible, it is also a reminder of how much still needs to be done. In its current form, it has real limitations. For instance, when fees are high, performance suffers dramatically, seen recently when Lightning transaction facilitator Nostr Assets was recently forced to pause deposits due to overwhelming demand.  The fact is Bitcoin’s current L2s do not yet have the capacity to onboard the next billion users. The primary thing a Bitcoin L2 should do is bring Bitcoin holders into “multiplayer mode.” A user shouldn’t need Cash App to send or receive BTC, they should be able to quickly and easily send value via email or through BTC-native apps like Nostr.  The launch of ETFs will vastly expand Bitcoin’s adoption funnel. But to truly succeed, the underlying blockchain needs to be an arena of activity — a decentralized financial ecosystem where people can trade and build. More than anything, Bitcoin as a network should be an ecosystem where like-minded people can gather, trade, conduct business, and build.  See also: BlackRock, Nasdaq, SEC Met Regarding Bitcoin ETF  This is already true for Ethereum, where it’s possible to make millions as a “degen,” but not yet for BTC. If the only thing you can do is to run a Lightning node, most people will never move beyond a brokerage account. Bitcoin must catch up with the DeFi ecosystems that have proliferated on other chains; the summer of 2024 needs to be BTC DeFi summer.  Fortunately, 2023 has already shown that BTC isn't done innovating. As a project, as an idea and as a community, Bitcoin isn't finished. Developer talent, which many assumed had moved on to other pursuits, is coming back.  Bitcoin is facing its greatest opportunity – and its greatest danger. The approval of ETFs will be the onboarding opportunity of our lifetimes. But if the infrastructure is not ready, the underlying promise of the technology will lose out to easy, convenient “paper” assets. The challenge for the community will be to build the infrastructure that can harness all this new activity to advance a future of decentralized, sound money for everyone.  All of this is likely to blindside VCs and influencers like Marc Andreessen, but the story of Bitcoin is a story of surprising the naysayers.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Matt Luongo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/22/2024-the-revenge-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc8cf657e6f7825ac3dbdae65036935fd4f8de2f-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418956,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9Rt,1703268647,Next Year Crypto Will Wash Away the Stains of the ICO Boom,"A remarkable amount of people began thinking crypto is a scam because of the initial coin offering (ICO) craze, which kicked off in 2017. It is largely true that that period was rife with sketchy projects. However, this coming year should help change that perception of the industry.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Ryan Gorman is the founder of RGPR, a Web3 consultancy and head of strategy at Uranium3o.  Back then, many project founders lied about virtually everything, including their partnerships, intentions and actual products. Many were simply scams from the beginning. One exchange founder may have even faked his own deathH to make off with millions in stolen crypto.  This period was the Wild West and led to a lot of fair criticisms. The crypto industry was born from an ideal meant to counteract what many believe was the profiteering of traditional financial firms, only to turn into something even worse.  Since then, however, digital assets have become far more professionalized. Real builders emerged during the recent crypto winter that have created genuine opportunities for both crypto-natives and non-crypto-natives. A focus on real world assets (RWA) and real world use cases has emerged. Many recent projects have far more utility than most ICOs, it's the difference between creating actual value and bolting the word “blockchain” onto a brand to juice its stock price.  The RWA market is massive, and tokenization is only getting started. This movement will forever change how people view and access investments — be they commodities, real estate, art, rare whiskey or any number of other things that have historically been bought or sold on opaque off-exchange or broker and auction dominated marketplaces.  The success of tokenization will change the perception of crypto as a whole.  Increased transparency  There are many commodities that have no spot or futures market, leading to opaque pricing that is more or less based on the whims of brokers as opposed to a clearing price where bids and asks meet. There may be a publicly available reference price, but often it is just a survey of what brokers think it should be.  Tokenizing assets, like metals, enables better price discovery and more accurate pricing because it creates a spot market where one did not previously exist. Blockchains also enable for better tracking across supply chains, verifying the authenticity of collectibles and commodities, limiting counterfeits and hopefully helping holders to better retain and understand the value of their items.  Democratization of access  A lot of illiquid assets are gate kept from all but the select few able to benefit from their price action, leaving those opportunities to a likely well-off group of insiders. Tokenization breaks down these barriers to entry and allows virtually anyone, regardless of background, to gain access to the benefits of investing (even on a fractional basis)  It also opens up fresh new opportunities through the creation of entirely new asset classes that previously did not exist. Remember back during the ICO craze when project founders and “experts” claimed ICOs enabled every and anyone to buy into early stage investments the same way Wall Street insiders are able to access private equity and venture deals? That was largely inaccurate and left many people holding empty bags when their tokens crashed.  Investing in tokens backed by the value of an actual, tangible, real asset ensures that holders at worst case should be able to redeem them for either the actual asset itself or its cash value. Of course, this may require outside audits to verify the authenticity of the underlying assets. But it is a far cry from having blind faith in a white paper or pseudonymous team with virtually no accountability to produce a real product, and should theoretically enable better outcomes than people have realized in ICOs or NFTs.  The next great frontier  People have discussed the tokenization of art and real estate at least for as long as I have been in crypto, since 2015. Most of these projects have yet to gain much traction for a variety of reasons ranging from a lack of interest to a lack of actual RWAs to tokenize. In the past year, the amount of innovation on this front has outpaced all previous years combined.  Sure, tokenizing liquid commodities like gold or silver makes sense as a proof-of-concept to show that assets can be brought on-chain. But, there is a real opportunity to create entirely new markets that unlock access to assets in ways not previously possible.  Take, for example, the idea that buyers of certain commodities cannot hedge against future price movements because they have no spot market enabling the creation of futures. If a spot market is created for that asset, then futures can be created so industries consuming a resource such as cadmium can also more predictably manage costs similarly to how airlines manage jet fuel price volatility to smooth out costs over the long-run.  The opportunity provided by RWA tokenization extends across all spectrums of investors and markets participants and creates an entirely new opportunity that is accessible, transparent and most importantly a significant improvement on putting out an RFP for a resource that can be more efficiently priced on a spot market.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Ryan Gorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/22/next-year-crypto-will-wash-away-the-stains-of-the-ico-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd9379a8e27238a21ad4086f56c3d7ede60cdc07-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This development could become a major talking point as the XRP community continues to clamor about XRP’s tepid price action. Can Ripple Burn Its Escrowed XRP Funds? In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, former Ripple Director Matt Hamilton suggested a way in which Ripple could potentially ‘burn’ its XRP holdings in escrow lockups. He stated that Ripple could disable the master key on the destination account, which usually receives these escrow funds. Related Reading: Solana Headed To $100? Here’s What’s Driving The Growth Hamilton believes that this achieves the same purpose for which tokens are burned, considering that they become inaccessible to anyone when they are released from escrow. His statement formed part of a larger discussion among some members of the XRP community on what to do with the escrowed funds if there was a need to get rid of them. Crypto sleuth Mr. Huber had also weighed in on the discussion as he stated that Ripple can’t burn these escrowed funds as the decision isn’t theirs to make. Ripple will apparently need the approval of validators on the XRP Ledger before they can make such a move. From the discussion, one could see that they were alluding to the escrowed funds possibly being encoded on the XRP Ledger. As such, Ripple will need the permission of these validators to alter the code and burn those funds. However, Hamilton’s comment was more focused on Ripple burning these funds by simply disabling access to the destination account. Bulls maintain control of price | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Ripple Burning Escrowed Funds And Its Significance Ripple burning their escrowed funds is something that could easily pique the interest of the XRP community. This is true, especially considering recent talks about Ripple deliberately suppressing XRP’s price. As such, there could be shouts for Ripple to burn some of these tokens to show its commitment to XRP’s growth. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Eyes $0.00002 As Shibarium Marks Momentous Milestone However, from all indications, this isn’t a straightforward process, and there is no guarantee that it will affect XRP’s price. At some point in the discussion, XRP YouTuber Moon Lambo alluded to the fact that Ripple’s XRP holdings aren’t part of those in the open market. It has also been reported that Ripple’s XRP transactions do not impact prices on crypto exchanges. Therefore, there is the likelihood that Ripple burning their XRP holdings (the escrowed funds in particular) might not impact XRP’s price on the open market. Ripple probably knows this, and that is why they haven’t made such a move. Instead, to provide stability to XRP, they return most of their unlocked tokens to escrow.

42418969,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9cD,1703267093,SEC Blasts 'Purportedly Decentralized' DAOs in $1.7M Settlement with BarnBridge,"Crypto investments issuer BarnBridge DAO and its founders agreed to pay $1.7 million to settle allegations from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it offered illegal crypto securities to U.S. investors.  The Ethereum-based crypto project will shut down its structured crypto investment product, called SMART Yield, which BarnBridge had compared to ""highly rated debt instruments."" Financial regulators said SMART Yield failed to register as an investment company even as it amassed $509 million from crypto investors, including some from the U.S.  While the SEC often comes after crypto companies for purported securities violations, Friday's action is notable because it may be the first targeting a crypto startup that structured itself as a ""decentralized autonomous organization,"" or DAO, in which the DAO held a public vote on how to respond.  DAOs are businesses theoretically beholden to their tokenholders. In BarnBridge's case, anyone who owned its BOND token had a say in operations. Financial startups that fashion themselves as DAOs do not always register as companies. It's even rarer for such entities to view their products as securities that need to be registered with the SEC.  This can prove problematic if their wares are open for U.S. investors, as was the case with BarnBridge. According to the SEC, BarnBridge took no steps to prevent U.S. investors from buying into its SMART Yield product.  It accused Ward and Murray of violating registration requirements and other violations. Both agreed to pay individual civil penalties of $125,000. BarnBridge DAO itself agreed to $1,457,000 in disgorgement to the SEC. In both cases the parties did not admit to or deny the allegations.  The minutia of SEC's allegations against SMART Yield raise questions about its broader stance on DeFi structures such as pools, lending, staking and stabelcoin returns, according to tweets from securites lawyer Drew Hinkes. But the outcome offers no sweeping answers. Because it's a settlement it ""has no precedental value,"" according to Hinkes.  While the SEC has come down hard on crypto firms' alleged violations of U.S. securities law, it is hardly a monolith. Some members of the commission – notably Hester Pierce – have previously written dissents criticizing SEC orders they see as overly burdensome on a burgeoning area of financial innovation.  Pierce filed no such dissent on Friday.  BarnBridge's structure as a DAO found no favor with the SEC, which called it a ""purportedly decentralized autonomous organization.""  In reality, according to the SEC, Murray and Ward were instrumental to the business's day-to-day operations as well as its wonky crypto governance quirks. They held outsize portions of BarnBridge's BOND.  ""Every proposal approved by the DAO needed, and received, Ward and Murray’s votes to reach a quorum,"" the SEC order read.  ""This case serves as an important reminder that those laws apply to all who wish to access our capital markets, regardless of whether they are, or purport to be, incorporated, decentralized or autonomous,"" Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said in a press release.  Regardless of the SEC's opinion, BarnBridge DAO's founders played their governance game to the end. In October they held a vote seeking approval for a settlement with the SEC. They passed it using their own tokens.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/22/sec-blasts-purportedly-decentralized-daos-in-17m-settlement-with-barnbridge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc9df8930e4dc724cc0a0e7cb7ac84f5bb8e9767-5714x3809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s why this break could pave the way for a further rally. Polygon Has Risen By More Than 6% During The Past 24 Hours After topping above the $0.94 mark earlier in the month, MATIC had gone on to register some significant drawdowns. In the last few days, though, the asset appears to have hit a bottom around the $0.75 level, as it hasn’t gone below the mark yet. Related Reading: Analyst Says Polygon (MATIC) On Brink Of Major Move, Here’s Why Something that could add further evidence for this is the fact that bullish momentum has returned for Polygon in the past day, as its price has shot up over 6%. The below chart shows how the cryptocurrency has performed during the past month: Looks like MATIC has sharply risen in the past day | Source: MATICUSD on TradingView With this sharp surge, the cryptocurrency has recovered back above the $0.85 mark. This break could turn out to be significant for Polygon if on-chain data is anything to refer to. MATIC Has Broken Past A Major Resistance Zone With The Latest Surge In a post on X, analyst Ali discussed about how Polygon was about to face a major test of on-chain resistance. When the analyst had made the post, the coin was still trading around the $0.78 mark. Here is a chart that shows how the on-chain support and resistance levels looked like at the time of the post: The different MATIC price ranges based on the density of cost basis | Source: @ali_charts on X In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price range to act as support or resistance depends on the number of coins that the investors purchased inside the particular range. This is because of the fact that holders are more likely to react whenever the price retests their cost basis or acquisition price, as such a retest can flip their profit-loss condition. The more addresses that have their cost basis inside a particular range, the stronger the market reaction when the price retests said range. From the chart, it’s visible that Polygon’s price had been trading just under the $0.79 to $0.84 range at the time Ali had made the post. This range carried the cost basis of around 38,570 addresses, which bought 4.24 billion MATIC at it. Generally, whenever the investors are in a loss (as these holders would have been when MATIC was trading under the range), there is a chance that they sell when the price retests their cost basis since they might get desperate to exit the market and break-even would sound like a good opportunity to do so. Related Reading: XRP Whales Show Exchange Inflow Activity, Bad Sign For Price? As a result of this, price ranges above the spot price that are dense with investors can provide resistance to the cryptocurrency. This had made the aforementioned thick $0.79 to $0.84 range important for Polygon. “For MATIC to embark on a journey to new heights, it’s crucial to break through this level with conviction,” the analyst noted in the post. Following the latest surge, MATIC has clearly surged past this major obstacle. And as is visible in the graph, there aren’t any ranges this difficult to break anymore, either. It now remains to be seen how the Polygon price develops from here, given the lower on-chain resistance at the levels above.

21658061,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566555,1703257219,Here Are The Hottest Altcoins To Buy As The Bull Market Returns – Santiment,"As the bull market returns, market intelligence platform Santiment has provided some insights into altcoins that one should keep an eye on. This comes as other altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are already leading the way on the back of a significant rally from both tokens. Four Altcoins To Keep An Eye On In a post on their X (formerly Twitter) platform, Santiment highlighted ETH, SHIB, FET, and DENT as four altcoins to keep an eye on. These four crypto tokens are said to be seeing their top 10 respective exchange wallets move coins away from exchanges. This usually connotes a long-term bullish signal as it suggests that these wallets are moving the tokens to cold storage. Related Reading: Renewed Hope For Crypto: 2023 Sets The Stage For A Monumental 2024 The timing is also important. Many anticipate that the next bull run is around the corner, while some even say that it has already begun. Whatever the case might be, it is obvious that crypto investors are looking to position themselves ahead of the market boom that lies ahead. As such, the decline of these coins on exchanges could mean that some people are betting big on them. According to further data provided by Santiment, Ether has seen a 4.3% drop in the holdings of these top 10 exchange wallets in the last 3 months. In the same period, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DENT have seen 2.7% and 1.5% drop respectively. Fetch.ai’s FET happens to have been the most significant drop among the four at 26.1%. ETH will undoubtedly be among the altcoins that crypto investors will be keeping an eye on in the next bull run. If certain price predictions are anything to go by, the second-largest crypto token by market cap could be one of the best performers in the next cycle. For one, the Blockchain analytics platform Token Terminal predicts that it will rise to as high as $13,000. Total market cap recovers above$1.62 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Shiba Inu Could Be A Dark Horse From Santiment’s report, it is obvious that crypto investors believe that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could be one of the best-performing tokens in the next bull run. The reason is not farfetched, as the team and community continue to show they are committed to the meme coin’s growth. This is evident in how Shibarium’s utility has increased significantly, which could potentially affect SHIB. Related Reading: Solana Headed To $100? Here’s What’s Driving The Growth Another milestone that can be credited to the team and community is the spike in SHIB burns. Recently, Bitcoinist reported how the SHIB burn rate has spiked by 420%. The majority of these tokens burnt are from transaction fees made on the Shibarium network. The Shiba Inu team had committed to converting some of these fees to SHIB and burning them. The SHIB burn rate will continue to spike, considering that Shibarium’s utility will more likely than not see new highs when the bull market returns. As the meme coin continues to see its circulating supply decline, one can expect its value to rise. Therefore, there is no doubt that SHIB should be one altcoin that many should keep an eye on.

Stacks Network’s native token, STX, had a strong 600% increase in 2023. Stacks is a noteworthy 2019 SEC-qualified token that functions as a layer-2 Bitcoin protocol for smart contracts. Related Reading: BONK Crashes 31% After A Solid Month – Is the Success Story Ending? Stacks Surges: Social Buzz And Growth Stacks has been the talk of the cryptocurrency community lately, receiving a lot of attention on social media. The altcoin’s market value has experienced a notable upswing, having reached a new eight-month high, concomitant with this rise in social volume. STX’s price has increased by more than 30% in the last week, which has been an impressive rise. This increase in social media mentions and the price gain that followed highlight the rising attention and involvement that Stacks is getting, pointing to increased excitement and hope among investors and the cryptocurrency community as a whole. Furthermore, in the last few hours, the Bitcoin scaling solution minted its first STX-20. The inscription caused a spike in network activity that led to a sharp rise in transactions and brief network congestion. STXUSD currently trading at $1.3283 territory. Chart: TradingView.com The upsurge coincided with the excitement surrounding Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20. The average transaction amount experienced a record increase earlier this month, rising from $5 to $7. Because more users were etching non-financial data onto the Bitcoin blockchain, there was an increase in demand for block space, which contributed to the growing transaction costs. The token’s price has been steadily rising for the past month, which has encouraged more social contact among members of the cryptocurrency community. Meanwhile, on-chain data provider Santiment cautioned in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter) that excessive social media activity frequently leads to “fear of missing out” (FOMO) buying. 🗣️ #Solana (+13%), #Stacks (+23%), and #NEARprotocol (+17%) are the top trending assets, according to rising social volumes. In each case, when there is mainstream talk at this level, #FOMO will create price tops. If holding any, take a cautious approach. https://t.co/bb3O2lFJd1 pic.twitter.com/oMnVvAI0ea — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 21, 2023 STX Price Surge Raises Red Flags The emergence of local price peaks is usually the result of this trend, and as the initial euphoria wears off, prices frequently correct quickly. Following a spike in enthusiasm and speculative interest that drives price increases, there follows a correction phase in the market. The Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator for STX shows a growing gap between its upper and lower bands, indicating more volatility following the recent price ascent. Since December 3rd, the Average True Range (ATR) has increased by 140% to reach 0.12, suggesting that there may be notable price swings. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This AI Altcoin Will Hit A Fresh ATH After 300% Rally Due to the spike in demand, STX’s major momentum indicators—the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 80.22 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 71.56—have reached overbought levels, indicating a potential for a short-term price decrease and the probability of buyer exhaustion. Despite an endorsement from billionaire investor Tim Draper, it seems that STX couldn’t leverage this significant support to its fullest potential. In a recent interview with Coin Bureau, Draper designated Stacks as the foremost “showstopper” among crypto projects, highlighting it as the most impactful project he discovered this year. As STX captures attention and climbs to new heights, the unfolding twists in its journey continue to captivate the cryptocurrency space, leaving enthusiasts eager to see what the next chapters hold for this compelling digital asset.

42419000,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDB9B,1703251800,SEC Chair Gary Gensler: 'Far Too Many Frauds and Bankruptcies',"Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to speak with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, recognized by CoinDesk as one of the most influential figures in the crypto industry over the past year, about how he views his agency's role in the digital asset world.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  A business model of noncompliance  The narrative  The crypto industry has its share of bad – or maybe inept – actors. After the past year, that point can't really be argued. I spoke to SEC Chair Gary Gensler earlier this month as part of my reporting for this year's Most Influential series.  Why it matters  The SEC chief and the agency he oversees continue to remain the most prominent regulatory body for the U.S. crypto industry, and with good reason – while crypto companies look for state money transmitter licenses and look to comply with anti-money laundering rules, much of the industry's trading falls within the SEC's bucket (or not, depending on who you ask).  Breaking it down  Crypto's entrepreneurs have ""generally built a business model around noncompliance with the law,"" the SEC chief said.  Gensler, one of the industry's favorite – or perhaps least favorite – foils was recognized by CoinDesk as one of crypto's most influential figures through 2023. In the past year his agency has sued crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, begun reviewing a new slate of spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications and started outlining a (still-untested) pathway for companies to list and trade digital assets in compliance with the agency's vision of how digital assets fit within existing law.  But in Gensler's words, much of his focus is on addressing a field that's rife with fraud and where some companies fail to protect their customers against wash trading or other issues. It's a view he's reiterated a number of times, pointing to the bankruptcies of the past 18 months or so as an example.  While he has ""deep respect for the investing public,"" Gensler told CoinDesk he does not believe crypto investors are receiving appropriate disclosures from the various projects they may be buying tokens for.  There are ""far too many frauds and bankruptcies"" out there, he said.  Read more: Gary Gensler: The Crypto Lightning Rod Who Runs the SEC  Within the crypto remit, Gensler said some of his concerns included companies commingling customer funds (a concern that's shown up in some of the SEC's complaints against crypto companies this year) and trading against their own customers.  The SEC is reviewing a number of outstanding rules that might affect the crypto industry, though he said he wouldn't prejudge them when asked about how he looked at one, as an example.  He highlighted entrepreneurs in the sector a number of times.  ""These entrepreneurs have followings on Reddit, on Medium. It's also 24 hours a day, seven days a week,"" he said.  Gensler also questioned the real value proposition of most of the tokens he sees as crypto securities.  ""If there's a good or service, we can understand that,"" he said. ""What's the value proposition of actually having a decentralized token?""  Many of these projects are just ""speculative investment contracts,"" he said. Even bitcoin, which is widely seen as a commodity, is speculative, he said.  ""[Investors] should be wary, they should be careful, they should be ready to lose 100% of their assets – if you can find a website, if you can read about them in CoinDesk, it's likely that you're making a bet on those entrepreneurs,"" Gensler said.

Latest Prices  Top Stories  Solana’s SOL neared $100 early Friday as hype for the blockchain’s speedy transactions, cheap fees and a lottery of meme coin issuances extended into a third week. Metrics show Solana has possibly been the strongest draw among on-chain traders, with trading volumes and network fees crossing those of Ethereum – which is usually the highest – on a seven-day rolling basis. Value locked on Solana applications grew in tandem, rising to $1.3 billion worth of tokens from November's $400 million to reach levels previously seen in July 2022.

Bitcoin was down slightly on the day.  Hong Kong regulators said they are ready to consider applications for spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

In October, the SFC updated its rule book to allow a broader range of investors to engage in spot-crypto and ETF investing.

21656205,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566554,1703246418,"Solana Flips BNB To Become 4th-Largest Crypto, Is Ethereum Next","Solana has had one of the best price journeys this year, increasing an outstanding 665% since January. The cryptocurrency has particularly done well in the last quarter of the year, registering price gains that were practically absent for the majority of the year. This week, SOL flipped BNB to become the 4th largest cryptocurrency and second-largest altcoin by market cap. At this rate, Ethereum’s spot may be next. Solana’s Impressive Growth Solana’s price movement this year has been nothing but surprising, and it has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. At the same time, Solana’s blockchain has grown in different metrics. The growth can also be simultaneously linked to various airdrops in Solana-based projects and the Solana Saga Phone which gave out 30 million BONK tokens, a Solana meme coin, for each new owner of the phone. As a result, Solana overtook XRP in market cap rankings for the first time ever, with the latter having a 1.82% price decrease in a 7-day timeframe. Related Reading: Renewed Hope For Crypto: 2023 Sets The Stage For A Monumental 2024 Solana’s native token, SOL, recently reached a yearly high of $99, helping the network to also briefly overtake BNB in terms of market cap. According to data from Coinmarketcap, SOL’s 24-hour trading volume increased by over 33% to over $5.86 billion. However, Solana has since undergone a price correction and is now trading at $91. On the other hand, BNB’s price growth has been slow this year, with the crypto only registering a 9% gain in the past 365 days. At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $269, a 22.7% decrease from its yearly high of $348. Solana is now at loggerheads with BNB and it is only a matter of time until it fully overtakes and claims the position of the 2nd largest altcoin. SOL price recovers above $93 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com Can Solana Catch Up With Ethereum? The question now is whether Solana can catch up to Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network. While Ethereum still dominates in the DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts space, Solana is continuing to acquire a growing share of the industry. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Eyes $0.00002 As Shibarium Marks Momentous Milestone In particular, activity on Solana has been on par with Ethereum in the past few weeks, with the chains now rivaling in terms of DEX volume, NFT volumes, active addresses, transaction count, and stablecoin transfers. According to on-chain analytics platform Artemis, total SOL trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached $1.5 billion in the past 24 hours, its highest so far this year. Source: Artemis Solana is currently trading at $91, up by 17% in the past seven days, and is on its way to breaking the $100 price level again. If the current pace of price growth continues, we could see Solana revisiting its current all-time high of $259 in the first half of 2024. However, Solana still has a long way to go to match Ethereum’s network effects and price. Ethereum’s total market cap currently stands at $278.3 billion, $244 billion more than Solana’s $39.4 billion market cap.

21655791,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566557,1703244230,BONK Crashes 31% After A Solid Month – Is the Success Story Ending?,"BONK has encountered a challenging period following its recent peak at an all-time high of $0.00003, which occurred just this past Wednesday. Since reaching this pinnacle, the price has undergone a significant decline, plummeting by more than 50%. This notable downturn has raised concerns within the market, emphasizing the urgency for buyers to re-enter the scene promptly. The next moves by buyers will play a pivotal role in determining the trajectory of BONK’s price action. BONK: Meme Coin’s Price Rollercoaster Ride At the time of writing, the meme coin was trading at $0.000018, down 29% in the last 24 hours, and sustained a significant loss of 30.6 in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This AI Altcoin Will Hit A Fresh ATH After 300% Rally Latest BONK data mirrors a substantial price surge, drawing parallels to the remarkable and sometimes notorious ascents witnessed in other meme coins, such as Shiba Inu. Yet, the chart now reveals the initiation of a descending pattern, with the emergence of red candles signaling a sell-off phase and hinting at the potential conclusion of the BONK narrative. The evolving chart dynamics raise questions about the sustainability of BONK’s earlier success and introduce an air of uncertainty into its once-bullish trajectory. BONKUSD currently trading at $0.0000190336 territory. Chart: TradingView.com This week, Binance announced a notable expansion of BONK trading on its platform by introducing it to Binance Margin. This strategic move followed the earlier listing of BONK on the exchange with three additional pairs, a decision fueled by substantial demand for the meme coin. The introduction of BONK to Binance Margin fueled speculation within the crypto community, with expectations of a potential price boost for the meme coin. However, the unfolding events took an unexpected turn, diverging from the anticipated trajectory. Despite initial speculations, the market dynamics surrounding BONK underwent a different outcome, introducing a layer of unpredictability to its trading journey. BONK seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko As the price approaches the $0.000018 support level once again, the direction that BONK is moving in appears to be bearish. If it starts to decrease, it can soon reach the $0.000014 barrier. RSI Decline Raises Concerns For BONK The RSI on the three-day timeframe has been falling rapidly, going from 98 points in early December to 78 points today as the purchasing momentum has faded and the sell volume is increasing. Remaining bullish would be difficult if this kept up. The chart’s high volatility, which is seen in its large price swings and suggests a struggle between buyers and sellers, is another important component. The market may be losing the sharp rising trend that typified previous rises as the Moving Averages (MAs) begin to flatten out. Source: CoinCodex Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Hits New ATH At $44 – Is $50 Next This Christmas? According to CoinCodex technical indicators, the current sentiment is bullish despite the depressing numbers for BONK, and the Fear & Greed Index is currently displaying 74 (Greed). As for the meme coin, the current price projection indicates a decline to the $ 0.000021 level by December 27, 2023, or a loss of 2.39%. Despite an initially enchanting journey, BONK’s narrative now suggests a fading magic, leaving investors with another dog-themed asset lacking a clear use case. The coin’s future appears to be navigating a cycle where exuberant explosions are followed by significant corrections, echoing the market’s sobering from speculative fervor.

Metrics show Solana has possibly been the strongest draw among on-chain traders, with trading volumes and network fees crossing those of Ethereum – which is usually the highest – on a seven-day rolling basis.  Value locked on Solana applications grew in tandem, rising to $1.3 billion worth of tokens from the $400 million mark in November to reach levels previously seen in July 2022.  These factors have apparently helped extend year-to-date gains for SOL to over 830%, with most growth in the past two months alone. The buying pressure has sustained even amid significant selling pressure from the bankruptcy estate of crypto exchange FTX, which held billions of dollars worth of SOL. The token was trading around $94 during the European morning, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  Dog-themed bonk (BONK) apparently revived attention with a more than 1,000% jump in late November. That inspired a flurry of meme coins, such as dogwifhat (WIF), which yielded some early retail buyers with gains of over 10,000% in a short period.  WIF added another 35% to market capitalization in the past 24 hours alone, showing no signs of stoppage amid significant hype in crypto circles on X.  Data shows thousands of meme coins have since been issued by opportunistic developers. Most of these run up from a very low market capitalization to a few million.  Meanwhile, some analysts expect SOL’s outperformance to continue in the weeks ahead, pointing to the possible interest from retail investors as a driver of token growth.  “Solana is recovering more steadily than most major competitors and shows more interest in it in the community, which promises to keep its performance above the market in the coming months,”  “Google searches on Solana have soared 250% in the past two months,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a Friday note to CoinDesk. “User interest has coincided with the explosive growth of the asset and rising prices of related meme coins.”  “The Solana blockchain continues to grow strongly with the background of new protocols and related airdrops,” Kuptsikevich added, referring to the BONK, ACS and JTO airdrops to Solana users in the past weeks.

Over the past 24 hours, FTM has experienced a notable surge of 9%, propelling its price to the $0.4950 level. This upward momentum has sparked optimism within the market, with the potential to drive FTM towards its yearly high of $0.65. Fantom Poised For Upward Surge? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared insights into the promising outlook for Fantom. Martinez emphasizes that FTM trading above the critical resistance level of $0.47 signifies a significant bullish turning point. Furthermore, the analyst notes that there are no major obstacles in sight until the $0.65 level. As long as FTM remains above this crucial level, Martinez predicts a strong rally for the token. Related Reading: Neon EVM Hits Record-High 730 TPS On Mainnet With FTM’s breakthrough above the $0.47 resistance level, the stage is set for further gains. The absence of significant barriers until the $0.65 mark provides an encouraging backdrop for FTM’s potential upward trajectory. Analyst Ali Martinez’s assessment reinforces the belief that as long as FTM maintains its position above $0.47, investors should prepare for a robust rally in the token’s price. Social Media Buzz Surrounding FTM In recent weeks, Layer 1 (L1) blockchain protocols have taken center stage in the cryptocurrency community. Tokens such as Injective (INJ), Kaspa (KAS), Avalanche (AVAX), and Solana (SOL) have outperformed major cryptocurrencies. However, amid this L1 surge, Alpha Scan highlights that Fantom has emerged with impressive sentiment strength, capturing the attention of market participants and further bolstering the protocol’s native token price surge. According to a recent post on X (formerly Twitter) by the sentiment analytics firm, an analysis of social media conversations reveals that a staggering 61% of all monthly mentions of FTM have occurred within the last seven days. This sudden surge in mentions commenced on December 9th, indicating a heightened interest and positive sentiment surrounding the token. Over the past 30 days, 28 key accounts have actively discussed FTM, further emphasizing its growing significance. Notably, 20 of these key accounts have specifically highlighted FTM within the last seven days, reflecting a heightened level of attention and engagement within a relatively short period. This ratio of key account engagement during the past week indicates a distinct rise in interest and potential market influence. Annualized Increase Reinforces Positive Outlook According to Token Terminal data, in addition to the social media buzz surrounding the protocol and its native token, Fantom’s market capitalization has reached approximately $1.38 billion, with a remarkable increase of 18.47%. This surge reflects the growing demand for FTM and its expanding market presence. In terms of revenue, the token has witnessed substantial growth, with a 30-day revenue increase of 734.11% to $171.73k. Moreover, the annualized revenue has surged to $2.09 million, representing a significant rise of 813.75%. Related Reading: Matrixport Foresees Bitcoin Hitting $50,000 Price Mark: Here’s When Moreover, Fantom’s fully diluted market capitalization stands at around $1.57 billion, indicating a substantial increase of 43.39%. This growth further reinforces the market’s confidence in the protocol’s prospects. When considering performance ratios, the P/F ratio (fully diluted) is calculated at 203.80x, while the P/S ratio (fully diluted) is reported at 679.33x. Although both ratios have dipped by 82.8%, they still suggest a strong valuation for Fantom relative to its performance.

21648370,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566422,1703203237,XRP Price Forecast: Wave 5 Signals Impending Supercharged Growth To $13 By 2024,"XRP price has recently demonstrated a sideways price action, deviating from the overall trend witnessed across the cryptocurrency market and altcoins. Despite a modest 2% growth in the past 30 days, with prices ranging between $0.6427 and $0.5994, a crypto analyst operating under the pseudonym James Crypto has made a bold prediction based on Elliott Wave Theory’s interpretation of XRP’s monthly chart. Grand 5th Wave And Potential Rally For XRP Price James Crypto points to an intriguing possibility of XRP price entering a grand 5th wave, drawing attention to the extended durations of Wave 1 and Wave 3. The Elliott Wave Theory, developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, is a technical analysis tool widely used to forecast future price movements in financial markets. The theory suggests that price movements unfold in recurring wave patterns, which can provide insights into potential future trends. According to the theory, a complete market cycle consists of five waves, with three impulse waves (1, 3, and 5) and two corrective waves (2 and 4). The fifth and final wave is often associated with a significant price surge before a potential reversal or consolidation. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Eyes $0.00002 As Shibarium Marks Momentous Milestone James Crypto’s analysis focuses on XRP’s monthly chart, which provides a broader perspective on the asset’s price movements. The extended duration of Wave 1 (20 weeks) and Wave 3 (spanning over 40 weeks) caught the analyst’s attention. By extrapolating this trend, the theory suggests the possibility of a 60-week Wave 5, which could mark a substantial price rally for XRP. Should XRP price follow the projected Elliott Wave pattern, James Crypto’s forecast points to a supercycle top expected to occur in March to April 2024. The target price range for XRP during this period is estimated to be between $5 and $13. Struggles Amidst Price Declines Trading at $0.6147, XRP has experienced a decline of 0.5%, 1.4%, and 4.3% over the past 24 hours, seven days, and fourteen days, respectively. These downward trends highlight the token’s current lack of bullish momentum and catalyst. CoinGlass’ liquidation heatmap indicates a critical juncture for XRP’s price, as significant leveraged positions exist on both sides of the market. The heatmap reveals notable liquidations at the $0.6284 and $0.6347 levels, with the largest amount observed at $0.5960 over the past three days. Considering these developments, XRP may initially break through the long liquidation level before experiencing another upward movement to bolster much-needed bullish momentum. However, given the unpredictable nature of volatility and price actions, a short squeeze could potentially occur first, temporarily driving the XRP price above its nearest resistance levels. Related Reading: Renewed Hope For Crypto: 2023 Sets The Stage For A Monumental 2024 The outcome remains uncertain as to which side will yield first and what additional catalysts may contribute to a price surge for XRP, aligning it with the overall market trend of gains as we approach the end of the year.
