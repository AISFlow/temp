42423963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iu1h,1641252663,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Slips Under $46K as Volume Across Major Centralized Exchanges Remains Low,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves:  Bitcoin opened lower on the first trading day of the year in U.S. equities markets, while the stock market gained with Apple briefly hitting a $3 trillion market capitalization.  Technician’s take: Price indicators suggest limited downside for BTC over the short term as selling pressure slows.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,343 -2.29%  Ether (ETH): $3,755 -1.84$  Markets  S&P 500: 4,796 +0.64$  DJIA: 36,5856 +0.68%  Nasdaq: 15,832 +1.2%  Gold: $$1,803 -1.38%  Market moves  Bitcoin, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, was trading below $46,000 at the time of writing, down by nearly 3% in the past 24 hours.  “It’s pretty much been choppy since that big drop in the beginning of December,” Andrew Tu, business development manager at crypto quant trading firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Bitcoin has “been ranging $46,000-$51,000 for a month or so now… most of major [tokens] have been following the trend.”  Bitcoin’s spot trading volume across major centralized exchanges remained low on Monday, nowhere near its pre-holiday levels, based on data compiled by CoinDesk.  An “absence of trading activity is likely to be one of the reasons for the overall crypto market’s “bearish pullback” over the past week, according to crypto trading data firm Kaiko.  While bitcoin is viewed by some market participants as “a risk-on asset” similar to stocks, the S&P 500 opened its first trading day of the year higher, with electric car maker Tesla’s stock skyrocketing and Apple’s market capitalization briefly touching $3 trillion.  Risk-on refers to a situation where investors are willing to invest in assets with higher risks like equities, commodities and currencies. That typically happens when the economy is expected to fare well. But according to Wall Street Journal, Monday’s stock rally is also associated with the new year as stocks tend to rally at the start of new calendar periods due to “new money” like pension funds that invest when a new period starts.  Efficient Frontier’s Tu said “macro uncertainty” remains the main factor of bitcoin’s choppy move. The Federal Reserve in the U.S. in December signaled three interest rate hikes in 2022 and said it will move faster to wind down its bond purchases in response to elevated inflation pressures.  As CoinDesk reported, a tightened monetary policy is typically considered as bearish for assets, bitcoin included.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Stuck in Range Between $45K Support and $52K Resistance  Bitcoin is off to a slow start as traders ring in the new year. The cryptocurrency is down about 8% over the past week as demand from buyers slowed. The current price of around $46,000 is near the bottom of a two week-long price range, which previously led to higher bids for BTC.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from an oversold level reached on Dec. 10. That suggests selling pressure is starting to wane, especially as downside exhaustion signals appeared on the daily chart for the first time since July.  BTC will need to return above its 200-day moving average, currently at $47,962, to yield further upside targets. The next level of resistance is seen at around $52,000, which could limit short-term gains.

42423952,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2itfh,1641250483,Boston Fed Is Hiring New Director for CBDC Project,"The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is on the hunt for a new director of product management for Project Hamilton, its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program.  The director will work to “forward the Federal Reserve System’s efforts to build, manage and test software to further its understandings of digital currency … [and] continue our efforts to build a hypothetical general purpose digital currency,” according to an online job posting.  In partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Digital Currency Initiative, the Boston Fed has been researching CBDC technology since August 2020.  The project was initially slated to run two to three years. In September, Boston Fed senior vice president Jim Cunha said the project’s initial stages were “basically done,” but the search for a new director signals that the work isn’t over.  Alongside Project Hamilton, the Digital Dollar Project – led by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo – is a private-sector effort to promote a U.S. CBDC.  The Digital Dollar Project recently hired a new executive to lead its upcoming CBDC pilot programs. In October, Jennifer Brooks Lassiter – a founding member of the Innovation Lab at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) – was appointed as the project’s executive director.  Lassiter told CoinDesk that she sees the expansion of Project Hamilton as an encouraging sign for CBDC research in the United States.  “We are on the path towards an intentional, thoughtful process for consideration of a U.S. CBDC,” Lassiter said.  But progress is slow going, especially when compared with the research and implementation of CBDCs outside of the United States, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been reticent about the Fed’s stance on whether it intends to issue a CBDC.  As private stablecoins like tether and USD Coin continue to grow in popularity, many on Capitol Hill have raised concerns about their financial backing. Others have expressed doubts about whether private stablecoins and CBDCs can coexist.  UPDATE (Jan. 4, 15:24 UTC): Added more detail about the Digital Dollar Project and comment from Lassiter.

In 2022, bitcoin will reach $100,000 and two more countries will adopt the digital asset as legal tender, Bukele tweeted on Sunday, adding that the cryptocurrency will also become a major issue in the U.S. midterm elections to be held on Nov. 8.  El Salvador embraced bitcoin as legal tender in September last year, venturing into uncharted waters and drawing the ire of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Bukele went a step further in November, announcing plans to issue a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” with a 10-year maturity on the Liquid Network. Half of the proceeds from the bond issue will fund the construction of a new ”Bitcoin City” along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano.  According to Blockstream projections, the annualized yield offered by the bond could reach as high as 146% in the 10th year, subject to bitcoin rallying to $1 million in the next five years – a somewhat farfetched target given that the cryptocurrency is currently trading around $47,000, having peaked near $69,000. El Salvador has been a consistent buyer of the dip, a sign of confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term price prospects.  While bitcoin rallied nearly 60% in 2021, outperforming traditional assets by a significant margin, the widely-anticipated price target of $100,000 remained elusive, thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish shift and broad-based risk aversion in financial markets in November and December.  While Bukele expects bitcoin to regain its mojo this year, some observers foresee the cryptocurrency underperforming coins associated with layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom and Solana.  Singapore-based QCP Capital recommended diversification out of bitcoin and into as basket of layer 1 coins as one of the trades for 2022.  According to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Funds, thematic investing is expected to drive most gains in 2022. “From an investment standpoint, Arca remains thematically focused on DeFi, sports and entertainment as it pertains to fan engagement, gaming and NFTs, and Web 3,” Dorman said in a blog post published on Dec. 22.  “As institutional capital enters the market in an exponential fashion, the marginal buyer will far outpace the marginal seller,” Dorman added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/03/salvadoran-president-bukele-expects-bitcoin-to-reach-100k-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92325606aa4e0e1746f1af7c47060d6fbf7677ea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new stadium will have a seating capacity of 50,000, Bukele said in the tweet. It will be built in the current location of the country’s military school in Santa Tecla, which will be rebuilt elsewhere and have twice the capacity it has now. Bukele telegraphed the announcement in an earlier tweet.  In September, El Salvador became the first – and so far only – country to designate bitcoin legal tender. “We must break the paradigms of the past,” Bukele said at the time. “El Salvador has the right to move toward the First World.”  The decision has been criticized.

42421214,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrhV,1641245728,Garry Kasparov: Crypto Means Freedom,"Garry Kasparov knows math. He knows logic, strategy and decision-making. Widely regarded as the greatest chess player in the history of mankind, the Russian grandmaster – ranked No. 1 from 1984 to 2005 – sees the world with a certain clarity.  So it will delight many in the blockchain industry to learn that Kasparov, easily one of the smartest people alive, is now a champion of cryptocurrency. And it’s partly because of math. Kasparov has spent his “retirement” opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin (a defiance that once got him tossed in jail), fighting for humanitarian causes and serving as chairman of the Human Rights Foundation (a nonprofit that strongly supports bitcoin as a freedom-giving tool). Now he views crypto as a way to check government power. Bitcoin offers protection against rampant government spending, says Kasparov, “because you’re protected by math” – by the logic of the code itself.  Read more: Jeff Wilser –Mobile Bitcoin Gaming Is Powering Up on Lightning  Kasparov also sees merit in non-fungible tokens. In December, in partnership with 1Kind, he dropped a series of 32 NFTs that showcase iconic moments from his life: the 1985 match that crowned him as the youngest world chess champion, the epic battle against International Business Machines’ artificial intelligence-powered “Deep Blue” and speeches against totalitarian governments.  It’s this battle against totalitarianism that has defined the current chapter of his life, and Kasparov sees crypto as part of that struggle. Or as the grandmaster puts it, “I believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity.”  This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  CoinDesk: How’d you get into the crypto space?  Kasparov: If you followed my career and read about my early interest in computers and technology, you should not be surprised that I was very excited when I recognized the value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.  This goes all the way back to the ‘80s; I always tried to be at the cutting edge. It started with chess. But I also saw an opportunity to use computers and new tools to advance individual freedoms. It’s my belief that technology should help people fight back against the power of the state.  How do cryptocurrencies fit into that?  Cryptocurrencies become an inseparable part of or progress, because the whole world is moving digital. And if the economy becomes more digital, so does the money. Another philosophical reason is that … governments [have] unlimited opportunities to print money. And printing money is the most exquisite form of borrowing from us and from future generations.  And I believe that cryptocurrencies – with bitcoin as a standard – offer a protection against this onslaught of the government, because you’re protected by math. You’re protected by the limited number of any code behind the respective currency. Cryptocurrencies, and all the products related to cryptocurrencies, are absolutely vital for the future development of our world.  How, specifically, did you first get involved?  My first indirect involvement was through the Human Rights Foundation. Because in the Human Rights Foundation, we had a few experts that have been advocating cryptocurrencies at a very early stage. And as an organization, we offer support to the dissidents around the world.  We thought about using crypto as a way to help them to get material help, because in many countries it was impossible – and it’s still impossible – to actually get proper funding. So crypto offered an opportunity to support these activists indirectly. And the more I learned about it, the more interested I got in the whole mechanism.  Can you elaborate on why this is important to you?  Look, crypto is a controversial thing. Because you hear a lot of people say, “Oh, that’s money laundering. That helps bad guys.” True. I mean, no technology is uniquely good, because it’s technology. Humans still have a monopoly for evil.  So, I’ve been doing a lot of talks about it, and I’ll say, “Look, it’s not the magic wand or the terminator. It’s not a harbinger of utopia or dystopia. It’s a tool.” Crypto is a tool. And of course it could benefit some bad guys with maligned intentions. But it’s about the balance, it’s about trade-offs. And I think the balance is so much in favor of progress.  It’s like the dot-com bubble. 99.9% will be gone. But those that survive will become the Googles of the world.  You mentioned crypto’s ability to help protect human rights in undemocratic countries. What do you see as the benefits in democratic countries?  In the democratic countries in America and Europe, trillions of dollars will be printed. I’m an American taxpayer. And I understand that you need to build new infrastructure. But I’m not happy to see that the government has a free hand to use my taxes, basically to devalue [the dollar].  So I think it’s very important that technology would offer me an opportunity to fight back, to protect my hard-earned fortune. And I think that bitcoin – which I believe is online gold – and other cryptocurrencies are the way to the future. I’m not a financial expert, but I would not be surprised if, I would not be surprised if, in 10 years’ time, the dollar will be replaced by the basket of coins as a standard.  I’m guessing it’s safe to say you own bitcoin?  I’m a great believer in the future of coins.  I suppose if you believe that, then it would almost be foolish not to be buying Bitcoin?  Yes.  Thoughts on the future of bitcoin?  Well, I think bitcoin will remain as a standard. But of course it cannot stay alone. So that’s why you have more coins coming in. It’s a natural process. Now we have thousands and thousands of coins. It’s like the dot-com bubble. Ninety-nine point nine percent will be gone. But those that survive will become the Googles of the world. I’m not here to judge which one, but there will be few that will survive – that’s why I said basket of coins.  In the past, your championing of human rights has gotten you in trouble with the Russian authorities. Given that background, are you concerned that your support for cryptocurrency can get you in hot water?  Well, this is definitely a no. [In the past,] I was in hot water. To give you an idea, one of the NFTs is a picture of my first arrest in Russia. So it’s all reflected in my NFT. Look, this is much less perilous than to attack Putin directly.  I grew up in the Soviet Union, and learned from my mother and my teacher the motto of Soviet dissidents, “Do what you must, and so be it.” And I believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity. And, again, I [view it] as a much less risky endeavor than speaking publicly about Putin or other dictators.  Read more: Most Influential 2021: Sam Bankman-Fried - Jeff Wilser  How would you describe your NFT project?  I don’t pretend to be a great expert in NFTs, but I’m not aware of anything similar that exists. It’s a collection of 30-plus NFTs that are related to special events in my life and special people in my life. This is a story that connects you to very personal moments. Every NFT has a video message.  It’s all connected to the physical assets, like my notebooks from the ‘70s. Thanks to my late mother, who preserved this archive, you can actually look at me scribbling in 1973.  The NFTs all reflect the moments of me growing up, learning from my mother, and from my teachers, and then fighting for the title, and then shifting my life and moving into human rights and computers.  Interesting. This feels almost like a memoir, in a sense. I’ve worked with CEOs before to collaborate on their memoirs, and one thing I’ve found is that the process can almost be emotional, or even a bit therapeutic. Did you have any sense of that?  The whole story starts from a very emotional moment, though it’s a tragic one. My mother died on Christmas day last year, from COVID. And I couldn’t be next to her, and that was a really big blow because we were so close.  While she was alive, I didn’t even know that she preserved all these archives. She was not happy to talk about the past. That’s why I [held off] on any major publication that would highlight [the past]. I wrote two books, but not the one that could tell everything.  After she died, I thought it would be right for me [to honor] her memory to actually start doing things. I’m doing a documentary now; it’s in Russian. The first segment will be ready early next year. And I hope I can cover my entire chess career, and it’s for her. It’s dedicated for her. And this [NFT] project was inspired by this tragedy. I thought it was very important to show my personal life and her connection, and why she was so important.  And so I spoke to 1Kind, and 10% of the sales will go to Kasparov Chess Foundation, and this will be a scholarship under her name for all the great talents raised by single mothers.  Amazing.

42411589,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzTe,1641244451,Ape Theft Is an Expensive Way to Learn About Crypto’s Security Philosophy,"Last week, an NFT trader named Todd Kramer made a simple plea on Twitter.  “I been hacked,” he wrote. “All my apes gone. This just sold please help me.”  Kramer was referring to his cache of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs (non-fungible tokens) – now the single most valuable franchise of crypto collectibles. They’ll run you about $276,000, at the cheapest, and Kramer had eight of them, along with seven from a spin-off collection called the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, before his tokens were siphoned away in a phishing scam.  Almost immediately, Kramer’s “apes gone” post went viral.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  NFTs already have a terrible reputation among the non-crypto crowd (which is to say, most people), thanks to their fraught relationship with the concept of “digital property rights” and the environmental impact of proof-of-work blockchains like Ethereum. More than a few brands have reneged on planned NFT drops after facing intense backlash on social media.  And while it’s not exactly surprising that the anti-NFT crowd would find a little schadenfreude in Kramer’s tweet, what’s more so is that crypto’s true believers – the kinds of people who are already immersed in NFTs – were equally derisive.  That’s because the culture of crypto places an outsize emphasis on personal responsibility. One of the nice things about banks and other centralized financial institutions is that they’re required to take certain steps to protect your money. Those protections can come in the form of deposit insurance and fraud protection, but also little security features like “forgotten password” mechanisms.  So-called “unhosted” crypto wallets like MetaMask ask users to keep track of their own private keys; if you lose them, there’s no way of getting them back. “Not your keys, not your coins,” goes one longtime crypto mantra.  There’s something inherently silly about having a significant chunk of your net worth (Kramer claims it was around $2.2 million) tied up in illiquid JPEG files. But for me, the “apes gone” controversy mostly speaks to a kind of widespread hypocrisy in the NFT market.  The billionaire Mark Cuban, who spent the first half of last year breathlessly championing DeFi (“decentralized finance”) programs and pumping his crypto investments in appearances on major TV news networks, made a similar plea last summer after some of his holdings went to zero. In a statement to Bloomberg, Cuban explicitly called for greater regulation of the crypto space. He was a lot quieter in the second half of the year.  Consumer protection laws, though they’re never perfectly conceived or enforced, exist for a reason. Saturated, unregulated markets like crypto are natural targets for scammers, and even the savviest traders can lose millions with a stray click.  OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, was able to halt trading on the stolen assets and flag them as having been involved in a scam. But because OpenSea is mostly just a front-end trading interface, and Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs are hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, the company couldn’t actually return any of the tokens.  See also: NFT Forgeries Aren’t Going Away | The Node  He did get some of them back, though. And ironically, the Twitter users dunking on Kramer may have played a crucial role, amplifying Kramer’s plea and rallying members of the Bored Ape community to help retrieve the tokens.  Kramer isn’t the first trader to lose his Bored Apes to a phishing scam. Another NFT enthusiast, Calvin Becerra, made a similar splash on Twitter after losing three tokens in November. He even wrote a note to the apes’ captors, asking to work out a deal for their safe return (he also listed the note as an NFT, naturally).  Accepting decentralized infrastructure means accepting these risks. If you’re going to advocate for a new, independent financial system – one without regulation, fraud protections and many of the other safeguards that help people hang onto their money – then there’s no point in appealing to centralized mediators when the system starts to work against you.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/03/ape-theft-is-an-expensive-way-to-learn-about-cryptos-security-philosophy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b1cee2174c71eb812bc40ea4287b3e4d463309-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bullish sentiment appears to be low despite bitcoin marking its 13th birthday. On Jan. 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block, the Genesis Block, which marked the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain.  For now, technical indicators suggest nearby support could encourage short-term buying activity. Still, long-term momentum has slowed, which could point to low or negative crypto returns this month.  Some analysts are monitoring blockchain data for clues on BTC’s future price direction. For example, net exchange flows have increased recently, signaling a bearish shift in investor sentiment similar to the one seen before the price crash last May.  Other metrics, however, show improvements that could boost overall market sentiment.  The Bitcoin blockchain’s hashrate set new highs on Sunday night after crossing previous highs from mid-2021.

42375594,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9FsJ,1641243905,LinksDAO NFT Sale Books First $10M Toward Buying an Actual Golf Course,"Country clubs and NFTs collided Sunday when LinksDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, became one step closer to buying its own crowdfunded golf course.  The DAO successfully sold out of its debut collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), raising $10.5 million to fund the project’s operations. Further capital will have to be raised to buy the actual golf course, said project lead Mike Dudas.  LinksDAO, of course, comes in the wake of ConstitutionDAO, a crypto-enthused group that raised over $40 million in ETH to purchase an original copy of the U.S. Constitution in November.  While the ConstitutionDAO effort ultimately failed, its PEOPLE token lives on with a market cap north of $600 million, netting initial investors some serious gains and spawning spin-off efforts hoping to learn from its mistakes. (As for PEOPLE, it exists as a governance token with nothing to govern.)  Wen token?  In addition to the completed NFT sales, LinksDAO says it will launch a LINKS governance token soon.  “I’m not able to promise a specific date, but the goal is to launch the governance token as early in 2022 as possible,” said Dudas, a staffer at blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos and the founder and former CEO of crypto media outlet The Block. “We need to do it in a compliant way and one where the token distribution and governing rights are such that we can ensure broad participation in governance.”  Governance tokens are used to determine influence and power within DAOs. Holders of LINKS (not to be confused with Chainlink’s LINK token) could decide the geographic location of the proposed golf club, vote on proposals related to the project or simply resell their tokens on the open market – as many did with ConstitutionDAO’s PEOPLE token when the project itself was promptly scuttled.  Holders of either of LinksDAO’s two NFTs are expected to receive an allocation of LINKS, with holders of the higher-tier “Global Membership” receiving four times the number of tokens awarded to the lower-tier “Leisure Membership.”  “We aim to show that literally anything is possible when you have a passionate group of people who move with inspiration and conviction at exceptional speed,” said Dudas. “We hope it shows sports communities that folks in crypto have passion, new ideas, capital and conviction to create new models of membership, fun and participation.”  A DAO for golfers  LinksDAO’s mission is to “create the modern golf and leisure club” and “reimagine the country club,” offering a sports-centric experiment amid a burgeoning DAO ecosystem.  “We were looking at Gary Vaynerchuk’s Flyfish Club model – purchase an NFT to join the membership club at a restaurant – and had recently seen the ConstitutionDAO model of collective organization and funding of a common goal,” Dudas told CoinDesk.  “We thought that we could combine the best of both of those initiatives into something really large and special, creating the world’s best golf and leisure club,” he said.  The group’s vision comes as DAOs increasingly eye real-world assets, thinking up creative projects to onboard first-time crypto users. It also draws from NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club, which have proven that inclusion in an exclusive community is a winning value-add.  Since launch, LinksDAO has built a fervent following on social media, raking up over 16,000 followers on Twitter and almost 12,000 members in its Discord chat.  Membership NFTs  On Sunday evening, the public minting of LinksDAO’s two NFTs – the Leisure Membership and Global Membership – sold out in mere hours, generating $10.5 million in funds from a collection of 9,090 NFTs. (LinksDAO held back 10% of its NFTs at auction. The group plans to use the reserve NFTs for giveaways and to build partnerships with incumbent golf organizations and athletes.)  LinksDAO says buying the NFTs would provide their holders exclusive perks, such as the right to purchase a membership at the first physical club LinksDAO acquires, discounts on golf tee times and access to members-only Discord channels, including guest appearances by golf, business and celebrity luminaries.  The higher-tier Global Membership would have all the benefits of the Leisure Membership, as well as the right to purchase one additional membership at the first physical LinksDAO club, and four times the governance rights via a prospective token drop, among other additional perks.  While the geographic location of the course will ultimately be decided by a vote of its token holders, a representative told CoinDesk the preliminary interest is largely concentrated in the greater New York and Miami areas.  At mint, Leisure Memberships sold for 0.18 ETH (approximately $676) and Global Memberships sold for 0.72 ETH (approximately $2,703).  As of Monday afternoon, the NFTs were trading on secondary marketplace OpenSea at a floor price of 0.3 ETH (approximately $1,126) for the Leisure Membership and 0.89 ETH (approximately $3,341) for the Global Membership.  Since launch, the project has generated over 875 ETH (approximately $3.3 million) in sales volume on OpenSea, with 7.5% of trading volume royalties awarded back to the LinksDAO treasury.  ‘We are buying a golf club’  The first and perhaps largest challenge for LinksDAO is raising the funds to purchase a PGA-certified golf course, which can run upwards of tens of millions, before even factoring in operational costs.  “It is not cheap to buy and operate a world-class golf operation,” said Dudas. “To do so, we will absolutely need additional funding.”  If it succeeds, LinksDAO will also need to do some clever accounting.  DAOs may not hold traditional assets such as real estate or corporations for compliance reasons. The group is currently in talks with legal experts to create a separate operating entity called LinksDAO Inc., which will own the physical asset as well as serve as the day-to-day operating company for the prospective golf course.  LinksDAO’s inability to skirt centralization speaks to an issue many DAOs have faced – their fundraising ability often dwarfs their operational capacity.  Pending legal nuances, LinksDAO also plans to give its DAO members the first opportunity to purchase into the operating company. If realized, some NFT purchasers could ostensibly receive equity ownership of a physical golf course and receive cash flows from the operation.  The group has floated the idea of turning to traditional capital markets to fund its prospective purchase, such as private equity and venture capital firms.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | PEOPLE,"Tracy Wang, Eli Tan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/03/linksdao-nft-sale-books-first-10m-toward-buying-an-actual-golf-course,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78391ce5c17be4c00144055f8631474359b5a700-5472x3078.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CFTC announced the penalties as part of a settlement with Polymarket on Monday, ordering the company (the operating name for Blockratize Inc.) to wind down all of its markets because it didn’t seek a Designated Contract Market (DCM) or Swap Execution Facility (SEF) registration, two requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act for companies offering binary options in the U.S.  Polymarket is a crypto betting service that allows users to pick one of at least two options on given trades, such as who might win the 2020 presidential election. According to the order published by the CFTC, Polymarket offered at least 900 such markets over the last 18 months.  These markets are swaps under federal law.  Polymarket cooperated with the investigation, according the CFTC’s press release, leading to a reduced fine. The company will stop offering markets by Jan. 14 and commit to making all funds available to users by Jan. 24, according to the order. Polymarket will also cease and desist any further violations of the CEA, though it doesn’t appear the company itself will be shut down.  In a statement, Vincent McGonagle, the CFTC’s acting enforcement director, said that “all derivatives markets must operate within the bounds of the law regardless of the technology used, and particularly including those in the so-called decentralized finance or ‘DeFi’ space.”  Bloomberg reported that Polymarket was under investigation in October. However, now-former CFTC Commissioner Dan Berkovitz said in June 2021 that in his view, decentralized finance (DeFi) markets for derivatives would fall under his agency’s purview.  “The CEA does not contain any exception from registration for digital currencies, blockchains or smart contracts,” he said.  In a statement sent by an external spokesperson, Polymarket said it would wind down three markets and offer refunds to its users by the Jan. 14 deadline. The company plans to share more information in the future about its plans.  “We have been encouraged by our learnings through this experience and have built out an exceptional compliance team and robust internal practices and procedures, which will ensure that compliance remains an integral pillar of Polymarket’s global business going forward,” the statement said.

Bitcoin Whales Now Account For 90% Of Inflow To Exchanges As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the exchange whale ratio has risen above 0.9, implying that dumping may be going on in the market. The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the total Bitcoin amount of top 10 transactions to exchanges and the total inflows. In simpler terms, the metric tells us how the ten largest transactions to exchanges compare with the total amount of coins moving to exchanges. When the indicator has values lower than 0.85, it means that the ten largest transactions to exchanges (which are assumed to belong to whales) make up for less than 85% of the total Bitcoin inflow amount. Such values have been historically healthy for the market. On the other hand, when the metric reaches high values, it implies the top ten transactions make up for most of the inflows to exchanges. Investors usually move their Bitcoin to exchanges for selling purposes. So, this trend may show that whales are currently dumping as they are moving vast amounts of coins to exchanges.

42375602,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9G3d,1641236365,Bitcoin Whales Were Active on Coinbase Amid a Quiet Holiday Week,"Just like the 24/7 crypto market, some traders, especially some whales, did not take last week off for the holidays.  While overall trading volume was lower last week, some traders executed large bitcoin trades on crypto exchange Coinbase, according to crypto trading data firm Kaiko, causing a spike in overall bitcoin trading activity on the exchange.  Among those trades, the most notable one was executed on Dec. 30, which turned bitcoin’s prices temporarily bullish for the day. By charting the second-by-second volume of buy versus sell orders for all trades greater than five bitcoin, Kaiko found a large concentration of such buy orders on Dec. 30, with Coinbase’s market share of bitcoin spot volume among major crypto exchanges jumping from 45% to 68%.  This is abnormal, according to Clara Medalie, strategic initiatives and research director at Kaiko. She pointed out that Coinbase “never” had such a high market share of volume. During normal market circumstances, exchanges keep a relatively steady market share day-to-day.  “Prices had been low this [past] December, which could be one reason the trader sought to make a large buy order now rather than wait,” Medalie told CoinDesk via an email.  According to data from TradingView and Coinbase, the price of the BTC/USD trading pair rose 1.4% on Dec. 30 after dipping to $46,094.02 from $52,100 over the previous three days.  Traders who usually conduct large-volume transactions may choose to split their orders into smaller sizes over a longer period of time to avoid price slippage or potentially impacting the spot price, as CoinDesk reported previously. Business intelligence software company MicroStrategy, for example, reported that it bought 1,914 bitcoins between Dec. 9 and Dec. 29 for about $94.2 million in cash.  Medalie said that Coinbase’s high liquidity could be one of the reasons why the trader, or group of traders, chose to conduct this trade on the exchange.  “Coinbase works with many large investors through their professional execution services, and they often source liquidity directly from their professional exchange order book,” Medalie noted.  But following the big buys, both large buy and sell orders for bitcoin were placed on Coinbase right before the expiry of bitcoin’s options contract on Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, on the other hand, sell orders with more than five bitcoin dominated Coinbase’s BTC/USD trading pair volume. These large trades, however, did not cause any spikes in Coinbase’s spot market share, according to Kaiko’s Medalie, meaning that similar activity was taking place on other exchanges over the same time period.  It is unknown why there was increased whale selling activity on exchanges on Jan. 1, but it is not uncommon to see more trading activity before the expiration of options contracts.  In Coinbase Institutional’s last weekly market newsletter in 2021 dated Dec. 24, it warned about the risks of low liquidity during the holidays that could see the convergence of the spot price towards a maximum pain price.  This convergence price move trend usually comes from spot market manipulations by option sellers (mostly institutional traders) to push the spot price closer to the strike price at which the highest number of open options contracts expire worthlessly. That creates maximum losses – so-called max pain – for option buyers. The max pain point for last Friday’s option expiration was at $48,000 as of Dec. 28, according to Cayman Islands-based crypto financial services firm Blofin.  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $46,473.73, down 1.07% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk price data.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/03/bitcoin-whales-were-active-on-coinbase-amidst-a-quiet-holiday-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9dafe16ba0657a8c31a0378cf32b079d7622cac3-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new court motion accuses Earnity of hiding its ties to Cred in order to steal intellectual property.  In a motion to compel filed last week with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the trust acting in the interest of Cred lenders said that former Cred executives “secretly conspired” to form Earnity. The new DeFi company, under its beneficial owner Dominic Carosa, then purchased Cred’s electronics, computers and other assets from the trust without disclosing its ties to Cred.  When the trust learned of the connection, Earnity was subpoenaed but only provided a list of Cred employees currently working at the company and one consulting contract.  The trust is investigating whether the former Cred execs “smuggled” intellectual property (IP) to Earnity and then covered the theft with the electronics purchase. The trust has the legal right to all of Cred’s IP.  The trust is asking the court to force Earnity to comply with the subpoenas for additional information and wants financial reimbursement for the related legal costs.  A lawyer for Earnity denied the trust’s claims.  “The assertions made against Earnity are categorically false and designed to extract money from what was a simple hiring of former Cred talent,” said Daniel M. Glassman, an attorney at K&L Gates LLP. “Earnity has a completely different business model and IP that remains entirely unrelated to Cred and will continue to cooperate transparently with the Bankruptcy Court.”  When Cred filed for bankruptcy, the company primarily blamed alleged fraud by an outside investment manager who was entrusted with 800 bitcoin. Former Cred employees, however, told CoinDesk the company was also hurt by a soured $39 million credit line that was extended to a Chinese lender at the behest of Cred CEO Dan Schatt.  In early December, Earnity announced it had raised $15 million in a funding round led by bitcoin mining company BitNile to launch a curated financial marketplace for tokens.

42411594,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOznU,1641229072,Web 3.0 Is Too Complicated,"One of the most important goals and benefits of the Web 3.0 revolution is for the world’s information technology ecosystems to re-decentralize. The internet, when it started, was a highly decentralized system. Centralized systems have, in time, layered themselves very successfully across this decentralized ecosystem.  The economics of the software business and the power of network effects is the foundation for the centralization of the Web 2.0 era, and they are helped along by liberal use of dark patterns on users as well (i.e. Web 2.0 tricks to get people to give up personal data). If we are not careful, we risk repeating some of the same patterns in the Web 3.0 era.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader, and a CoinDesk columnist.  I see two major risks to a sustainably decentralized future. The first, and by far the biggest, is the immense complexity that’s involved in building good blockchain interaction tools. Interacting with distributed systems is complicated, all the more so when you layer in additional requirements like managing multiple signatures or using zero knowledge proofs to maintain privacy.  The easiest way to manage that complexity today, is to do so through an application programming interface (API). Want to mint a token? There’s an API for that. Want to get some transaction history? There’s an API for that, too. Those APIs, in turn, write to and from the blockchain, handling all the complexity that is involved. APIs simplify building blockchain tools, but nearly all of them rely upon centralized software and infrastructure. In other words: Extensive use of APIs will lead to the centralization of many critical blockchain functions.  EY blockchain infrastructure is no different, and it not only makes heavy use of API-based services from other companies, but also offers services as APIs to enterprise users that would otherwise find all that complexity too much to manage. While I know that APIs will certainly have a role to play in the future, especially when it comes to interfacing the Web 3.0 world with the Web 2.0 world, I’d prefer to see a future where many applications run and interact natively in the blockchain ecosystem. We have our own ongoing priority inside of EY to keep putting more genuinely decentralized infrastructure in our blockchain business, and I hope our peers do, too.  To avoid excessive centralization through dependency on APIs and SaaS (software as a service) applications, the most important work is for developers to build libraries and tools that make it easy to access Web 3.0 ecosystems directly and keep code up to date without having to rely upon APIs. That sounds easy but it is actually very hard. I have discovered in my career how fiendishly difficult it is to manage the distribution of software and how easy it is to maintain control and consistency through a software-as-a-service API. Some projects like Stereum, funded in part by the Ethereum Foundation, are a good start because they make starting and running your own node at home as easy as installing any other piece of package software.  A second big concern I have is that in our efforts to build Web 3.0 offerings that run and perform just like Web 2.0 offerings, we’re going to end up centralizing Web 3.0 to a high degree. Protocols that support “decentralized” compute and file storage are designed to reward the participants with the most highly available, high-performing systems. Those are usually located in centralized data centers run by large companies.  Read more: 10 2022 Predictions From PwC’s Henri Arslanian  This is essential if we want Web 3.0 applications to be as fast and responsive as Web 2.0 applications. But is that a useful objective? The most successful new technologies address new workloads rather than migrating old ones on to new platforms. Web 3.0 is better at some very specific things, like moving value with tokenization and enabling complex integrations with smart contracts.  Perhaps we can leave the synchronous interactions and instant user interface gratification to the Web 2.0 world? The “30″ in “net 30″ on a corporate invoice refers to days, not milliseconds. For most enterprises, business and financial applications, a cycle time of a few minutes to a day is more than adequate. Maybe we should leave gaming and virtual reality for Web 2.0?  If we want a truly distributed and decentralized future, we will have to resist the twin temptations of instant user interface gratification, the kind that can be delivered only by always-on data centers, and extremely simple API integrations. The payoff will be a fairer, more competitive and more resilient financial and technology ecosystem.

42411591,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzkB,1641225063,Should Western Union Worry About Stablecoins?,"Remittances are small transfers, usually $1,000 or less, that people living in diaspora make to loved ones back home. These payments have become a vital form of survival not only for families left behind, but also for the developing countries themselves, which over the years have received shrinking amounts of development assistance and direct investment. Total remittances have reached $589 billion this year, according to the World Bank.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  At the moment, stablecoins are used mostly in the speculative crypto economy, not the bricks and mortar economy. Cryptocurrency exchanges that lack access to the banking system rely on stablecoins such as tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC) as substitute proto-dollar accounts. Stablecoins also serve as the building blocks for decentralized financial (DeFi) tools.  Significant real-world usage of stablecoins, particularly remittances, would be a big “get” for the stablecoin sector. But there are some big challenges to address before this happens.  To be fair, crypto does already serve as a remittance vehicle, albeit a niche one. In a recent paper, economists Ken Rogoff, Carmen Reinhart and Clemens Graf von Luckner found that a lower-bound of 1.3% of all trades on LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer exchange, were related to usage of bitcoin for cross-border payments. The authors note that bitcoin remittances often involve countries like Nigeria that have exchange controls, which bitcoin is useful for evading.  The advantage that stablecoins have over bitcoin is that they don’t suffer from bitcoin’s wild volatility. Indeed, remittance company MoneyGram is currently experimenting with them.  The first of the two major hurdles to ubiquitous stablecoin remittances is the double-hop problem.  The double-hop problem  Much of the world lives in a bank account world. Our salaries arrive in our bank account. We purchase our necessities like shelter or food with a debit card or bank transfer.  Everyone else lives in a cash world. We earn money in cash and buy stuff with physical currency.  But no one lives in a stablecoin world. Except for a few privileged denizens of the crypto economy, no one receives a salary in stablecoins. Certainly no one buys supper with them. (Using a crypto-linked payment card to make purchases doesn’t count, since these cards sell crypto for fiat at the last instant and pay with bank money.)  Read more: Ripple to Deliver First Real-Time Payments From Oman to India Using Blockchain  This is the core of the problem. For most of the world’s remittance users, a stablecoin remittance forces them to temporarily leave their preferred financial environment. A sender must jump out of cash or bank accounts onto stablecoin rails. The person who receives the stablecoins must then hop back into the world of bank accounts or physical cash.  These extra hops are inconvenient. First, they require a certain level of technical and financial expertise to expedite. No internet access? Forget about it. Secondly, they are expensive. A hop into and out of stablecoins doubles the foreign exchange transaction fees involved in remitting money.  In her recent testimony to the U.S. Senate, financial regulatory expert Alexis Goldstein crunched how much the stablecoin double-hop costs. Using the U.S.-to-Europe remittance corridor as her example, Goldstein found that a remittance sender in the U.S. who buys $200 worth of tether stablecoins with dollars on Coinbase must pay a fee of $2.99. The $200 is then sent to a European recipient, who must pay $2.99 to sell tether on Coinbase for euros.  That’s already $6 in fees. Goldstein’s numbers didn’t include slippage – the gap between the bid and ask price for tether on Coinbase – which amplifies the all-in costs of a stablecoin remittance.  By contrast, a traditional $200 remittance carried out by Wise, MoneyGram or Western Union is just a single-hop transaction. Dollars must be sold for euros, and that’s it. A single-hop will always be cheaper than a double-hop.  The user fee problem  The double-hop problem that bedevils stablecoin remittances is compounded by the user fee problem. Platforms like Ethereum that are based on proof-of-work require that crypto miners be paid a fee to validate transactions. At the time of writing this article, it would have cost me a whopping $23 in mining fees to transfer $100 worth of USDP stablecoins that I own. That’s an awfully pricey remittance.  Read more: JP Koning - The Race for Stablecoin Transparency  The user fee problem can be avoided by dispatching stablecoin remittances over Ethereum’s emerging layer 2 architecture, say the Optimism or Polygon protocols. However, graduating stablecoins from the main level of Ethereum over to layer 2 and back down again incurs costly mining fees. It is also technically complex and takes time.  Competing blockchains Tron, Avalanche and Solana offer an alternative route for avoiding Ethereum’s user fee problem. These blockchains rely on proof-of-stake for security, which is much cheaper than proof-of-work.  But even if the parties to a remittance manage to route a stablecoin in a way that minimizes the user fee problem, the nagging double-hop problem remains. The jump into stablecoins and back out again will always be more costly than a single-hop remittance.  A few developments might minimize the double-hop problem and help make stablecoin remittances more competitive with regular ones.  Banks and stablecoins closer  One way to solve the double-hop problem would be a tighter fusion between stablecoins and bank accounts. If banks allowed customers to automatically withdraw stablecoins from their accounts without a fee (like we already do with cash), and also freely deposit stablecoins, then people making stablecoin remittances would no longer have to pay double the fees.  For example, say that Manuel – an immigrant living in the U.S. – wants to send money to Maria in Honduras. He’d start by withdrawing $200 in Wells Fargo-approved stablecoins from his Wells Fargo bank account, for free. He then sends them to Maria, who deposits the $200 worth of stablecoins directly into her Honduran bank account at no charge. Maria then asks her bank to convert the funds into Honduran lempira so she can pay rent. This foreign exchange swap is the only transaction in the entire circuit that incurs a bank fee.  While no-fee bank-to-stablecoin transactions would allow for cheap remittances, it’s not evident that this option will ever emerge. Banks don’t want to lose business to stablecoin issuers, after all, unless they themselves are the issuer of stablecoins.  Stablecoins invade the real world  A second way to minimize the double-hop problem would be to increase the number of real-world situations where stablecoins are accepted.  Read more: Crypto Remittances Prove Their Worth in Latin America  If Manuel’s real-world U.S. salary was paid in stablecoins, say tether, then he wouldn’t have to do a U.S. dollar-to-tether conversion when he sends a remittance to Maria. Alternatively, if Maria could purchase food and other basics with stablecoins, then she wouldn’t have to do a stablecoin-to-lempira conversion.  Broadening the range for real-world stablecoin transactions is not as easy as it sounds. What makes a payments network useful is the fact that other people are already connected to it. Lacking an initial set of users, a new payment network’s chances of breaking through are tiny.  Growing the crypto economy  If real-world acceptance of stablecoins is unlikely to occur, there’s a third way towards stablecoin ubiquity: increase the amount of people inhabiting the nascent crypto economy.  Right now the crypto economy is occupied by crypto fans, speculators and people who work in the industry. If there were more things to do in the crypto economy – entertainment, job opportunities, socializing – then people would increasingly “immigrate” there from the real world. New arrivals would be obliged to adopt the de facto payments standard, stablecoins.  If Bob, who occupies one region of the crypto economy, wants to remit $200 to Alice in another region of the crypto economy, USD coin or tether are the most convenient options. Interposing a non-blockchain intermediary like Western Union into the mix would be a step backwards. That would introduce an expensive double-hop, much like a stablecoin remittance in the real world introduces a double-hop.  For now, the double-hop and user fee problems prevent stablecoins from being a competitive remittance vehicle. Plenty of work remains to be done if they are to ever get to ubiquity.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | USDT,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/03/should-western-union-worry-about-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0eef7db391fa9bee45cca6bb3e2cdc61a1f69e67-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411860,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgiL5,1641224820,What Is Polygon? Understanding Polygon and How It Works,"Polygon is a sidechain or scaling tool for the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum, while very popular, is slow and expensive. Polygon is a way to help avoid this issue by processing transactions outside of the Ethereum blockchain.  While the recent Ethereum Merge is the first step towards increasing the transactions per second (TPS) on the blockchain, most of the upgrades that will facilitate that speed are still in the future. Ethereum is able to process about 10 to 30 transactions per second, with transaction fees hovering around $25, as of January 2023. During periods of high network congestion, the price can spike two or three times higher.  That’s where scaling systems such as Polygon come in. Polygon makes things cheaper by processing batches of transactions on its proprietary proof-of-stake blockchain. Polygon claims to be able to process up to 65,000 transactions each second, with fees costing less than a fraction of a cent.  Recently Polygon completed a hard fork to reduce its own gas fee spikes and further speed transactions. It also plans to introduce ZK rollups to further decrease costs. It launched a public testnet late in 2022.  Read More: How to Connect MetaMask to the Polygon Network  What’s MATIC?  In 2021 you might have seen the blockchain project name Polygon used synonymously with “Matic Network.” That’s because Matic Network was the original name of Polygon before the project was rebranded in February 2021. Matic Network launched in 2019.  Polygon decided to retain the ticker MATIC for its native utility crypto token after the rebranding, leading to some initial confusion. All you have to remember is that Polygon is to MATIC as Ethereum is to ETH.  There are 10 billion possible MATIC tokens. As of January 2023, 8.9 billion MATIC are in circulation. The rest will be minted by stakers – users who deposit their MATIC into a staking smart contract in order to become validators. Polygon is a proof-of-stake network that randomly selects stakers to validate new transaction data.  Scaling solutions: the bigger picture  Polygon is an Ethereum scaling solution, but it plans to expand beyond Ethereum. It pitches its services as a framework for an “internet of blockchains,” which means it can connect any Ethereum-interoperable blockchain together and be used to cut transaction costs and increase speeds.  Polygon is not the only project that attempts to hasten transactions on Ethereum. There are a number of rival blockchains that also support “bridges” and let people trade variants of Ethereum tokens. These include:  Avalanche  Solana  Cosmos  Brands and NFTs using polygon  Polygon has won mass-market attention thanks to Starbucks, Nike, Reddit, Meta and DraftKings launching projects on Polygon in 2022. It was also the blockchain of choice for Disney’s Accelerator program. The president of Polygon Labs credits the success of these big brands to building “this great funnel for partners to come through and make the onboarding to Polygon really seamless.”  See Also: Bernstein Says Polygon Blockchain Is Bringing Crypto to Consumers  In addition, Polygon has made a concerted effort to garner more of the NFT market, recently paying DeLab, the startup behind top artists Y00ts and DeGods, $3 million to migrate chains from Solana to Polygon.

42375589,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9FnH,1641210713,Bitcoin’s Net Exchange Flows Flip Bearish as Cryptocurrency Struggles for Directional Bias,"A blockchain indicator tracking the flow of coins in and out of centralized exchanges is signaling a bearish shift in investor sentiment similar to the one seen before the May 2021 crash.  Glassnode data shows the 90-day moving average of net exchange flows has turned positive, meaning more coins are entering exchanges than leaving.  Sustained net inflows, if any, would be a cause for concern for the bulls.  Net inflows imply investor intention to sell, while consistent outflows represent strong holding sentiment and take out circulating supply from the market, paving the way for price rallies.  The 90-day average of net flows turned positive on May 13, 2021, following which bitcoin crashed from $50,000 to $30,000, extending the pullback from the then-record highs above $64,000.  The metric consistently signaled outflows with a negative print throughout bitcoin’s 10-fold rally to over $60,000 observed in 11 months to April 2021.  A similar pattern was observed in October 2021 when bitcoin rallied 40% to new record highs above $65,000.  Bitcoin was last seen trading largely unchanged on the day near $47,100. The cryptocurrency has been restricted to a range of $45,500 to $52,000 since early December.  The Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes and the U.S. jobs data scheduled for release later this week may inject volatility into the bitcoin market.  According to FXStreet, the U.S. economy is expected to have added 400,000 jobs in December after November’s 210,000 additions.

The announcement does not mention anything about the delay, only stating that the pilot began in May and ended on Dec. 31, 2021.  Jamaica is set to roll out the CBDC in the first quarter of 2022.  The BOJ had been working with Ireland-based technology firm eCurrency Mint on the sandbox project. The scope of the pilot was limited to digital wallet providers who indicated readiness to participate within the time frame.  The National Commercial Bank (NCB) also came on board to test the range of services that can use the CBDC solution, according to the announcement.  The services tested included minting J$230 million (circa $1.5 million) worth of digital currency, issuing CBDCs to wallet providers such as the BOJ’s banking department (J$1 million worth of CBDC to be distributed to staff). The first CBDC issuance to a deposit institution was worth J$5 million, made to NCB.  The NCB also onboarded 57 customers who conducted person-to-person, cash-in and cash-out transactions through 37 accounts. This included transactions with small merchants, such as local craft jewelers, footwear designers and fashion and garment boutiques, the BOJ said.  The rollout will see a continuation of onboarding existing customers and new customers, allowing two additional wallet providers, who are currently conducting testing, to distribute CBDCs to their customers, and the testing of transactions between customers of various participating wallet providers.

42375590,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9FoX,1641204556,Bitcoin Hashrate Mints New All-Time Highs,"Hashrate figures for Bitcoin set new highs on Sunday night after crossing previous highs from mid-2021, data from analytics tool Glassnode show.  Hashrate refers to the amount of computational power used by miners dedicated to the minting of new bitcoins and verification of new transactions on the Bitcoin network. Millions of calculations are solved each second to “win” new blocks, in a process broadly called mining.  Higher hashrates mean a stronger and more secure network, making it hard for a group of attackers to execute an ill-fated 51% attack and gain control of the network.  But the upkeep of such intensive machinery is costly and requires deep technical knowledge – which has historically led miners to set up in inner regions of China, where manpower is affordable and climate conditions are conducive.  The Chinese government, however, isn’t big on crypto. A crackdown on local miners and mining businesses last year saw Bitcoin hashrates plummet to as low as 61 exahashes per second in June 2021, from over 190 exahashes per second in April 2021.  Data at the time estimated that over 46% of Bitcoin’s requisite computing power was supplied by Chinese miners. The ban has since led to an exodus of Chinese miners to other regions, such as Kazakhstan, Iran and the U.S.  But Bitcoin has since bounced back and the network has not taken very long to recover: Glassnode data shows hashrates spiked to 201 exahashes on January 1, surpassing April 2021 levels.  Some engineers say the recovery showcases the network’s resilience after a plummet last year.  “Weathering and completely recovering from a 50%+ drop due to a mining ban by the country with the most hash power was a major milestone for network resilience,” said Casa wallet founder and Bitcoin developer Jameson Lopp in a tweet on Sunday night.

DeFi projects rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen for financial services such as lending, trading and borrowing.  Data from DeFi Llama shows that the platform locked just $68 million after its launch in May 2021, surpassing older projects in later months. The project took a month to attract $1 billion, and five months to reach $10 billion. Increased demand for the product led to an additional $10 billion in liquidity in the last two months.  Convex allows users to access liquidity and earn fees from Ethereum-based stablecoin exchange Curve Finance, the largest DeFi protocol with a TVL of $23 billion.  Curve tokens (CRV) are issued as yield farming rewards to liquidity providers on Curve Finance, and can be converted into vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV). Holding veCRV allows users to participate in platform governance, earn higher rewards and fees and receive airdrops.  The tokens are time-locked, meaning users are incentivized to lock their CRV for a long time to receive more veCRV and more platform rewards. However, this mechanism effectively locks up liquidity, creating opportunity costs for users.  To solve this problem, Convex pools all user assets together so that it can purchase curve tokens, convert them into veCRV and maximize rewards for its liquidity providers. This allows Convex users to receive Curve rewards without locking up curve tokens for lengthy periods.  Convex’s native tokens (CVX) were trading at $47 at the time of writing, down 6.6% in the past 24 hours. The network is worth over $2.2 billion by market capitalization, as per data from CoinGecko.",POSITIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/03/defi-protocol-convex-finance-crosses-20b-in-locked-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24f8823494f2cdfda6c41b0ecd00d4adddadd040-2157x1438.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin traded in a narrowed range after “crypto witching day” ended  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a hiatus for the holidays. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser’s Q&A with Cathy Hackl, sometimes called the “Godmother of the Metaverse,” on the future of the metaverse, including why brands will need a metaverse strategy.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47,348 -0.02%  Ether (ETH): $3.825 +1.96%  Markets  S&P 500: 4,766.18 -0.26%  DJIA: 36,338.30 -0.16%  Nasdaq: 15,644.97 -0.61$  Gold: 1,829.05 + 0.73%  Market moves  Bitcoin’s price was ranging between $46,000 and $48,000 during the weekend, after “crypto witching day” ended Friday with the expiration of roughly $8.67 billion worth of bitcoin and ether options contracts.  Bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, experienced a small price recovery to as high as about $47,961.0 on Saturday, before it fell into red again on Sunday, based on data from TradingView. But its overall spot trading volume across major centralized exchanges declined on the weekend, meaning that the price move was not supported by strong market activities.  On Friday, about 115,000 bitcoin options and roughly 882,000 ether options contracts, worth a total notional value of $8.67 billion, expired, according to Cayman Islands-based crypto financial services firm Blofin. After the settlement was completed, bitcoin’s price briefly went up sharply to above $48,000 on some exchanges, crypto trading data platform aICoin tweeted on Dec. 31.  Meanwhile, harmony (ONE) and chainlink (LINK) were the biggest winners among alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on Sunday, at the time of writing. Harmony is the native token of smart contract platform Harmony and LINK is an ERC-20 token for decentralized oracle network Chainlink.  Column  How Brands Can Build in the Metaverse: Cathy Hackl, aka “the Godmother of the Metaverse,” on how crypto-oriented virtual worlds can be useful for marketers. (By Jeff Wilser)  Clinique had a problem. The brand wanted to “enter the metaverse,” but it didn’t want to do it in a way that was cringey. So, they called a woman named Cathy Hackl: The “Godmother of the Metaverse.”  Her credentials? Hackl, the “Chief Metaverse Officer” of Futures Intelligence Group, has worked in metaverse-related fields for nearly a decade – or basically since the dawn of meta-time.  This post is part of Crypto 2022: Culture Week.  Just ask Steven Spielberg. When filming “Ready Player One,” Spielberg partnered with the virtual reality headset company HTC Vive, where Hackl served as “VR Evangelist.” At Magic Leap, an augmented reality company, she worked with the man who coined the term metaverse, Neal Stephenson. And over a year before the current craze, she wrote articles for Forbes like “The Metaverse Is Coming And It’s A Very Big Deal.”  It was such a big deal that Hackl left a cushy job at Amazon Web Services to “take a big bet on the metaverse.” Now she advises brands – like Clinique – on how to position themselves in this strange new space. (Her work with Clinique fetched a glowing write-up from Vogue business.)  The Godmother shares why the metaverse is larger than perhaps the crypto crowd realizes, why avatars are fast becoming “emotional surrogates of ourselves,” and how in the future, “every company is going to need a metaverse strategy.”  CoinDesk: The term “metaverse” can mean 10 different things to 10 different people – even inside the crypto space. When you start working with clients, how do you explain it to them?  Cathy Hackl: I usually start from the past. Web 1 connected information, so you got the internet. And did that change anything for your brand? It probably did. Web 2 connected people and you got social media, the sharing economy. Did that change anything for your brand? Of course it did, right?  CoinDesk: Right.  Hackl: And now we’re in the evolution of Web 2 going into Web 3. And Web 3, it connects people, places, and things – or people, spaces and assets. And those people, spaces and assets can sometimes be in a fully virtual environment, like most people tend to think.  Read more: Play-to-Earn Is Already the Biggest Star in the Metaverse - Jeff Wilser  But it’s also going to be in our real world with some level of augmentation, probably through a wearable. So, Web 3 is kind of enabling the creation of the metaverse, and the metaverse is a convergence of physical and digital. Think of it as the successor of what comes next on the internet. It’s like your digital lifestyle catching up to your physical life.  CoinDesk: That’s a pretty expansive view. So, it includes not just blockchain projects, like Decentraland, but also augmented reality from traditional platforms?  Hackl: Yeah. Even Snapchat, the things that they can do with the camera for augmented reality – that’s a metaverse play. That’s all part of the metaverse. I have a pretty expansive view, and part of that comes from working in VR [virtual reality] hardware, spatial computing and augmented reality hardware. And when people think the metaverse is only virtual reality, or only fully immersive, I think that’s a pretty narrow view. And a pretty dystopic one.  CoinDesk:With that wide of a definition, I’m guessing the blockchain metaverse projects are only a small slice of the overall “metaverse pie”?  Hackl: It is small, but it’s ever increasing. You’ve got SoftBank leading the investment for $93 million in a Series B [for The Sandbox]. Upland just raised $18 million, I believe, with a $300 million valuation. You’ve got a lot of these blockchain projects – like NFT [non-fungible token] gaming metaverses – growing really fast.  CoinDesk: How does blockchain fit into your vision for the metaverse?  Hackl: You cannot enable the open decentralized metaverse that many of us dream of without blockchain, right? Blockchain is the underlying component. NFTs are a bit of a stepping-stone into the metaverse when it comes to ownership of digital assets and digital identity. How do you actually enable that? NFTs are a big part of that equation.  CoinDesk: What’s the biggest potential for brands?  Hackl: One of the big things that I try to explore is, “Is direct-to-avatar the next direct-to-consumer?” Again, it’s stepping-stones. When we text people we use emojis; we don’t even write anymore. We use an emoji to represent a message. Our emojis – and by extension our avatars – are becoming emotional surrogates of ourselves.  In order to represent yourself as an avatar, that’s a big thing. Because it’s a moment of self-expression, it’s a moment of self-exploration. And how do brands play into that? Well, I’m going to have to outfit my avatar. Maybe I want to make a statement and wear Supreme. Fashion and culture go together. How does your avatar show up, right? What does it look like, what does it wear? There are going to be a lot of opportunities for brands. And there will be opportunities for them to engage with the younger generation.  I can see how it’s obvious for some brands – especially in wearables and fashion – to get involved in the avatar game. But how about for less obvious brands? I mean, how does a food company make a metaverse play?  This post is part of Crypto 2022: Culture Week.  Well, people are saying that Chipotle caused the [Roblox] outage. (Of course they didn’t cause the outage – let’s get that straight.) But a brand like Chipotle can come in and say, “We’re going to do a burrito, and we’re going to give away $1 million worth of burritos in the game.” I think those types of things are interesting and fun, and the audience is engaged, they enjoyed it.  CoinDesk:What do you see as some of the biggest obstacles that need to be overcome for the metaverse to become more mainstream?  Hackl: There are a lot of things that need to happen. If you look at how many people actually have [digital] wallets, it’s actually a very small number. And it’s a generational thing. My kids understand digital ownership in a way that maybe older generations don’t. They love buying digital assets and their skins. Once my kids get older, they’re going to question, “Why can’t I take this asset that I paid so much money for in Roblox, and move it over to Fortnite?” Eventually they’re going to expect that.  CoinDesk: And that leads to more of an appreciation for NFTs and a desire for open worlds, got it. What else is needed for the metaverse to take off?  Hackl: There will be a serious need for computing power. And right now, obviously you’ve got supply chain issues related to chips, so that might slow things down.  There also needs to be a lot of education within organizations – and not just the brand team – to understand where this is headed. And for companies, there’s already a talent war so it’s hard to hire people. When you realize that every company is going to need a metaverse strategy, then hiring is going to get even harder. That’s why I partnered with Republic Realm to create the Republic Realm Academy, for executive education.  CoinDesk:How does Facebook fit into all of this? What’s your reaction to Zuckerberg’s meta play?  Hackl: I take the good with the bad. I mean, it is a validation of the work that many of us have been doing for years. So, I’ll take that. On the other side, with Facebook being so literal with the name “meta,” it does cast a bit of doubt and shadow on the metaverse. The big thing is confusion – people thinking the metaverse is Facebook. It is not.  I was at an event having breakfast with some speakers. I sat down, and someone asked me what I do. I said, “I do metaverse strategies.” And they said, “Isn’t that Facebook?”  Read More: Note to Brands: Crypto Isn’t Funny Money. It’s Community  CoinDesk:No!  Hackl: [Laughs.] Yeah. So, I think there is that level of confusion. I don’t know how many people read the news that Facebook rebranded to meta, and they learned the word because of that.  CoinDesk:How many years until we get to a “Ready Player One”-style metaverse?  Hackl: First of all, I will say “The Oasis” [the fully immersive platform in “Ready Player One”] is not what we should aim for. That’s pretty dystopic, where the real world has gone to s**t, and you have to escape reality. [Laughs.] I don’t want to escape reality, but I want the metaverse to be somewhere fun when I want to have fun – instead of Instagram.  CoinDesk:So how long until we get there?  Hackl: I don’t think anyone can put a time or date, but I will say that this decade is a decade of building and pioneering. We’re all testing, trying to understand how it all works. This is the decade where those foundations are created. It’s a time of change and a time for creators. Now is the time to build. Now is when you start to figure out, what does this mean? Where are we going? And what does our company or brand have to do to be prepared for the future?
