42398921,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgO5,1457987287,New York Bitcoin User Charged With Unlawful Money Transmission,"A New York man has been charged with operating an unlawful money transmitting business in connection with the sale of bitcoins, the US Department of Justice announced on Friday.  The government said last week that it was charging Rochester, New York, resident Richard Petix with illegally selling $200,000 in bitcoin between August 2014 and December of last year. Notably, the report does not provide information on any state-specific laws Petix was in violation of when conducting the sale.  Petix's charges, the Justice Department said, are connected to a wider alleged scheme that involved money laundering as well as the trafficking of controlled substances and stolen goods.  According to court documents filed with the US District Court of the Western District of New York, Petix has also been charged with lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about ownership of electronic devices.  The Justice Department had alleged that this is a violation of a release agreement stemming from a 2009 guilty plea to a child pornography charge, which stipulated that Petix must alert authorities when using digital devices and allow them to examine any devices he used.  Petix allegedly conducted a bitcoin transaction with an undercover agent, using a computer that he later denied owning.  The Justice Department said:  ""However, on December 3, 2015, Petix conducted a bitcoin sale with an undercover federal agent. Using his laptop computer and smartphone, the defendant transferred 37 bitcoins worth approximately $13,000 to the agent. But when confronted by federal probation officers at the scene, Petix claimed that the laptop and smartphone were not his.""  Petix is set to be arraigned tomorrow and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted on both charges.

In a post today, USAA called the pilot run successful and stated that support for the mobile app would likely be rolled out in March. Both USAA.com and the USAA mobile apps were part of the initial trial.  In statements, lead investment associate at the USAA corporate development Jon Cholak, indicated his support for the more widespread rollout, positioning his firm as an early advocate for the technology.  Cholak said:  ""Traditionally, USAA is very good about getting in front of emerging technology trends. What we're developing is at the forefront of the financial services industries.""  USAA was one of several participants in the $75m Series C round raised by bitcoin services firm Coinbase in January 2015, alongside The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and BBVA Ventures.  The Fortune 500 firm has previously said its members are active bitcoin users, and that this was a key reason behind its investment in Coinbase.

42398933,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgYu,1457981410,Ethereum Blockchain Project Launches First Production Release,"Next-generation blockchain platform Ethereum has released 'Homestead' the first production release of its software, which was implemented at block 1,150,000 today.  The introduction follows Frontier, Ethereum's inaugural release, which was released to developers in July 2015. Further, it comes on the heels of escalating interest in the open, public platform, which is attracting the interest of major financial institutions, in part due to its support for self-executing smart contracts.  For example, a private version of the Ethereum network served as the platform for the first major test conducted by blockchain consortium startup R3CEV in January, with the trial uniting 11 major banks in a high-profile proof-of-concept.  Andrew Keys, co-founder of decentralized application development firm ConsenSys Enterprise, explained that whereas Frontier featured only command-line interfaces, Homestead will expand what users will be able to build on the platform and the ease with which they'll be able to build proof-of-concepts and minimum viable products.  Keys told CoinDesk:  ""Homestead's arrival will begin to demonstrate the next generation of blockchain technology, whereby anything we can dream of, can be accomplished in a decentralized manner using Ethereum.""  Elsewhere, early members of the platform sought to stress the recent benchmarks that they believe point to the success of the project at a time when financial incumbents are increasingly focused on alternatives to the bitcoin network.  ""We’ve seen Microsoft and IBM doing projects on Ethereum. There’s a lot of coders. It’s exciting to see something you were in on in the early stages growing and bearing fruit,"" Anthony Di Iorio, one of Ethereum's founders and a Chief Digital Officer at the Toronto Stock Exchange, said in an interview.  In a Google Hangout hosted by Ethereum community members, there was celebration as the software was implemented at roughly 18:50 UTC.  ""That was the most anti-climactic event I've ever hosted,"" Alex Van de Sande, lead designer at the Ethereum Foundation, commented in the channel.  Growth of Ethereum  Announced in January 2014 by inventor and project leader Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum raised some $18m in a crowdsale of the tokens that help power its platform later that year.  The success of the crowdfunding effort, while controversial, earned the platform coverage in The Wall Street Journal and other major financial publications.  Since then, those close to the project's development believe its network health is now comparable to that of the long-running bitcoin network on which it was inspired.  ""You need to look at the growth of the Ethereum network via the growth of its nodes, sitting at 5,100 versus bitcoin’s about 6,000 roughly. That's quite significant and shows the stability and global nature of the Ethereum network,"" William Mougayar, a special advisor for the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that supports its development, told CoinDesk.  Mougayar indicated that Ethereum is now processing around 25,000 transactions a day, or about 10% of the number currently supported by the bitcoin network.  Since the beginning of February, Ethereum has also seen strong growth in the value of its token, ether, which users need to convert into 'gas' in order to run its applications. Ether's valuation has increased to more than $1bn, nearly five-fold annual growth, though how much of this total is fueled by use as opposed to speculation, is unclear.  While Ethereum has seen such a significant rise, there are not many easy ways for the average user to buy ETH. The most popular exchanges are Poloniex, Kraken and Shapeshift, and most recently, Bitfinex.  Still, those close to the project believe this will change as interest grows.  ""We are seeing major interest from cryptocurrency exchanges. We can expect to see many US and foreign exchanges adding ether to their trading pairs,"" Keys suggested.  Notably, Bitfinex said the high trading volumes of ether at other exchanges had become ""hard to ignore"", citing demand was a key reason for its support.  Hard fork upgrade  The Homestead launch is also notably for the development effort behind the upgrade, as Ethereum underwent a hard fork, a fundamental change in the protocol that makes older versions incompatible.  The decision to implement through a hard fork comes at a time when the bitcoin community has been ensnared in a months-long debate over how its network could be upgraded in a similar fashion.  As such, Ethereum stakeholders sought to highlight this choice in contrast to bitcoin, framing the network as perhaps more adaptable to development needs.  ""Interestingly, in comparison to the governance problems in the bitcoin community, the Ethereum community has supported the changes and achieved consensus on the upgrade to Homestead,"" Keys noted.  In a FAQ published on the platform's growing Reddit community, Taylor Gerring, director of technology at the Ethereum Project, outlined potential issues users may experience in the transition process.  He noted that upgrading is not necessary and that an user tokens would be safe so long as they owned their private keys, but that they would be unable to reconnect to the network until they upgrade their software.  In the bitcoin community, there is still continuous debate on how to achieve a hard fork, with two competing development teams pursuing alternative strategies.  The Bitcoin Classic team, for instance, has been advocating for 75% of bitcoin's transaction validators to approve the measure, a decision that would be followed by a 28-day grace period. On the other side, the Bitcoin Core team, the network's longest-serving team of developers, has argued that hard forks should be done very slowly, arguing for code to be submitted this year that wouldn't go into effect until July 2017.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Gerring went on to explain further differences between how the Ethereum developers are working differently than bitcoin developers, stating that the platform's community is shouldering the burden of supporting user needs.  ""[Our approach] stands in stark contrast to what we're seeing in the bitcoin community where an intermediate block scaling solution is being shuttered for something the community isn't necessarily clamouring for,"" he said.  Technology improvements  These upgrades, Ethereum's developers contend, will now allow the network to be competitive among private and public blockchain softwares. On a more specific level, however, Homestead will see Ethereum introduce three Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) as part of the upgrade: EIP-2, EIP-7, and EIP-8.  Stephan Tual, founder of Slock.it and the former CCO of Ethereum, explained that with these technical improvements, ""the training wheels are off"" for developers.  One of the big changes is what Tual referred to as the removal of canary contracts. In essence, if a form had occurred to a consensus bug, members of the Ethereum team could have stepped in with the Frontier software.  ""Activating these contracts would have triggered a 'stop' call for mining in the official clients in order to regain control of the situation and hard fork properly,"" Tual said to CoinDesk. ""With these contracts gone, the Ethereum network is now fully launched and completely autonomous.""  The other major change he discussed was the introduction of new codes in Solidity, the language used to compile for the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the part of the protocol that handles the internal state of the network.  ""Being able to hard fork at anytime, and more importantly, getting the support from the miners (who will vote by updating the software or not) is a big, big differentiator from other blockchains, paving the way for major features upgrades in the future,"" Tual said.  Along with the upgrade to the protocol, the developers introduced a wallet product called Mist, which will allow users to write and deploy smart contracts in addition to serving as a place to hold ethers. Mougayar explained that, while this is taken for granted in the bitcoin world, it is ""a big deal"" for Ethereum given it has not had such an offering.  With the software forked and Homestead the new predominant protocol, there is an expectation that more decentralized applications will be introduced.  Keys explained that some of the applications he’s most looking forward to now that Homestead is out are a prediction market, a decentralized music platform, a tokenized gold custodian and asset tracking system, and an easy way for users to convert bitcoin to Ether.  Supporters like Keys believe the combination of these upgrades will find more large institutions accepting Ethereum alongside bitcoin as a blockchain technology that will be integral to future financial products.  Keys concluded:  ""Fortune 500s are learning Ethereum's Turing-complete virtual machine and smart contracting language are necessary to create enterprise applications.""

42398920,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgN6,1457979213,Bitcoin Exchange Bitfinex Adds Ether Trading Amid Increasing Demand,"In the weeks preceding the release of the Ethereum's production-ready software implementation 'Homestead', the next-generation blockchain project has seen a sharp increase interest from the digital currency community.  According to figures from industry data source Coinmarketcap, the market cap for ether (ETH), the platform's publicly traded token, has risen to more than $1bn at press time, up from $768m on 7th March. During this time, the value of ETH has climbed to $13.55 across exchanges, rising from $9.92 one week prior.  Still, the value is a far cry from the $2.50 observed on 7th August, 2015, when digital currency exchange Kraken announced it would be the first major venture-backed business to offering ether trading pairs. Some 5,000 ETH were traded over the course of the first day.  At the time of Kraken's announcement, Bitfinex indicated it was ""not considering"" support for ETH trading, but that it would potentially add the coin should it become more widely traded. However, Bitfinex officially added trading on 12th March.  Bitfinex director of community Zane Tackett indicated that it began to consider adding ether trading pairs in late February, and that it was spurred on by the fact that the exchange had previously taken steps to support ether on its API and trading engine.  Tackett told CoinDesk:  ""You can definitely see there's a demand there for trading Ethereum. We couldn't really miss what was happening with the volume. That was a large basis for our decision. It's higher than any other [alternative digital currency] has ever gotten.""  During the first five hours of trading, Bitfinex had already processed more than 44,200https://www.bitfinex.com/pages/stats or nearly $600,000 in volume for its ETH/USD and ETH/BTC trading pairs.  By contrast, Poloniex, the largest ethereum exchange, was reporting 2.6m ETH traded, or about $35m in total volume, over the previous 24-hour period.  The decision further comes in anticipation of the release of 'Homestead', expected to take place on 14th March at block 1,150,000. The open, public blockchain has been previously lauded for its ambitious design and support for self-executing smart contracts, with developers likening Ethereum to a ""decentralized world computer"".  Attractive features  Despite high demand, Bitfinex sought to distance itself from the idea that Ethereum would perhaps become a tradeable digital asset that would rival bitcoin, in part, due to the fact that the exchange recognizes it's not meant to act as a store of value.  Tackett told CoinDesk that, while the exchange's decision was a ""validation of the demand to trade ether"", the exchange has adopted a wait-and-see approach to the market.  ""I think that, in that regard [the trading of ETH] is kind of funny. The founders of Ethereum have said that its primary purpose isn't a store of value, so I find it interesting that people latch onto it,"" Tackett said.  In particular, he cited statements from Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin, that describe the project as about applications ""first and foremost"".  ""Ether is there simply as a token to facilitate payment of transaction fees and incentivize mining,"" Buterin has said on Reddit.  Tackett took steps to maintain that Bitfinex is still a ""bitcoin company first"" despite the addition of ether, noting that it sees days where as much as 295,000 BTC is traded on its platform. Still, he suggested it could have interesting attributes for traders in addition to the ""insane speculation"" that he said sometimes characterizes the digital currency markets.  ""Ethereum's [meant to be] inflationary, bitcoin is deflationary, there is a difference. It's also proof of stake versus proof of work. But it's still young, whereas bitcoin's been around a lot longer. It's been through speculative bubbles,"" he said.  ETH market develops  Despite this larger argument, at bitcoin exchange Kraken, enthusiasm for Ether appeared similarly high, with its trading totals mirroring those at Bitfinex.  The exchange's ETH/USD trading pair had observed $91,000 in 24-hour volume, while its ETH/EUR pair had seen roughly 239,000 euros ($265,000) in trades.  Speaking to CoinDesk in August, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell expressed a general optimism for the Ethereum project and its potential as a reason for the support of ether trading.  ""[Pairs we add] have either got to be very interesting, be innovative and have a strong development community, and I think Ethereum meets all of those,"" he said.  Larger traders, it seems, were taking a similar approach, observing developments in the market and waiting for a ""critical mass"" that would indicate the ETH market is mature and liquid.  Bitfinex has suggested it is now doing the same, and that it plans to hold off on adding ETH margin trading until such time as its order book garners significant depth.  Correction: A previous version of this article indicated Bitfinex sees trading volume of $295,000 in bitcoin. This has been revised to 295,000 BTC.

42398915,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgIB,1457972513,Microsoft Drops Bitcoin? Payments Still Live As Reports Cast Doubt,"UPDATE (14th March 22:08 BST): In an emailed statement, Microsoft called previous indications that it was cutting the bitcoin payments option ""inaccurate"".    ---------    Despite reports surfacing over the weekend that software giant Microsoft is drawing back its support for bitcoin, its website is still processing and crediting bitcoin payments.  A notice  posted by the tech giant said that its Microsoft Store online shop was not accepting bitcoin, with the policy applying to Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile in particular.  ""You can no longer redeem bitcoin into your Microsoft account,"" the page states. ""Existing balances in your account will still be available for purchases from Microsoft Store, but can't be refunded.""  Microsoft made significant waves in late 2014 when it began accepting bitcoin in its online content marketplace by way of payments processor BitPay, which takes the bitcoin payment and credits it to Microsoft. The company had stressed that it was not accepting the digital currency directly, but rather allowing it as an option for adding funds for purchasing Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox content.  The apparent move to cut out bitcoin payments sparked headlines from publications such as PC World, TechCrunch and The Verge that the tech company was giving the digital currency the boot.  Yet, in practice, Microsoft is still allowing users to send in bitcoin to add funds to their user account, which can then be spent on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile and Xbox products.  In a statement, the firm said that the widely-reported post was inaccurate, telling CoinDesk by email:  “We continue to support Bitcoin for adding money to your Microsoft Account which can be used for purchasing content in the Windows and Xbox stores. We apologize for inaccurate information that was inadvertently posted to a Microsoft site, which is currently being corrected.”  Still taking payments  A customer service representative for Microsoft told CoinDesk that users can still send in bitcoin to add funds to their Microsoft account, and from that point can use those funds to purchase items.  The representative added that their support office has received no official word about the policy change, suggesting that a formal statement could be forthcoming – as well as clarification on the exact policy regarding bitcoin payments.  Notably, Microsoft appears to be classifying bitcoin payments it receives as ""prepaid card"" payments. CoinDesk sent a payment after following instructions on this FAQ page, and after a single confirmation it appeared on the user control page. CoinDesk subsequently purchased a Windows 10 app using those funds.  At the 'front edge'  When Microsoft announced that it was accepting bitcoin, it became the biggest brand then to begin taking payments in the digital currency.  At the time, corporate vice president of Universal Store at Microsoft said that it usage of the technology to expand, remarking that ""while not mainstream, [the use of digital currencies like bitcoin] is growing beyond the early enthusiasts"".  ""We expect this growth to continue and allowing people to use bitcoin to purchase our products and services now allows us to be at the front edge of that trend,"" he wrote.  More recently, the firm has begun moving toward offering blockchain technology serves through its Azure cloud computing platform.

First announced in early 2015 and spurred by a successful crowdfunding through the sale of its software tokens, Augur aims to allow users to trade on the outcome of events, and for the market to then leverage that crowdsourced information.  With the news, Augur is now open to initial users, boasting what it called improved front-end design while enabling the creation of new markets that go beyond binary 'yes or no' answers.  Further, Augur said it will soon release a revision of its original working paper as it works toward the distribution of reputation ( REPhttps://augur.net/blog/what-is-reputation), the cryptographic token it sold during its 2015 crowdfunding effort, as part of a four-stage rollout.  Core developer Joey Krug told CoinDesk:  ""We're looking to use the beta as a platform to iterate on until launch. It'll have three additional stages: one where a limit order book is added, one with the consensus and outcome resolution backstops added and the final stage will have a testing of the official REP distribution.""
