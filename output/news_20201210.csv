42385311,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo6U1,1607635519,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Briefly Slides Below $18K as ETH Is More Volatile Than BTC in 2020,"Weak volumes and rotations into other cryptocurrencies are likely impeding bitcoin’s price movement from going higher. Meanwhile, ether has been more volatile than bitcoin in 2020 and could remain that way.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $18,349 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.14% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $17,904-$18,652 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC slightly above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish trending signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin once again fell below $18,000 Thursday, going as low as $17,904 according to the CoinDesk 20. The price was able to reverse course, with higher volume pushing it back up to $18,349 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Stuck as ECB’s Lagarde Primes Extra €500B Stimulus      Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial, pegs $17,900 as a “support” level whereby if traders don’t start scooping up bitcoin to push price back up, there may be a larger fall. ""The trend is weakening,” Kogan told CoinDesk. “If we dip further then I will consider that as a start of a downtrend.""      Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank, has noticed a lull in the market this week but sees it as a buying opportunity for those who have a longer time frame. “I’m not scared by this. It's just providing a better entry point for those who want to invest mid-long term,” said Thomas to CoinDesk. “I haven’t seen much [over-the-counter] or larger activity this week, though.”      At a combined $1.1 billion as of Wednesday’s close, average weekday spot volume on major CoinDesk 20 exchanges is lighter this week than last week’s $1.7 billion. As of press time, combined volumes were at $873 million Thursday.      Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trader, is not dismayed by the doldrums in the crypto market this week. “It’s a moderate dip on the way up,” Kugelberg told CoinDesk. “Nothing to see here.”      Rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies has been a popular theme in the crypto market as of late, and Swissquote’s Thomas pointed to XRP as one example of this dynamic. “Our data shows that in the last four weeks the volume of XRP has increased substantially at the detriment to ether and a little bit bitcoin,” Thomas said.      Read More: Coinbase to Support Spark Token Airdrop to XRP Holders      Indeed, XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a bump in volume over the past month, according to data from aggregator CoinGecko.      An airdrop in collaboration with Coinbase is likely accelerating a hype cycle on XRP, leading to volume jumping along with price, noted Thomas.“I think XRP volumes continue to outperform BTC and ETH ahead of tomorrow night’s flare token snapshot,“ said Thomas.    Ether more volatile than bitcoin this year    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Thursday, trading around $566 and slipping 1.1% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ethereum Far Outpaces Bitcoin in Developer Activity in 2020      The 30-day volatility for ether for the most part has been higher than for bitcoin in 2020, according to data collected by CoinDesk Research.      Vishal Shah, a crypto options trader and founder of derivatives venue Alpha5, says Ethereum’s ambitious “2.0” upgrade provides totally different fundamentals for ETH compared to BTC, giving it wilder gyrations.      “ETH should have a higher volatility given that it's a less established protocol than bitcoin; it is materially smaller in market cap and has more uncertainties on the immediate horizon,” Shah told CoinDesk. “The largest uncertainty would be the settling of [the Beacon Chain] and the transition to 2.0, it's all a bit uncharted.“    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Thursday, mostly red.

42385288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo67N,1607632240,World Economic Forum Wants to Standardize Ethical Data Collection,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) is designing a global governance framework for the ethical collection and sharing of data, the organization announced Tuesday.      WEF’s Data for Common Purpose Initiative (DCPI) is the first of its kind and aims to “responsibly enhance the societal benefit from data” by creating guidelines to ensure governments and researchers can more readily rely on data for making decisions that benefit the public, especially in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the announcement.      Sheila Warren, head of Data, Blockchain and Digital Assets at WEF, told CoinDesk that having siloed, or isolated, data led to a delay in humanity’s ability to respond to the pandemic with the necessary speed and agility.      ""While [siloing data] often comes from either good intentions or, more realistically speaking, business imperatives, it has really meaningful consequences,"" said Warren, who also co-hosts CoinDesk's Money Reimagined podcast, referring to the problems surrounding personal protective equipment (PPE) provisions and supply chains during the pandemic.      The DCPI hopes to refocus data policy and models towards a range of “common purposes” like public health, environmental protection and disaster management, while ensuring people’s personal data cannot be used for non-permissioned purposes.      The project already has the support of 10 governments and over 50 global partners, the announcement said, including consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and blockchain platforms such as Elastos.      A number of pilot projects have launched in Japan, Colombia and India, Warren said, though it’s important to note that WEF focuses on policy pilots as opposed to traditional tech proof-of-concept.    ‘Differentiated Permissioning’    One goal of the initiative is to enable differentiated permissioning of the same data for varied purposes. This means people would be able to set permissions around how their data can be used.      For instance, the initiative asks you to imagine a world where devices collect your vitals and medical information but you could set permissions for how that data is used in research or testing related to COVID-19, cancer, dementia and more, or get paid if someone wants to use your data for market research.      Read more: The Web Wasn’t Built for Privacy, but It Could Be      According to the initiative, user data will “automatically be encrypted, anonymized and transmitted along with digital rights management rules to ensure that the data cannot be used for other purposes,” likening personal data sharing to the controlled sharing of music.      Warren said people should be able to make a choice about what happens with their data beyond the yes-or-no choice that is available now.      “I don't think the general tenor is that all data should be approved by each individual. I think the idea is that we should create a system in which that is possible,” Warren said.    The role of blockchain    According to the WEF announcement, the prioritization of data protection and privacy by institutions over constructive data sharing has led to the failure of harnessing the full value of data as well as the “rapid fragmentation of data governance policies.”      “I think that there are a lot of ways to protect privacy and also share data,” Warren said, adding that whether it is a question of data sharing, access or encryption, blockchain can help.      DCPI partner, the Elastos Foundation, is developing a collection of open-source software to build a free and decentralized internet.      Donald Bullers, Global Technical lead at Elastos, told CoinDesk blockchain firms can incorporate policies and visions resulting from initiatives like the DCPI into client-facing products.      Read more: How FinCEN Became a Honeypot for Sensitive Personal Data      “We can take some of these discussions on data marketplaces, data exchange, global accessibility … and we can implement that into the software that we're developing,” Bullers said.      Blockchain also has a role to play in data protection by providing a new way to think about permissioning, Warren added. According to Bullers, Elastos is building a specific profile for each individual where they can house data privately and control the “inbound-outbound” of their data.      “You're already giving up a lot of your information to these large corporations, or these siloed enterprises where they're storing it on their own servers, and they have complete control and you're okay with that. But what we're really trying to do is to flip that and make it so that the individual or those who want to control their own data can do that,” Bullers said.      But Bullers added that blockchain can only address small parts of the larger problem around data governance.      “Blockchains do not solve all the problems of the internet,” Zach Warsavage, public relations director at Elastos told CoinDesk.      Blockchains are public and are “terribly inefficient” at storing large amounts of data, he said, so other technologies would be needed to assist any blockchain base.    Pilot projects    According to Warren, the DCPI will leverage the global network and prestige of the WEF to create momentum for the multi-year program, and there are two pilot programs already in motion.      The Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Colombia is working with the city of Medellin to develop a government-led data marketplace to connect data contributors and consumers, the WEF announcement said.      In Norway, WEF’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Ocean is working with partners in conservation and government to improve the environmental footprint of ocean industries by combating emissions, plastic waste and overfishing.      “The Data for Common Purpose Initiative gives us a solid platform to work from, both in developing content but not the least to engage with ambitious partners from all sectors,” Bjørn Tore Markussen, chief executive at Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Norway, said in the WEF announcement.      Two more pilots are in the works in Japan and India, Warren said.

The twin plays – both revealed in a Thursday press release – give MassMutual direct exposure to the cryptocurrency's price swings and signal it's betting that other big fish will follow suit. NYDIG is one of the fastest-growing institutional crypto shops with $2.3 billion under management. It provided MassMutual with the $100 million buy.      Without specifically explaining why it saw bitcoin as a reasonable investment, MassMutual told the Wall Street Journal it was seeking “measured yet meaningful” exposure to an increasingly digital world.      MassMutual’s $100 million BTC bet is barely a drop in its general investment account’s hulking $235 billion money bucket. Coming from a 169-year-old insurance institution in the business of measuring risk it could wield an outsize influence on bitcoin's perception among mainstream investors.      That storyline has already been playing out all year.      The life insurance company is the latest institutional stalwart to join bitcoin’s march into the financial mainstream this year. Since the pandemic took hold, publicly traded corporations and storied fund managers have been embracing the cryptocurrency at a pace not seen at any other point in its history.      But with its dual investment in NYDIG, the firm that facilitated this buy, MassMutual is moving to embrace the infrastructure powering institutional adoption.      NYDIG has been forthright in its courting of the institutional class. Wednesday, the firm hired crypto banker Patrick Sells to lead its crypto-services outreach efforts. It regularly raises tens of millions of dollars for crypto funds, including a $100 million bitcoin fund filed over Thanksgiving. That mammoth vehicle, which CoinDesk reported at the time, only had a single investor.

42385299,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo6Jx,1607622949,Rapper Lil Yachty Sells Out Social Token in 21 Minutes,"Twenty-one minutes and 41 seconds is how long it took for American rapper Lil Yachty’s new social token, $YACHTY, to sell out on Thursday. The token was listed on social money platform Fyooz, where buyers, most likely fans of the rapper, bought $YACHTY for $15 each.      “I’m still new and learning about the crypto world, but I can tell you I’m partnering up with some very smart people to give my fans some dope experiences,” Lil Yachty said in a statement.      The sale is the latest in a recent string of experiments involving social tokens, a way for artists and other personalities to potentially monetize fan engagement as the events industry reels from COVID-related shutdowns. Yachty’s offering, which was only open to non-U.S. investors, captured mainstream media attention earlier this month.      According to the Fyooz app, the sale brought in $276,006. Owning $YACHTY gives fans exclusive access to the Grammy-nominated artist, including surprise boxes prepared by his mom, Venita McCollum, author of the book “Raising a Rapper.”      Token owners can also receive personal items from the rapper’s career and participate in online parties with him, according to Fyooz.      The $YACHTY sale comes as other social token platforms have toyed with high-profile collaborations. Rally drew chart-topping Christian vocal trio Selah into the fold with a similarly structured fan engagement token earlier this month. Earlier this year, Roll inked a deal with rapper Ja Rule.      Remo Prinz, co-founder of the Zurich-based Fyooz (pronounced “fuse”), said Thursday’s sale was a sign of “growing demand for social money.”      “We are at the forefront of a new type of economic relationship between artists, actors, athletes, gamers and influencers to engage their fans,” Prinz said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TRADING,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/10/rapper-lil-yachty-sells-out-social-token-in-21-minutes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4b05e02e1d0de84676f431d2ee010d765cbe2b2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385307,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo6Sl,1607622838,"Blockchain Bites: Paxos' Banking Play, France's KYC Terreur, FinCEN's Personal Data Honeypot","U.S. lawmakers are asking the nation's financial guardians to clarify custodianship questions. France is looking to eliminate anonymity in the crypto sector. And an exposé into how FinCEN became a honeypot for personal information.    Top shelf    Banking play Paxos is making moves to become a federally regulated bank in the U.S., according to a filing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The stablecoin issuer and crypto services firm is seeking to create the Paxos National Trust, which would operate out of New York and incorporate as one of the first crypto-native banks in the U.S. There are two paths to achieving bank status, the state-chartered route through Wyoming (that Kraken and Avanti used) or the federal route, which is also being pursued by BitPay and Anchorage.      La Terreur? The French Ministry of Finance unveiled sweeping know-your-customer (KYC) requirements Wednesday on all cryptocurrency companies operating in and servicing the country, a move that could ultimately strip the French crypto space of any semblance of anonymity. All virtual asset service providers must immediately begin checking their customers’ identities, verifying “beneficial owners” and prohibit anonymous crypto accounts, according to the press release. The government said the action was taken to prevent terrorist financing, a broadside that has justified the encroachment of centralized powers over many civil liberties.      Data honeypot In an explosive exposé, CoinDesk privacy report Ben Powers outlines how FinCEN, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network meant to track and eliminate criminal activity from the financial system, became a honeypot of personal information. There is little sense of the amount of personal data, what types of data and how long the agency holds on to data or shields it from malicious actors – and the agency wouldn’t answer questions. “You’ve got personal, private information in a database and allegations of conduct,” said Melissa G.R. Goldstein, a former attorney-advisor at FinCEN and now Special Counsel at financial law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel. “Just because someone is named in a SAR doesn’t necessarily mean that they are guilty of something criminal.”      Deposit drag? Bank of America is warning a digital euro with mass appeal could “reduce costs and complexity for individuals” but negatively affect the region’s banking industry. In a Tuesday report, BofA analysts said a digital euro, a central bank digital currency with accounts and reserves held by the supranational European Central Bank, would cut into commercial bank deposits and reduce the need for third parties. Analysts criticized the ECB’s steadfast attention on China’s digital yuan and Diem’s (formerly Libra’s) multinational stablecoin, as a cause for developing a CBDC. “Money, like internet data, has a strong tendency to monopoly,” they wrote.      Dollar vs. BTC Morgan Stanley Investment Management Chief Global Strategist Ruchir Sharma said bitcoin is already cutting into the U.S. dollar. ""Today, most bitcoins are held as an investment, not used to pay bills, but that is changing,"" Sharma wrote in a Financial Times op-ed. He further argued that ""bitcoin will gain"" as its traditional competitors falter – even if the market bubble were to burst.

In the latest legal gambit seeking to determine how crypto can and will square with existing regulation, nine lawmakers are seeking clarification for how crypto firms can become registered broker-dealers.      CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De reports nine U.S. lawmakers of both major political parties have written an open letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton Wednesday and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) seeking clarification. What is crypto custodianship, anyway?      To date, only a few companies in the crypto space have become registered broker-dealers, including Watchdog Capital, Harbor (which was acquired by BitGo) and Prometheum. Though there is reportedly a backlog of applications sitting with FINRA.      “CoinDesk reported in June 2019 FINRA had been sitting on a number of broker-dealer applications from firms that touch crypto, some for over a year. FINRA had taken no actions to approve or disapprove these applications, letting them sit in a sort of limbo,” De wrote.      The most recent letter asks the SEC and FINRA to confirm whether banks can provide custody services for digital securities; asks for a clearer pathway for crypto custodians to register with FINRA; and for FINRA to move on outstanding applications.      Though there are a number of issues that complicate the question. First is the issue of private keys – a special bit of code that confers complete access, control and ownership over a crypto asset – and which party controls them. Second is the ambiguous classification of cryptocurrencies, which depending on intended use, level of decentralization and other considerations could fall along the commodity to security spectrum.      (All securities are commodities, but not all commodities – like gift cards, for instance – are securities.)      This is important, because, as De notes, broker-dealers in the crypto space may also lose Securities Investor Protection Act protections if the crypto assets are deemed not tobe securities, the agencies said.      Three of the lawmakers involved in this bill, plus Rep. Scott Perry, have also sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, “expressing our concern” about rumored self-hosted wallet regulations.      Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted last month that Mnuchin was “planning to rush out” these new regulations, which would apparently require crypto exchanges to verify know-your-customer data for self-hosted wallets before they could send cryptocurrencies off of their platforms and into the wallets.      According to Wednesday’s letter, this potential regulation would “hinder American leadership,” preclude U.S. actors from participating in the space and “undermine the Treasury Department from stopping illicit actors from exploiting the financial system.”    Most influential    Art auction Looking to make someone (or just yourself) happy this yuletide holiday?

In November, bitcoin chart views on TradingView soared 82% from the previous month with similar growth seen in charting of other cryptocurrencies, per user data shared exclusively with CoinDesk.      Bitcoin’s price rallied 42% over the same period.      “BTCUSD has consistently been the most popularly viewed symbol this year,” said David Belle, the company’s U.K. growth director, in an email to CoinDesk, referring to bitcoin and the U.S. dollar. TradingView supports price charting tools across stocks, futures, foreign exchange, cryptocurrency and other markets.      “What we’re seeing is that currently there’s simply a massive amount of interest in bitcoin,” Belle said.      Beyond charting, rapid growth in attention paid to bitcoin is seen in the use of other products and services including record buying volume on the retail-focused product CashApp by Square along with strong demand for new services like PayPal’s cryptocurrency features.      Institutional trading activity is also increasing, as evidenced by CME Group’s bitcoin futures market hitting record-high open interest shortly before bitcoin’s all-time high in November.

42385304,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo6QF,1607619666,Ethereum Far Outpaces Bitcoin in Developer Activity in 2020: Electric Capital Report,"The number of developers in crypto is ticking up again, according to the annual developer report from venture firm Electric Capital.      And one network remains a clear winner in terms of attractiveness to coders. ""More than 300 new developers per month are joining Ethereum,"" Maria Shen, a partner at Electric and the report's author, told CoinDesk. ""Ethereum has continuously grown through Crypto Winter.""      The report tracks ecosystems by blockchain. In other words, a Bitcoin developer is counted toward Bitcoin even if the person is working on its Lightning Network or any of its wallets. Similarly, Ethereum's numbers are driven by developers working on tokens that rely, fundamentally, on Vitalik's world computer.      Of the ecosystem, Electric's report shows Ethereum so far out in front that second place is almost misleading. Almost 2,300 average monthly developers worked on Ethereum across the third quarter of 2020, with Bitcoin in second at a bit under 400.      Still, the good news for the industry is broader: Developer numbers are going up across crypto's stronger projects.      Electric's data is based on ongoing scraping of all the publicly available code documentation (89 million code commits across just under 300,000 repositories on sites such as GitHub and GitLab from January to October). No one can know who is a paid staffer, who is a volunteer and who is trying to earn street cred that will get him or her a spot as a paid staffer. For that reason, the report also takes pains to segment contributors out by their rate of contribution.      All that said, when viewed across the board most people believe looking at developer activity in aggregate can be a good sign of health for any open-source technology project, crypto or otherwise.      ""New monthly crypto developers grew 15% in 2020,"" Shen writes in the report's summary, noting also that the ""Bitcoin ecosystem has 70% more developers than it did three years ago.""      Electric takes pains to track contributions, developers and to remove double counts as much as possible. For more detail on their methods, check out the report.    Also-rans    The report drew a line between the top 200 crypto projects by value and the rest, noting that much of the loss in developer activity occurred in the smaller projects, offsetting much of the gains elsewhere. Electric called this a flight to quality.      Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, Tezos, Cardano and EOS are the largest networks, each averaging more than 100 monthly developers. Of those, only EOS lost developers when the third quarter of 2020 is compared to 2019.      Read more: Crypto Code Commits Remain Near All-Time Highs, Despite Price Declines      While many might think that making a distinction between the top 200 and the rest is still a too-generous threshold, Shen said there are likely some very small networks now that will rise up soon. Longtime denizens of the lower echelons of the top 200 are less likely to ascend but there could be some new arrivals that surprise everyone, and that's why Electric drew the distinction so generously.    DeFi    The most striking area of growth has been in decentralized finance (DeFi), which has been a major topic in 2020.      No one can know for sure why new people are coming in, but Electric's team had some guesses. Shen noted the tooling is better than it has ever been and there's so much proven code to fork and build upon. That makes it easier to get started.      Electric co-founder Curtis Spencer noted that we're now in an era where a developer can deploy a smart contract and very rapidly see an enormous amount of assets move into it. Even if they give control of that application away through a fair launch, as has become popular this year, that can still just be tremendously gratifying to someone who just wants to build.      Shen concurred that the engagement alone can be rewarding. ""Once you launch a protocol, suddenly tens of millions of dollars are wrapped in your protocol,"" she said.      For users of DeFi, though, sometimes this eagerness to see people use projects has come at a cost. Depositor beware.    Getting started    But some of the new activity also, no doubt, comes down to the fact that crypto is a space so well resourced that it's fairly easy, for technical adepts, to get a new company started.      ""We've seen a professionalization of grant funds,"" Spencer added. This means that well-resourced layer one projects are eager to support promising devs with ideas for applications that might entice users. That makes it easier to get a company off the ground.      It should be noted that a grant kicked off Uniswap, now one of the biggest projects out there, in terms of funds entrusted to it.      Read more: Hayden Adams: King of the DeFi Degens      Ken Deeter, another Electric Capital partner, said the growth in DeFi might also be partially attributed to developers from fintech frustrated by what they can't do there.      ""DeFi is a really interesting area ... where there's an ability for developers to really experiment in a way that in the traditional financial system is difficult to do,"" Deeter said.      In last year's report, Electric explained that testnets were always moments that saw strong growth in developer activity, led by developments on the Cosmos network. Shen said that has continued to hold true, noting that NEAR had a strong showing this year.      Though the spikes fall after the incentives run out, she said they still see gains in ongoing participation following these booms.      The prior report also heavily emphasized the total number of commits in 2019 hadn't fallen, though the number of developers had. There's no update on commit volume this time around, however.

42385306,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo6Oz,1607614590,Will the Next M-Pesa Be a Blockchain App?,"“How does your solution touch the base of the pyramid?” asked Nomcebo Sherron Hadebe from the Ministry of Finance in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland).      “I’m talking about those communities where a cell phone is charged only once a while, in a rural community where electrification is still very low. I think our target audience is not just those who have cell phones and use them daily,” she said.      Given 770 million people around the world still live without access to electricity, it was a tough but poignant question from the judging panel at this year’s finals for the AFI Inclusive FinTech Showcase, hosted by the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI).    Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.    The question was directed to Anca Bogdan Rusu of cLabs, the startup that launched the Celo blockchain, an open-source platform making financial tools accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. In response, Anca explained that the solution – a mobile-first application called Toca, allowing people to work on micro tasks, such as training artificial intelligence (AI), and get paid in the stablecoin cUSD – had been adapted and tested on low-end smartphones as cheap as $15.      Smartphone apps like Celo’s are undoubtedly unlocking life-changing, income-earning opportunities for marginalized communities, with the market for AI training micro tasks projected to be worth $24 billion by 2023. I’ve seen the potential for it here in the Philippines, where I’m based, too, with crypto-fueled gaming apps giving jobless Filipinos a way to make up to $400 a month while stuck at home during the COVID-19 lockdown.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler – The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID      But Anca was frank about reaching the poorest of the poor. “This solution isn’t optimized for those conditions,” she said. “Our focus has been on moving from ‘you need a laptop or a computer to be able to access this type of work’ to ‘you only need access to a low-end smartphone.’ It’s very low data, very low electricity needed, but that need is still there.”      So Ms. Hadebe was right to point out Celo’s solution would be out of reach for those at the very bottom of the pyramid, that is, the poorest and largest segment of the global population. The enabling effects of technology are only as good as their accessibility, and as the digital economy takes over, there are serious concerns for those who find themselves stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide. This discrepancy is top of mind for AFI’s members, who represent central banks and regulators from more than 80 emerging and developing countries.      M-Pesa is the darling of this space. The Kenyan mobile money solution has lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, and it is wheeled out at every opportunity as the example of how fintech can deliver a better future. M-Pesa has been adopted far and wide across Africa, partly because it doesn’t need internet and can be used on a feature phone that only gets charged every few days. For people in poor countries, this is a big drawing card over products that require a smartphone, data (another cost barrier for many) and a daily recharge.    We should be spending more time with people like Ms. Hadebe, who can remind us who it isn’t serving yet.    The purpose of AFI’s showcase is to uncover the next M-Pesas of the world. As a judge of the competition, I was required to assess applicants on how well they satisfied one or more of AFI's nine themes for financial inclusion. I also had to consider how they were empowering women, tackling climate change and, in 2020, contributing to the COVID-19 crisis response. I was to look out for showcase hopefuls that were evidently ready to scale and, crucially, those that promised to enhance the regulator-innovator dialogue that AFI was working to establish.      This year, the challenge attracted more than 60 entries, from pre-seed startups to finserv behemoths such as Mastercard. The solutions that made it to the finals were as diverse as they were uniquely targeted, including (but not limited to) a digital ecosystem connecting Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to affordable working capital; an edtech platform partnering with financial institutions and leveraging data analytics to improve financial literacy; and a pension scheme helping workers in the informal sector save for their retirement.      Each one of AFI’s vetted finalists leveraged technologies that required a power source of some sort, and the majority were smartphone enabled, which made me think that Ms. Hadebe’s question may have been a bit unfair within the context of a fintech pitching competition.      Robin Newnham, AFI’s Head of Policy Analysis, reiterated the point about smartphones being less accessible than feature phones. But he was optimistic. “The spread of $15 smartphones is happening at a tremendous pace, to the point where the cost of the handset probably isn’t going to be a significant barrier in the near future,” he said, adding that the improved distribution of solar power across Sub-Saharan Africa would help with cost and reliability of electricity in rural areas.      Even so, perhaps the most impressive takeaway from this experience was Anca’s willingness to welcome Ms. Hadebe’s scrutiny, especially because Celo was the first and only blockchain-based project to make it through to the showcase finals, now in their second year.      In the echo chamber, we blockchain fans rarely have to work as hard to explain our position and purpose. It’s much, much harder to step outside and speak on our wares to those who aren’t on the bandwagon, who probably don’t understand (or care much about) the technology for the sake of itself and have a completely different set of problems and priorities on their plate.      If we truly believe blockchain can solve some of the world’s wickedest problems, we should be spending more time with people like Ms. Hadebe, who can remind us who it isn’t serving yet.

The crypto-friendly regulator took office last year, and has overseen an expansion of regulated crypto products in the derivatives space, including ether futures contracts and bitcoin options products. In a public statement, he noted that ether was declared a commodity under his tenure.      Tarbert has said in various public statements that he sees the potential for much of the financial system to build on top of blockchain platforms, like Ethereum.      ""With the agenda I laid out last year now complete, the Commission can fully turn its focus to the unwritten future,"" he said in Thursday's announcement.      ""A majority of our work has taken place in the midst of COVID-19, a global pandemic that is testing the strength of our markets and our ability to adapt. Amid historic volatility, the CFTC has provided a steady hand and watchful eye while our markets act as shock absorbers.

42385305,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo6RV,1607612580,First Mover: Bitcoin Stuck as ECB's Lagarde Primes Extra €500B Stimulus,"Bitcoin (BTC) was lower while staying mostly within this month's range of roughly $18,200 to $19,700.      ""Upward price action seems to stall, and our analysts believe more inertia is required to push bitcoin beyond the $20,000 psychology barrier,"" Lennard Neo, head of research for the cryptocurrency investment firm Stack Funds, wrote Thursday in a report.      In traditional markets, European shares were lower even after the European Central Bank boosted the size of an emergency bond-buying program to combat the economic toll of a resurgent coronavirus. U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open. Gold rose 0.3% to $1,843 an ounce.    Market moves    It's becoming tougher to get through a rundown of each day's news without finding a story or several about economic stimulus.      U.S. headlines are filled with incremental developments on lawmakers' push to hammer out a new government stimulus package by the end of the year. Only the details change from article to article. Is it $908 billion or $916 billion? Will there or won't there be a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks? A CNBC article on Wednesday mentioned the possibility of $25 billion in rental assistance. Liability protections for businesses? Unresolved.      What's clear is just how dependent the stock market has become on further stimulus for further gains. ""Wall Street falls on stimulus stall,"" read the headline on Reuters' stock-market wrap Wednesday. And because the stock market's performance is in some way connected to hundreds of powerful billionaires' fortunes, millions of Americans' retirement savings and scads of politicians' futures, it seems unlikely that more stimulus wouldn't be forthcoming – not to mention the pressing need to actually provide stimulus to an ailing economy and millions of jobless people.      All this matters to bitcoin traders, or course, because the cryptocurrency has suddenly become in vogue among big investors from traditional finance as a way of hedging against trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus that could theoretically debase the U.S. currency, boosting the value of dollar-denominated assets.      ""As recently as 2017 bitcoin could be viewed largely as a speculative instrument but this is no longer the case,"" Gavin Smith, CEO of the cryptocurrency financial firm Panxora, said in an email. ""The bitcoin of today has become a store of value that is used in times when people fear currency devaluation.""      Even Wall Street's starting to agree, with pronouncements on bitcoin's growing stature emerging Wednesday from the likes of JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.      On Thursday, the stimulus watch shifted to Europe, where monetary policy makers have just announced their latest plans to revive the coronavirus-stricken economy.      The European Central Bank, led by President Christine Lagarde, said Thursday that it would increase the size of the pandemic emergency purchasing program, or PEPP, by €500 billion ($604 billion) to about €1.85 trillion.      ""This is a solid package, both in its own right, not to mention that it delivers what markets expected, which is a key signal as well,"" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon, told clients Thursday in an email.      ""Assuming a smoothed implementation of the PEPP, this would allow the ECB to buy just under €100B per month between now and the end of the program in March 2022,"" Vistesen wrote. ""The reality, however, is that purchases will be flexible and front-loaded.""      Such flexibility recalls Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's pledge as recently as last month to keep pumping fresh money into global markets at the current pace of about $120 billion a month or as needed to ""sustain smooth market functioning.""      ""In short, the printer keeps going brrrrrrrrrrrr in all the wrong places, to the great delight of investors everywhere,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told newsletter subscribers Wednesday.      Investors in bitcoin, whose price is up 160% this year, may be the most delighted. And if Pantheon's right, the stimulus headlines could continue for at least couple more years.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin has steadied over the past couple of days. But based on technical analysis, a sell-off earlier this week to as low as $17,640 during Asian trading hours appears to have resulted from a price-chart pattern known as a descending triangle breakdown.      The pattern, typically defined by a series of lower highs and a zone of support forming a baseline, can be seen on the four-hour chart (above). The chart indicates weakened buying pressure above $18,600 after being rejected from the triangle baseline of support near $18,650 during a price bounce on Wednesday.      The cryptocurrency may move to test this zone of support-turned-resistance in a bid to reestablish bullish dominance. A close above $18,650 would likely invalidate bearish confidence in the short term as it makes bitcoin makes its final moves for what has been a tumultuous year.      Yet, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO at BCB Group, told CoinDesk via Telegram that while strong support exists at $18,000, any further breakouts heading into year's end will likely be ""tempered.""      Current price levels are likely buoyed by large holders continuing to buy bitcoin. ""It is almost certain that companies, banks and other institutions are accumulating BTC in private as well,"" Gunnar Jaerv, COO of First Digital Trust, said in an interview via Telegram.      - Sebastian Sinclair    What's hot    Singapore's DBS Bank says new digital-asset exchange, 10% owned by Singapore's SGX stock exchange, will start trading next week (CoinDesk)      Stablecoin issuer Paxos becomes latest crypto firm to file for federal bank charter, joining fellow applicants BitPay and Anchorage (CoinDesk)      Fidelity Digital to hold bitcoin as collateral for cash loans, in partnership with crypto lender BlockFi, under plan to provide liquidity to hedge funds, cryptocurrency miners and over-the-counter trading desks (Bloomberg)      Nine U.S. lawmakers ask securities regulators to clarify how crypto firms can become registered broker-dealers and provide custody services for crypto assets (CoinDesk)      FTX exchange lists Airbnb pre-IPO derivatives ahead of planned IPO (CoinDesk)      266-year-old German bank issues euro-linked stablecoin on Stellar blockchain network (CoinDesk)      U.S. cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin agrees to list Blockstack's STX token following new network launch (CoinDesk)      Bitwise's crypto-index fund becomes available to U.S. investors (CoinDesk)      MicroStrategy boosts size of bitcoin-focused convertible-notes sale to $550M from originally announced $400M (CoinDesk)      Ukrainian politician discloses owning $24M in privacy coin monero (CoinDesk)      Miners creep back to OKEx exchange after mass defection (CoinDesk)      Mexico City-based crypto exchange Bitso raises $62M in funding round, with participation from existing shareholders Coinbase and Pantera Capital (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    More than 37 million U.S. student-loan borrowers haven't made a payment in months (CNBC)      Euro rally weighs on inflation, sapping appetite for stocks (WSJ)      Gold's volatile run continues in December (WSJ)    Tweet of the day",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/10/first-mover-bitcoin-stuck-as-ecbs-lagarde-primes-extra-500b-stimulus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bba8f7ec36c457b0f0b0695e6f8cf0f1c4972cc-1483x826.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo6Df,1607612502,Curv Partners With MetaMask to Help Institutions Custody DeFi Assets,"Curv is teaming up with MetaMask to allow institutions to be able to invest in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols with institutional-grade custody options.      Curv is a custody startup that specializes in multi-party computation, and the company chose to integrate with MetaMask after building an integration with lending protocol Compound in July of this year. MetaMask is a wholly owned product of Ethereum software company ConsenSys.      “You get all of the enterprise controls, security level and audit trail that you would get from Curv, but with MetaMask in one click you get integration with all of the DeFi protocols,” Curv CEO Itay Malinger said, adding:    “A DeFi protocol can become valuable in a matter of seconds or minutes from when it emerges, so you want to have the ability to access new protocols as soon as possible and not wait for your custody provider to integrate with that specific protocol.”    Curv’s customers are professional traders who want to use protocols to lend, stake and trade; and exchanges and wallet providers who want to offer retail customers integrated access to DeFi protocols, Malinger said.      Creating products for institutional customers to have access to DeFi protocols is a burgeoning market. In September, crypto custody firm Trustology announced it was offering a “DeFi Firewall” that would allow customers to set rules or filters specifying which protocols they think are kosher. In the same month, the Chicago DeFi Alliance launched a Liquidity Launchpad program to get “professional players” into DeFi.      Read more: This Ethereum Startup Is Building a ‘DeFi Firewall’ for Institutional Investors      The program is only open to a limited number of early adopters so that institutions do not overwhelm the new program, but MetaMask aims to release the program widely by the end of next year, said ConsenSys global fintech co-head Patrick Berarducci.      Curv’s MPC technology allows multiple people within an organization can approve financial decisions on DeFi protocols such as lending assets through a smart contract.      “When it comes to DeFi, there are an infinite number of interactions that you can have with a very large number of smart contracts,” Malinger said. “So an institutional investor wants to keep the operational policy that they have for their digital assets, and the flexibility to define those policies.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/10/curv-partners-with-metamask-to-help-institutions-custody-defi-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/376527c9299b7892c019d4aa0e66d579c33d0650-1272x818.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAo667,1607611378,JPMorgan Completes Live Blockchain Repo Trade Ahead of New Product Launch,"Investment bank JPMorgan says it has completed a live intraday repo transaction using a blockchain solution that will soon see a commercial launch.    The repo trade was carried out between JPMorgan’s broker-dealer and banking entity, the bank announced Thursday.  The blockchain application used was developed in-house by the bank's blockchain business arm, Onyx, and is said to support the settlement and maturity of such transactions in hours rather than days.  The trade also used the bank's stablecoin jpm coin for the cash leg. Blockchain was used for both collateral and cash legs.  For context, the repo market allows financial firms such as JPMorgan to trade large quantities of securities and to borrow cheaply – allowing parties with cash to earn a small return.  Repo trades are like a short-term loan, involving a trader selling an asset to another trader at a set price and committing to repurchase the same asset, or part of the asset, at a different price at a future date.  The blockchain app will see production use, being offered to external counterparties in the U.S., according to the announcement.  Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have both been involved in trial trades on the platform and will be involved going forward.  Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, said his institution is ""looking forward to going live in early 2021.""  Brian Ruane, CEO of BNY Mellon Clearance & Collateral Management, said his bank would be a ""critical partner for JPMorgan to provide much-needed collateral services to market participants looking to execute intraday repo transactions.""

42405533,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMrLF,1607610606,"S&P, State Street Back $15M Investment in Crypto Data Startup Lukka","Financial data giant S&P Global and institutional asset manager State Street Corp. are headlining a $15 million investment in Lukka, the blockchain data startup set to power the upcoming cryptocurrency indices from S&P Dow Jones.      CPA.com, the for-profit arm of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), also participated in the Series C, Lukka CEO Robert Materazzi told CoinDesk. It's S&P’s first equity play in the crypto industry and the latest of many blockchain efforts by State Street, which led the round.      The investment adds institutional clout to a crypto startup already careening toward the financial mainstream. Last week, S&P Dow Jones Indices, one of the world’s biggest index providers, launched a partnership with Lukka that will ultimately deliver price points on 550 cryptocurrencies to Wall Street.      Read more: S&P Dow Jones Indices to Launch Crypto Indexes in 2021      Such data could be a boon to desks eager for signals on an asset class many investors still struggle to understand, let alone know how to quote. Even in the cryptocurrency industry, coin traders treat exchange-reported numbers with a skepticism that speaks to a still-maturing industry.      State Street and others are betting on Lukka’s ability to capitalize on this maturation. They are also buying into a business that goes far deeper than price sourcing. Lukka builds data-management software for exchanges and data-standardization tools for businesses spanning the cryptosphere.      But Lukka is perhaps best known in the crypto industry as a tax software developer. In the past year Lukka has raised awareness of crypto tax reporting (and its own products to help calculate them) just as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service turned up the heat on non-filers.      Regardless of the product, Lukka’s focus remains the parsing of complex datasets into things businesses and people can use, said Materazzi.      “It all comes down to organizing and managing this very messy crypto data,” he said. “We are experts in managing incredibly high-volume crypto datasets, across tons of liquidity providers and tons of assets.”      S&P Global declined to comment on the round. State Street and CPA.com did not answer CoinDesk’s questions by press time.    Next steps    The Series C is Lukka’s first equity sale since founder Jake Benson left the company in June.      Founded in 2014, Lukka had raised $25 million in two previous equity rounds, both back when the firm operated as “Libra.” It announced a rebrand to Lukka in late March 2019 with U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records showing a transfer of the trademark to Facebook in April 2019, months before the stablecoin project – now called Diem – was announced in June 2019.      See also: Libra Eyes Institutional Investors with Crypto Tax and Accounting App      Materazzi said Lukka’s successes have largely stemmed from its ability to create institutional-grade software for crypto that financial traditionalists feel comfortable using. Basically, that means Lukka’s platforms follow the methodologies, accounting standards and audit guidelines that any normie platform must use to be taken seriously on the Street.      Such stringency is a no-brainer in traditional finance. But in crypto, where seemingly every attestation notched by this exchange or that tax software firm is a cause for celebration, incremental progress carries weight. It’s a sign of an industry trying to bootstrap its way into big-money finance.      Lukka already provides crypto datasets to over 160 active crypto funds. It also previously forged commercial partnerships with the three investors headlining this round.      Even before last week’s indices tie-up, Lukka signed a separate data deal with IHS Markit, the financial research provider that S&P recently agreed to acquire for $44 billion in stock. With CPA.com, Lukka developed and promoted a crypto gains tax calculator last tax season. And Materazzi said State Street’s equity investment emerged from commercial conversations.      Materazzi said getting the trio on board as investors was a “deliberate strategy” in Lukka’s Series C.      “Hopefully, what this will do is introduce us to more of the traditional financial services industry, because we're pretty well known in the crypto-native one,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/10/sp-state-street-back-15m-investment-in-crypto-data-startup-lukka,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/868855c074440e9a97ec5f35877205f232a6cdf7-1800x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The planned blockchain-powered mesh network of low-earth orbit satellites would ""democratize access to the nascent space sector with lower barriers to entry by individual companies,"" according to the firm.  ""Space exploration projects are tremendous in scale and require close collaboration and partnership, and this milestone unlocks new opportunities for building commercial solutions that leverage space and blockchain applications,"" said Nick Trudgen, chief commercial officer and U.K. director at SpaceChain.

But for now, we will be concentrating on financial assets.” Gupta said.      The third part is custody, which is said to be bank and institutional grade.

Announced Wednesday, the pre-IPO contracts will give traders exposure to Airbnb's performance based on its market capitalization at the close of its first day of trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange.  After that point, the contracts will automatically become fractional stocks contracts with the respective Airbnb stock, said FTX.  Airbnb is expected to list its shares under the ticker symbol “ABNB” later today.  The Wall Street Journal reports the company has priced its shares at $68 per share bringing Airbnb a valuation of about $47 billion based on a fully diluted share count which also includes the proceeds of the offering. The IPO is expected to raise around $3.7 billion.  FTX outlines on its website that If the Airbnb stock does not list and trade publicly by March 9, 2021, FTX reserves the right to roll back trades on its ABNB product.  The brokerage services for the contract are being provided by CM-Equity AG in Germany.  FTX is now known for launching thematic derivative products.

42405530,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMrME,1607592894,Cryptocurrency Founder Charged With Avoiding Tax to Buy Yachts and Homes,"Two U.S. government agencies are taking action against the founder of a cryptocurrency project who allegedly pulled an exit scam and avoided taxes while spending the proceeds on a lavish lifestyle.      According to an indictment filed in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York and unsealed on Wednesday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has charged Amir Bruno Elmaani, aka ""Bruno Brock,"" on two counts of tax evasion.      Elmaani, who created a blockchain protocol called Oyster Pearl, is alleged to have made ""millions of dollars"" from an initial coin offering of its pearl (PRL) cryptocurrency in 2017. Those tokens were purportedly to be used for the purchase of online data storage that fueled the Oyster protocol.      Rather than reporting the income earned from the sales to the IRS, Elmaani allegedly falsified his 2017 tax return and failed to file one in 2018, instead pocketing the millions.      ""As it turns out, Elmaani was funneling the proceeds of his alleged cryptocurrency scheme through a shell company that hid the true nature of his financial interests,"" said William Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director, in a Department of Justice statement.      According to the indictment, Elmaani used $10 million in proceeds to buy multiple yachts (where he stored gold bars), real estate and home renovations, as well as spending $1.6 million at a carbon-fiber composite company.      The maximum penalty of a criminal charge for tax evasion carries a maximum of five years per count, meaning Elmaani could be facing up to 10 years in a federal prison.      Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a separate civil action against Elmaani on Wednesday.      He is charged with conducting an illegal securities offering of PRL tokens and profiting from ""minting millions of unauthorized tokens for himself at no cost and selling them into the secondary market, thereby causing the value of others' tokens to plummet.""    The exit scam    Beginning October 2018, Elmaani – operating under his pseudonym Bruno Brock – exploited a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain to create new tokens to be sold at a below-market price before creating new ones for himself for free.      At the time, Elmaani said he was retaining millions of PRL in accordance with his ""founders share"" and in the process claimed he had to move his PRL tokens to a different wallet in order to avoid double taxation, per the DOJ indictment.      By inflating the fixed supply of PRL through his access to the protocol, it's claimed Elmaani was able to convert his newly minted PRL tokens to other cryptocurrencies using a ""foreign-based exchange."" After discovering the alleged foul play, the exchange ceased all trading for PRL which left investors holding bags of essentially worthless tokens.      The SEC said, ""Elmaani made approximately $570,000 in illicit gains through the minting and sale of Pearl tokens and, as a result of his sales, the price of Pearl tokens fell by nearly 65%, resulting in significant losses for investors.""      See also: Over 13% of Bitcoin Crime Proceeds Laundered Through ‘Privacy Wallets’: Elliptic      Elmaani used a coin mixer – a service designed to conceal the true origin or destination of cryptocurrencies on a given blockchain – before transferring funds to family members and friends, after which he transferred them to his own accounts, according to DOJ.      ""The underlying scheme was old-fashioned fraud and tax evasion,"" said Audrey Strauss, acting Manhattan U.S. attorney. ""Thanks to the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation Division, Elmaani is now in custody and facing federal prosecution.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/10/cryptocurrency-founder-charged-with-avoiding-tax-to-buy-yachts-and-homes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/549e17891b936fd36ad060ccaf85b6338cd629b8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405528,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMrII,1607559622,US Lawmakers Tell Mnuchin to Back Off From Potential Crypto Wallet Regs,"Four U.S. lawmakers want Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to rethink his rumored crypto wallet regulations.      Reps. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.) and Scott Perry (R-Penn.) sent a letter to Mnuchin on Wednesday, ""expressing our concern"" about rumored self-hosted wallet regulations Mnuchin apparently intends to implement in the coming weeks.      Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted last month that Mnuchin was ""planning to rush out"" these new regulations, which would apparently require crypto exchanges to verify know-your-customer (KYC) data for self-hosted wallets before they could send cryptocurrencies off of their platforms and into the wallets.      According to Wednesday's letter, this potential regulation would ""hinder American leadership,"" preclude U.S. actors from participating in the space and ""undermine the Treasury Department from stopping illicit actors from exploiting the financial system.""      Requiring exchanges to maintain this much KYC data could also threaten user privacy, the lawmakers wrote. Rather, the U.S. should have ""regulatory parity"" between the traditional financial system and the crypto ecosystem.      Implementing regulations around self-hosted wallets might have the unintended effect of turning anyone who currently uses one into a criminal, the letter added.      In a statement published online, Davidson said that ""before Treasury issues midnight rules on the regulation of self-hosted wallets, Secretary Mnuchin should come to the Peoples’ House and speak to representatives about what his regulations would do.""      ""Over-regulating self-hosted wallets will crush a nascent industry and leave the United States behind the rest of the world when it comes to harnessing the power of blockchain and cryptocurrency,"" he added.      This is the second letter most of these lawmakers sent Wednesday; earlier in the day, Emmer led a letter sent to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, asking the securities regulator to create some clear guidance on crypto custody and direct the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to approve broker-dealers from the space.      Clayton intends to step down from his role at the end of 2020.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/10/us-lawmakers-tell-mnuchin-to-back-off-from-potential-crypto-wallet-regs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb6e232dfb2585e207c2bfd53bf5ac05ef7bd44c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
