42378236,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Umv5,1438286930,Report: Tokyo Police Seeking Fraud Charges Against Mt Gox CEO,"UPDATE (31st July 20:30 BST): Local news sources are reporting that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police will arrest Mark Karpeles on 1st August in connection with its investigation. A representative for the Tokyo police was not available for comment.      The Tokyo Metropolitan Police is reportedly pursuing criminal charges against Mark Karpeles, CEO of the now-defunct, Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  Domestic news service Nikkei reported on 31st July that, according to an official with the city's police force, Karpeles is being investigated for allegedly using dummy exchange accounts with fictitious bitcoin balances to meet customer orders.  According to a rough translation of the Nikkei report, speculation is now rising that some of the 650,000 BTC reported stolen last year could have been fraudulently accounted for on the exchange. This suggests some users may have never owned bitcoin lost in Mt Gox's collapse.  A report  from April suggested that many of the reportedly stolen bitcoins were gone by mid-May 2013.  Police also suspect that Karpeles may have misappropriated actual bitcoins deposited by users, allegations that could lead to embezzlement charges. Local authorities formally opened their investigation into Mt Gox last year.  The report comes soon after the completion of a bankruptcy claims process that ended on 29th July. The exchange first announced that it would seek bankruptcy protection in February 2014.  A representative from US law firm Baker & Mackenzie, which had previously represented the embattled exchange, told CoinDesk it is no longer representing the company.

42378257,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7UnHj,1438282263,Kaspersky Data Shows Bitcoin Malware Attacks Declining in 2015,"A new report from Kaspersky Lab has found developers continue to target users with malware geared toward illicitly generating or stealing bitcoin, though rates have fallen over the past year.  According to the company's report  on cybersecurity threats, bitcoin mining malware accounted for 9% of financial bugs detected.  Programs designed to steal bitcoins from wallets accounted for 6%.  These figures suggest a possible decline in activity. According to Kaspersky Lab's Q2 report from last year, detection rates for illicit mining programs and wallet stealers accounted for 14% and 8%, respectively. The firm's Q1 data, bitcoin mining and wallet theft malware accounted for 12% and 3% of malware types detected.  What this decline might mean isn't clear.  The company's 2013 assessment found that, at the time, year-over-year malware deployments related to bitcoin rose overall. Therefore, it could be suggested that the prominence of bitcoin malware has some relationship with the market price.  The vast majority of financial malware detected by the firm – 83% – related to banking software. Kaspersky also found that mobile threats are on the rise, suggesting that malware developers are taking advantage of rising investments in mobile platforms by the world's major banks.  An average of 40% of computers worldwide were targeted at least once during the second quarter, according to the report.

42378251,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7UnCh,1438271059,Ethereum Launches Long-Awaited Decentralized App Network,"Eighteen months and roughly $18m after it was first announced, Ethereum has launched.  Arguably the most ambitious 'crypto 2.0' project to date, and the third-largest crowdfunded project of all time, Ethereum is aiming to create a new universe of programmable contracts, powered and secured by its own proof-of-work blockchain.  Grand in scale and flexible by design, it aims to decentralise pretty much anything on the Internet. ""What bitcoin does for payments, Ethereum does for anything that can be programmed,"" the site reads.  This Monday, Stephan Tual, Ethereum's CCO, confirmed in a company blog post that the platform's code had now been 'frozen' for two weeks, with all technical features prepped.  The launch  of the Ethereum mining network and the ability to execute contracts happened earlier today, following eight proof-of-concepts and a barrage of stress tests in the last release, Olympic. The formal launch had been pushed back multiple times.  Though it's publicly available, Frontier – which comes in a ""bare bones"" command line format – is aimed squarely at developers as a live testing environment. Only this time, real funds are at stake.  Speaking to CoinDesk, release co-ordinator Vinay Gupta warned potential users that Frontier will be a complex technical release, not for the faint of heart:  ""Don't put a lot of value at risk unless you really, really are sure you know what you are doing, and you're confident about your risk assessment of the network.""  Non-developers will have to wait for a UI in Ethereum's next release, Homestead, which is expected in two to four months. Serenity, the final version of the platform, may be up to 12 months away.  Timeline of events  Following the creation of the Ethereum genesis block, which contains all transactions from its $18m crowdsale, users are now able to mine and trade the platform's native token, ether (ETH).  Unlike bitcoin, ether is not intended to be used as a global digital currency. Rather, to perform any action on the network, users need to pay an amount of ether. Those who validate transactions on the network, as with bitcoin, will be rewarded in ether for any resources they contribute via mining.  In essence, its a large pay-as-you-go computer, with ether – computational power – the currency that brings these computerised functions to life. The more you need the computer to do, the higher the fee.  In the first tentative days of the platform – known as the 'thawing phase' – the supply of ether will be normal, 5 ETH per block, which are created roughly every 12 seconds. Transactions will not be available in the thawing phase, while the network ramps up.  Technically, anyone with a GPU will be able to act as one of Ethereum's mining nodes as it employs an ASIC-resistant mining algorithm to help prevent a single miner monopolising the network. However, should something go awry, the development team will still have a degree of control over the network, in the form of so-called 'kill switches', or canary contracts that signal to miners there is a problem with the fork they are working on.  True decentralisation comes later, Gupta said:  ""We'd originally thought about running Frontier with a huge range of intervention points in case something spun out technically. But for a variety of reasons we've pulled back to the kill switches only ... Those switches are what make Frontier the 'live test' that it is. Once we're confident it's all solid, we pull them out.""  Once the platform is deemed stable enough by Ethereum’s developers and auditors it will migrate to ‘Homestead’. Previously, all smart contracts would be wiped during this process, but the team say this is no longer the case.  Development milestone  The brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, a 21-year-old college dropout and Peter Thiel fellow, Ethereum first surfaced as a white paper in 2013 and was announced at the Miami's North American Bitcoin Conference the following January.  The glut of 2.0 platforms – such as Factom and Counterparty – often function by running abstratction layers on top of the bitcoin blockchain. However, Ethereum made the decision to create a purpose-built platform for these functions from scratch, building its own programming languages (Serpent and Solidity), comms system (Whisper), peer-to-peer file sharing network (Swarm) and a browser for Ethereum-built apps (Mist).  Whereas bitcoin aimed to take the central processor out of payments, Ethereum is seeking to decentralize all manner of Internet services, making them cheaper, faster and more accessible by moving power away from a central server and placing it into the hands of users.  The platform intends its primary user base to be developers who want to create and distribute peer-to-peer apps.  In the future, Ethereum aims to govern itself using its own system, if it can be mathematically represented it can be modelled, secured and traded.  Much to prove  Given the project's grand scope, it has drawn some criticism from the bitcoin community and beyond.  Some of the more common complaints center on the fact that the bitcoin network has continued to improve and develop since Ethereum was first conceived. For example, the Tim Draper-backed startup Mirror is reportedly working on bringing native smart contracts to the bitcoin blockchain.  Rudimentary versions of Ethereum smart contracts – one of the project's principal selling points – are already available on the bitcoin network today to users of Counterparty, which made a point of porting this functionality from the project to its own testnet in November.  Bitcoin developers like Mike Hearn, for example, have sought to frame the project as overambitious given that bitcoin has a scripting language, that while rudimentary, has yet to be fully explored.  A recent white paper from the National University of Singapore also raised questions about how the Ethereum network incentivizes its users to achieve consensus, finding that honest miners may prove vulnerable to attacks given the Turing-complete nature of its programming.  At issue was the idea that transaction validators on the Ethereum network have arguably more control over operations than in bitcoin, a criticism members of the project addressed.  ""The bottom line is that clients have a ton of liberty about what they store, and if people start to feel real pain about blockchain size, clients will adapt to reduce what they store in a variety of ways,"" Gupta told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The initial clients aren't particularly optimized for storage efficiency because, frankly, £100 buys you two terabytes in Maplin - disk is nearly free today. Over time it will be more of an issue, and I expect we'll sort it out then.""  Cornell professor Emin Gun Sirer told CoinDesk that while he believes smart contracts open up a level of expressivity in payment systems, the project's broader goals of decentralization are perhaps naive.  Sirer said:  ""The killer apps for smart contracts have not been designed yet ... I'm a big proponent of Ethereum and smart contracts, though I believe in this case the hype and the fantasy-borne use cases overstep the capabilities of the platform.""

42378242,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Un2d,1438256867,Bitcoin Exchange Igot Challenges Scam Allegations,"UPDATE (30th July 16:54 BST): This article has been updated with additional comment from igot users.      The founder of Australia-based bitcoin exchange igot has refuted claims his business is a scam.  Igot  recently came under fire, with many of its users complaining about delays to their withdrawals, branding the company “untrustworthy” and claiming they'd been robbed.  Rick Day, igot's founder told CoinDesk the delays particularly affected fiat withdrawals, attributing them to a number of factors.  “They [the issues] are as not as big as they appear from the outside … one of the biggest issues that we have with delays is banking relationships.”  Strained banking relations  Day said the exchange had received a few incoming fraudulent transactions into one of its bank accounts in Australia.  “The person sending the funds basically used stolen bank accounts to fund igot wallets and withdraw bitcoin and [then] disappeared,"" he explained.  This particular igot user, Day added, had a verified account, which raises questions around the company's verification procedure. Day explained:  ""Their account got verified by providing legitimate documents. Problem is, it was not that person's ID. We've seen this many times and enforce video calls for many of our users to prove they are who they say they are. By the time we got to that point with this account, it was too late. The bank had already restricted the account and funds frozen.""  To overcome this issue, Day said, igot will require users making deposits over a certain amount to engage in mandatory video calls in the future.  The founder said progress had been made and he expected account restrictions to be removed by mid-August. “We’re certain that we will be able to resolve all the withdrawal issues in the next one to two weeks. Banks have so far been very cooperative and we’ve assisted them with their investigations.""  In order to prevent these kind of issues from happening again, Day noted his company was looking to procure additional banking partners.  ""We've established a more solid relationship with other banks internationally ... We've opened multiple accounts in multiple countries so we do not depend on any one bank and be in this situation again.""  Although, CoinDesk has not seen evidence of these relationships.  DDoS attacks  In addition to its strained banking relationship, Day claimed igot had also been subjected to a series of “very sophisticated” DDoS attacks in the past weeks.  The attacks, Day said, were not targeting the site itself, but the wallet addresses by sending 'dust' transactions.  This, he said, has been mostly contained. ""We have started rerouting such transactions, removing such addresses and suspending such accounts. We've made some good progress here and are going to resume normal services soon.""  One Reddit user, who goes by the name of fernetbreakfast, voiced his dissatisfaction with the company:  ""Excuse after excuse, now 30 days missing $12,000USD. DDOS excuse for last tw weeks - these guys are about go under. Buyer beware.[sic]""  Others took to Twitter to note the inconvenience caused by the ongoing delays:    @iGotcom Very very worst service I have ever seen my life. Small businessman like me can't afford this type of delay.        — Prafulla Shinde (@microsysimpex) July 24, 2015      Damage control  Day sympathised with users, but calling igot untrustworthy or feeling that they have been robbed was not, he said, a fair assessment.  “Were withdrawals delayed? Absolutely. At the same time, we were able to make many payments.”  The intention of the business was not to rob people, he said. “Our business model works great. We have some really big potential and are not one bit interested in robbing users.”  One user, who is owed $400, told CoinDesk: ""I am not sure it is a scam, however, what is ridiculous is the support shown to every customer who is as nervous as I am about the status of my money.""  Previous issues  The recent events aren't the first to cause people to criticise igot's services. In May this year, users also complained of delayed withdrawals. At the time, igot assured its customers the issues were due to a ""major upgrade"" to its system.  Nevertheless, Day said people should not ""write off"" his company, stating that it has been running for 18 months and has many satisfied customers.  “We provided great customer service to our customers and will continue to do so,” he concluded.  In the meantime, many igot customers are still awaiting access to their funds. A user who is owed over $15,000 told CoinDesk:  ""Rick ... constantly promises payment 'shortly', but never delivers. I have learnt the painful lesson of never trusting him with my money. He uses convenient but difficult to verify excuses such as bank issues, upgrades and external attacks.""
