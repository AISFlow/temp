42405461,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMYt0,1606082456,Crypto Long & Short: 4 Metrics That Show How the Current Bitcoin Rally Is Different From 2017,"Crypto markets have historically been led by retail investors, with professional investors following. Is that changing? After all, high-tech innovation in the past 15 years has executed an opposite about-face, flipping an enterprise-led pattern into a consumer-led pattern.      Retail's lead was evident in the fourth quarter of 2017, as media hype soared alongside the price. There's no doubt the retail hype is quieter this time around. CNBC had nearly 100 ""bitcoin"" headlines in the first half of Q4 2017. These past six weeks, as bitcoin ran to a new all-time high in market value, it has put up less than 40. Where the hell are Davy Day Trader and the ""Robinhood effect"" investors? Did their stimulus checks run out?      It's premature to diagnose a secular trend in crypto investing, mostly because the retail/institutional dichotomy is problematically simplistic. Below, I'll run through four dimensions of the market that show how the participants in this run-up are behaving differently than investors did in 2017:    Bitcoin whales and trading vs. holding  Bitcoin vs. ether and everything else  Regulated vs. off-shore futures markets  N. America vs. E. Asia investors  1. Bitcoin whales and trading vs. holding    The number of addresses holding at least one bitcoin increased at an unrelenting pace from the end of 2013 to the 2018 crash. It picked up again in 2019, then leveled off again this spring. This is different from the end of 2017, when it soared to a peak with the bitcoin price.      Compare that to the number of what we could call bitcoin ""billionaires,"" addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC. These whales were selling into the run-up in 2017. This time, the Bitcoin blockchain's Forbes List is growing, not shrinking.      Address balances must be taken with a grain of salt; addresses ≠ entities. Behavior is a better signal. If there be whales, where are they swimming to? Wherever they winter, they are bringing their bitcoin bags along. The orange coin is accumulating more in wallets that historically buy and hold, and less in wallets that have shown a tendency to trade.      Twice since 2017 a slowing in holder accumulation has been a leading indicator for the market top. In 2020, it shows no sign of slowing, yet.    2. Bitcoin vs. ether and everything else    The 2017 bull market is remembered as a phenomenon driven by enthusiasm for initial coin offerings (ICOs) on Ethereum. However, by the time the frenzy reached its fever pitch, ether (ETH) had largely completed its run. At the midpoint of 2017 Q4, bitcoin returns were 23.9%; ether returns were 6.9%. It was bitcoin's Q4 catch-up run that fed the bulls.      Contrast that to 2020 and the similarities and differences are telling. Again, ether led the run-up, but this time it's keeping pace with bitcoin, returning 23.2% so far on the fourth quarter to bitcoin's 28.4% even before it crossed $500 early Friday. If 2017's pattern repeats, the bitcoin bulls may have a longer range to run.      So, are crypto markets consolidating? The answer is, yes and no. Bitcoin dominance, the orange coin's share of cumulative market cap, is in the high 50s. Usually, that means a shorter list of assets that compose the bulk of the market. Not this year.      Top-five assets in the CoinDesk 20 are growing with bitcoin, but the long tail is now more fragmented than it has been since the aftermath of the 2017 bubble. (This tally includes stablecoins and other pegged assets.)    3. Regulated vs. off-shore futures markets    The ""institutions are here"" chorus can sing about the growth of the CME Bitcoin Futures market, signaling increasing demand for regulated exposure to bitcoin via established operations channels. Open interest on the CME hit $1 billion this week, an all-time high.      However, much of that growth is attributable to bitcoin's price run. And in aggregate, lightly regulated derivatives contracts, traded by individuals, prop desks and liquidity providers, dwarf the CME. It would be unwise to base an institutional flippening thesis on growth in the CME alone. Better to say institutional participation is growing with the rest of the market.    4. N. America vs. E. Asia investors    Parallel to the growth of CME futures is the flow of bitcoin onto North American exchanges, and off of East Asian exchanges.      To the extent exchange flows represent the activity of participants, East Asian investors have been selling bitcoin into this bull market at rates never before seen. Meanwhile, North American interest in bitcoin is greater than it was in 2017.      One important caveat: The flows here may represent the preferences of traders more than the long-term activity of investors. The stablecoin tether (USDT) is on pace to grow its market cap by more than $10 billion this quarter. Some of the flows in East Asia likely represent tether's march toward quote currency dominance, as traders increasingly favor it over bitcoin in crypto-to-crypto markets.    Conclusion    The takeaway: This bull run is indeed different from 2017, though that doesn't mean we won't see another peak-and-trough cycle. Signals that hint at the kinds of investors who are participating indicate we may be earlier in the cycle than we were when bitcoin hit its all-time high three years ago. Bitcoin's history is full of narratives about upcoming shifts or regulatory change s that would change the market fundamentally. Those narratives have been overblown in the past, and they’re probably overblown now. The same is true of narratives that foretell the dollar's demise.      Are traditional financial markets burning down their own frat house? Maybe, but that doesn't suddenly transform bitcoin into a safe haven or a hedge. The current patterns of new, larger and longer-term investors' growing involvement is likely to continue, but bitcoin and downmarket cryptos will be risk-on investments for the foreseeable future, and investors should continue to treat them as such.    Bitcoin is already breaking records    While we haven’t achieved the elusive $20,000 spot price all-time high yet, other metrics show where bitcoin has grown far beyond previous peaks.      Last week, investor Nic Carter published a piece called “Nine Bitcoin Charts Already at All-Time Highs” showing just how far bitcoin had come and how fundamentally bullish this quiet run-up was.      In this piece, NLW goes over those metrics that have achieved all-time highs, and adds one more that happened after Nic published his piece. The metrics include:    Addresses with a balance of $10 or more  Open interest on CME bitcoin futures  Realized capitalization  Bitcoin options open interest  Bitcoin priced in Turkish lira  Bitcoin held by Grayscale  Stablecoin free float  Silvergate’s settlement network  Growth of crypto-native credit  Market Capitalization  Anyone know what's going on yet?    One of the things that makes bitcoin such a successful investment is its lack of infrastructure. Like most retail investors, I tend to take profits too early. Like many bitcoin investors, I keep my coins in cold storage, which means it takes time and effort to get them ready to trade. We bitcoin investors are akin to the apocryphal Fidelity clients, who died and, in death, stopped mucking around with their portfolios, thereby becoming more successful than other Fidelity customers.      That said, bitcoin's returns this month have put the orange coin into a stratospheric percentage of my family's portfolio. Anyone else out there getting white knuckles, yet?      (Note: Nothing in this newsletter is investment advice. The author owns some bitcoin and ether.)    CHAIN LINKS    Rick Rieder, CIO of fixed income at BlackRock, is thinking about crypto assets. In case you've been living under a rock, Rieder made comments on CNBC Friday morning that indicate the world's largest asset manager is taking crypto seriously: ""Do I think it's a durable mechanism that ... could take the place of gold to a large extent? Yeah, I do, because it's so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,"" Rieder said. TAKEAWAY: If BlackRock walks the walk Rieder is talking, we all better put on our running shoes to keep up.      IBM has secured a patent covering blockchain-based transactions in massively multiplayer online video games like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone. TAKEAWAY: Blockchain startups in the game industry have touted similar technology as a way to secure player ownership of virtual goods and their portability between games, but it's unclear whether existing incentives in game development and publishing would support moving to such a structure. It's doubly unclear how permissioned blockchains like the kind IBM has championed would improve upon a simple database in these cases.      One potentially overlooked factor in the current bitcoin run-up: Beijing's crackdown on over-the-counter crypto trading desks, where miners convert new-minted bitcoin into cash. We broke it down in a new CoinDesk partnership with Axios, this week (check it out), after reporting the news on Monday. TAKEAWAY: The 2020 bitcoin halving reduced the impact of new supply on the market. With more investors holding, demand factors may be more of a driver in this run-up. This is more a medium-term supply issue to monitor, as it may shape the makeup of bitcoin mining.      Brian Brooks, a former Coinbase general counsel, has gotten a White House nod to serve a five-year term to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the primary U.S. bank regulator. Brooks, who has been serving as Acting Comptroller, has already overseen a public letter allowing nationally regulated banks to offer crypto custody and to handle accounts for stablecoin issuers. TAKEAWAY: Most of the air in crypto goes to securities- and commodities-markets regulators. For the non-regulated currencies that top the CoinDesk 20 list of crypto assets, bank regulation may be more significant as an enabler of infrastructure that professional investors need, in order to participate.      Offshore crypto exchange operator Binance has sued Forbes and two of its journalists alleging defamation over a story on the so-called ""Tai Chi"" documents, reportedly leaked from inside Binance, detailing a strategy for regulatory misdirection in the U.S. TAKEAWAY: CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao has been coy about his company's corporate structure, refusing to say where Binance's jurisdictional headquarters lie. It's a sign of crypto infrastructure's immaturity when one of the largest exchange operators won't tell you what law it operates under.      Goldman Sachs expects the digital yuan, China's planned national virtual currency, to reach 1.6 trillion rmb ($229 billion) in issuance and 19 trillion rmb ($2.7 trillion) in annual total payment value within 10 years. TAKEAWAY: If you think PayPal's move to embrace bitcoin is exciting as an on-ramp to crypto, you should be frenzied over the opportunity presented by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Their aptitude as a gateway drug depends heavily on structure and regulation, but the potential is there.      In Japan, 30 firms have announced a collaborative effort to issue a private digital yen and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of Japan's largest banks, has announced plans to launch a blockchain payment network in 2021. TAKEAWAY: This looks quite different from China's digital yuan (see above), but both are examples of ways in which digital currencies can reach mainstream banking and its customers. East Asian economies are ahead of the U.S. and Europe in this. If you think U.S. and EU adoption of this kind of technology seems far-fetched, please reflect that you probably said the same thing about text messaging in 2005.

42405457,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMYp4,1606074164,NFT Painting of Buterin in Harlequin Garb Sets Record in Weekend Crypto Art Sale,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, dressed like a medieval harlequin leaning against a velvet chair, stares past the viewer into the distance – that is, until he’s rocketed into the sky while ether’s price flashes on the screen. Ethereum is rallying, the image suggests.      A programmable version of the scene just described made records this weekend when a non-fungible representation sold for 260 ETH, or approximately $141,536.20. That’s the most paid, in dollar terms, for a work of crypto art to date, according to one of the painting’s co-creators, Trevor Jones.      Not your average NFT. A collaboration between crypto artists Jones and Alotta Money, the digital painting ""EthBoy,"" a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Ethereum co-founder Buterin, uses new programmable technology called “layering” to remake itself daily.    An innovation enabled by the blockchain-based art market and platform Async Art, which EthBoy was released on, allows digital artworks to reflect external data and stimuli. EthBoy will change every day, “in response to external variables out of ours or anyone else's control,” Jones’ website reads.  “[A]s the months and years progress EthBoy on Async will become an artistic, visual representation of Ethereum relating to factors including price fluctuations, gas fees, an accessory layer connected to one of Vitalik's wallet address and even annual changes triggered by Vitalik’s birthday and the initial release of the Ethereum system,” the site continues.  The painting is the first such programmable art project released on Async, which launched in February and has since seen over $600,000 in artist sales.  The artwork is a 1/1, an industry term for a digital artwork that has only one official version. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, derive their value from cryptographically derived scarcity. The same underpinning that ensure each bitcoin is one of a kind and cannot be double spent can be applied to any digital object rendered as an NFT.    More than ownership. Twitter user Maxstealth is now the owner of the unique painting, following a day-long auction. The sale can be observed here. But it’s more than a collector’s item, as the painting’s unique characteristics continue to yield revenue for its owner and creators.    Twice a year, for the next five years, mini-animations based on the painting will be auctioned off as separate NFTs on the crypto marketplace OpenSea.  Each animation will consist of approximately 182 days of changes taking place between July 30, the anniversary of the Ethereum system release and Vitalik's birthday, Jan. 31.  The profit on the sale of each work will be divided three ways between the two artists and the owner of the EthBoy NFT, with a “small amount” of the profit used to fund the further programmable development of the original, if necessary.

42405510,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMYgD,1606067985,Bitcoin Shortage? Pantera Thinks Market Rally Driven by PayPal Buys,"PayPal’s (PYPL) recent leap into the crypto market is helping to drive the current bitcoin rally, according to Pantera Capital, a prominent cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm.      In an investor letter published Nov. 20, the venture firm compared the ongoing bull market to the last time BTC rose above $18,000, three years ago.      “Previously the friction to buy bitcoin was pretty onerous,” the letter notes, contrasting that difficulty with how e-commerce giant PayPal has now made it easy for millions of users to become potential bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin buyers.      Indeed, all eligible PayPal account holders in the U.S. can now buy, hold and sell those cryptocurrencies – sooner than the payments firm anticipated, due to steep customer interest. Additionally, the firm recently upped its weekly crypto purchase limits to $20,000 from an initial $10,000.      “BOOM! The results are already apparent,” Dan Morehead, chief executive and founder of Pantera, wrote in the November letter. “When PayPal went live, volume started exploding.”      Pantera claims that PayPal is already buying almost 70% of the new supply of bitcoins. Together with Square’s Cash App routine bitcoin buying, more than 100% of all newly minted bitcoins is accounted for, Pantera alleges.      See also: Bitcoin’s Rally Could Be Caused by a Supply Crunch in China      The Bitcoin network issues new BTC on a fixed and predetermined schedule. Only 6.25 new BTCs are mined every 10 minutes, following this year’s “halving,” an amount that will continue to decrease every four years until all 21 million BTC enter circulation.      Pantera’s thesis centers around a supply-side understanding of the bitcoin market. The idea is that as the supply of BTC decreases, due to lower mining rewards, the demand naturally increases, leading to an appreciation in price.      “When other, larger financial institutions follow [PayPal’s] lead, the supply scarcity will become even more imbalanced. The only way supply and demand equilibrates is at a higher price,” Pantera wrote.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/22/bitcoin-shortage-pantera-thinks-market-rally-driven-by-paypal-buys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd35f24448ebb4b01e19553b7e8ef520d39bc8c7-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We are actively looking into this matter and will provide further updates,” the Pickle Finance team announced on their official Twitter account.  The price of Pickle's native token (PICKLE) fell 50.12% to $10.17 on the news, according to Messari data. It has since rebounded to around $12.60.    Pickle came on the scene Sept. 11 as one of many food-themed DeFi projects. The fully automated system rewards users with interest payments and token disbursements in PICKLE, ether and stablecoin pairings for providing liquidity to several stablecoin pools.    The project attempted to bring price stability to the four top stablecoins, DAI, USDC, USDT and sUSD, which are frequently knocked off their dollar peg.  Pickle’s pJars, similar to yearn.finance’s vaults, found and executed arbitrage opportunities between stablecoin deposits on several protocols, nominally to push these stablecoins towards their peg, but also to reward Pickle users.    On Friday, the team introduced the cDAI jar, a “new strategy” aimed at maximizing returns from DAI deposited on the decentralized lending protocol Compound. The Pickle team, and a group of ""white hat hackers"" have traced the 19,759,355 DAI weekend exploit to this smart contract, according to a blog post.    ""This was a very complicated attack and involved many components of the Pickle protocol. As of right now, it does not seem that any other funds are at risk,"" they said. ""While we work on the fix to remove the attack vector, the white hat group has decided that we should not publish any details of the actual attack yet.""  A fix was estimated by Sunday at 15:00 UTC.    “We’re encouraging all LPs to withdraw their funds from the Jars until the issues have been resolved,” the Pickle team tweeted.",NEGATIVE,DAI | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TRADING | DAI | USDC,"Daniel Kuhn, Kevin Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/22/defi-protocol-pickle-finance-token-loses-almost-half-its-value-after-197m-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/489a0aa02a574cf361db73c287484a7ae1e64283-1606x1026.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Due to ongoing judicial proceedings for some tokens, daily withdrawal limits will be put in place for a few tokens, the exchange said. Those limits will be removed after the judicial process has been completed, KuCoin said. In the meantime, those tokens with daily limits will have zero trading fees, the exchange said.  You can view a continually updated list to determine which cryptocurrencies have restricted functionality.    KuCoin’s $281 million security breach is among the largest in cryptocurrency history. One or more hackers obtained the private keys to the centralized exchange’s hot wallets, gaining control over vast quantities of bitcoin, ether, tron, XRP, stellar and various ERC-20 tokens, among others. KuCoin immediately moved to freeze all wallets and disable services.    At the time, exchange CEO Johnny Lyu said any stolen customer funds would be “covered completely” by an insurance fund.  KuCoin is one of the most active cryptocurrency exchanges, with daily average volumes of over $100 million, according to the cryptocurrency data site CoinGecko.

It wasn't immediately clear if any of the attacks resulted in a loss of funds.  The attacks are similar to the July assault on Twitter in which that firm's employees were tricked using social engineering to giving access to the company's administrative tools, thus allowing the hackers to control about 130 high-profile accounts.  Liquid CEO Mike Kayamori confirmed the latest breach in a blog post. “This gave the actor the ability to change DNS records and in turn, take control of a number of internal email accounts. In due course, the malicious actor was able to partially compromise our infrastructure, and gain access to document storage,” the CEO said.  NiceHash also confirmed it had been subject to a similar attack, but that no emails, passwords or personal data were compromised.  The incursions may have also affected cryptocurrency platforms Bibox.com, Celsius.network and Wirex.app, according to the report, which said none of those companies responded to comment.  GoDaddy acknowledged to KrebsOnSecurity that “a small number” of domain names had been modified after a “limited” number of the firms employees fell for a social engineering scam. The company declined to say how its employees were tricked.
