42399330,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiw75,1474488766,Brothers Face Jail Time for Stealing Power to Mine Bitcoins,"Two brothers in the Netherlands face months in prison after allegedly siphoning power to fuel a small bitcoin mining operation, Dutch authorities say.  The case dates back to 2014, when the brothers, whose names were not disclosed, are said to have been caught stealing electricity from a local utility provider in order to power bitcoin mining devices at a location in Rotterdam. Prosecutors said this week that, in total, the brothers mined roughly €200k ($223,000) worth of bitcoin prior to being caught.  According to the Openbaar Ministeriehttps://www.om.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/@96001/15-maanden-geeist/, the public prosecutorial service in the Netherlands, the brothers have both been charged with money laundering. One brother, who owned the property in which the devices were kept, has also been charged with stealing power to grow marijuana plants at the same location.  Local reports  suggest that the younger brother, aged 39, faces up to fifteen months in prison if convicted. The older brother, aged 42, could be sentenced to as many as five months in prison.  Fines as high as €250,000 may also be levied if the two are convicted.  A decision is expected in the next two weeks, local news source De Gelderlander reported.

42399354,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwCz,1474468402,Blockchain Smart Contracts Need a New Kind of Due Diligence,"More than 20 years ago, Nick Szabo proposed the use of a 'smart contract' to reduce fraud and enforcement costs associated with traditional paper contracts. His smart contract would be implemented as a “computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract” – in other words, a computer program.  Like any other software, a 'smart contract' computer program would receive inputs, run a series of program steps, and supply outputs. For example, the smart contract could wait for a predetermined condition to occur (eg: a stock reaches a particular price), automatically deem the terms of the contract met, and trigger a predetermined series of performance steps (eg: a payment) that would be automatically carried out. Well ahead of its time, the idea did not catch on.  Fast forward now to 2016. Blockchains abound, and there is renewed interest in smart contracts, particularly with decentralized contract execution: smart contracts on the blockchain.  The bitcoin blockchain has been running since 2009 but, despite various efforts, does not appear to lend itself to convenient implementation of smart contracts. By contrast, the original ethereum blockchain, announced in 2014 and launched in 2015, was specifically designed to allow the implementation of smart contracts.  Problems in paradise  Since the launch, smart contracts began to proliferate in the ethereum ecosystem. However, the future immutability of ethereum smart contracts is uncertain after the widely publicized ethereum “hard fork”. The existing ether effectively became “E[i]ther” – ether classic (ETC) and *new* ether (ETH) – leaving market forces to determine whether either, or both, will survive.  The ethereum system, like bitcoin, associates ownership of currency (ether) with an address. Unlike bitcoin however, ethereum also provides an address for executable contract code that runs on the blockchain. When the contract address receives a suitable message from a user or another contract, the code is executed. Ethereum smart contracts are stored on the blockchain and executed on “ethereum virtual machines” (EVMs) by self-selected computer nodes, commonly known as “miners"". Those nodes perform the processing needed to execute the corresponding program steps. For a fee, of course.  The processing fee for each ethereum smart contract is proportional to its complexity and use of computing resources. By charging a proportional fee, resource-intensive misuse of the ethereum system is discouraged.  But overuse of ethereum resources is not the only type of misuse possible. A recent paper noted that among the roughly 19,000 ethereum smart contracts studied, 44% contained vulnerabilities. As smart contract code was copied over and over again, and flawed drafting techniques were repeated, error-filled code propagated. Old, flawed code apparently became the unsteady foundation for towering new smart contracts.  As we are all painfully aware, software bugs and system vulnerabilities are nothing new. The most popular operating systems and application software are “updated” frequently. And more bugs are found all the time. The typical software license agreement includes years of “free” updates.  How to correct an immutable system?  As a software consumer, your “due diligence” is fairly straightforward because an error correction process is built into the software license. When (and not if) something goes wrong, you have some hope that someone is trying to solve the problem.  But smart contracts are not ordinary software. A smart contract is supposed to automatically implement a real-life contract: an actual agreement between two (or more) parties. After the negotiating parties agree to the terms of a deal, those terms are converted into a smart contract – eg: given to a computer programmer to create smart contract code. So how do the parties know if the terms agreed upon were correctly programmed?  Moreover, if a smart contract is stored on an immutable blockchain then, by definition, its stored program code does not change. The certainty that results from such permanence becomes a valuable feature. But that certainty also means that immutable smart contracts lack traditional error correction capabilities. The program code implementing the smart contract cannot readily be debugged after being stored on an immutable blockchain. Any errors or vulnerabilities are set in 'blockchain stone'.  A smart contract needs to be error-free, error-tolerant or, in at least some way, correctable. Relying on “form” contracts is no guarantee of safety – especially not for smart contracts. Old, buggy software certainly can be exploited and has been to great effect. Look at The DAO hack. A reported $50m-plus of ether was diverted due to a smart contract vulnerability.  There needs to be a new kind of due diligence for this new kind of contract. Smart contracts blend law and computer science. The due diligence on smart contracts should do the same.  Due diligence in the blockchain age  What due diligence is needed for a smart contract?  A traditional analysis of the proposed transaction and the negotiated contract terms should identify practical and legal issues. A source code analysis should identify flaws in programming the smart contract before it is compiled.  In addition, the proposed smart contract should be run on a simulator to see how it operates in response to expected and unexpected messages from users and other contracts. Both the legal issues and the programming issues can then be addressed together. Expected and unexpected contingencies can be identified, evaluated, and mitigated.  To the dismay of some, using smart contracts on a blockchain won’t eliminate the need for lawyers. More likely it will just change what the lawyers need to do.  We predict this new type of due diligence will bring together specialized transactional lawyers who can review the terms of a specific deal, software experts who can analyze smart contract program code and its operation on the blockchain, and 'smart contract' lawyers who can bridge the gap between the two.  Obviously, the due diligence team should be engaged well before a smart contract is added to the blockchain – even before the underlying deal is negotiated – to help avoid foreseeable mistakes. By conducting this new type of due diligence with the proper team, smart contracting parties can have much more confidence in achieving their intended results.  More rigorous smart contract due diligence may finally bring some peace of mind.

42399324,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiw57,1474459246,Winklevoss Bitcoin Exchange Gemini to Launch Daily Auctions,"Gemini Trading, the bitcoin and ethereum exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is set to begin hosting daily bitcoin auctions.  While such auctions are commonplace as a way to determine more accurate closing prices for the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, Gemini is positioning the auction as more than a first for its exchange.  Tyler Winklevoss told CoinDesk:  ""It's the first ever end-of-day auction on a bitcoin exchange. It's a pretty standard feature on traditional exchanges that didn't exist on a bitcoin exchange until now.""  The launch represents the latest effort by the Winklevoss brothers to create investment mechanisms for mainstream investors.  Since 2014, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust has been working to open the first bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) on a major stock exchange. In June, after almost three years, the Trust filed to move their application from Nasdaq to Bats, a move that accelerated progress even if the final decision could still be months away.  How it works  Beginning at 5pm ET, Gemini will begin accepting two-sided bids in BTC/USD for the next day’s auction, ending at 4pm. Gemini expects to add additional trading pairs at a later date.  By concentrating liquidity at a single moment each day, Winklevoss says the auction will increase liquidity while minimizing “slippage” thats results from large investors who affect the price with their purchases.  After 22 hours and 50 minutes of bidding, Gemini will begin publishing “indicative auction prices” every minute, giving bidders a chance to pull out their bids until 3:59pm ET, after which the final bid closes.  The closing auction price is determined by finding the price, at which the greatest aggregate buy demand and sell demand can be fulfilled.  In addition to giving investors an official closing price to report to their banks and accounts, the auction is intended to make it easier for buyers and sellers to find each other, according to Benjamin Small, head of Gemini’s market structure.  ""A benefit for institutional traders is that an auction attracts counterparties during a particular time,” Small told CoinDesk. “By focusing on a specific moment of time, the opportunities to interact are increased significantly.""  Pricing bitcoin  The auction set-up builds on the Winkdex, a bitcoin index that draws its data from the top three bitcoin exchanges by trade volume.  In interview, Small pointed to the index as a complimentary tool for bitcoin investors, whereas the auction helps serve to provide insight into how investors are buying and selling bitcoin during specific periods.  Small concluded:  ""The Winkdex and other indexes are based on trades that have occurred, a blended rate of history. The auction price is based on the orders at a set time. It optimizes the amount of trading.""

42399328,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiw48,1474457935,Asset Managers Expect to Be Using Blockchain in Five Years,"A new survey has found that nearly two-thirds (64%) of asset managers expect to using blockchain technology within the next five years.  Conducted by consultancy Roubini ThoughtLab, the findings are part of a report entitled ""Wealth and Asset Management 2021"", a broad research offering that aimed to study how investment providers are embracing new technologies.  When asked about technology-enabled investment tools, 39% indicated that they expect blockchain will form a part of next-generation digital wealth management platforms, though it was not the fastest-growing technology among those surveyed.  Over the next five years, respondents expected artificial intelligence and virtual reality use to grow the fastest followed by web analytics and sentiment analysis.  Notably, 45% of respondents are targeting blockchain in the short-term, indicating that they expect the technology to become a bigger part of their business by 2021.  Bank of Montreal, Broadridge, CFA Institute, Cisco, eToro, Schroders, SEI and State Street also contributed to the report.

42399338,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwEx,1474436951,Thomson Reuters Demos New Ethereum Blockchain Use Cases,"Microsoft wasn't the only financial firm to voice its interest in ethereum today.  At the software project’s annual developer conference, Devcon2, Thomson Reuters research scientist Dr Tim Nugent revealed a number of early-stage projects that the media giant is building on the decentralized application development platform.  At the day's final morning session, Nugent spoke broadly about the company’s projects (including its work with the R3CEV banking consortium and the Hyperledger blockchain project), while offering new details about how it sees the technology fitting into its existing product lines.  However, Nugent explained that while Thomson Reuters is working on private consortium efforts, most of its internal demos have been built so far with ethereum.  Nugent told the audience:  ""We spend most of our time working with ethereum demos and building proofs-of-concept with ethereum.""  The presentation was the latest indication that the New York company is interested in applications of blockchain technology, following public statements earlier this year.  Nugent also highlighted Thomson Reuters work to promote its blockchain efforts through hackathons held in partnership with the Ethereum Foundation, indicating these events help it better test its solutions with the open-source community.  Thomson Reuters, he said, remains committed to continuing its work on such programs, and that it will hold its next ethereum developer conference in January.  Customer identity  Nugent said that while Thomson Reuters is primarily known as a news service, it has four other verticals it believes blockchain would better apply to, including its financial and risk; legal; tax and accounting; and intellectual property and science offerings.  ""Many of our products and services are proprietary databases and solutions, and there is a question of entitlement, [of] who should have access to these databases,"" Nugent said.  One use case Nugent said is particularly suited to blockchain is licensing agreements, and he gave an overview for what he called ""BlockOne ID"" an ethereum-based distributed application that could provide identity services.  ""This is already an area where we have compliance products and we want to make these available on-chain,"" he continued.  Eventually, Nugent said such a service could be integrated into its KYC offerings, including its compliance records checking software.  Data delivery  Given its role in providing trusted data delivery, Nugent said he sees Reuters also playing a role in the creation of oracles, or blockchain-based tools that could be queried by smart contracts.  The idea that has also caught the attention of Microsoft, forming a key part of its early morning keynote.  ""You might deploy a smart financial instrument, and you would make a request that would talk to our oracle,"" he said, indicating that it could, as an example, call the price of a financial asset tracked by its data tools.  For such applications, Nugent said that Reuters is examining other innovations in the blockchain industry, including those related to privacy, which he said would be integral for his company to deploy applications on a public blockchain.  Though interested in such developments, Nugent stressed that all the demonstrations remain in early stages.  He concluded:  ""That's all very much under test.""

42399343,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwIt,1474417830,Microsoft's Bletchley Blockchain Project Enters Next Phase,"Microsoft unveiled a new version of its consortium blockchain software offering at ethereum's annual developer conference in Shanghai today.  Released as part of the update is its first ""Quickstart Template"", a tool designed to make it easier for Project Bletchley users to spin up a consortium using a private version of the ethereum blockchain. The template, Microsoft representative said, is likely to be the first of many that automate the process using different blockchain projects.  But while the latest advancements to Bletchley may not sound like an overhaul, Microsoft Azure's blockchain program manager said the update offers a glimpse of what will come as the project adds additional members.  Gray told CoinDesk:  ""It's like a three-week process boiled down to eight questions.""  Gray explained that users are taken through a step-by-step process whereby they select the members of the consortium, determine the number of nodes each bank will have on the network and then geographically distribute those nodes using the Azure cloud to boost resilience.  The released co-incided with the launch of a new white paper that delves deeper into Microsoft’s ""cryptlets"" offering, a form of oracle that uses an outside data source to inform a smart contract.  Gray said that by using cryptlets, financial institutions could, for example, inform a smart contract’s execution with the current LIBOR rate. However, Gray added that he sees cryptlets as providing more functionality, allowing users that don’t want to share sensitive business information a way to store it off of a blockchain.  ""If you have Blackrock going into a smart contract agreement with Citi, they don't want to put their IP on the blockchain. It has access to Azure, the cryptlets itself will sign transaction, and you’ll have verification that the data is authenticated,"" he continued.  Middleware roadmap  In interview, Gray explained that the releases form the beginning of what he called a ""middleware roadmap"" that aims to explain how cryptlets work and what they can be used to create.  Should all go according to plan, Gray said he envisions the templates and cryptlets as a way to engage the open-source blockchain community.  At next year's Devcon, he said he hopes developers will attend to discuss specialty cryptlets libraries.  ""That is coming, we’re building that today,"" he added.  Enterprise institutions, he foresees, would then be able to subscribe to cryptlets data services that would provide data services that would charge money in exchange for a subscription to a certain number of calls.  ""You get trusted data in a dependable way because it runs in the fabric, you get resilience, we have guarantees about uptime,"" he continued.  Ethereum infrastructure  Gray indicated that the project is the latest sign that Microsoft remains interesting in developing ethereum as an ""infrastructure layer"" for enterprise blockchain services.  While Gray acknowledged the project has to do more to prove experimental elements like proof-of-stake payment verification and sharding, he said Microsoft intends to support this effort.  Overall, Gray said he sees the public ethereum blockchain as a key component of its vision, as evidenced by its plan to enable a collaborative environment on Azure. He noted that access to quality developers remains an issue for enterprise industries, and that by fueling efforts with resources from ethereum's developer pool, more progress could be made.  ""We want to contribute to help them achieve that, but we’re providing higher level services,"" he explained.  He added that Microsoft will also require the participation and interest of ethereum's community as well should it want efforts like Bletchley to succeed, concluding:  ""We need them to work with the community to improve public ethereum performance, to nudge them into enterprise.""
